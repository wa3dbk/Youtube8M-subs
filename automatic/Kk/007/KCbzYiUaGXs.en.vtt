00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
through the campaign on solo insane

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.839 
through the campaign on solo insane
arcade<00:00:07.230> with<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.649> hardest<00:00:08.099> mutators<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.730> you

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
arcade with the hardest mutators on you

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.030 
arcade with the hardest mutators on you
know<00:00:08.910> like<00:00:09.300> try<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.540> give<00:00:10.110> myself<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.590> challenge

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
know like try to give myself a challenge

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.530 
know like try to give myself a challenge
since<00:00:11.639> I'm<00:00:11.790> going<00:00:11.940> through<00:00:12.179> with<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.389> I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
since I'm going through with it I

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.959 
since I'm going through with it I
figured<00:00:13.200> why<00:00:13.500> not<00:00:13.530> record<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.309> post<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.670> so

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
figured why not record and post it so

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.400 
figured why not record and post it so
that's<00:00:15.599> more<00:00:15.809> or<00:00:15.839> less<00:00:15.960> what<00:00:16.080> I'm<00:00:16.199> gonna<00:00:16.289> be

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
that's more or less what I'm gonna be

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.840 
that's more or less what I'm gonna be
doing<00:00:16.440> for<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> while<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:16.980> mean<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:17.279> try<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.640> post

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
doing for a while I mean up try to post

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.849 
doing for a while I mean up try to post
one<00:00:17.970> chapter<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> day<00:00:18.630> where<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.500> more<00:00:19.710> or

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
one chapter a day where it's more or

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:20.900 
one chapter a day where it's more or
less<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:20.039> me<00:00:20.400> playing<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.760> campaign

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
less just me playing the campaign

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.310 
less just me playing the campaign
there's<00:00:21.270> thirty<00:00:21.480> three<00:00:21.720> chapters<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
there's thirty three chapters in the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.609 
there's thirty three chapters in the
campaign<00:00:23.269> it<00:00:24.269> comes<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.570> two<00:00:24.779> caches<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
campaign it comes with two caches of the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.890 
campaign it comes with two caches of the
first<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.240> three<00:00:27.480> hardest

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
first is that I have the three hardest

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.150 
first is that I have the three hardest
mutators<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.470> them<00:00:28.619> won't<00:00:28.740> make<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> game

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
mutators on them won't make the game

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.659 
mutators on them won't make the game
impossible<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.170> if<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:32.579> I

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
impossible and if I have to like if I

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.250 
impossible and if I have to like if I
die<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.420> restart<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.840> chapter

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
die I have to restart the chapter

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.290 
die I have to restart the chapter
completely<00:00:34.770> I've<00:00:35.670> always<00:00:35.880> felt<00:00:36.059> like<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
completely I've always felt like the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.880 
completely I've always felt like the
gears<00:00:36.540> campaigns<00:00:36.930> were<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> little<00:00:37.260> too<00:00:37.710> easy

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
gears campaigns were a little too easy

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.580 
gears campaigns were a little too easy
on<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.460> even<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.850> insane<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:40.170> kind<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.440> like

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
on like even on insane you kind of like

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.990 
on like even on insane you kind of like
learn<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.950> level<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:41.460> you're<00:00:41.640> good<00:00:41.969> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
learn the level and then you're good to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.580 
learn the level and then you're good to
go<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.600> beat<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.440> probably

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
go you can beat it like I can probably

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.860 
go you can beat it like I can probably
beat<00:00:43.890> gears<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.370> dying<00:00:44.700> once<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.239> twice<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
beat gears one dying once or twice if I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.560 
beat gears one dying once or twice if I
really<00:00:46.110> wanted<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:48.210> really<00:00:48.480> I've

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
really wanted to so I like really I've

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.850 
really wanted to so I like really I've
always<00:00:48.719> wanted<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.320> something<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.680> this

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
always wanted to do something like this

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.110 
always wanted to do something like this
but<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.250> no<00:00:50.370> way<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.520> actually<00:00:50.730> make

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
but there was no way to actually make

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.840 
but there was no way to actually make
the<00:00:51.270> game<00:00:51.449> harder<00:00:52.280> since<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the game harder since this is just the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.580 
the game harder since this is just the
prologue<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.570> impossible<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.140> dial<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
prologue and it's impossible to dial and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.810 
prologue and it's impossible to dial and
I<00:00:55.620> figured<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:55.980> would<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> good<00:00:56.430> chance<00:00:56.610> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
I figured this would be a good chance to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.760 
I figured this would be a good chance to
just<00:00:56.969> introduce<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:57.600> doing<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
just introduce what I'm doing the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.779 
just introduce what I'm doing the
mutaters<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.430> change<00:00:59.670> from

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
mutaters are going to change from

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.160 
mutaters are going to change from
chapter<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.239> chapter<00:01:00.359> I'm<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
chapter to chapter I'm not just going to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.510 
chapter to chapter I'm not just going to
pick<00:01:01.350> three<00:01:01.590> mutators<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.250> run<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.460> them

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
pick three mutators and run with them

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.340 
pick three mutators and run with them
like<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.210> example<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.660> chapter<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.170> all

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
like for example a chapter that's all

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
like for example a chapter that's all
lambent<00:01:04.799> enemies<00:01:05.070> would<00:01:05.250> use<00:01:05.460> friendly<00:01:05.909> fire

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
lambent enemies would use friendly fire

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.969 
lambent enemies would use friendly fire
instead<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.659> enemy<00:01:06.930> regeneration<00:01:07.650> since

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
instead of enemy regeneration since

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.640 
instead of enemy regeneration since
landman<00:01:08.970> enemies<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:09.840> regenerate<00:01:10.140> even

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
landman enemies don't regenerate even

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.969 
landman enemies don't regenerate even
when<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.479> for<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> most<00:01:12.750> part<00:01:12.869> no<00:01:13.680> ammo

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
when it's on for the most part no ammo

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.499 
when it's on for the most part no ammo
pickups<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.520> most<00:01:14.729> active<00:01:15.030> reload<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.390> going

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
pickups and most active reload are going

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.030 
pickups and most active reload are going
to<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.320> don't<00:01:16.799> think<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.009> are

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
to be on but if I don't think there are

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.640 
to be on but if I don't think there are
any<00:01:17.189> chapters<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.060> would<00:01:18.810> make<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.590> know

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
any chapters that would make it you know

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.020 
any chapters that would make it you know
that<00:01:19.830> they're<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> affect<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.880> if

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that they're not going to affect but if

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.460 
that they're not going to affect but if
there<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.479> i'm<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:21.990> use<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.320> those

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
there is i'm not going to use on those

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.230 
there is i'm not going to use on those
levels<00:01:22.860> I'll<00:01:23.310> find<00:01:23.640> something<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> change

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
levels I'll find something to change

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.270 
levels I'll find something to change
them<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.229> won't<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.770> I'll

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
them out for or I just won't have I'll

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
who looks at the mutaters and wonders

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.609 
who looks at the mutaters and wonders
why<00:01:32.909> i'm<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.090> using<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> vampire<00:01:33.900> mutator<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
why i'm not using the vampire mutator it

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.960 
why i'm not using the vampire mutator it
doesn't<00:01:35.189> actually<00:01:35.310> make<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> game<00:01:35.820> any

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
doesn't actually make the game any

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.550 
doesn't actually make the game any
harder<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.570> i<00:01:36.659> was<00:01:36.990> messing<00:01:37.290> around<00:01:37.320> with

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
harder like i was messing around with

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.770 
harder like i was messing around with
beating<00:01:38.100> chapters<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.509> makes

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
beating chapters with it and it makes

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.590 
beating chapters with it and it makes
the<00:01:39.900> game<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> lot<00:01:40.229> easier<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:41.329> guess<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.450> doesn't

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the game a lot easier I guess it doesn't

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.850 
the game a lot easier I guess it doesn't
necessarily<00:01:42.750> make<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.170> easier<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> just

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
necessarily make it easier it just

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.850 
necessarily make it easier it just

less<00:01:53.640> invincible<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:55.320> was<00:01:56.159> also<00:01:56.310> thinking

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
less invincible I was also thinking

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.130 
less invincible I was also thinking
about<00:01:56.640> using<00:01:56.850> big<00:01:57.119> explosions<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.930> some

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
about using big explosions on some

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.690 
about using big explosions on some
chapters<00:01:58.380> since<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.890> makes<00:01:59.040> lamb<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.520> more

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
chapters since it makes lamb bit more

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.330 
chapters since it makes lamb bit more
deadly<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.869> playing<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.799> also<00:02:02.130> turns

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
deadly but playing with it also turns

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.219 
deadly but playing with it also turns

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
frags and boom shots in like auto win

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.249 
frags and boom shots in like auto win
nukes<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> decided<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> keep<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.060> off<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.450> on

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
nukes so I decided to keep it off and on

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.779 
nukes so I decided to keep it off and on
some<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.770> levels<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.129> makes<00:02:08.369> goong<00:02:08.610> kurz

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
some of the levels that makes goong kurz

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.029 
some of the levels that makes goong kurz
impossible<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> beat

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
impossible to beat

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.920

not trying to make this impossible i'm
just<00:02:17.000> trying<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.209> make<00:02:17.329> it<00:02:17.420> as<00:02:17.510> difficult<00:02:17.540> as<00:02:18.019> i

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
just trying to make it as difficult as i

so<00:02:22.689> but<00:02:23.689> every<00:02:23.930> chapter<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.260> going<00:02:24.439> to<00:02:24.500> get<00:02:24.560> its

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
so but every chapter is going to get its

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
second part which is the first chapter

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.530 
second part which is the first chapter
