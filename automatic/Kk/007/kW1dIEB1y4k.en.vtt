of mine for a long time they said we've
never<00:00:15.420> seen<00:00:15.839> hatred<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.470> know<00:00:16.710> they<00:00:16.830> used<00:00:16.859> to

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
be friends it argue and then they go out

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.080 
be friends it argue and then they go out
to<00:00:19.410> dinner<00:00:19.560> together<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.369> Republican<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
to dinner together the Republican and

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.470 
to dinner together the Republican and
the<00:00:21.180> Democrat<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.140> they'd<00:00:22.560> get<00:00:22.710> things<00:00:23.039> done

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
the Democrat and they'd get things done

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.330 
the Democrat and they'd get things done
now<00:00:24.480> we're<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> stalemate<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.920> think<00:00:26.250> it

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
now we're like in a stalemate I think it

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.429 
now we're like in a stalemate I think it
would<00:00:26.460> be<00:00:26.490> great<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.240> somebody<00:00:27.810> got<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.170> there

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
would be great if somebody got in there

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.439 
would be great if somebody got in there
that<00:00:28.859> actually<00:00:29.039> could<00:00:29.550> get<00:00:29.820> along<00:00:30.060> with<00:00:30.269> both

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
that actually could get along with both

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.749 
that actually could get along with both
sides<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.439> know<00:00:31.500> many<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> people<00:00:32.640> that

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
sides and I know many of the people that

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.090 
sides and I know many of the people that
are<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> Democratic<00:00:33.719> side<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.920> some

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
are on the Democratic side and in some

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.410 
are on the Democratic side and in some
cases<00:00:35.340> they're<00:00:35.640> friends<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.030> mine<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.239> get

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
cases they're friends of mine I get

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.900 
cases they're friends of mine I get
along<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.630> them<00:00:36.840> great<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:38.340> think<00:00:38.460> it's

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
along with them great and I think it's

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.840 
along with them great and I think it's
time<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.600> people<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.200> sit<00:00:40.590> down<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.640> together

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
time for people to sit down get together

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.540 
time for people to sit down get together
and<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.840> mess<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:44.129> we're<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.520> right

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and get this mess that we're in right

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.510 
and get this mess that we're in right
now<00:00:44.789> sup<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> view<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.680> an<00:00:46.950> asset<00:00:47.309> not<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
now sup so I view that as an asset not a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.139 
now sup so I view that as an asset not a
liability<00:00:47.700> yes<00:00:48.120> ma'am<00:00:48.360> CNN<00:00:49.289> did<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.559> poll

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
liability yes ma'am CNN did a poll

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.920 
liability yes ma'am CNN did a poll
recently<00:00:51.199> where<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.879> Obama<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.539> are

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
recently where I Obama and I are

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.650 
recently where I Obama and I are
statistically<00:00:55.890> tied<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.699> you'd<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.600> could

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
statistically tied if you'd like I could

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.360 
statistically tied if you'd like I could
send<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.559> call<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.920> CNN<00:00:59.399> I<00:01:01.370> think

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
send it to you just call up CNN I think

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.910 
send it to you just call up CNN I think
I'd<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.579> nobama<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.329> i<00:01:03.750> look<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.290> economy

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I'd be nobama if i look at this economy

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
I'd be nobama if i look at this economy
and<00:01:05.100> how<00:01:05.159> bad<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.610> doing<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.090> i<00:01:06.510> look<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and how bad it's doing if i look at this

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.060 
and how bad it's doing if i look at this
economy<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.400> doing<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.119> poorly<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.070> i

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
economy it's it's doing so poorly and i

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.380 
economy it's it's doing so poorly and i
think<00:01:11.280> ultimately<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.299> be

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
think ultimately it's going to be

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.600 
think ultimately it's going to be
largely<00:01:12.810> about<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:14.010> look<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.460> he's

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
largely about that you look at what he's

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.429 
largely about that you look at what he's
doing<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.030> Libya<00:01:15.210> which<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> total<00:01:16.290> disaster

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
doing in Libya which is a total disaster

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.200 
doing in Libya which is a total disaster
nobody<00:01:17.009> even<00:01:17.189> knows<00:01:17.400> what's<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.090> in

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
nobody even knows what's going on in

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.179 
nobody even knows what's going on in
Libya<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:19.020> look<00:01:19.229> at<00:01:19.380> what's<00:01:19.590> happening<00:01:20.040> with

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
Libya you look at what's happening with

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.210 
Libya you look at what's happening with
gasoline<00:01:20.640> prices<00:01:21.090> where<00:01:21.840> he<00:01:22.560> said<00:01:22.830> he<00:01:22.979> has<00:01:23.189> no

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
gasoline prices where he said he has no

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.880 
gasoline prices where he said he has no
control<00:01:23.670> over<00:01:23.759> prices<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.930> he<00:01:25.049> does<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.710> he

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
control over prices which he does if he

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.819 
control over prices which he does if he
gets<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> phone<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.939> gets<00:01:27.060> off<00:01:27.330> his

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
gets on the phone or it gets off his

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
gets on the phone or it gets off his
basketball<00:01:28.829> court<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.460> whatever<00:01:30.119> he's<00:01:30.509> doing

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
basketball court or whatever he's doing

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.260 
basketball court or whatever he's doing
at<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> time<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.650> mean<00:01:31.950> he<00:01:32.340> should<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.729> focused

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
at the time I mean he should be focused

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.480 
at the time I mean he should be focused
on<00:01:33.420> OPEC<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.110> getting<00:01:34.590> those<00:01:34.740> prices<00:01:35.070> down

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
on OPEC and getting those prices down

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.910 
on OPEC and getting those prices down
that's<00:01:36.329> what<00:01:36.540> he<00:01:36.600> should<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.900> focused<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.619> yes

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
that's what he should be focused on yes

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.109 
that's what he should be focused on yes
well<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> would<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.250> handled<00:01:41.460> Libya<00:01:41.850> much

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
well I would have handled Libya much

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.490 
well I would have handled Libya much
differently<00:01:42.570> first<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> don't<00:01:43.409> know

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
differently first of all I don't know

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.350 
differently first of all I don't know
who<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> rebels<00:01:44.130> are<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.610> I've<00:01:44.759> said<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.180> many

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
who the rebels are and I've said it many

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.760 
who the rebels are and I've said it many
times<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:47.310> rebels<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:49.079> controlled
