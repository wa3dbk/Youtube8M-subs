you want to be falling into this place

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.920 
you want to be falling into this place
right<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.130> that's<00:02:02.549> actually<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> hole<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.600> you

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
right here that's actually a hole as you

just<00:02:07.110> walk<00:02:07.380> backwards<00:02:07.890> slowly<00:02:08.039> until<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
just walk backwards slowly until you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.150 
just walk backwards slowly until you
fall<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.590> late<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.280> pole

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
fall on that late on that pole

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.730 
fall on that late on that pole
then<00:02:12.340> walk<00:02:12.640> again<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.320> there<00:02:14.320> you'll<00:02:14.560> know

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
then walk again and there you'll know

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.250 
then walk again and there you'll know
this<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.370> basically<00:02:16.000> where<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.270> challenge

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
this is basically where the challenge

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.250 
this is basically where the challenge
starts<00:02:18.090> there<00:02:19.090> are<00:02:19.180> no<00:02:19.300> enemies<00:02:19.510> here<00:02:19.720> so

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
starts there are no enemies here so

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.590 
starts there are no enemies here so
don't<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.800> worry<00:02:20.950> about<00:02:21.070> anything<00:02:21.600> so

don't have to worry about anything so

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.110 
don't have to worry about anything so
swim<00:02:23.080> your<00:02:23.290> way<00:02:23.320> those<00:02:23.800> tunnels<00:02:24.070> with<00:02:24.940> all

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
swim your way those tunnels with all

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.050 
swim your way those tunnels with all
those<00:02:25.270> friendly<00:02:25.800> barracudas<00:02:26.850> should<00:02:27.850> be

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
those friendly barracudas should be

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.100 
those friendly barracudas should be
harmful<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.870> it's<00:02:29.740> not<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.100> much<00:02:30.130> thing

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
going to start our jumping puzzles so

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.060 
going to start our jumping puzzles so
I'm<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.960> first<00:02:38.320> show<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.560> how<00:02:38.890> you're

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
show you how what shortcut you can take

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.760 
show you how what shortcut you can take
to<00:02:43.630> make<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:43.780> easier<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:46.320> this<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.440> where<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
to make this easier so this is where the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.610 
to make this easier so this is where the
part<00:02:47.980> where<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.400> reach<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:51.550> tunnels<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.870> if

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
part where you reach the tunnels so if

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.230 
part where you reach the tunnels so if
you<00:02:53.800> look<00:02:53.980> carefully<00:02:54.190> you're<00:02:54.760> going<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.030> start

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
you look carefully you're going to start

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.270 
you look carefully you're going to start
seeing<00:02:55.330> there<00:02:56.050> there<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.590> plank<00:02:56.920> right

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
seeing there there is the plank right

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.080 
seeing there there is the plank right
here<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.890> there<00:03:00.040> is<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.310> pole<00:03:00.580> here

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
here and then there is this pole here

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.520 
here and then there is this pole here
and<00:03:01.300> this<00:03:01.450> year<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.050> this<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.440> you're

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
and this year and this and you're

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.140 
and this year and this and you're
basically<00:03:02.770> supposed<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.280> start<00:03:03.640> your<00:03:03.790> jumping

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
basically supposed to start your jumping

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
puzzle from this point here now in this

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.240 
puzzle from this point here now in this
room<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.720> can't<00:03:08.050> climb<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:08.830> bowl<00:03:09.070> you

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
room you can't climb to this bowl you

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.800 
room you can't climb to this bowl you

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
advance just a little bit over to

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.160 
advance just a little bit over to
digital<00:03:17.020> here<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:17.950> you're<00:03:18.700> going<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:19.050> want<00:03:20.050> to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
digital here and you're going to want to

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.800 
digital here and you're going to want to
find<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.950> way<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.310> climb<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:22.180> your<00:03:22.330> left<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:27.810> now

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
find a way to climb to your left so now

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.530 
find a way to climb to your left so now
it's<00:03:29.500> not<00:03:29.740> it<00:03:30.130> by<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.400> way<00:03:30.610> so<00:03:31.240> instead<00:03:31.480> of

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
it's not it by the way so instead of

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.240 
it's not it by the way so instead of
continuing<00:03:32.140> here<00:03:32.440> this<00:03:32.860> is<00:03:32.980> where<00:03:33.070> you<00:03:33.160> have

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
continuing here this is where you have

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.010 
continuing here this is where you have
to<00:03:33.340> go<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.550> climb<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:34.060> your<00:03:34.150> left<00:03:34.330> here<00:03:34.600> I'm

to go to climb to your left here I'm
standing<00:03:35.590> roughly<00:03:35.800> in<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.340> point<00:03:36.700> in<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:38.310> in

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
standing roughly in this point in the in

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.570 
standing roughly in this point in the in
the<00:03:39.580> cave<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:41.350> have<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.860> make<00:03:42.130> your<00:03:42.280> way<00:03:42.430> up

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
the cave so you have to make your way up

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.000 
the cave so you have to make your way up
here<00:03:42.910> that's<00:03:43.180> not<00:03:43.300> too<00:03:43.989> hard<00:03:44.020> of<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.620> jumping

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
here that's not too hard of a jumping

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.979 
here that's not too hard of a jumping
puzzle<00:03:45.430> just<00:03:45.790> have<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.360> make<00:03:46.540> your<00:03:46.690> way<00:03:46.840> of

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
puzzle just have to make your way of

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.720 
puzzle just have to make your way of
those<00:03:47.170> stones<00:03:47.470> because<00:03:47.800> climbing<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.580> the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
those stones because climbing on the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.520 
those stones because climbing on the
slope<00:03:48.970> itself<00:03:49.450> is<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.780> little<00:03:50.050> bit<00:03:50.140> impossible

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
slope itself is a little bit impossible

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.229 
slope itself is a little bit impossible
so<00:03:53.530> once<00:03:53.800> you're<00:03:54.040> up<00:03:54.190> here<00:03:56.910> you'll<00:03:57.910> want<00:03:58.180> to

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
so once you're up here you'll want to

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.080 
so once you're up here you'll want to
fall<00:03:58.540> down<00:03:58.620> back<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.830> that<00:03:59.980> hole<00:04:00.250> there<00:04:00.580> where

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
fall down back to that hole there where

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.699 
fall down back to that hole there where
it<00:04:01.300> leads<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.080> start<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.680> the

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
it leads you to the start of the

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.680 
it leads you to the start of the
platforming<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:05.820> do<00:04:06.820> it<00:04:06.910> carefully<00:04:07.150> because

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
platforming and do it carefully because

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.300 
platforming and do it carefully because
you<00:04:07.930> don't<00:04:08.110> want<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.380> do<00:04:08.500> this<00:04:08.680> step<00:04:08.950> over

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
you don't want to do this step over

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.800 
you don't want to do this step over
again<00:04:09.640> so<00:04:10.120> fall<00:04:10.989> down<00:04:11.170> here<00:04:11.620> first<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.250> then

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
again so fall down here first and then

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.170 
again so fall down here first and then
fall<00:04:13.810> down<00:04:14.050> to<00:04:14.320> this<00:04:14.500> ledge<00:04:14.800> right<00:04:15.040> here<00:04:15.489> so

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
fall down to this ledge right here so

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.520 
fall down to this ledge right here so
I'm<00:04:16.239> going<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.450> make<00:04:16.660> this<00:04:16.840> jump<00:04:17.140> actually

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
I'm going to make this jump actually

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.150 
I'm going to make this jump actually
from<00:04:17.770> this<00:04:18.040> side<00:04:18.510> all<00:04:19.510> right<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:19.959> I<00:04:20.470> didn't

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
from this side all right and I didn't

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.190 
from this side all right and I didn't
fall<00:04:21.370> through

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
fall through

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.710 
fall through
and<00:04:22.320> make<00:04:23.250> your<00:04:23.430> jump<00:04:23.700> here<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.090> here<00:04:24.600> you're

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
and make your jump here and here you're

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.560 
and make your jump here and here you're
going<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.900> start<00:04:25.170> scaling<00:04:26.270> towards<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.420> end

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
going to start scaling towards the end

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.330 
going to start scaling towards the end
of<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.870> jumping<00:04:28.200> puzzle<00:04:28.560> now<00:04:28.650> this<00:04:28.920> part<00:04:29.190> is

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
of the jumping puzzle now this part is

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.730 
of the jumping puzzle now this part is
actually<00:04:29.490> knowing<00:04:29.940> they're<00:04:30.150> quite<00:04:30.990> few

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
actually knowing they're quite few

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.740 
actually knowing they're quite few
difficult<00:04:32.250> jumps<00:04:32.970> for<00:04:33.270> instance<00:04:33.570> this<00:04:33.690> one

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
difficult jumps for instance this one

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.940 
difficult jumps for instance this one
and<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:35.550> next<00:04:35.700> one<00:04:35.880> as<00:04:36.150> well<00:04:36.590> but<00:04:37.590> as<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.800> can

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
and the next one as well but as you can

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.470 
and the next one as well but as you can
see<00:04:38.160> it's<00:04:38.280> doable<00:04:38.610> just<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.150> little<00:04:39.270> bit

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
see it's doable just a little bit

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.690 
see it's doable just a little bit
annoying<00:04:42.800> alright<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:43.980> now<00:04:44.070> here<00:04:44.460> I'm<00:04:44.550> going

to fall on purpose because i want to
share<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.380> shortcut<00:04:46.830> so<00:04:47.150> around<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:48.510> point

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
share the shortcut so around this point

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.750 
share the shortcut so around this point
in<00:04:49.200> the<00:04:49.320> cave<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.830> know<00:04:50.130> it's<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.310> bit<00:04:50.490> hard<00:04:50.700> to

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
in the cave I know it's a bit hard to

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.570 
in the cave I know it's a bit hard to
see<00:04:51.030> because<00:04:51.150> all<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.750> entrails<00:04:52.230> but<00:04:52.680> around

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
see because all the entrails but around

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.520 
see because all the entrails but around
this<00:04:53.790> point<00:04:54.030> in<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.210> cave<00:04:54.450> you're<00:04:55.350> going<00:04:55.470> to

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
this point in the cave you're going to

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.020 
this point in the cave you're going to
reach<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.770> point<00:04:55.980> where<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.340> this<00:04:56.460> small<00:04:56.790> ledge

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
reach a point where is this small ledge

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.840 
reach a point where is this small ledge
right<00:04:57.300> here<00:04:57.690> so<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.560> can<00:04:58.980> take<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.490> shortcut

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
right here so you can take the shortcut

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.060 
right here so you can take the shortcut
from<00:05:00.180> here<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:00.720> jump<00:05:00.960> over<00:05:01.200> there<00:05:01.410> done<00:05:01.650> that's

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
from here to jump over there done that's

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.160 
from here to jump over there done that's
a<00:05:02.370> little<00:05:02.850> bit<00:05:02.940> hard<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.390> I<00:05:03.450> might<00:05:03.690> not<00:05:04.020> make

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
a little bit hard and I might not make

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.710 
a little bit hard and I might not make
it<00:05:04.230> on<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.500> first<00:05:04.680> try<00:05:05.210> but<00:05:06.210> if<00:05:06.420> you<00:05:06.570> have<00:05:06.690> a

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
it on the first try but if you have a

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.920 
it on the first try but if you have a
speed<00:05:07.170> buff<00:05:07.980> with<00:05:08.430> you<00:05:08.670> a<00:05:08.880> sweetness<00:05:09.750> buff

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
speed buff with you a sweetness buff

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.260 
speed buff with you a sweetness buff
it's<00:05:10.290> actually<00:05:10.700> lot<00:05:11.700> easier<00:05:13.310> so<00:05:14.310> let's<00:05:15.150> give

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
it's actually lot easier so let's give

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.870 
it's actually lot easier so let's give
couple<00:05:15.630> tries<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:18.710> there<00:05:19.710> you<00:05:19.800> go<00:05:19.830> as<00:05:20.610> you<00:05:20.760> can

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
couple tries and there you go as you can

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.120 
couple tries and there you go as you can
see<00:05:21.060> you<00:05:21.210> have<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.480> multiple<00:05:22.320> cut<00:05:22.590> jump

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
see you have to multiple cut jump

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.060 
see you have to multiple cut jump
multiple<00:05:23.490> times<00:05:23.730> while<00:05:23.940> midair<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:25.070> like

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
multiple times while midair and like

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.760 
multiple times while midair and like
right<00:05:26.430> you're<00:05:26.610> when<00:05:26.880> you're<00:05:27.000> on<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.180> slope

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
right you're when you're on the slope

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.040 
right you're when you're on the slope
keep<00:05:28.770> jumping<00:05:29.030> keep<00:05:30.030> it<00:05:30.180> in<00:05:30.330> your<00:05:30.360> space<00:05:30.690> bar

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
keep jumping keep it in your space bar

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.260 
keep jumping keep it in your space bar
to<00:05:31.170> keep<00:05:31.380> jumping<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:31.950> it<00:05:32.070> should<00:05:32.400> do<00:05:32.580> it<00:05:32.610> all
