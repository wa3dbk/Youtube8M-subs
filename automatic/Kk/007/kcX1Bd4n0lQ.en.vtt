00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.739
 It's going to be quite this funny because 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:43.410
 If I'm funny, I think I really am 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.050
 very happy I am very stylized I am a 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.100
 normal person who is dedicated to sing and 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.540
 that subject is a job 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.800
 extraordinary although charges more 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:57.180
 extraordinary this but cooper for the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.820
 people will see what I am and how I 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.530
 I try on twitter or the stage or in the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.010
 same interviews some already know 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.960
 others is not what they see is what there is 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.770
 and they will be able to see more of that no more than 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.110
 what of what they see in the Greek scene 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.450
 Well, if you feel it is like that, it is not 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.810
 this character created does not get us to the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.810
 door 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.000

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.480
 grab say yes yes I want to do it 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.280

 We look for days we also set aside days 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.920
 so that I had to have free days 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.780
