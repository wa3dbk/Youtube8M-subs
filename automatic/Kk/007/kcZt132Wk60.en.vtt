this<00:00:15.630> box<00:00:15.900> here<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.230> where<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.440> can<00:00:16.470> place

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
this box here is where you can place

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.470 
this box here is where you can place
items<00:00:16.920> you'd<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.490> magma<00:00:17.820> crucible<00:00:18.300> to

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
items you'd like the magma crucible to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.990 
items you'd like the magma crucible to
process<00:00:18.869> now<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.039> does<00:00:20.220> require<00:00:20.520> redstone

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
process now it does require redstone

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.920 
process now it does require redstone
flux<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.420> operate

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930

so<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> recommend<00:00:22.470> bringing<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.920> redstone

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
so I recommend bringing the redstone

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.189 
so I recommend bringing the redstone
flux<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.820> via<00:00:24.060> thermal<00:00:24.300> expansion<00:00:24.900> energy

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199

will show you how much redstone flux is

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
will show you how much redstone flux is
being<00:00:35.940> stored<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.510> has<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> maximum<00:00:37.530> capacity

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.139 
of 400,000 this box over here will give
you<00:00:40.829> some<00:00:40.980> basic<00:00:41.309> information<00:00:41.370> about<00:00:41.850> its

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
you some basic information about its

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.270 
you some basic information about its
energy<00:00:42.420> consumption<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.129> current<00:00:44.129> power

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
energy consumption the current power

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.799 
energy consumption the current power
consumption<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.910> displayed<00:00:45.329> here<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
consumption will be displayed here and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.959 
consumption will be displayed here and
at<00:00:46.140> its<00:00:46.260> maximum<00:00:46.680> speed<00:00:46.860> it'll<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.399> using<00:00:47.700> 400

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
at its maximum speed it'll be using 400

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.510 
at its maximum speed it'll be using 400
redstone<00:00:48.660> flux<00:00:48.870> per<00:00:49.079> tick<00:00:49.469> however<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
redstone flux per tick however as the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.340 
redstone flux per tick however as the
buffer<00:00:50.789> decreases<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.570> power<00:00:51.750> consumption

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
buffer decreases the power consumption

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.750 
buffer decreases the power consumption
and<00:00:52.440> operating<00:00:52.860> speed<00:00:53.100> will<00:00:53.250> also<00:00:53.550> decrease

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
and operating speed will also decrease

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.119 
and operating speed will also decrease
so<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.899> always<00:00:55.020> best<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.379> keep<00:00:55.530> its<00:00:55.710> internal

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
so it's always best to keep its internal

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.680 
so it's always best to keep its internal
buffer<00:00:56.280> full<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.480> quite<00:00:57.629> easily

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
buffer full you can do this quite easily

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
buffer full you can do this quite easily
by<00:00:58.109> connecting<00:00:58.559> energy<00:00:58.859> conduits<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.430> are

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
by connecting energy conduits that are

cell over time the magma crucible will

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.670 
cell over time the magma crucible will
use<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> significant<00:01:04.080> amount<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.290> redstone

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
use a significant amount of redstone

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039 
use a significant amount of redstone
flux<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.880> example<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.900> going

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
flux so for example here I'm just going

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.630 
flux so for example here I'm just going
to<00:01:07.140> convert<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.740> piece<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.159> cobblestone

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.000 
to convert one piece of cobblestone
into<00:01:08.909> lava<00:01:09.119> it'll<00:01:09.930> take<00:01:10.049> around<00:01:10.200> 30<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.710> 40

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.060 
into lava it'll take around 30 to 40
seconds<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.850> total<00:01:12.060> it'll<00:01:12.420> use<00:01:13.070> 240,000

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
seconds and in total it'll use 240,000
