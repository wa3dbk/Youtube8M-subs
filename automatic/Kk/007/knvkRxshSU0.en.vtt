I<00:00:57.239> think<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.300> last<00:00:58.510> frontier<00:00:59.020> for<00:00:59.230> indie

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
I think the last frontier for indie

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.740 
I think the last frontier for indie
filmmakers<00:00:59.980> is<00:01:00.220> areal<00:01:00.550> cinematography<00:01:01.239> which
