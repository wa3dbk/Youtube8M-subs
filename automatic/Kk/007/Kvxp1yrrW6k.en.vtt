absolutely atrocious compared to Skyrim
but<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.950> game<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.369> definitely<00:01:35.790> really<00:01:36.420> in

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
but the game was definitely really in

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.840 
but the game was definitely really in
depth<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.290> definitely<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.920> recommend

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
depth and I definitely do recommend

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.399 
depth and I definitely do recommend
checking<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.270> out<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.869> haven't<00:01:39.900> played<00:01:40.290> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
checking it out if you haven't played it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.499 
checking it out if you haven't played it
already<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.040> you're<00:01:41.820> into<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.240> Elder

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
already and you you're into the Elder

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.200 
already and you you're into the Elder
Scrolls<00:01:42.540> games<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.350> Skyrim<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:44.340> Oblivion<00:01:45.000> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
Scrolls games like Skyrim or Oblivion so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.200 
Scrolls games like Skyrim or Oblivion so
I<00:01:45.240> definitely<00:01:45.630> recommend<00:01:45.930> checking<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.680> out

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.800 
release a patch I think it says
pre-empting<00:03:11.739> for<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.100> DLC<00:03:12.609> and<00:03:12.790> also<00:03:13.570> on<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
pre-empting for the DLC and also on the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.870 
pre-empting for the DLC and also on the
picture<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:14.140> dope<00:03:14.739> Kings<00:03:15.070> eyes<00:03:15.280> bill<00:03:15.609> and<00:03:15.790> so

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
picture and dope Kings eyes bill and so

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.220 
picture and dope Kings eyes bill and so
I<00:03:15.940> think<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.299> does<00:03:16.450> deal<00:03:16.690> with<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.900> farmer

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
I think it does deal with the farmer

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.190 
I think it does deal with the farmer
which<00:03:17.410> are<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.709> snow<00:03:17.950> elves<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.870> those<00:03:19.870> who

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
which are the snow elves and those who

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.349 
which are the snow elves and those who
do<00:03:20.350> not<00:03:20.380> know<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.799> falmer<00:03:21.040> are<00:03:21.340> blind<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.970> his

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
do not know the falmer are blind and his

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.120 
do not know the falmer are blind and his
eyes<00:03:22.569> were<00:03:22.600> glowing<00:03:23.049> so<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.410> think<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.920> they

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
eyes were glowing so I think that they

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.740 
eyes were glowing so I think that they
might<00:03:24.160> be<00:03:24.519> getting<00:03:24.819> their<00:03:24.970> eyesight<00:03:25.299> back<00:03:25.510> in

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
might be getting their eyesight back in

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.229 
might be getting their eyesight back in
trying<00:03:26.079> to<00:03:26.200> take<00:03:26.380> over<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.890> land<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.850> Tamriel

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
trying to take over the land of Tamriel

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.020 
trying to take over the land of Tamriel
because<00:03:28.510> Tamriel<00:03:28.989> stands<00:03:29.260> for<00:03:29.560> Don's<00:03:30.459> beauty

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
because Tamriel stands for Don's beauty

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.370 
because Tamriel stands for Don's beauty
or<00:03:31.120> something<00:03:31.450> like<00:03:31.569> that<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.019> think<00:03:32.109> you

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
or something like that so I think you

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.080 
or something like that so I think you
have<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.530> defend<00:03:32.920> Tamriel<00:03:33.430> against<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.910> snow

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
have to defend Tamriel against the snow

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.750 
have to defend Tamriel against the snow
elves<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:34.720> just<00:03:34.989> my<00:03:35.139> theory<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.549> just

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
elves that is just my theory and I just

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.759 
elves that is just my theory and I just
want<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.030> clarify<00:03:37.209> that<00:03:37.720> Tamriel<00:03:38.260> stands<00:03:38.530> for

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
want to clarify that Tamriel stands for

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.250 
want to clarify that Tamriel stands for
Don's<00:03:38.950> beauty<00:03:39.400> in<00:03:39.549> elvish<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:41.049> just

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
Don's beauty in elvish so that just

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.590 
Don's beauty in elvish so that just
furthers<00:03:41.859> my<00:03:42.100> interest<00:03:42.549> in<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.970> subject<00:03:43.150> so

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
furthers my interest in the subject so

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.180 
furthers my interest in the subject so
that's<00:03:43.840> why<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:44.019> think<00:03:44.109> about<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.859> like<00:03:45.130> that

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
that's why I think about it like that

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.550 
that's why I think about it like that
and<00:03:45.489> there's<00:03:46.030> honestly<00:03:46.540> no<00:03:46.989> theories<00:03:47.319> about

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
and there's honestly no theories about

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.229 
and there's honestly no theories about
that<00:03:47.769> there<00:03:48.100> are<00:03:48.250> theories<00:03:48.519> about<00:03:48.880> dealing

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
that there are theories about dealing

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.849 
that there are theories about dealing
with<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.569> snow<00:03:49.750> elves<00:03:49.989> there's<00:03:50.680> also

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
with the snow elves there's also

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.620 
with the snow elves there's also
theories<00:03:51.280> about<00:03:51.459> vampires<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.060> werewolves

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
theories about vampires and werewolves

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.599 
theories about vampires and werewolves
because<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.019> eyes<00:03:53.139> are<00:03:53.170> glowing<00:03:53.590> but<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.430> is

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
because the eyes are glowing but that is

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.400 
because the eyes are glowing but that is
just<00:03:54.639> my<00:03:55.030> theory<00:03:55.359> I<00:03:55.480> haven't<00:03:55.959> seen<00:03:56.170> anybody

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
just my theory I haven't seen anybody

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.949 
just my theory I haven't seen anybody
else<00:03:56.769> with<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.430> theory<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.450> think<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.810> is

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
else with that theory and I think it is

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.550 
else with that theory and I think it is
logical<00:03:59.170> in<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.920> sense<00:04:00.840> but<00:04:01.840> what's<00:04:02.079> a<00:04:02.200> quick

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
logical in a sense but what's a quick

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.140 
logical in a sense but what's a quick
update<00:04:02.739> with<00:04:03.190> what's<00:04:03.430> going<00:04:03.609> on<00:04:03.819> with<00:04:04.000> my
