00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and the online element too they're going

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.350 
and the online element too they're going
to<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.680> hoping<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.100> these<00:01:47.250> titles<00:01:47.759> really

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
to be hoping that these titles really

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.719 
to be hoping that these titles really
help<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> bolster<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> old<00:01:49.409> sales<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.070> course

help to bolster the old sales of course

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.370 
help to bolster the old sales of course
but<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.149> question<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.630> those<00:01:51.689> will<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.170> be

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
but the question for those will this be

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.109 
but the question for those will this be
enough<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:52.890> people<00:01:53.310> buying<00:01:53.549> Wii<00:01:53.909> U

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
into the black with a very good question

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.459 
into the black with a very good question
is<00:02:00.210> indeed<00:02:00.509> now<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.140> they<00:02:01.259> worked

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
is indeed now you can see they worked

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.110 
is indeed now you can see they worked
very<00:02:01.590> very<00:02:01.829> hard<00:02:02.040> time

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
very very hard time

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.850 
very very hard time
they<00:02:03.180> ought<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.330> be<00:02:03.510> very<00:02:03.810> good<00:02:04.050> games<00:02:04.350> so

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
they ought to be very good games so

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.230 
they ought to be very good games so
there's<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.130> good<00:02:05.340> chance<00:02:05.400> that<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.910> can<00:02:06.090> really

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
there's a good chance that it can really

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.120 
there's a good chance that it can really
help<00:02:06.450> we'll<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.230> to<00:02:07.260> wait<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:07.980> IE

does<00:02:08.430> it<00:02:08.670> Nintendo<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.600> done<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.960> before

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
does it Nintendo have done this before

with<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.650> 3ds<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.250> more<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.940> think<00:02:11.970> they

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
with the 3ds and more and I think they

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.090 
with the 3ds and more and I think they
can<00:02:12.630> do<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.810> again<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.320> later<00:02:13.500> we<00:02:13.890> most
