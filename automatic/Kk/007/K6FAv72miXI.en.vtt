with this particular one this is what

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.150 
with this particular one this is what
the<00:00:48.270> brush<00:00:48.570> itself<00:00:48.899> looks<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the brush itself looks like this is a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.340 
the brush itself looks like this is a
little<00:00:50.460> stand<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> comes<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.870> this

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
little stand that it comes on and this

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.080 
little stand that it comes on and this
is<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.649> cool<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.550> don't<00:00:53.610> know<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:53.940> other

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
is so cool and I don't know if other

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
is so cool and I don't know if other
brushes<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:55.559> stand

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
brushes do this but the little stand

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.549 
brushes do this but the little stand
opens<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.969> then<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.780> stores<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.410> other

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
opens up and then it stores your other

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.160 
opens up and then it stores your other
two<00:00:58.829> brush<00:00:59.190> heads<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.969> one<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> silicon

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
two brush heads so this one is a silicon

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.319 
two brush heads so this one is a silicon
tip<00:01:01.710> brush<00:01:02.190> head<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.640> one<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.120> bit

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
tip brush head this one is a little bit

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.119 
tip brush head this one is a little bit
more<00:01:03.480> firm<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> exfoliating

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
more firm so this is the exfoliating

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.280 
more firm so this is the exfoliating
brush<00:01:05.430> head<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.060> then<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> have

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
brush head and then the one that I have

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.469 
brush head and then the one that I have
on<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.340> everyday<00:01:08.729> brush<00:01:09.240> head

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
on here is just the everyday brush head

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450 
on here is just the everyday brush head
so<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.140> powers<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:10.890> there's<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so it just powers on and there's a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.280 
so it just powers on and there's a
couple<00:01:11.640> different<00:01:11.820> fees<00:01:12.479> there's<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.110> lower

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
couple different fees there's the lower

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.800 
couple different fees there's the lower
speed<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:14.070> beginners<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.270> people<00:01:15.390> who<00:01:15.689> are

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
speed for beginners and people who are

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.109 
speed for beginners and people who are
not<00:01:16.020> comfortable<00:01:16.560> or<00:01:17.189> familiar<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.759> using

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
not comfortable or familiar with using

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.480 
not comfortable or familiar with using
these<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.200> also<00:01:19.560> make<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.280> go

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
these and then you can also make a go

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.160 
these and then you can also make a go
little<00:01:20.670> bit<00:01:20.759> faster<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.299> there's<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> option

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
little bit faster so there's that option

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.749 
little bit faster so there's that option
and<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.500> also<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.979> other<00:01:23.009> cool<00:01:23.400> thing<00:01:23.580> like

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.130 
and then also the other cool thing like
I<00:01:23.790> said<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.090> don't<00:01:24.210> know<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.479> other<00:01:24.689> brushes<00:01:24.900> do

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.210 
you can click this other button right
here<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.659> brush<00:01:30.930> will<00:01:31.229> rotate<00:01:31.530> to

here and then the brush will rotate to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.399 
here and then the brush will rotate to
the<00:01:32.250> other<00:01:32.430> side<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.780> left<00:01:34.140> now

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the other side so it's going to left now

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.469 
the other side so it's going to left now
you<00:01:35.189> spin<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> other<00:01:35.700> way<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.299> going

you spin it the other way and it's going

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.999 
you spin it the other way and it's going
to<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> right<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.200> really<00:01:37.380> allows<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.979> to

so<00:05:35.169> I'm<00:05:35.289> having<00:05:35.500> a<00:05:35.710> little<00:05:35.919> bit<00:05:35.979> of<00:05:36.100> a<00:05:36.160> learning

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
so I'm having a little bit of a learning

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.969 
so I'm having a little bit of a learning
curve<00:05:36.729> trying<00:05:37.210> to<00:05:37.419> figure<00:05:38.200> out<00:05:38.260> how<00:05:38.530> to<00:05:38.590> tend

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
curve trying to figure out how to tend

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.950 
curve trying to figure out how to tend
to<00:05:39.130> my<00:05:39.490> dry<00:05:39.760> skin<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:40.389> I<00:05:40.450> feel<00:05:40.660> like<00:05:40.780> this

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
to my dry skin and I feel like this

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.290 
to my dry skin and I feel like this
particularly<00:05:41.380> has<00:05:41.740> helped<00:05:42.039> quite<00:05:42.639> a<00:05:43.000> bit

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
particularly has helped quite a bit

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.969 
particularly has helped quite a bit
because<00:05:43.570> I'll<00:05:43.900> just<00:05:44.080> get<00:05:44.260> flakes<00:05:44.620> that<00:05:44.770> will

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
because I'll just get flakes that will

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.520 
because I'll just get flakes that will
stick<00:05:45.370> and<00:05:45.610> I'll<00:05:45.789> use<00:05:46.090> like<00:05:46.300> exfoliators<00:05:47.050> I'll
