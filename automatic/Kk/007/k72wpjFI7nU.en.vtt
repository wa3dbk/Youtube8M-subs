00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.660
 teachers 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.119
 I do not even know we call 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.480
 Your name is the personal trainer. 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.060
 which acts as a teacher is we are 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.279
 observing a giant migration of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.939
 teachers for the personal market 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.670
 trainer 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.489
 according to our figures the demand for 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.050
 physical activity at the counter grew 10% 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.899
 in the last years 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.660
 every year looking for staff 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.989
 trainer grew 18% 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.739
 ie the majority of customers 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.760
 want a better result more 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.430
 that is more appropriate to their 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 features are seeking help with 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.309
 a personal trainer 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.070
 this has been done by most teachers 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.820
 want to be seduced by this opportunity 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.250
 understandable is fair even 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.290
 business model of the current 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.360
 Money for teacher has money. 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.670
 the owner a sales manager and that the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.470
 coordinator is not possible for a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.049
 teacher to earn the same money as 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.000
 he wins as a personal trainer giving 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.189
 classes at the gym hours 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.670
 that's fair they seek is 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.100
 important that they go behind but the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.630
 Some people need to make some adjustments and then 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.479
 I want to give you some valuable tips. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.939
 here imagine the following scenario 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.250
 a teacher working three four 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.020
 five hours for you and the other hours 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.030
 he giving personal trainer classes 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.520
 stimulate this cup with which the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.060
 teacher 's desire for this 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.460
 life of having a better recipe but you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.009
 need to make an adjustment on how much 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.869
 they devote themselves during the hours they 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.299
 Are you working for you, remember when? 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.770
 You set up your gym what you dreamed. 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.840
 in service that is what is 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.829
 happening is not and is not the fault of 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.930
 teachers 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.689
 so it 's my fault I will not call 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.040
 of guilt I would tell you a mission 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.090
 abandoned the ideas he had in the beginning 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.979
 your company 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.759
 I'll make a way here that you 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.760
 could follow that certain 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.470
 this scenario will change and I will start 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.750
 I ask you something when you went to 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.150
 Last time you had a cup of coffee. 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.370
 with the team teacher 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.409
 when was the last time you were 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.470
 met with the teacher to listen to the 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.239
 that he had to talk when he went to 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.310
 last time that instead of making a 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.349
 meeting with everyone at 10 hours 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.200
 night when everyone is tired 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.590
 you called a person to accept with 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.159
 You talk in a quiet mature manner. 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.690
 adult and professional about how they walk 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.590
 things in your gym 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.200
 you see that teachers do not know 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.959
 no gym number they do not know 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.150
 for example that on Monday which is the 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.379
 day normally full of academies 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.760
 does not reach 50% of the total assets 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.829
 pass by the ratchet 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.370
 someone missing from the orientation for them 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.379
 but before I said that I wanted to talk 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.959
 about relationship that wanted to come back 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.629
 at that point how many times you have 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.180
 talked to teachers wanting to know 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.000
 of their lives and they have children who 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.199
 what dreams are theirs what 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.870
 expectations 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.639
 This is a path I recommend for 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.790
 you start getting closer to your 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.340
 team and balancing this situation 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.079
 of course it is important that 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.780
 teachers focus on staff 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.239
 trainer is much more money conversation 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.459
 more than the staff get more than the guys 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.639
 but to make individual meeting 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.250
 listen the guys but the middle goes 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.040
 be the one crying I know part 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.379
 the human being and boot now listen with the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.650
 patient and on the first day does not say anything 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:56.980
 just listen illegal because cool with what 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.109
 annoying taboo meeting certainly the 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.889
 teachers will be suspicious of this 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.810
 conversation 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.959
 but you pay for space 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.659
 Wonderful in his emotions I will 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.940
 say something you do not believe 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.879
 nor does a teacher leave home wanting 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.810
 offend or abuse 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:19.889
 customer displeasure 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.200
 a little focus of direction of 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.990
 not theirs 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.350
 and during the conversation forget the 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.620
 say it himself 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.440
 pay attention to him in discussing and even 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.750
 in the middle of the group have some malandrinha 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.160
 people knows what human nature has 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.700
 patience 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.730
 your ideal your goal is much higher 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.830
 than these personality variations 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.169
 choose a nice time for you 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.780
 nice time for him and do this 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.400
 marriage in communication 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.490
 You will see that with the passage of time 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.790
 these meetings becoming regular if 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.580
 will achieve result marvels 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.860
 if you are wanting a performance 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.860
 better in your classroom 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.290
 take on the role of leader 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.139
 you can greatly influence your 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:16.169
 team now does not think of their team as 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.810
 A herd has its staff and 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.770
 individually the results will be 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.770
 great
