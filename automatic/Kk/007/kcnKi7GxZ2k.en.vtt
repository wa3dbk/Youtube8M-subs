00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
second one this is a biggie something we

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.390 
second one this is a biggie something we
call<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.490> Retina<00:00:10.969> display<00:00:12.250> what's<00:00:13.250> that<00:00:14.320> well

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
call the Retina display what's that well

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.700 
call the Retina display what's that well
in<00:00:16.400> any<00:00:16.730> display<00:00:17.300> there<00:00:17.509> are<00:00:17.630> pixels<00:00:17.869> here's

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
in any display there are pixels here's

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.510 
in any display there are pixels here's
four<00:00:19.040> of<00:00:19.160> them<00:00:20.619> we<00:00:21.619> start<00:00:21.980> off<00:00:22.130> with<00:00:22.369> the

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
four of them we start off with the

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.990 
four of them we start off with the
retina<00:00:22.880> display<00:00:24.070> by<00:00:25.070> dramatically

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
retina display by dramatically

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.929 
retina display by dramatically
increasing<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:26.869> pixel<00:00:27.259> density<00:00:27.460> four<00:00:28.460> times

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
increasing the pixel density four times

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.319 
increasing the pixel density four times
as<00:00:29.239> many<00:00:29.390> pixels<00:00:29.779> in<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:31.640> same<00:00:31.910> amount<00:00:32.239> of

as many pixels in the same amount of

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.280 
as many pixels in the same amount of
space<00:00:32.950> now<00:00:33.950> why<00:00:34.160> is<00:00:34.219> that<00:00:34.370> important<00:00:35.000> well

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
space now why is that important well

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.829 
space now why is that important well
let's<00:00:36.290> make<00:00:36.559> more<00:00:36.770> pixels<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:37.489> let's<00:00:38.420> say<00:00:38.629> we

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
let's make more pixels and let's say we

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.759 
let's make more pixels and let's say we
want<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.579> draw<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:40.609> letter<00:00:41.000> A<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:41.620> this<00:00:42.620> is

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
want to draw the letter A and this is

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.729 
want to draw the letter A and this is
the<00:00:42.949> outside<00:00:43.489> boundary<00:00:43.999> of<00:00:44.589> one<00:00:45.589> of<00:00:45.679> the

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
the outside boundary of one of the

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.459 
the outside boundary of one of the
strokes<00:00:46.070> of<00:00:46.219> a<00:00:46.309> letter<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:47.059> letter<00:00:47.269> A<00:00:47.480> well<00:00:48.350> as

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
strokes of a letter the letter A well as

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.130 
strokes of a letter the letter A well as
you<00:00:48.589> can<00:00:48.739> see<00:00:49.010> we<00:00:49.519> turn<00:00:49.789> on<00:00:49.940> pixels<00:00:50.390> inside

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
you can see we turn on pixels inside

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.869 
you can see we turn on pixels inside
that<00:00:51.409> stroke<00:00:51.769> we<00:00:52.159> can<00:00:52.370> get<00:00:52.489> far<00:00:52.850> more

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
that stroke we can get far more

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.889 
that stroke we can get far more
precision<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:54.019> more<00:00:54.199> pixels<00:00:54.530> we<00:00:54.739> have<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:55.899> we

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
precision the more pixels we have and we

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.509 
precision the more pixels we have and we
play<00:00:57.140> all<00:00:57.260> sorts<00:00:57.620> of<00:00:57.679> tricks<00:00:57.920> by<00:00:58.159> putting

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
play all sorts of tricks by putting

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.910 
play all sorts of tricks by putting
different<00:00:58.879> levels<00:00:59.329> of<00:00:59.420> gray<00:00:59.659> pixels<00:01:00.170> on<00:01:00.319> that

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
different levels of gray pixels on that

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.090 
different levels of gray pixels on that
line<00:01:01.760> as<00:01:02.030> well<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.989> try<00:01:03.170> to<00:01:03.199> fuzz<00:01:03.620> it<00:01:03.800> for<00:01:04.010> our

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
line as well to try to fuzz it for our

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.969 
line as well to try to fuzz it for our
eye<00:01:04.129> but<00:01:04.580> when<00:01:05.030> we<00:01:05.150> zoom<00:01:05.420> out<00:01:05.659> of<00:01:05.720> this<00:01:06.050> what

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
eye but when we zoom out of this what

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.210 
eye but when we zoom out of this what
you<00:01:07.130> can<00:01:07.310> see<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.940> that<00:01:08.690> because<00:01:09.620> we<00:01:09.830> have<00:01:09.950> four

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
you can see is that because we have four

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.550 
you can see is that because we have four
times<00:01:10.460> as<00:01:10.670> many<00:01:10.760> pixels<00:01:11.120> we<00:01:11.750> get<00:01:11.930> really

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
times as many pixels we get really

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.030 
times as many pixels we get really
really<00:01:13.250> sharp<00:01:13.730> text<00:01:14.080> compared<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.230> what<00:01:15.890> we

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
really sharp text compared to what we

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.100 
really sharp text compared to what we
normally<00:01:16.250> get<00:01:16.670> on<00:01:16.880> displays<00:01:17.720> of<00:01:17.900> lesser

there's never been a display like this

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.419 
there's never been a display like this

on a phone people haven't even dreamed

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.450 
on a phone people haven't even dreamed
about<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.969> display<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> phone<00:01:37.460> but

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
about a display like this on a phone but

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.109 
about a display like this on a phone but
it's<00:01:38.579> more<00:01:38.909> than<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:40.170> turns<00:01:40.649> out<00:01:41.119> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it's more than that it turns out that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.740 
it's more than that it turns out that
there's<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.450> magic<00:01:43.109> number<00:01:43.369> right<00:01:44.369> around<00:01:44.750> 300

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
there's a magic number right around 300

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.260 
there's a magic number right around 300
pixels<00:01:46.229> per<00:01:46.439> inch<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:47.640> when<00:01:47.819> you<00:01:47.909> hold

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
pixels per inch that when you hold

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.389 
pixels per inch that when you hold
something<00:01:48.630> around<00:01:49.289> 10<00:01:49.590> or<00:01:49.619> 12<00:01:49.979> inches<00:01:50.250> away

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
something around 10 or 12 inches away

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.449 
something around 10 or 12 inches away
from<00:01:50.490> your<00:01:50.819> eyes<00:01:50.969> is<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:52.200> limit<00:01:52.709> of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.429> human

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
from your eyes is the limit of the human

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.449 
from your eyes is the limit of the human
retina<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.600> differentiate<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.770> pixels<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
retina to differentiate the pixels and

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.539 
retina to differentiate the pixels and
so<00:01:56.959> they're<00:01:57.959> so<00:01:58.259> close<00:01:58.590> together<00:01:58.859> when<00:01:59.459> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
so they're so close together when you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.880 
so they're so close together when you
get<00:01:59.729> at<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.030> 300<00:02:00.840> pixels<00:02:01.649> per<00:02:01.709> inch

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
get at this 300 pixels per inch
