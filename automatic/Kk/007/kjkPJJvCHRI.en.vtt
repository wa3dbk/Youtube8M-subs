00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.440
 in fact, we are in Mediterranean sales 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.180
 full phase faldi which will also continue 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.160
 for the month of February and I have chosen 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.859
 some products that are here in front of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.039
 me is that ranging from facial care to 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.080
 make up which are therefore suitable for 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.119
 make a complete beauty routine 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.920
 let's start with facial care myself 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.300
 I would like you to see these two products 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.550
 a serum and a cream together with oil yes 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.430
 I was face and this is the balance of 30 per 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.500
 hundred as well as the cream this yes 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.480
 Anti-age serum heroin which is good for everyone 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.960
 the types of skin therefore also to the skins 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.000
 mixed and fat like mine you can 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.309
 apply it directly to the face indeed 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.920
 they were of can spread it under the face 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.870
 or mix with the cream or make 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.770
 like I do I put a little bit on 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.410
 Palm of the hand 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.539
 then rub his hands and then tap him 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.519
 no time then I spread it over everything 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.100
 the whole face is really very few 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.930
 drops because over super concentrated e 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.580
 can also be used to make a 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.979
 facial massage that can be 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.530
 relaxing or even invigorating for 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.259
 wake up the skin a little tired and a little 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.110
 off then passing to the cream I apply 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.000
 of villa and already the name speaks for itself and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.009
 inside this package it is 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.259
 really beautiful super super chic 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.159
 I think it is gold and black indeed I do 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.460
 see the cream here is also the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.610
 gold and black packaging cream is a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.460
 cream as I said before wrinkle then 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.070
 plays a tonic and moisturizing action 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.320
 also protects the reasons to a complete one 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.829
 who fights in short, all the various signs 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.500
 age 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.130
 okay even if maybe you are a little bit 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.030
 younger and want to start 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.979
 to prevent the first signs 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.990
 of aging here passing then to 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.500
 eye makeup I used two 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.740
 pencils one brown and one black these mi 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.439
 like them because they are good 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.210
 very soft very smooth too 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.979
 very pigmented I show you them 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.470
 on the hand 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.090
 here they are and then fade away immediately 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.550
 so you can also get a 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.319
 nice smokey effect and a faded effect 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.930
 I did what I did 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.660
 brown under the lower lashes for a 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.910
 more natural effect on the other hand 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.519
 the upper lashes I used that 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.890
 black then or faded both pencils e 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.959
 in the outer corner or applied another 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.880
 little brown pencil that I shaded with 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.430
 fingers then I applied some of the 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.290
 brown pencil also on the eyebrows 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.000
 and I recommend it if you do it a lot 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.519
 very careful not to do a stretch 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.100
 too marked is too strong because 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.110
 unfortunately, these pencils are born 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.830
 which pencils eyes and not like pencils for 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.959
 eyebrows 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.340
 I decided to use it also on 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.769
 eyebrows because it's the color 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.080
 perfect for my eyebrows and me 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.459
 it seemed a shame not to use it 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.040
 but here my advice is to 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.319
 apply very little and then 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.480
 above all not to press and not to make a 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.150
 stretch too marked are the are 2 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.370
 over-defined eyebrows and lo 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.739
 look hardens and in short it does not come 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.600
 a nice effect is the thing among other things 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.940
 which surprised me is that these pencils 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.459
 more than 70 percent are on sale 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.760
 so they are at 3 o'clock instead of 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.100
 13 50 and a fantastic price then 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.829
 I think it's worth taking advantage of it 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.590
 like mascara or used this here 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.109
 this is the max mascara supermedio 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.519
 false eyelashes to a brush of those 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.910
 that I like now I do it 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.890
 see why it is made of silicone and 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.359
 these are the pipe cleaners as I have 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.130
 already said in so many videos that 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.530
 I prefer absolutely because they manage to 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.790
 take all the eyelashes well 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.610
 even maybe it gives you more court 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.969
 and thinner so he can take 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.599
 all of them well to the eyelashes in curve 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:59.459
 rlh and to intensify them and to thicken if 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.319
 you want a natural effect maybe made 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.569
 one on one pass if you want instead 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.120
 a more intense effect and more eyes than 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.010
 cat you can do even two passes 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.170
 even listening on this mascara is 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.769
 really very high because it is more than 55 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:17.310
 percent and is instead of 18 euros 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.380
 90 to 7 euros and eighty as I apply the 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.299
 I take mascara the toothbrush I bring 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.580
 very close to the lash line 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.289
 and then made to make zig movements 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.090
 zag in this way I make sure of 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.220
 take all all your eyelashes 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.680
 so I do zigzag movements e 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.070
 then the doors upwards and more safe 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.419
 which then zig zag movement and more except 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.210
 the more I stop making movements and 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.590
 excel for simply combing them towards 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.960
 up if maybe I want to open it 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.990
 look or outward if I want 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.090
 have more cat eye effect if 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.500
 I want to look further and finally not 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.710
 a product that I would like to show 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.680
 this lip balm this is the lipstick 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.510
 which is a lip treatment 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.449
 absolutely transparent this is in 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.949
 20 percent balance is one stick either 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.409
 you to take care of the lips 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.810
 really manages to moisturize the lips 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:10.650
 background thanks also to hyaluronic cigo 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.449
 and to vitamin e and I like that 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.000
 really leaves your lips super super 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.260
 soft throughout the course of the 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.840
 day in short, leaves the lips 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.639
 soft for a long time and nothing these are 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.380
