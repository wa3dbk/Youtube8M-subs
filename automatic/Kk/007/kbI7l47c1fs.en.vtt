00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.519
 and the next SMS are 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.570
 it was very well done 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.409
 by Paul MÃ¼ller who receives 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:31.669
 Question by SMS what happens if the referee bet on each other 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.740
 Ramallah set up a case for the game would mess up 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.940
 clearly solved the first big problem 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.860
 to get the chance 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.370
 then actually in relation to it 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.270
 but he simpler 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.720
 but that happens often 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.860
 This also shows what important role the head in this sport 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.450
 plays 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.650
 Well so if the referee messes up the game then that will 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.560
 Spectators will not get a blast furnace head next time because that is 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.070
 of course embarrassing 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.890
 and then has to try the picture as well as possible 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.890
 to reconstruct 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.000
 and after which 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.480
 criteria 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.900
 6 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.850
 and the players 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.270
 were paid for the Cup of Track 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.290
 Now these are very simple the numbers 1 to 6 of the world ranking then, so to speak 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.290
 as local hero Jimmy White 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.130
 the Londoner travels as number 8 in the world 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.210
 Plus the reigning world champion ever forget the 8 players here 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.700
 started the question 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.680
 after a prize money for the second leg Marica 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.220
 So that's true for every percent 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.290
 You usually train a special price 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.440
 for the highest break 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.260
 This year there are still a few thousand pounds for that 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.000
 get here, however, plans issue no prizes there's 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.109
 Entry fee for each of the players 3000 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.109
 500 before the meeting 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.139
 Meinsen 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.349
 put something too straight on blue 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.539
 Blue he still punched that was not the problem now 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.579
 and the forum 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.049
 the ride has still managed 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:52.809
 to come on this route 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.789
 Quality 1 I would have wanted to run this Roth on the long track 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.639
 again with left 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.549
 he is the only one of them 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.180
 dishonest seamless between right and left Axel Kammerer runner land 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.329
 that was not always rehearsed wanted he wanted the red 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.329
 Zone have to change 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.770
 on 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.770
 schulte-euler lost time to talk again 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:34.050
 This time he gets the red one 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.240
 but not so that he can really do something sensible with it 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.710
 and at 40 points difference 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.710
 these cases are far from decided 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.629
 of course that was a lucky hit that was not planned 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.629
 of emigrants 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:37.939
 times 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:48.279
 I still have a relaxed mood was actually a very pleasant thing 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:07.809
 from underneath 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:10.809
 that was close 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:41.270
 when he's his youngest the coach and mentor are sealed off 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.490
 by the way 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.720
 this is the man of the year 1900 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.230
 96 won the first Portals Cup back then in the final 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.639
 Thief per Handorf and Gelmer 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.710
 Final with 88 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.360
 to the 29th 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.370
 against Pommes bridle and in the course of the tournament before was the highest break of the 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.569
 Tournaments and thus also the fifth Braque
