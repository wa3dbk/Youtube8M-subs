this is the first of a series of videos
about<00:00:04.359> Google<00:00:04.930> Earth<00:00:05.080> 5.0<00:00:05.920> this<00:00:06.220> one<00:00:06.399> showing

about Google Earth 5.0 this one showing
the<00:00:06.910> new<00:00:07.059> ocean<00:00:07.450> data<00:00:07.930> for<00:00:08.320> Google<00:00:08.620> Earth<00:00:08.679> 5

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
the new ocean data for Google Earth 5

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.669 
the new ocean data for Google Earth 5
the<00:00:09.969> first<00:00:10.209> thing<00:00:10.360> you'll<00:00:10.509> notice<00:00:10.660> is<00:00:10.990> when

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:11.679 
the first thing you'll notice is when

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.199 
the first thing you'll notice is when
you<00:00:11.799> get<00:00:11.919> the<00:00:12.070> new<00:00:12.190> Google<00:00:12.459> Earth<00:00:12.580> ride<00:00:12.849> is<00:00:13.059> the

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:13.209 
you get the new Google Earth ride is the

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.150 
you get the new Google Earth ride is the
new<00:00:13.389> ocean<00:00:13.749> floor<00:00:14.110> imagery<00:00:14.589> which<00:00:14.799> actually

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
new ocean floor imagery which actually

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.150 
new ocean floor imagery which actually
was<00:00:15.309> released<00:00:15.700> about<00:00:15.969> two<00:00:16.030> weeks<00:00:16.390> ago<00:00:16.660> but<00:00:17.590> now

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
was released about two weeks ago but now

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.460 
was released about two weeks ago but now
it<00:00:18.760> has<00:00:18.849> something<00:00:19.180> really<00:00:19.630> exciting<00:00:19.990> and<00:00:20.260> new

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
it has something really exciting and new

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.089 
it has something really exciting and new
as<00:00:20.769> you<00:00:20.980> come<00:00:21.849> in<00:00:22.090> closer<00:00:22.420> to<00:00:22.689> the<00:00:22.869> ocean<00:00:23.590> and

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
as you come in closer to the ocean and

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.980 
as you come in closer to the ocean and
you<00:00:24.429> start<00:00:24.730> to<00:00:24.849> tilt<00:00:25.060> your<00:00:25.269> view<00:00:25.599> you<00:00:25.810> can

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
you start to tilt your view you can

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.279 
you start to tilt your view you can
actually<00:00:26.199> see<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:27.009> ocean<00:00:27.039> surface<00:00:27.820> now<00:00:28.300> not

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
actually see the ocean surface now not

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.050 
actually see the ocean surface now not
just<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.800> undersea<00:00:30.369> bathymetry

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
just the undersea bathymetry

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.020 
just the undersea bathymetry
and<00:00:31.269> as<00:00:32.050> you<00:00:32.169> get<00:00:32.349> in<00:00:32.500> closer<00:00:32.770> you<00:00:33.640> actually

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
and as you get in closer you actually

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.390 
and as you get in closer you actually
see<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.450> waves<00:00:34.720> moving<00:00:35.410> along<00:00:35.710> on<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.040> ocean

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
see the waves moving along on the ocean

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.430 
see the waves moving along on the ocean
now<00:00:37.180> I<00:00:37.240> understand<00:00:37.750> there's<00:00:37.960> some<00:00:38.020> people

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
now I understand there's some people

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.230 
now I understand there's some people
with<00:00:38.530> older<00:00:38.830> graphics<00:00:39.220> cards<00:00:39.550> may<00:00:39.820> not<00:00:40.000> see

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
with older graphics cards may not see

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.080 
with older graphics cards may not see
those<00:00:40.650> animations<00:00:41.650> but<00:00:42.580> what's<00:00:42.790> really<00:00:42.940> cool

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
those animations but what's really cool

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.150 
those animations but what's really cool
is<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.510> elevation<00:00:44.200> data<00:00:44.380> for<00:00:44.740> Google<00:00:45.010> Earth

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
is the elevation data for Google Earth

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.940 
is the elevation data for Google Earth
used<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.880> never<00:00:46.090> go<00:00:46.330> below<00:00:46.720> sea<00:00:46.990> level<00:00:47.020> but<00:00:47.710> now

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
used to never go below sea level but now

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.800 
used to never go below sea level but now
it's<00:00:48.490> negative<00:00:48.880> when<00:00:49.270> you<00:00:49.390> put<00:00:49.570> your<00:00:49.660> mouse

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
it's negative when you put your mouse

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.980 
it's negative when you put your mouse
over<00:00:50.080> the<00:00:50.260> oceans<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:51.550> what<00:00:52.210> happens<00:00:52.540> if<00:00:52.840> you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
over the oceans so what happens if you

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.340 
over the oceans so what happens if you
fly<00:00:53.350> below<00:00:53.770> the<00:00:53.800> water<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:55.300> right<00:00:55.630> you<00:00:56.140> can

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
fly below the water that's right you can

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.740 
fly below the water that's right you can
now<00:00:56.560> see<00:00:56.950> that<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.580> ocean<00:00:57.910> bathymetry<00:00:58.270> data

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
now see that the ocean bathymetry data

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.370 
now see that the ocean bathymetry data
is<00:00:59.020> actually<00:00:59.470> in<00:00:59.590> 3d<00:01:00.280> so<00:01:01.240> that's<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.990> under

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
is actually in 3d so that's the under

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.749 
is actually in 3d so that's the under
sea<00:01:02.590> floor<00:01:03.869> 3d<00:01:04.869> terrain<00:01:05.140> in<00:01:05.649> Google<00:01:06.310> Earth<00:01:06.399> all

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
sea floor 3d terrain in Google Earth all

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.260 
sea floor 3d terrain in Google Earth all
over<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.390> oceans<00:01:07.810> of<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.259> earth<00:01:08.439> and<00:01:09.219> oh<00:01:09.789> man

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
over the oceans of the earth and oh man

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.359 
over the oceans of the earth and oh man
this<00:01:10.420> is<00:01:10.600> just<00:01:10.630> awesome<00:01:11.170> it's<00:01:11.320> like<00:01:11.439> when<00:01:12.340> I

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
submarine and going and seeing the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.060 
submarine and going and seeing the
undersea<00:01:16.179> floor<00:01:16.689> and<00:01:16.990> now<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.619> can<00:01:17.890> do<00:01:18.039> it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
undersea floor and now you can do it

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.859 
undersea floor and now you can do it
yourself<00:01:18.640> from<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.299> comfort<00:01:19.600> of<00:01:19.659> your<00:01:19.719> home

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
all over the world look at that terrain

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.609 
all over the world look at that terrain
it's<00:01:23.289> just<00:01:23.499> really<00:01:23.799> cool<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.659> this<00:01:26.229> is<00:01:26.409> all

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
part in the new Google Earth 5.0 and I

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.700 
part in the new Google Earth 5.0 and I
love<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.469> look<00:01:29.619> of<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.859> water<00:01:30.130> up<00:01:31.090> above<00:01:31.710> so

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
love the look of the water up above so

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.919 
love the look of the water up above so
let's<00:01:32.979> some<00:01:33.450> look<00:01:34.450> at<00:01:34.539> something<00:01:34.899> different

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
let's some look at something different

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.559 
let's some look at something different
I'm<00:01:35.530> going<00:01:35.619> to<00:01:35.799> take<00:01:36.249> a<00:01:36.280> view<00:01:36.609> of<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.359> death

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
I'm going to take a view of the death

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.080 
I'm going to take a view of the death
imagery<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.319> show<00:01:38.920> it<00:01:39.069> to<00:01:39.249> you<00:01:39.429> without<00:01:39.700> the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
imagery and show it to you without the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.300 
imagery and show it to you without the
ocean<00:01:40.240> surface<00:01:40.659> and<00:01:41.170> we'll<00:01:41.679> make<00:01:42.039> it<00:01:42.069> even

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
ocean surface and we'll make it even

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.279 
ocean surface and we'll make it even
more<00:01:42.460> apparent<00:01:42.909> by<00:01:43.200> exaggerating<00:01:44.200> the

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
more apparent by exaggerating the

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.050 
more apparent by exaggerating the
elevation<00:01:44.889> so<00:01:45.490> I'm<00:01:45.579> going<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.789> show<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:45.909> how

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
elevation so I'm going to show you how

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.760 
elevation so I'm going to show you how
to<00:01:46.119> do<00:01:46.299> that<00:01:46.539> first<00:01:46.869> you<00:01:46.990> go<00:01:47.170> up<00:01:47.319> to<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:47.530> menu

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
to do that first you go up to the menu

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.830 
to do that first you go up to the menu
and<00:01:48.639> you<00:01:48.700> choose<00:01:49.689> view<00:01:51.119> water<00:01:52.119> surface<00:01:52.600> and

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
and you choose view water surface and

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.109 
and you choose view water surface and
turn<00:01:53.079> it<00:01:53.259> off<00:01:53.469> now<00:01:54.219> when<00:01:54.460> you're<00:01:54.579> viewing<00:01:54.880> the

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
turn it off now when you're viewing the
