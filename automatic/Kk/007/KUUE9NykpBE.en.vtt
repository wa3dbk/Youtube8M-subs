00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
supplied by improv electronics I've been

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.749 
supplied by improv electronics I've been
using<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.219> for<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.759> few<00:00:12.179> days<00:00:12.360> now<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:13.759> it

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
using this for a few days now and it

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.340 
using this for a few days now and it
seems<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.059> work<00:00:15.240> really<00:00:15.450> well<00:00:15.800> it's<00:00:16.800> very<00:00:17.039> thin

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
seems to work really well it's very thin

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:26.980 
seems to work really well it's very thin
I'm<00:00:19.350> say<00:00:20.010> roughly<00:00:22.010> one<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.160> two<00:00:23.340> millimeters

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.830 

has<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> nice<00:00:28.320> style<00:00:28.680> very<00:00:29.340> light<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.970> it's

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
has a nice style very light and it's

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.810 
has a nice style very light and it's
also<00:00:30.990> quite<00:00:31.289> flexible<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.949> well<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.399> it'll<00:00:32.550> be

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
also quite flexible as well so it'll be

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.150 
also quite flexible as well so it'll be
found<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.780> your<00:00:33.809> bag<00:00:36.530> just<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> demonstrate<00:00:37.950> it

your fingers I don't know if you can see
it<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.149> camera<00:00:54.180> very<00:00:54.750> well<00:00:57.350> but<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.410> can

it will flash twice and it'll clear it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:20.510 
it will flash twice and it'll clear it
through<00:01:13.140> again<00:01:17.270> there<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.330> go<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

through again there you go you get a
nice<00:01:20.670> little<00:01:20.960> cloth<00:01:21.960> which<00:01:22.259> cleans<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.740> quite

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
nice little cloth which cleans it quite

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.700 
nice little cloth which cleans it quite
well<00:01:23.630> fingerprints<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.990> stuff<00:01:25.590> like

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
well fingerprints on it and stuff like

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:35.060 
well fingerprints on it and stuff like
that<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:27.000> seemed<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.360> get<00:01:27.479> off<00:01:27.630> quite<00:01:27.960> easy

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.120 

I've<00:01:35.550> been<00:01:35.790> using<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.590> random<00:01:37.590> designs

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
I've been using it for random designs

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.950 
I've been using it for random designs
general<00:01:38.970> draw<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.770> seems<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.040> very<00:01:41.310> well<00:01:41.960> at

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
general draw in seems to do very well at

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.950 
general draw in seems to do very well at
all<00:01:43.229> them<00:01:43.800> things<00:01:44.040> I'll<00:01:44.970> replace<00:01:45.390> paper<00:01:45.720> as

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
all them things I'll replace paper as

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.320 
all them things I'll replace paper as
well<00:01:46.220> see<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.310> you're<00:01:47.460> using<00:01:47.580> lots<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.030> sheets

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
well see if you're using lots of sheets

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.460 
well see if you're using lots of sheets
when<00:01:48.660> you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.200> raise<00:01:49.440> it<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:51.470> draw

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
when you can just to raise it and draw

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.180 
when you can just to raise it and draw
then<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:55.140> only<00:01:55.350> bad<00:01:55.470> thing<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.830> could<00:01:56.009> see

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
then the only bad thing I could see

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.469 
then the only bad thing I could see
about<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.000> need<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.270> light

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
about it is that you need to light

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.560 
about it is that you need to light
around<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.470> see<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> board<00:01:59.300> because<00:02:00.300> it

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
around you to see the board because it

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.710 
around you to see the board because it
doesn't<00:02:00.900> have<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.050> backlight<00:02:02.330> so<00:02:03.330> we<00:02:03.420> can't<00:02:03.600> use

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
doesn't have a backlight so we can't use

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.300 
doesn't have a backlight so we can't use
it<00:02:03.900> at<00:02:03.990> night<00:02:04.020> town<00:02:04.410> but<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.890> still<00:02:05.040> draw

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
it at night town but you can still draw

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.020 
it at night town but you can still draw
on<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.700> it'll<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:05.970> there<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.330> daytime

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
on it and it'll be there in the daytime

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.110 
on it and it'll be there in the daytime
but<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.270> won't<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.570> able<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.170> night

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.470 

so<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.270> got<00:02:15.390> an<00:02:15.480> 8.5<00:02:16.080> inch<00:02:16.820> LCD

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
so it's got an 8.5 inch LCD

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.030 
so it's got an 8.5 inch LCD
it's<00:02:20.480> also<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.840> pressure-sensitive<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:24.040> you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
it's also a pressure-sensitive so you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.260 
it's also a pressure-sensitive so you
can<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.460> really<00:02:25.820> late<00:02:27.550> or<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.790> could<00:02:29.000> press

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
can do it really late or you could press

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.230 
can do it really late or you could press
harder<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.260> do<00:02:31.390> add<00:02:32.390> 10<00:02:33.820> seems<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:34.970> have<00:02:35.060> lots

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
harder and do add 10 seems to have lots

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:43.060 
harder and do add 10 seems to have lots
of<00:02:35.360> pressured<00:02:35.840> levels<00:02:41.590> then<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:42.830> clear

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
of pressured levels then you just clear

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.400 
of pressured levels then you just clear
it<00:02:43.100> again<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:46.550> highly<00:02:47.480> recommend<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.140> for

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
it again and highly recommend this for

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.130 
it again and highly recommend this for
them<00:02:49.400> evil<00:02:49.820> geniuses<00:02:50.390> out<00:02:50.450> there<00:02:50.750> were<00:02:50.930> always

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140
