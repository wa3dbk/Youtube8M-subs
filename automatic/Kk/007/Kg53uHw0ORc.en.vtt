00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
thought was an orchid virus but the

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.699 
thought was an orchid virus but the
experience<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.180> have<00:02:53.450> with<00:02:53.480> orchid<00:02:54.019> viruses<00:02:54.560> so

experience I have with orchid viruses so

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.259 
experience I have with orchid viruses so
I<00:02:54.859> had<00:02:55.069> one<00:02:55.099> once<00:02:56.090> before<00:02:56.420> on<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.409> cat<00:02:57.799> layer<00:02:58.269> and

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
I had one once before on a cat layer and

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.589 
I had one once before on a cat layer and
it<00:02:59.510> didn't<00:02:59.780> manifest<00:03:00.079> like<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:00.769> at<00:03:00.920> all<00:03:01.599> what

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
it didn't manifest like this at all what

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.380 
it didn't manifest like this at all what
happened<00:03:03.019> was<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.769> cataleya<00:03:04.579> was<00:03:04.849> reluctant

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
happened was the cataleya was reluctant

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.479 
happened was the cataleya was reluctant
to<00:03:05.450> flower<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:08.440> when<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.590> did<00:03:09.799> put<00:03:10.069> up<00:03:10.220> new

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
to flower and when it did put up new

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.690 
to flower and when it did put up new
suitable<00:03:11.120> new<00:03:11.510> growths<00:03:12.459> sometimes<00:03:13.459> they

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
suitable new growths sometimes they

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.319 
suitable new growths sometimes they
would<00:03:13.879> wither<00:03:14.299> and<00:03:14.629> die<00:03:15.290> away<00:03:15.970> now<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.000> was

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
would wither and die away now I was

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.360 
would wither and die away now I was
fairly<00:03:17.569> new<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.169> orchid<00:03:18.530> growing<00:03:18.769> at<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.069> time

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
fairly new to orchid growing at the time

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.059 
fairly new to orchid growing at the time
so<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:20.090> didn't<00:03:20.599> analyze<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:21.319> properly<00:03:21.349> I<00:03:21.709> didn't

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
so I didn't analyze it properly I didn't

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.420 
so I didn't analyze it properly I didn't
you<00:03:22.639> know<00:03:22.760> think<00:03:23.120> about<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.389> properly<00:03:23.750> I

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
you know think about it properly I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.069 
you know think about it properly I
didn't<00:03:25.430> realize<00:03:25.819> you<00:03:26.359> know<00:03:26.480> there<00:03:26.690> was<00:03:26.810> really

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
didn't realize you know there was really

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.800 
didn't realize you know there was really
an<00:03:27.290> issue<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:28.269> eventually<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.299> got<00:03:29.569> that

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
an issue and eventually I got that

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.199 
an issue and eventually I got that
orchid<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.379> flower<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.980> when<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:31.639> flowered

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
orchid to flower and when it flowered

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.379 
orchid to flower and when it flowered
then<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.910> was<00:03:35.349> obvious<00:03:36.349> that<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.639> had<00:03:37.849> a<00:03:37.879> virus

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
then it was obvious that it had a virus

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.289 
then it was obvious that it had a virus
because<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:39.290> sepals<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:40.129> wilted<00:03:41.090> very

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
because the sepals and wilted very

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.330 
because the sepals and wilted very
quickly<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:42.230> also<00:03:42.739> there<00:03:42.919> were<00:03:43.040> kind<00:03:43.220> of

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
quickly and also there were kind of

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.189 
quickly and also there were kind of
streaks<00:03:43.819> on<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.209> flowers<00:03:44.629> I<00:03:44.810> wish<00:03:44.989> I<00:03:45.049> had<00:03:45.169> a

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
streaks on the flowers I wish I had a

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:55.260 
streaks on the flowers I wish I had a
photograph<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.949> show<00:03:45.980> you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.580 

and<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:58.450> flower<00:03:58.690> is<00:03:58.840> faded<00:03:59.260> really

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
and and the flower is faded really

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.700 
and and the flower is faded really
really<00:03:59.830> quickly<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:01.480> knew<00:04:02.020> it<00:04:02.110> was<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.260> virus

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
really quickly and I knew it was a virus

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.150 
really quickly and I knew it was a virus
and<00:04:02.920> I<00:04:02.950> disposed<00:04:03.370> at<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.700> plant<00:04:04.680> but<00:04:05.680> this<00:04:05.920> is

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
and I disposed at the plant but this is

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.970 
and I disposed at the plant but this is
nothing<00:04:06.550> like<00:04:06.730> that<00:04:07.240> other<00:04:07.450> issue<00:04:08.380> as<00:04:08.740> well

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
nothing like that other issue as well

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.220 
nothing like that other issue as well
that<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:10.180> don't<00:04:10.240> know<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.450> sprung<00:04:14.020> up

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
that I don't know and that it sprung up

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.790 
that I don't know and that it sprung up
in<00:04:14.530> from<00:04:15.520> a<00:04:15.550> healthy<00:04:16.060> plant<00:04:16.620> looking<00:04:17.620> like

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:17.800 
in from a healthy plant looking like

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.130 
in from a healthy plant looking like
this<00:04:17.980> in<00:04:18.220> five<00:04:18.489> days<00:04:18.820> now<00:04:19.390> it<00:04:19.690> might<00:04:19.840> not<00:04:19.900> be<00:04:20.110> a

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
this in five days now it might not be a

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.050 
this in five days now it might not be a
virus<00:04:20.590> it<00:04:20.770> could<00:04:20.890> be<00:04:21.100> some<00:04:21.670> people<00:04:21.970> were

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
virus it could be some people were

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.870 
virus it could be some people were
suggesting<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.780> bacterial<00:04:23.770> rot<00:04:24.070> of<00:04:24.340> some<00:04:24.550> sort

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
suggesting a bacterial rot of some sort

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.060 
suggesting a bacterial rot of some sort
but<00:04:25.630> nothing<00:04:25.990> has<00:04:26.110> happened<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.590> this<00:04:26.740> plant

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
but nothing has happened to this plant

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.230 
but nothing has happened to this plant
nothing<00:04:27.580> different<00:04:28.200> so<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.230> like<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.250> well<00:04:30.970> I

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
nothing different so I like I well I

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.850 
nothing different so I like I well I
mean<00:04:31.390> whatever<00:04:31.690> happened<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:32.350> us<00:04:32.500> it<00:04:32.650> came

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
mean whatever happened to us it came

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.900 
mean whatever happened to us it came
from<00:04:33.100> somewhere<00:04:33.580> but<00:04:33.730> I've<00:04:33.880> no<00:04:34.390> idea<00:04:34.420> where<00:04:35.910> so

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
from somewhere but I've no idea where so

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.700 
from somewhere but I've no idea where so
some<00:04:37.330> people<00:04:37.450> said<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.840> me<00:04:37.960> what<00:04:38.200> I<00:04:38.230> could<00:04:38.500> do

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
some people said to me what I could do

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.590 
some people said to me what I could do
is<00:04:38.890> like<00:04:39.100> cut<00:04:39.490> off<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:39.910> affected<00:04:40.390> leaves

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
is like cut off the affected leaves

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.600 
is like cut off the affected leaves
certainly<00:04:41.410> I<00:04:41.440> don't<00:04:41.680> want<00:04:42.070> them<00:04:42.250> anywhere

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
certainly I don't want them anywhere

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.460 
certainly I don't want them anywhere
near<00:04:42.760> my<00:04:43.150> other<00:04:43.300> clans<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.870> don't<00:04:44.050> even<00:04:44.200> want

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
near my other clans I don't even want

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.080 
near my other clans I don't even want
them<00:04:44.560> and<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.770> sit<00:04:45.010> this<00:04:45.280> plant<00:04:45.640> in<00:04:45.790> the<00:04:45.880> same

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
them and to sit this plant in the same

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.320 
them and to sit this plant in the same
room<00:04:46.450> with<00:04:46.720> them<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:48.070> new<00:04:48.460> growths<00:04:48.790> they<00:04:49.090> seem

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
room with them the new growths they seem

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.180 
room with them the new growths they seem
fairly<00:04:49.690> okay<00:04:50.170> I<00:04:50.200> mean<00:04:50.410> there<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.710> you<00:04:51.070> know

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
fairly okay I mean there it you know

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.100 
fairly okay I mean there it you know
they're<00:04:51.400> not<00:04:51.580> very<00:04:51.760> strong<00:04:52.270> they<00:04:52.660> just<00:04:52.900> seem<00:04:53.080> a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
they're not very strong they just seem a

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.860 
they're not very strong they just seem a
bit<00:04:53.350> weak<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:53.890> that<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:55.030> I<00:04:55.330> said<00:04:55.510> I<00:04:55.570> could

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
bit weak and that and I said I could

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.190 
bit weak and that and I said I could
actually<00:04:56.050> cut<00:04:56.440> off<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.650> old<00:04:56.890> leaves<00:04:57.250> or

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
actually cut off the old leaves or

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.040 
actually cut off the old leaves or
something<00:04:59.200> like<00:04:59.530> that<00:04:59.740> but<00:05:00.460> I<00:05:00.790> don't<00:05:01.660> want<00:05:01.870> to

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
something like that but I don't want to

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.960 
something like that but I don't want to
I<00:05:02.200> think<00:05:02.320> I'm<00:05:02.740> just<00:05:02.890> going<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.280> dispose<00:05:03.910> of

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
I think I'm just going to dispose of

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.840 
I think I'm just going to dispose of
this<00:05:04.330> plant<00:05:04.680> it's<00:05:05.680> just<00:05:05.890> too<00:05:06.130> scary<00:05:06.340> what's

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
this plant it's just too scary what's

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.730 
this plant it's just too scary what's
happened<00:05:07.240> to<00:05:07.390> it<00:05:07.420> and<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.960> danger<00:05:08.440> of<00:05:08.470> us

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
happened to it and the danger of us

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.570 
happened to it and the danger of us
infecting<00:05:09.460> something<00:05:09.850> else<00:05:10.030> is<00:05:10.270> just

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
infecting something else is just

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.550
