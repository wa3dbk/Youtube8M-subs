00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
when I did that it acted like he was

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:36.230 
when I did that it acted like he was
going<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.610> load<00:02:26.820> oh<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:35.070> know<00:02:35.340> what<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.820> can<00:02:36.090> do

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
going to load oh you know what it can do

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.030 
going to load oh you know what it can do
that<00:02:37.670> it's<00:02:38.670> going<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.940> let<00:02:39.060> me<00:02:39.180> do<00:02:39.330> that

that it's going to let me do that

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.830 
that it's going to let me do that
because<00:02:41.040> i<00:02:41.250> already<00:02:41.430> changed<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.420> anyway

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
blurry but it says hardware class it's

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.949 
blurry but it says hardware class it's
going<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.489> say<00:03:48.579> zero<00:03:48.909> you're<00:03:49.599> going<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.780> change

exit out of here exit out of this one as

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.099 
exit out of here exit out of this one as
well<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:13.239> then<00:04:13.480> you're<00:04:13.629> going<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.780> double

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
pretty I mean it's pretty laggy I don't

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.960 
pretty I mean it's pretty laggy I don't
know<00:04:47.280> if<00:04:47.340> there's<00:04:47.490> anybody<00:04:47.700> else<00:04:48.030> out<00:04:48.210> there

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
know if there's anybody else out there

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.370 
know if there's anybody else out there
that's<00:04:50.970> done<00:04:51.240> this<00:04:51.480> and<00:04:51.750> if<00:04:51.900> they've<00:04:52.050> gotten
