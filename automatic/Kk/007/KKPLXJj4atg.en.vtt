00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.059
 the truth a great game was that we saw 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.190
 on the worlds screen in the day 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.280
 14 midweek the manchester 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.900
 united in old trafford could not face the 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.119
 everton a historic triumph manolo 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.360
 because the toffees did not win in that 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.520
 1992 scenario a very good match 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.010
 of which we had back and forth and the 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.410
 goalies were phenomenal taking out 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.710
 some plays that seemed already goals and 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.500
 good at the end a great goal of the tico for 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.359
 go to the front and after twenty-something 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.940
 years break this hegemony by one 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.260
 thinks that everton came to defend himself 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.389
 but I think he did a job really 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.249
 excellent in all its lines with 

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:45.319
 unfold appealing to the counter but 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.539
 also balancing a match where 

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:49.460
 tried it is clear to be a protagonist in 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.139
 the first 20 or 25 the local team is 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.269
 a team that knows very well what 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:55.069
 plays defends very well with 89 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.079
 players leaving only luca with 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:59.600
 the front but apart from defending 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.819
 very well you say it to me unfolds with 56 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.499
 to attack a very well-worked team 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.750
 big figures to the two goalkeepers 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.850
 because both david de gea in two or three 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.680
 a couple of them are stopped 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.479
 the Catalan player who entered the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.460
 second time and not to mention the 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.500
 American Tim Howard who had 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.600
 quietly three goal plays that 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.130
 he shuffled very well and they ran with something 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.960
 lucky because the first one makes a great 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.360
 saved a shot of brad head and 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.920
 then hit that post on the post 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.840
 that would have been 1-0 of the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.549
 manchester united but then it gave 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.049
 back and it goes with a great victory the 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.180
 everton team and what life and the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.619
 football and the chances of 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.720
 moments that you have to take advantage of because 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.280
 bryan oviedo the tico player who is the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.509
 that marks the goal that came to mark him 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.429
 the stoke city ​​that has played three 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.840
 matches and has scored two goals is 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.850
 being a starter because he's replacing 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.649
 to the left sideline holder that is 20 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.630
 who is injured in the dry dock and 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.310
 It really has not been out of tune at all 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.869
 of the left lateral tico and that's what 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.520
 try football you are waiting 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.590
 always an opportunity you are working 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.060
 every week they gave it to the tico and 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.369
 he takes full advantage now to see who 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.630
 he takes it out of there join victory of the
