the reason we're replacing these is when

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.799 
the reason we're replacing these is when
to<00:00:14.580> start<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.910> car<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.240> all<00:00:15.330> he<00:00:15.420> got<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.599> that

click<00:00:16.139> like<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> dead<00:00:16.830> battery<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.369> knew<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
click like a dead battery we knew the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.550 
click like a dead battery we knew the
battery<00:00:17.850> was<00:00:18.029> good<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.230> want<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.470> go

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
battery was good so we want to go

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.529 
battery was good so we want to go
tighten<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> positive<00:00:20.400> lead<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.359> I'm

tighten the positive lead here and I'm

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.290 
tighten the positive lead here and I'm
doing<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.260> bolt<00:00:22.859> or<00:00:23.160> screw<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.760> rusted<00:00:24.210> in

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
doing so the bolt or screw is rusted in

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.029 
doing so the bolt or screw is rusted in
there<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.689> actually<00:00:24.990> turned<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.650> piece<00:00:25.859> of

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
there and actually turned the piece of

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.950 
there and actually turned the piece of
the<00:00:26.310> terminal<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.849> broke<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> off<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.869> we're

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
the terminal and broke it off so we're

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.269 
the terminal and broke it off so we're
going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.109> replace<00:00:28.349> both<00:00:28.560> ends<00:00:28.859> on<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.099> car

terminals on top or a side post with the
terminals<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> side<00:00:37.200> they<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.250> make

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
terminals on the side they do make

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.950 
terminals on the side they do make
batteries<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:38.969> both<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.690> need<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
batteries that have both so you need to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.530

kind of ends you need or terminal ends
now<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.160> car<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.550> an<00:00:50.610> older<00:00:50.850> car<00:00:51.059> where

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
now for this car it's an older car where

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240 
now for this car it's an older car where
these<00:00:51.600> wires<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.260> molded<00:00:52.620> into<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.949> clamp

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
these wires are molded into this clamp

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.290 
these wires are molded into this clamp
so<00:00:53.430> we're<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> need<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> cut<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.239> off

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
so we're going to need to cut that off

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
so we're going to need to cut that off
so<00:00:55.170> we're<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> go<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.770> style

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
so we're going to go with this style

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.580 
so we're going to go with this style
clamp<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:57.149> wire<00:00:57.690> will<00:00:57.870> go<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.350> we'll

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
clamp that wire will go in here we'll

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.959 
clamp that wire will go in here we'll
tighten<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:58.920> two<00:00:59.160> screws<00:00:59.460> it'll<00:00:59.760> hold<00:00:59.879> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
on to working on the positive so we'll

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.500 
on to working on the positive so we'll
do<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.470> same<00:02:50.500> thing<00:02:50.680> on<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.040> positive<00:02:51.459> side

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
do the same thing on the positive side

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.550 
do the same thing on the positive side
we'll<00:02:52.510> go<00:02:52.630> ahead<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:52.780> remove<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.170> electrical
