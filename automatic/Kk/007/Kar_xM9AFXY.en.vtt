00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.100
 like many game heroes 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.359
 video and comics men have 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.460
 long dreamed of traveling to great 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.679
 speed the famous we not the corners of the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.820
 blood but all speed records 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.469
 if we are sure we can go again 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.969
 the faster the better would be the speed 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.719
 maximum is surreal 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.719
 the speed of light 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.110
 it's a classic convention of the kind 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.120
 to justify a narration gameplay 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.530
 flesh out a character some 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.860
 movements are made at the speed of 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.420
 light 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.730
 the spirit of light as they say 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.379
 in addition to the handle the head the light 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.420
 represents the speed of the amade 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.950
 photons that characterizes the plasma him 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.620
 minutes in the vacuum 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.080
 we prefer to speak here of celerity and not 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.100
 speed the speed applies to 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.990
 something tangible 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.370
 while the cries more cries over 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.220
 precisely the speed of propagation 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.600
 of a wave in a vacuum 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.880
 precisely who notes thousands of 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.220
 references the light reaches 3 10 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.400
 power 8 meters per second 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.180
 three hundred thousand kilometers per second 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.040
 with such speed 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.260
 we could join the moon in one 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.060
 comma 21 a second taking into account 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.579
 the middle changes 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.470
 indeed every material medium to a 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.630
 very specific light celerity 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.250
 this shift is due to 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.829
 shock between bright lons and the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.850
 molecules that make up the matter the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.670
 light and therefore brake 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.679
 that's why to calculate the speed 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.509
 of light in a given medium one 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.610
 use this formula we introduce the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.130
 brake coefficient of the called medium 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.909
 here refractive index of the medium 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.020
 transparent so the place most 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.450
 simple to go to the speed of the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.619
 light remains space though the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.110
 light etc be faster it's where 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.509
 if we go faster if we look at the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.619
 different speed records on earth 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.399
 we reach 495 points 5 km hour 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.759
 137 meters per second in the air 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.190
 11000 144 kilometers per hour or 3000 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.769
 95 meters per second while in 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.560
 space the probe helios 2a reaches 252 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.290
 1792 km hour is 70 thousand two hundred 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.640
 twenty meters per second 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.390
 it's huge but the speed of the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.190
 light and 4270 times larger than the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.680
 speed of the fastest object 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.720
 made by hand be careful not to 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.790
 confuse speed of light and years 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.650
 light a year light is a 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.739
 distance that travels through the light during 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.859
 a terrestrial year that is to say 9 10 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.810
 power 15 m for comparison the 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.859
 distance between the sun and neptune that 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.190
 the last planet in our system 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.799
 solar is about 4.5 10 power 12 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.700
 m one is on a distance of 1000 times 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.290
 longer in the parties the principle 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.400
 that space would be the best place 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.870
 to reach the light 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.090
 but can we explain such a big 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.010
 difference on earth or in 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.359
 the atmosphere there is air that is a 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.670
 set of molecules more or less 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.380
 heavy according to the altitude 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.239
 this density of molecules will cause 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.850
 shocks on our moving surface 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.100
 this multitude of shock will cause a 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.470
 energy dissipation mainly 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.359
 in thermal form our surface so 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.609
 no problem, except that in 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.130
 the air there is oxygen and that will act 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.109
 as oxidant from a certain 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.299
 temperature our surface catches fire 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.799
 this is particularly the case for most 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.849
 meteorites that arrive on earth and 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.879
 they do not go to the speed of the 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.879
 light 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.610
 in space the problem arises 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.590
 differently the emptiness is not 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.300
 exactly empty there are small 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.890
 particles called photons that are going 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.560
 come to shock us on our racing car 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.390
 this being no competitor so no 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.530
 fire the problem of fire does arise 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.000
 not however the shock of photons and 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.230
 so the slowdown is 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 proportional to our speed 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.209
 that is, the faster you go 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.860
 it's raining so it stops you 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.110
 will have to provide energy to push from 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.549
 more and more important to win the 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.410
 last meters per second needed 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.450
 reaches the speed of light 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.580
 the energy to be developed would be infinite 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.479
 such energy could bring back 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.889
 cause the coherence of the entire universe the 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.290
 speed of light in the vacuum is 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.540
 a speed limit no particle 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.550
 hardware can not go faster in 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.990
 mines and transparent speed 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.320
 the light takes a lower speed 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.180
 to the severity of light when the 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.410
 sufficiently material particles 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.110
 energetic that go a speed 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.340
 important change of environment 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.930
 can then spread with 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.729
 speeds above the limit speed 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.460
 of their new environment while staying 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.120
 less than haste 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.630
 So they have speed 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.340
 supraluminic then they emit a 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.110
 blue light by a similar process 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.740
 supersonic aircraft emitting 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.910
 soundtrack 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.350
 it's the Cherenkov effect it's especially 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.330
 were made which causes the limit 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.700
 and blue of the water surrounding the heart of a 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.320
 nuclear reactor 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.630
 with the speed of light we lose the 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.620
 absolute character of classic tones and 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.720
 many ideas such as 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.240
 the invariance of a time interval where 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.570
 the notion of simultaneity must be 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.669
 thoughts an interesting paradox on 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.710
 this loss of landmarks and the paradox 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.889
 twins langevin who can get 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.630
 pretty easily summarize two twins getting 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.950
 say goodbye on the tarmac 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.599
 the eldest and flies to perform the 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.430
 turn of our solar system to a 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.610
 high speed close to haste the 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.870
 light the younger will follow his epic the 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.419
 feet firmly anchored on the good old 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.729
 earth at the end of the story well of 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.900
 years later back to earth 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.940
 the eldest will be younger than his twin in 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.590
 effect the time repository will not have 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.000
 changed for each of them they 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.539
 will have lived like you and me time 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.440
 flowing 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.990
 the difference is just 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.910
 in the origin of this repository for the 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.560
 earthly time flows with the earth 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.750
 as a center while for our 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.560
 traveler his speed is telling the telly duration 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.640
 and creates this paradox 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.230
 what must be understood is that the 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.210
 speed of light can not be reached 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.040
 but we can tend to it indeed 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.870
 the faster our speed approaches the 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.390
 celerity of light plus energy 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.010
 to accelerate is important we touch 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.110
 then at the limit of our model 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.540
 physical and our understanding 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.820
 current of the universe indeed it 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.750
 there is no 100% safe model that 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.170
 would allow us to detail is 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.150
 exactly the speed of light 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.230
 however it has been shown here that the 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.150
 speed of light can only be 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.690
 reach by any means whatsoever and 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.670
 fortunately 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.900
 the energy released by a displacement of 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.550
 the kind could destroy the universe 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.920
 whole 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.520
 so it's a good thing anyway 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.520
 finally I guess
