00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
leafy green vegetable so you have to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.030 
leafy green vegetable so you have to
take<00:00:35.399> those<00:00:35.550> things<00:00:35.760> into<00:00:35.910> consideration<00:00:37.040> for

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
take those things into consideration for

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
take those things into consideration for
my<00:00:38.129> purple<00:00:38.520> carrot<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> cut<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.780> on

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
my purple carrot I'm going to cut it on

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.260 
my purple carrot I'm going to cut it on
the<00:00:40.200> diagonal<00:00:41.129> first<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.879> then<00:00:42.000> I'm<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.210> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the diagonal first and then I'm going to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.080 
the diagonal first and then I'm going to
make<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.570> into<00:00:42.840> matchsticks<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> cut

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
make it into matchsticks so you cut

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.979 
make it into matchsticks so you cut
along<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.390> diagonal<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:47.719> then<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.809> make<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
along the diagonal and then you make a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.150 
along the diagonal and then you make a
little<00:00:49.289> stack<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:52.110> go<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.980> that's

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
little stack you go like this so that's

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.680 
little stack you go like this so that's
how<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> match<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:56.640> see<00:00:57.059> how<00:00:57.180> beautiful

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
how you do a match and see how beautiful

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.430 
how you do a match and see how beautiful
this<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> look<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.660> secondly<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
this is going to look and secondly the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.789 
this is going to look and secondly the
other<00:01:01.710> important<00:01:02.250> thing<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.359> timing<00:01:03.799> when

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
other important thing is the timing when

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.859 
other important thing is the timing when
do<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.129> put<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> vegetable<00:01:06.090> into<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> water

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
do you put the vegetable into the water

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.230 
do you put the vegetable into the water
to<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> oil<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.770> you're<00:01:07.920> sautéing<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.610> what

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
to the oil that you're sautéing in what

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.880 
to the oil that you're sautéing in what
order<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:09.930> go<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.860> think

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
order do they go in you have to think

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.380 
order do they go in you have to think
okay<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:13.020> using<00:01:13.290> broccoli<00:01:14.180> this<00:01:15.180> is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
okay if I'm using broccoli this is

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.420 
okay if I'm using broccoli this is
pretty<00:01:15.780> water<00:01:16.110> dense<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.830> doesn't<00:01:17.130> take<00:01:17.280> very

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
pretty water dense and doesn't take very

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.859 
pretty water dense and doesn't take very
long<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.700> cook<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.299> I'm<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> want<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.720> add

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
long to cook so I'm going to want to add

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.630 
long to cook so I'm going to want to add
this<00:01:19.110> last<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:20.549> I'm<00:01:20.729> using<00:01:20.909> say<00:01:21.799> carrot<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
this last if I'm using say carrot it's a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.280 
this last if I'm using say carrot it's a
root<00:01:23.820> vegetable<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> little<00:01:24.720> bit<00:01:24.900> harder

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
root vegetable it's a little bit harder

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.080 
root vegetable it's a little bit harder
so<00:01:26.040> you're<00:01:26.250> probably<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> need<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.880> add

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
so you're probably going to need to add

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.440 
so you're probably going to need to add
this<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.470> beginning<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> there's<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
this in at the beginning so there's a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.200 
this in at the beginning so there's a
number<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.140> ways<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> stir-fry<00:01:32.220> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
number of ways you can do a stir-fry you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.270 
number of ways you can do a stir-fry you
can<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.780> oil<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.159> in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
can do it in oil or you can do it in

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.990 
can do it in oil or you can do it in
water<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.909> broth<00:01:36.950> either<00:01:37.950> way<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.369> fine<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
water or broth either way is fine it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.179 
water or broth either way is fine it
depends<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.079> weather<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.040> it's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
depends on the weather like if it's

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.940 
depends on the weather like if it's
getting<00:01:41.490> warm<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.509> good<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.079> water<00:01:43.380> saute

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
getting warm it's good to do water saute

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770 
getting warm it's good to do water saute
instead<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.640> oil<00:01:44.790> saute<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.390> want<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.750> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
instead of oil saute you want to have a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.710 
instead of oil saute you want to have a
skillet<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> lid<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.820> lid<00:01:47.850> when<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.540> put

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
skillet with a lid the lid when you put

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.090 
skillet with a lid the lid when you put
it<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:48.960> helps<00:01:49.380> uh<00:01:49.439> sort<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.710> steam<00:01:50.070> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
it on it helps uh sort of steam and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.370

going<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.020> wait<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.469> starts<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> sizzle

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
going to wait to this starts to sizzle

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.400

so as you can see it's starting to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.229 
so as you can see it's starting to
sizzle<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.280> when<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.489> go<00:02:11.849> ahead<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.090> add
