00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
if you live in New York City chances are

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.990 
if you live in New York City chances are
you<00:00:03.510> have<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.720> steam<00:00:04.080> radiator<00:00:04.670> many<00:00:05.670> people

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
you have a steam radiator many people

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.240 
you have a steam radiator many people
complain<00:00:06.390> about<00:00:06.420> their<00:00:07.410> radiators<00:00:07.950> they<00:00:08.160> are

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
complain about their radiators they are

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.499 
complain about their radiators they are
noisy<00:00:08.639> they<00:00:08.940> leak<00:00:09.620> but<00:00:10.620> truth<00:00:11.010> be<00:00:11.040> told<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.759> lot

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
noisy they leak but truth be told a lot

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.150 
noisy they leak but truth be told a lot
of<00:00:12.599> these<00:00:12.750> things<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.620> can<00:00:13.799> solve<00:00:14.040> it

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
of these things you can solve it

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.820 
of these things you can solve it
yourself<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:15.480> let's<00:00:15.660> take<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> look<00:00:16.080> at<00:00:16.560> what

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
yourself so let's take a look at what

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.849 
yourself so let's take a look at what
you<00:00:16.949> can<00:00:17.100> do<00:00:17.220> your<00:00:17.880> steam<00:00:18.330> radiator<00:00:18.680> may<00:00:19.680> look

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
you can do your steam radiator may look

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.010 
you can do your steam radiator may look
like<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.460> one<00:00:20.670> now<00:00:21.240> right<00:00:21.510> there<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
like this one now right there on the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.859 
like this one now right there on the
side<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.590> will<00:00:22.740> notice<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.730> air<00:00:24.060> vent<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
side you will notice the air vent the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.980 
side you will notice the air vent the
function<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> air<00:00:25.680> vent<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.189> quite<00:00:26.490> simple

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
function of the air vent is quite simple

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.710 
function of the air vent is quite simple
once<00:00:27.990> your<00:00:28.289> boyer<00:00:28.740> sends<00:00:29.220> steam<00:00:29.490> up<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
once your boyer sends steam up to the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.650 
once your boyer sends steam up to the
radiator<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:32.070> air<00:00:32.279> vent<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.820> going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.420> let

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
radiator the air vent is going to let

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.069 
radiator the air vent is going to let
the<00:00:34.380> cold<00:00:34.680> air<00:00:34.950> escape<00:00:35.850> from<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.660> radiator

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the cold air escape from the radiator

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.950 
the cold air escape from the radiator
and<00:00:37.350> once<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.430> radiator<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.910> hot<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.930> air

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and once the radiator is hot the air

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.220 
and once the radiator is hot the air
vent<00:00:40.469> will<00:00:40.680> shut<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.219> then<00:00:41.489> keep<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.719> hot<00:00:42.960> air

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
vent will shut and then keep the hot air

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.330 
vent will shut and then keep the hot air
inside<00:00:43.969> one<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> problem<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.840> may<00:00:45.960> have

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
inside one of the problem you may have

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.260 
inside one of the problem you may have
with<00:00:47.340> an<00:00:47.700> event<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.940> never

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
with an event like this is that it never

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.110 
with an event like this is that it never
shuts<00:00:51.600> down<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.289> therefore<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.579> letting

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
shuts down and therefore it's letting

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.900 
shuts down and therefore it's letting
air<00:00:54.449> constantly<00:00:55.440> escape<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.489> reason<00:00:56.789> for

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
air constantly escape the reason for

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.990 
air constantly escape the reason for
that<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.710> air<00:00:58.829> vent<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> clogged<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that is that the air vent is clogged and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.119 
that is that the air vent is clogged and
all<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.840> do<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.500> remove<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> air

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
all you have to do to remove the air

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.179 
all you have to do to remove the air
vent<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.239> twist<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.339> then<00:01:07.010> you<00:01:08.010> can

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
vent is to twist it and then you can

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.149 
vent is to twist it and then you can
remove<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:10.979> you're

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
remove it just like this if what you're

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.090 
remove it just like this if what you're
fixing<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> leak<00:01:12.330> over<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> oven

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
fixing is a leak over here and the oven

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.820 
fixing is a leak over here and the oven
is<00:01:14.280> good<00:01:14.549> then<00:01:15.450> all<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.780> need<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.619> little

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
is good then all you need is a little

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.010 
is good then all you need is a little
bit<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.280> teflon<00:01:18.030> tape<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.479> what<00:01:18.720> we're<00:01:18.869> going

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
bit of teflon tape and what we're going

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.440 
bit of teflon tape and what we're going
to<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> put<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> tape<00:01:20.009> around<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.030> thread

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
to do is put the tape around the thread

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.410 
to do is put the tape around the thread
of<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.530> event<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.159> we'll<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.700> put<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
of the event and we'll just put the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.740 
of the event and we'll just put the
event<00:01:24.840> back<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:27.119> seen<00:01:27.390> many

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
event back in here I have seen many

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.819 
event back in here I have seen many
events<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:29.369> radiators<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.540> no<00:01:30.930> teflon<00:01:31.619> tape

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
events on radiators with no teflon tape

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.010 
events on radiators with no teflon tape
and<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.549> explains<00:01:32.939> why<00:01:33.090> sometimes<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.840> have

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and that explains why sometimes you have

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.679 
and that explains why sometimes you have
water<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.650> along<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.549> side<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:35.939> now<00:01:36.119> let's

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
water going along the side so now let's

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.310 
water going along the side so now let's
put<00:01:36.930> some<00:01:37.229> teflon<00:01:37.560> tape<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.479> thread<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
put some teflon tape on the thread of

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.130 
put some teflon tape on the thread of
this<00:01:40.530> air<00:01:40.829> vent<00:01:41.210> now<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.270> trick<00:01:42.630> when<00:01:43.049> you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
this air vent now the trick when you

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.080 
this air vent now the trick when you
give<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.759> wrap<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.810> teflon<00:01:46.259> tape

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
give this is to wrap the teflon tape

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.730 
give this is to wrap the teflon tape
clockwise<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.840> face<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.009> thread<00:01:50.880> right

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
clockwise when you face the thread right

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:06.430 
clockwise when you face the thread right
so<00:01:52.740> let's<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:53.340> ahead<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.130> here

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.550 

right

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.580 

you<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.310> go<00:02:11.459> for<00:02:11.730> two<00:02:12.599> three<00:02:14.360> letters<00:02:15.590> and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
you just go for two three letters and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.150 
you just go for two three letters and
here<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.310> go<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:18.510> right<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.989> I'll<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:19.830> put<00:02:20.069> it

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
here we go all right so I'll just put it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:28.820 
here we go all right so I'll just put it
back<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:25.190> go<00:02:26.190> for<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.550> few<00:02:26.790> rotations<00:02:27.830> see

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
back in just go for a few rotations see

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.160 
back in just go for a few rotations see
how<00:02:28.980> far<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.489> go<00:02:32.690> all<00:02:33.690> right<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:33.989> nice

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
how far you can go all right it's nice
