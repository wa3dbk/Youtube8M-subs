 lengthening the rate of fertility is 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.360
 going down and this is going to bring problems 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.370
 in Europe, women are 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.500
 having fewer and fewer children and the 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.830

 relevant today 5 women are 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.600
 working more and more the old role 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.450
 in which only men worked 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.310
 have changed according to ECLAC in America 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.200
 Latina 'more than 100 million women

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.720
 in their autonomy or their rights but 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.860

 to meet your needs and 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.410
 strengthen it as the basic institution 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.060
 that is still for society to
