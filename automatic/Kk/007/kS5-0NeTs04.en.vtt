00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.620
 Frankenstein degrees 7 The wounded are extensively inspected by an expert 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.419
 jury 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.029
 no, of course, well substantiated and the appearance of the dog 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.119
 dog breeders notice that there is always more than a clear split in it 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.650
 breeding this dog you should have a german shepherd 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.980
 now he sees the intruder sometimes as black or as women round 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.060
 after his wife from London that up 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.160
 the dean then touched his and the specific to the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.140
 and if you see that ross brown-black 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.420
 of those that are generally among those more bred for show muiden 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.870
 7 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.620
 That suggested researchers only focus on the beauty of the dog 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.440
 very negative development according to brussels 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.280
 then you even get what you are in fashion sometimes when you are on one but the 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.400
 show comes there are the beautiful models 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.800
 but you may sometimes wonder what is in the upper room 7 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.590
 that's how it goes with that honda actually you also see a lot 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.440
 that out of these lines the most common failure is that the dogs later become hamsters 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.210
 being or having not the right character for a year, which makes them feel like a family 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.630
 do less justice 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.070
 for some, the training remains more of a side issue 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 eventually it must be judged for breeding suitability 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.780
 then you must be surprised with it so it's a show and exits 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.020
 with me comes first so yes of course everyone wants to be first 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.080
 if you only have the 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.140
 yes, most people go for it, but what I find important is 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.030
 that you are heading in the direction of yes when your first performance is and you are walking very well 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.030
 direction well then that is nice daf on you of course too 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.560
 the for preferences is then often the hardest reason to avoid the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.080
 The popularity of a shepherd dog as a pet depends on others 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.150
 factors 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.280
 yes you see that as soon as the third film on 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.500
 the outside of security 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.570
 well then everyone has handed out once 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.600
 we also see that in that regard, he can still ask a lot from the outside 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.099
