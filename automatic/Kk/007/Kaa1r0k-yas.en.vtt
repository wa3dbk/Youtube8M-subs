00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
man that Paul is one cool dude let's

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.100 
man that Paul is one cool dude let's
open<00:02:24.470> up<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.830> box<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.340> see<00:02:25.430> what's<00:02:25.700> inside

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
open up the box and see what's inside

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.300 
open up the box and see what's inside
you<00:02:27.110> can<00:02:27.260> see<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.440> picture<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.040> drillbit

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
you can see a picture of the drillbit

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.030 
you can see a picture of the drillbit
system<00:02:28.790> here<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.450> since<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.020> has<00:02:30.170> 82<00:02:30.620> bits

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
system here and the since it has 82 bits

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.330 
system here and the since it has 82 bits
that<00:02:31.790> range<00:02:32.120> from<00:02:32.420> 1/16<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.380> an<00:02:33.530> inch<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.830> half

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
that range from 1/16 of an inch to half

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.449 
that range from 1/16 of an inch to half
an<00:02:34.520> inch<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.959> one<00:02:35.959> sixty-fourth<00:02:36.650> increments

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
an inch in one sixty-fourth increments

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.340 
an inch in one sixty-fourth increments
so<00:02:37.850> let's<00:02:38.209> cut<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.540> open<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:39.020> see<00:02:39.200> what's

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
so let's cut it open and see what's

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:52.410 
so let's cut it open and see what's
inside<00:02:47.680> cool<00:02:49.720> check<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.840> out

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
inside cool check it out

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.420 
inside cool check it out
well<00:02:53.420> here's<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.720> plastic<00:02:54.140> case<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.709> it

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
well here's the plastic case and it

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.400 
well here's the plastic case and it
feels<00:02:55.760> pretty<00:02:56.209> heavy-duty<00:02:56.660> that's<00:02:57.230> some

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
feels pretty heavy-duty that's some

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.440 
feels pretty heavy-duty that's some
thick<00:02:57.800> stuff<00:02:57.920> right<00:02:58.220> there

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
thick stuff right there

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.510 
thick stuff right there
it's<00:02:59.959> got<00:03:00.230> stickers<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.890> here<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.280> are

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
it's got stickers on here that are

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.000 
it's got stickers on here that are
color-coded<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:03.050> tell<00:03:03.320> you<00:03:03.560> where<00:03:03.800> each

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
color-coded that tell you where each

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.850 
color-coded that tell you where each
size<00:03:04.340> drill<00:03:04.700> bit<00:03:04.730> goes<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:06.350> kind<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.680> like

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
size drill bit goes and I kind of like

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.340 
size drill bit goes and I kind of like
how<00:03:07.040> it's<00:03:07.220> tilted<00:03:07.700> forward<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:08.870> let's<00:03:08.900> take<00:03:09.320> a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
how it's tilted forward so let's take a

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.199 
how it's tilted forward so let's take a
look<00:03:09.620> at<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.920> drill<00:03:10.250> bits<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:10.700> come<00:03:10.910> with<00:03:11.060> it

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
look at the drill bits that come with it

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.720 
look at the drill bits that come with it
this<00:03:11.690> system<00:03:12.110> comes<00:03:12.380> with<00:03:12.470> multiples<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.489> each

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
this system comes with multiples of each

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.509 
this system comes with multiples of each
size<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.630> drill<00:03:14.870> bits<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:16.220> looks<00:03:16.430> like

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
size of the drill bits and it looks like

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.140 
size of the drill bits and it looks like
they<00:03:16.850> were<00:03:16.910> sealed<00:03:17.360> in<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:17.989> bag<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.970> bag

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
they were sealed in this bag but the bag

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.910 
they were sealed in this bag but the bag
broke<00:03:20.480> during<00:03:20.720> shipping<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.470> they<00:03:21.560> all<00:03:21.709> just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
broke during shipping and they all just

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.400 
broke during shipping and they all just
kind<00:03:22.100> of<00:03:22.160> spilled<00:03:22.459> out<00:03:22.610> but<00:03:23.269> luckily<00:03:23.959> they're

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
kind of spilled out but luckily they're

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.860 
kind of spilled out but luckily they're
color-coded<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.549> makes<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.940> easy<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.420> put

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
color-coded so it makes it easy to put

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.350 
color-coded so it makes it easy to put
them<00:03:27.080> into<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.620> case<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.640> let's<00:03:28.880> dump<00:03:29.150> these

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
them into the case so let's dump these

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.570 
them into the case so let's dump these
out<00:03:29.540> on<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.840> workbench<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.590> see<00:03:31.190> how<00:03:31.340> long<00:03:31.519> it

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
out on the workbench and see how long it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:04:35.960 
out on the workbench and see how long it
takes<00:03:32.000> me<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.360> get<00:03:32.480> them<00:03:32.690> into<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.110> case

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.939 

well<00:04:36.970> all<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.449> bits<00:04:37.660> are<00:04:37.840> here<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.380> even

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
well all the bits are here and even

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.200 
well all the bits are here and even
though<00:04:39.070> they<00:04:39.250> were<00:04:39.280> all<00:04:39.520> jumbled<00:04:39.940> up<00:04:40.030> together

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
though they were all jumbled up together

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.780 
though they were all jumbled up together
in<00:04:40.660> one<00:04:40.900> bag<00:04:41.139> it<00:04:41.440> was<00:04:41.650> really<00:04:41.979> quick<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.340> easy

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
in one bag it was really quick and easy

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.000 
in one bag it was really quick and easy
to<00:04:43.060> get<00:04:43.210> them<00:04:43.419> into<00:04:43.630> place<00:04:43.780> using<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.500> color

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
to get them into place using the color

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.330 
to get them into place using the color

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
you get three each of those drill bits

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.760 
you get three each of those drill bits
and<00:05:12.280> on<00:05:12.850> the<00:05:13.000> upper<00:05:13.180> two<00:05:13.510> levels<00:05:13.900> you<00:05:14.229> get<00:05:14.470> to

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
and on the upper two levels you get to

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.580 
and on the upper two levels you get to
each<00:05:15.039> of<00:05:15.400> those<00:05:15.760> drill<00:05:16.150> bits<00:05:16.389> and<00:05:16.660> having

each of those drill bits and having
these<00:05:17.740> color<00:05:18.130> coded<00:05:18.610> is<00:05:18.789> going<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.120> be<00:05:19.240> great

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
these color coded is going to be great

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.110 
these color coded is going to be great
because<00:05:19.810> it's<00:05:20.800> easy<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.310> find<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.700> size<00:05:21.910> you

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
because it's easy to find the size you

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.300 
because it's easy to find the size you
need<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.510> go<00:05:23.260> and<00:05:23.470> use<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.770> drill<00:05:23.979> bit<00:05:24.160> and

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
need and go and use the drill bit and

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.909 
need and go and use the drill bit and
then<00:05:24.789> it's<00:05:25.030> very<00:05:25.120> easy<00:05:25.539> to<00:05:25.720> return<00:05:26.380> it<00:05:26.530> to<00:05:26.560> its

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
then it's very easy to return it to its

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.120 
then it's very easy to return it to its
home<00:05:27.450> these<00:05:28.450> are<00:05:28.510> high<00:05:28.900> speed<00:05:28.960> still<00:05:29.620> split
