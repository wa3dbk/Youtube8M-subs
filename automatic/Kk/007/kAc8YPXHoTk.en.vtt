not<00:01:52.730> stir<00:01:53.150> at<00:01:53.360> this<00:01:53.510> point<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.960> don't<00:01:54.080> want<00:01:54.290> to

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
not stir at this point you don't want to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.720 
not stir at this point you don't want to
stir<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:54.620> again<00:01:54.950> assume<00:01:55.370> that<00:01:55.580> your

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
stir this again assume that your

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.360 
stir this again assume that your
flavoring<00:01:56.120> and<00:01:56.210> that's<00:01:56.360> at<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.540> very<00:01:56.720> end<00:01:57.370> and

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
flavoring and that's at the very end and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.880 
flavoring and that's at the very end and
now<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.550> usually<00:01:59.150> watch<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.390> deliver

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
now I usually watch it deliver

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.219 
now I usually watch it deliver
to<00:02:02.220> 260<00:02:03.060> degrees<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.630> which<00:02:03.810> point<00:02:04.110> we're

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
to 260 degrees at which point we're

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.530 
to 260 degrees at which point we're
going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.470> have<00:02:04.650> our<00:02:04.740> color<00:02:05.420> alright<00:02:06.420> we're
