00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
have something called Genesis which we

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.130 
have something called Genesis which we
have<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.070> list<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.430> persecuted<00:01:57.390> lots<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.960> only

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
have a list to persecuted lots of only

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.080 
have a list to persecuted lots of only
access<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:59.070> levels<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.490> yeah<00:01:59.880> you're

access the levels and yeah you're
designing<00:02:00.300> applications<00:02:00.900> one<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
designing applications one of the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.380 
designing applications one of the
application<00:02:01.710> which<00:02:01.909> head<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.000> fact<00:02:03.210> it's

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
application which head in fact it's

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.910 
application which head in fact it's
calling<00:02:03.600> me<00:02:03.720> do<00:02:03.869> ya<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.530> they've<00:02:04.650> launched

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
calling me do ya and they've launched

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950 
calling me do ya and they've launched
jeepers<00:02:05.159> operation<00:02:05.640> that's<00:02:06.270> right<00:02:06.509> that's

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
jeepers operation that's right that's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.590 
jeepers operation that's right that's
great<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.160> also<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:09.030> side<00:02:09.360> load

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
great but you can also just side load

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.050 
great but you can also just side load
from<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> internet<00:02:10.410> or<00:02:10.560> email<00:02:10.800> yeah<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.970> if

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
from the internet or email yeah so if

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.000 
from the internet or email yeah so if
