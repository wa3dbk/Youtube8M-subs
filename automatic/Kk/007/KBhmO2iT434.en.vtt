00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.450

 rehearsals and now the actor and laid out 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.520
 as full as last 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.910
 and not by chance by decision of the studio third 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.220
 witcher 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.220
 will complete the legendary game series 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.340
 You know, you drive the hero of a video game. 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
 he is closer to the athlete of his aging and 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.700
 obsolescence 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.470
 visible to all he is good at the zenith of his career 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.060
 but if not finish it at the peak of the form 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.060
 will only regret 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.610
 Warsaw studios I sit projekt red 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.540
 now really at the peak of attention 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.490
 gaming press 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.920
 wild hunt is called the most expected 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.900
 the game of the year is affected by a huge 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.850
 the popularity of the two previous parts 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.800
 commercial success allowed the studio 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.050
 develop your own ambitious 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.710
 red engine 3 graphics engine 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.030
 between realism pictures and and 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.230
 cinematic this program is often 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.720
 chooses the second 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.970
 for example the bokeh effect of art 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.550
 blur background objects peculiar 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.210
 not the human eye but camera 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.540
 optics 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.970
 and still the world of the witcher became truly 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.090
 huge and seamless new locations 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.750
 loaded on the fly will come true it's easier 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.090
 but the game you do not give the whole 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.350
 open world was painted around 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.209
 scenic canvases 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.360
 on the contrary, you are always in the center 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.150
 narratives and your main freedom in 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.050
 choosing a combat specialization sword alchemy 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.110
 or magic 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.150
 This choice does not conflict with the essence of the hero 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.670
 so it does not hurt us to tell with 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.489
 screen deep personal history 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.500
 special pride of developers 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.590
 constructor facial animation who can 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.590
 work directly with the movement scenario 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.510
 characters' lips are set right from the audio 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.150
 file with the dictatorial and filling 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.970
 some program languages ​​are understood with 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.790
 sheet directly from the text this 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.160
 extremely facilitates our work remain only 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.610
 up to work with your hands complex emotions and 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.799
 the hero comes to life to develop know-how and 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.530
 perspectives in the same animation 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.260
 obvious from igrodelov require a record 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.880
 number of localization directions game 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.370
 will be released in seven languages 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.730
 dubbing including Russian and translated 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.560
 text in 16 languages ​​and technology 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.540
 production of such that all dialogues 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.910
 must be written published in the department and 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.190
 localization many months before the release 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.530
 games so in the scenario aspect all 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.380
 we have long been put writers 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.380
 finished their work but at the staff 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.060
 composer studio work now in the very 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.790
 the height 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.500
 the idea is that the music is not easy 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.560
 changed depending on the action 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.290
 gamer but did it without breaking 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.989
 tempo and rhythm as if it were one big 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.959
 melody so musical canvas 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.540
 broken layered and for example when a player 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.360
 initiates the battle enters in advance 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.150
 the recorded chorus for this track however 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:01.350
 when the battle is over the voices subside 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.120
 we met the witcher emperor 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.710
 native Polish literary and 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.320
 virtual witches 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.750
 considered a national treasure and it is not 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.730
 just words four years ago second 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.770
 part of the game and at that time the prime minister 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.950
 country donald tusk presented a gift 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.290
 baraka obama himself true american 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.580
 president recently admitted that and 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.570
 the coffin and did not run anyone I gave 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.540
 third part 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.790
 probably george martin author of the game 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.490
 of thrones would be helpful to hear him 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.640
 review strengthen it using our story a 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.680
 would even send out a wild hunt to Hollywood 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.860
 blockbuster directors because we want 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.860
 make the game as much as possible 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.860
 cinematic
