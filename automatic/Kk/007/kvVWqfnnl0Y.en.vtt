00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
drop the SATCOM right in that area and

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.340 
drop the SATCOM right in that area and
then<00:02:22.299> we're<00:02:22.480> going<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.660> go<00:02:22.780> back<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.230> this

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
then we're going to go back to this

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.729

and move it over we're quickly and you

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.360 
and move it over we're quickly and you
should<00:02:40.810> see<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.019> second<00:02:41.590> package<00:02:41.890> floating

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
should see that second package floating

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.960 
should see that second package floating
in<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.610> ER<00:02:42.640> like<00:02:42.940> always<00:02:44.669> now<00:02:45.669> what<00:02:45.850> we're

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
going to do for this one this is quite

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.970 
going to do for this one this is quite

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
the gate we're going to put that down

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.300 
the gate we're going to put that down
and<00:03:01.930> you'll<00:03:02.050> get<00:03:02.230> thrown<00:03:02.590> out<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.099> gate

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
and you'll get thrown out of the gate

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.790 
and you'll get thrown out of the gate
and<00:03:03.550> out<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:03.940> map<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:05.019> you're<00:03:05.470> free<00:03:05.650> to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
and out of the map and you're free to

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.309 
and out of the map and you're free to
run<00:03:05.950> around<00:03:06.010> on<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.610> rear<00:03:07.019> so<00:03:08.019> it's<00:03:08.170> pretty

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
run around on the rear so it's pretty

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.050 
run around on the rear so it's pretty
cool<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> do<00:03:08.860> this<00:03:09.040> just<00:03:09.370> give<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.640> go<00:03:09.790> we

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
cool to do this just give it a go we

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.880 
cool to do this just give it a go we
only<00:03:10.090> do<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.900> private<00:03:11.170> matches<00:03:11.530> by<00:03:11.830> the

only do this in private matches by the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
way we don't do this online we don't

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.140 
way we don't do this online we don't
come<00:03:14.410> dong<00:03:14.650> doing<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.130> online<00:03:15.550> if<00:03:15.790> you

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
come dong doing this online if you

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.870 
come dong doing this online if you
wanted<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.750> then<00:03:17.049> that's<00:03:17.290> up<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.799> if<00:03:18.099> you

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
wanted to then that's up to you if you

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.539 
wanted to then that's up to you if you
feel<00:03:19.209> like<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.630> can<00:03:19.810> actually<00:03:20.190> manage<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.430> do

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
feel like you can actually manage to do

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.640 
feel like you can actually manage to do
it<00:03:21.580> then<00:03:22.569> that's<00:03:22.720> up<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.170> if<00:03:23.319> you<00:03:23.349> want<00:03:23.590> to

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
do it online but we do this in private

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.080 
do it online but we do this in private
much<00:03:25.720> it's<00:03:25.930> just<00:03:26.110> brutal<00:03:26.290> life<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.849> can

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
much it's just brutal life so you can

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.610 
much it's just brutal life so you can
actually<00:03:28.239> shoot<00:03:28.630> Chris<00:03:28.900> Gloor<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.440> kill

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
actually shoot Chris Gloor and kill

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.680 
actually shoot Chris Gloor and kill
people<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:33.459> it's<00:03:33.730> pretty<00:03:33.910> cool<00:03:34.180> this<00:03:34.420> glitch

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
people so it's pretty cool this glitch

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.690 
people so it's pretty cool this glitch
to<00:03:34.930> do<00:03:35.049> give<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.799> go<00:03:35.950> if<00:03:36.099> you're<00:03:36.250> not<00:03:36.280> seeing

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
to do give it a go if you're not seeing

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.350 
to do give it a go if you're not seeing
this<00:03:36.819> before<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:39.519> there<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:39.819> actually<00:03:40.120> a

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
this before and there is actually a

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.539 
this before and there is actually a
secret<00:03:40.840> room<00:03:41.019> over<00:03:41.319> there<00:03:41.590> well<00:03:41.860> see<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.160> secret

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
secret room over there well see a secret

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.509 
secret room over there well see a secret
room<00:03:42.819> it's<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.420> room<00:03:43.959> that's<00:03:44.290> not<00:03:44.519> involved

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
room it's a room that's not involved

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.370 
room it's a room that's not involved
with<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.910> muck<00:03:46.120> in<00:03:46.299> anywhere<00:03:46.690> but<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.140> can't

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
with the muck in anywhere but you can't

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.319 
with the muck in anywhere but you can't
actually<00:03:47.620> get<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.340> or<00:03:48.489> I've<00:03:48.700> certainly<00:03:49.000> not

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
actually get to it or I've certainly not

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.970 
actually get to it or I've certainly not
found<00:03:49.599> a<00:03:49.690> way<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.900> get<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.319> it<00:03:50.470> because<00:03:50.769> once

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
found a way to get to it because once

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.539 
found a way to get to it because once
you<00:03:51.099> get<00:03:51.280> close<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.819> do<00:03:52.329> just<00:03:52.599> fall<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:52.840> die

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
you get close you do just fall and die

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.840 
you get close you do just fall and die
so<00:03:54.549> it's<00:03:55.000> pretty<00:03:55.359> difficult<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:56.019> get<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.380> that

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
so it's pretty difficult to get to that

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.699 
so it's pretty difficult to get to that
so<00:03:57.850> this<00:03:58.000> time<00:03:58.269> we're<00:03:58.510> going<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.750> do<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.260> on

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
so this time we're going to do the on

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.729 
so this time we're going to do the on
top<00:04:00.130> of<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.459> building<00:04:00.880> glitch<00:04:01.319> for<00:04:02.319> this<00:04:02.500> if

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
top of the building glitch for this if
