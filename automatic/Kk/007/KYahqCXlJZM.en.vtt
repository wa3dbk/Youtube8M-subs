for<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.290> moment<00:03:02.410> if<00:03:02.830> I<00:03:03.370> pick<00:03:03.580> up<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.820> four<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:04.800> can

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
for the moment if I pick up a four I can

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.790 
for the moment if I pick up a four I can
consider<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:07.030> six<00:03:07.450> as<00:03:07.720> being<00:03:08.410> underneath

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
consider this six as being underneath

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.790 
consider this six as being underneath
the<00:03:09.220> for<00:03:09.750> now<00:03:10.750> I'm<00:03:10.900> going<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.110> six<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.500> for

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
the for now I'm going to six and for

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.510 
the for now I'm going to six and for
those<00:03:12.460> cards<00:03:12.850> add<00:03:12.970> up<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.240> 10<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:15.160> what<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.340> do<00:03:15.430> is

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
those cards add up to 10 so what I do is

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.330 
those cards add up to 10 so what I do is
I<00:03:15.700> just<00:03:15.760> take<00:03:15.910> my<00:03:16.030> for<00:03:16.480> put<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.810> on<00:03:16.930> top<00:03:17.340> those

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
I just take my for put it on top those

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.060 
I just take my for put it on top those
two<00:03:18.490> cards<00:03:18.790> are<00:03:18.880> at<00:03:18.940> n<00:03:19.350> two<00:03:20.350> cards<00:03:20.680> add<00:03:20.800> up<00:03:20.950> to

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
two cards are at n two cards add up to

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
ten one point being ok now this for is

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.850 
ten one point being ok now this for is
considered<00:03:27.310> in<00:03:27.430> my<00:03:27.610> hand<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:29.200> four<00:03:29.560> is

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
considered in my hand and the four is

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.270 
considered in my hand and the four is
kind<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.880> between<00:03:31.540> each<00:03:31.990> of<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.350> cards<00:03:32.650> if<00:03:33.010> my

hand were this for example I could score

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.220 
hand were this for example I could score
a<00:03:36.370> combination<00:03:37.210> and<00:03:37.390> consider<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.870> four<00:03:38.140> at

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
a combination and consider the four at

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.350 
a combination and consider the four at
the<00:03:38.320> bottom<00:03:38.590> here<00:03:38.860> or<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.370> combination<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:40.120> for

the bottom here or a combination the for

the bottom here for the bottom here it's

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.150 
the bottom here for the bottom here it's
interesting<00:03:43.270> because<00:03:43.960> you've<00:03:44.860> got<00:03:44.950> multiple

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
interesting because you've got multiple

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.340 
interesting because you've got multiple
possibilities<00:03:45.910> for<00:03:46.360> where<00:03:46.570> that<00:03:46.810> card<00:03:47.140> can

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
possibilities for where that card can

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.380 
possibilities for where that card can
come<00:03:47.590> in<00:03:47.800> now<00:03:48.810> one<00:03:49.830> complicating<00:03:50.830> factor

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
come in now one complicating factor

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.910 
come in now one complicating factor
sometimes<00:03:52.390> you're<00:03:53.320> going<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.530> take<00:03:53.710> something

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
sometimes you're going to take something

sometimes you're going to take something
that<00:03:54.160> won't<00:03:54.280> let<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.580> score<00:03:54.910> that's<00:03:55.540> going<00:03:55.720> to

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
that won't let you score that's going to

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.330 
that won't let you score that's going to
happen<00:03:55.930> sometimes<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.620> don't<00:03:56.800> want<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.190> take

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
happen sometimes you don't want to take

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.070 
happen sometimes you don't want to take
something<00:03:57.580> or<00:03:58.300> it'll<00:03:58.510> mess<00:03:58.660> up<00:03:58.810> what<00:03:58.990> you

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
something or it'll mess up what you

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.360 
something or it'll mess up what you
already<00:03:59.260> have<00:03:59.410> collected<00:03:59.920> in<00:04:00.010> your<00:04:00.130> hand

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
already have collected in your hand

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.100 
already have collected in your hand
because<00:04:00.580> if<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.150> have<00:04:01.300> tons<00:04:01.630> of<00:04:01.750> stuff<00:04:01.990> in

because if you have tons of stuff in

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.040 
because if you have tons of stuff in
your<00:04:02.200> hand<00:04:03.330> let's<00:04:04.330> say<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.480> had<00:04:04.690> this<00:04:04.810> for

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
your hand let's say I had this for

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.640 
your hand let's say I had this for
example<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.590> could<00:04:06.240> choose<00:04:07.240> to<00:04:07.660> score<00:04:08.410> these

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
example I could choose to score these

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.030 
example I could choose to score these
two<00:04:08.920> cards<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.310> add<00:04:09.430> up<00:04:09.460> to<00:04:09.550> 10<00:04:10.620> but<00:04:11.620> on<00:04:11.860> the
