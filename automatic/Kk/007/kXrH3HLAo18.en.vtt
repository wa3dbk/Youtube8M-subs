00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.770
 Hi, welcome to the picture now that we already 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.230
 We finished with lime and let's start 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.779
 analyze the sheets 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:22.290
 the leaf is the main plant organ 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:26.099
 specialized in capturing sunlight and 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:30.540
 moreover, the sheet is responsible for 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.250
 make gas exchange with no environment 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.260
 processes of photosynthesis or 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.310
 perspiration and all these processes 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.150
 will be detailed in the physiology classes 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.210
 vegetable 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:50.030
 In this class we will analyze the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:54.450
 The internal structure of one sheet of 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.500
 completely covered by the epidermis 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:02.850
 epidermis is that layer of cells that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.229
 It is very much juxtaposed together each 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.409
 and this layer of cells is 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:14.490
 responsible for coating the two 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:18.140
 plant organs coating the epidermis 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:24.659
 we have a waterproofing layer 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.789
 this layer is called cuticle and 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.819
 we already saw in the fabric class of 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:34.079
 that the presence of the cuticle 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:37.979
 is very important to avoid loss 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.719
 of water beyond the cuticle another 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.959
 structure present in the leaves are the 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:50.069
 stomata usually in quantities 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:53.389
 varied depending on the species and we 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:56.029
 we have also seen that the stomach is 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:59.999
 responsible for making the gas exchange 

00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:00.869
 between the internal environment and the external 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:05.130
 plant 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:09.330
 the innermost region of the leaf is called 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.030
 of mesophiles and from now on 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.510
 Let's explain this region. 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.290
 the mazola is filled by a 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.069
 relative 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.989
 We have already seen in class about relatives that this 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.700
 fabric is responsible for filling the 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.090
 of plant organs 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.480
 but beyond the fulfillment of the intimate father 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.319
 can also perform other functions 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.220
 for example in this parenchyma that make up 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.900
 the mesothelium of the leaf where the cells are 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.299
 chloroplasts rich in chloroplasts 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.260
 are the organelles that store the 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:56.200
 chlorophyll which is the essential pigment 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.159
 for photosynthesis and is what gives the color 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.159
 green 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:03.689
 the leaf and this rich parenchyma 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.760
 chlorophyll is called relative a 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:10.659
 chlorophyll and year when the cells are 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.720
 very juxtaposed to one another 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:17.530
 this chlorophyll parenchyma and year is 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.530
 called a relative palis to disc and 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.739
 when the cells of the parenchyma 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:27.669
 chlorophyll year are very scattered 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:31.659
 we call a relative a gap in the 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:35.349
 the lacunar parenchyma cells also 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:39.159
 are rich in chlorophyll and this relative 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:42.479
 breast also performs photosynthesis 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:47.109
 besides these fabrics the cold mazola also 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:51.340
 conductive fabrics conductive fabrics 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:57.280
 are arranged in bundles and these 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:01.180
 beams with a veins veins 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.750
 ribs are those traces present 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.439
 on the foliar surface composing these 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.609
 beams then we have chile lima that 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:17.699
 is usually aimed at the 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:21.930
 leaflet and this motto is 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:26.310
 responsible for driving the sap 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:30.130
 inorganic reminiscing the sap 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.150
 is rich in salts and water that 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.050
 were 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.810
 roots beyond the Chilean 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.130
 in the lower part 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:46.180
 we have the vessels of flu lima the flu 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:50.260
 Emma is responsible for transporting the 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.510
 organic sap which is the rich sap in 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.200
 organic compounds 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:00.460
 this sap is produced on the sheet itself 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.820
 from the process of photosynthesis and 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.980
 it will be transported to others 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:11.170
 plant organs and making the support 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.790
 of these conductive beams 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.200
 we also have some fibers here 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.470
 choose climate 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:24.040
 the fibers choose climate with the 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:28.480
 wrist the clerin kills the scleral in 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:32.230
 climate is that very resistant fabric 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:36.130
 which gives support to the rest 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:39.070
 and before closing this class I 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:42.640
 I want to talk about the disposition of 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:47.050
 veins in monoculture leaves 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:51.010
 and I of cotyledons there are two 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:55.080
 basic patterns of 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:06:00.850
 ribs on the 9th cotyledons the ribs 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:03.730
 are arranged parallel to the 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:08.170
 leaves that have this type of 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:13.120
 ribs are called leaves for 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:17.280
 alelÃ­ nervos is already born of fucile do nis 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:21.790
 the leaves are different from the ribs 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:25.930
 from a cult and branching out 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:29.890
 in smaller and smaller bundles 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:33.640
 these leaves can be called penny 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:38.740
 nerves because this pattern reminds 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:42.990
 a feather from a passin beyond pn snow 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.240
 they can also be called sheets 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.139
 reticulated 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:52.759
 and these crosslinked sheets are typical 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:56.660
 from the zew of cotyledons we close by 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:59.030
 with the internal morphology of the 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:02.870
 leaves and next class 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:05.139
 we will analyze the external structure of 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.139
 leaf
