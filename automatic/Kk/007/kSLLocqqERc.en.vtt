00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.419
 good people and the order of abbas to 

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.740
 disable background we'll see how that 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:08.830
 applications that come by default 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.990
 our android terminal apps 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.570
 that come from the factory and that bother us 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.000
 since we do not use them and we do not 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.510
 are interested in having these several steps not 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.390
 root 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.030
 worth with root salaries is to leave the link 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.860
 of another myth in the description since yes 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.619
 are you group you will be eliminated by 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.110
 complete is valid in this way that if a 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.360
 root user what we will do then 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.640
 make it not appear on the screen and 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.960
 make it occupy as little as possible worth it 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.960
 win more I enter and we start 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.900
 rest here back guys the truth 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.310
 is that it's very fast, you're not going to 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.100
 lose more time what I have to do 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.930
 is to go to settings, and within settings 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.640
 we will go to applications as a post 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.950
 be several and within applications for 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.300
 do it faster and between applications 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.040
 we have all the list is worth and 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.470
 we will choose the one that is good, the one that we 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.960
 interesting to have in my case I'm going to erase 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.330
 what he mentioned play google play music 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.090
 I'm not interested in having her, you just want to be 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.950
 applied over and will offer us a series 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.680
 of options the first thing we should do 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.110
 is to uninstall the updates worth 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.300
 this what it will do is that in total it has 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.500
 15 m is the application worth is what in 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.620
 his fault in not coming 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.320
 in our terminal and uninstalling the 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.220
 updates I wanted to give you now 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.220
 accept what we will do 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.930
 accept what we will here me 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.210
 15 less worth 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.580
 and let's see now you see they do not deal 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.130
 you can appreciate on your part 4 with 21 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.550
 megas is to say that we have already saved 11 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.080
 mb of space is worth that in the first place 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.370
 of fiscal ar the updates that 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.010
 have the application that we want 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.520
 disable the constitution yes that you 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.910
 we give to disable here on the right 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.910
 we want to accept 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.720
 and in this way I would not have to 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.799
 leave us in what has been our 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.840
 android terminal to not enter 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.130
 applications and let's observe us 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.750
 appears here and here it's worth and it's like that 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.970
 simple guys how can you observe no 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.950
 have nothing we go to settings we erase 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.290
 applications the application example 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.930
 we erase what are still the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.560
 updates and give to disable and 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.050
 in this way can take 15 megabytes 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.200
 as it occupied we occupy 4 and we do not have 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.819
 on the screen, it's not a total way 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.160
 nothing at all since always the 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.350
 we will have there and we will be able to recover what 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.120
 which is also worth it is quite interesting 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.560
 not because we can eliminate it but then 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.510
 we have it just in case but good 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.269
 it will always occupy 4 megabytes 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.370
 and these all guys without root user 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.780
 then in the destruction that will compensate you 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.819
 the other method maybe that's also very 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.379
 fast and the divine is completely of 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.269
 this terminal assumption so nothing 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.280
 more guys a greeting comment 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.840
 tell them if you liked it if we liked it 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.730
 I can improve because here I want to draw 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.049
 a little bit with your help you win 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.829
 more tricks a greeting and that other people 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.829
 bye
