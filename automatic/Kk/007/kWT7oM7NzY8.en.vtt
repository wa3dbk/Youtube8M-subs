then<00:03:11.280> up<00:03:11.430> nude<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.390> more<00:03:12.599> of<00:03:12.630> just

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
then up nude so this is more of just

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.690 
then up nude so this is more of just
like<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.930> nude<00:03:13.170> color<00:03:13.410> it's<00:03:13.799> very<00:03:14.160> very<00:03:14.489> pretty

like a nude color it's very very pretty
but<00:03:15.000> it's<00:03:15.510> kind<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.750> sheer<00:03:16.049> a<00:03:16.109> more<00:03:16.380> sheer<00:03:16.620> that

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
I thought it would be and I think it's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.520 
I thought it would be and I think it's
