00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Beyond the speed of light, the adventure of the Red Dragonfly 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.120
 Come on, come on, pony! Who is a good horse? 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.640
 Jose, please let go of the local habitat. 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.460
 Please see! It is a rainbow horse! It's like a little girl's black light poster illusion becomes real! 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.500
 Did you mean that the poster was in your previous room? 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.180
 No, no! 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.840
 As the ambassador of the galaxy, I extend the friendship of the federation to you. 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.640
 Oh...... 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.640
 Come on, Jose, let's go. 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.240
 Hey whats up? 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.700
 Sambo, is there any data for the structure? 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.020
 data? 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560
 No, I have been playing video games all the time. 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.740
 It was a crashed Nguyen ship. 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.960
 How long has it been there? 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.000
 I do not know 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.560
 Don't worry, I know how to do it. 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.480
 Close to the alarm, the fire spread, is about to crash, the temperature rises 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.680
 Relax, you are fine. 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.260
 Yes, you have crashed 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.240
 Crashed! ? 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.420
 Unfortunately, my memory is unstable, nanomachines need time to recalibrate 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.020
 What do you remember? 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.680
 Flare, click, endless click 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.460
 He attacked the ship 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.500
 I am the last survivor 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.540
 The engine is destroyed, we crashed here 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.780
 The invading fleet was also killed. 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.840
 Enter sleep mode to save energy 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.420
 Proposal: I am your crew, we leave the planet 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.680
 My main function has always been to operate the shield. 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.000
 Ha, let's get out of here. 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.480
 I hope that you don't mind letting Mannâ€™s take charge of the shield. 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.980
 Don't mind at all 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.460
 But if you are building an intrusion fleet, I am more interested 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.280
 His Majesty 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.380
 come on 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.460
 (System: Shield System) (Reactor: 10 Energy Bars) 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.020
 what is that? 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.880
 Analysis: We have jumped into an asteroid belt 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.040
 He said that we are surrounded by rocks 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.680
 Not just rocks! It is a stone man! It is a stone pirate! 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.940
 His weapon is charging faster than us! 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.880
 We shot it! Now the asteroids will take them apart! 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.820
 Not finished yet, because they also have missile weapons 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.600
 Our entire ship has lost its air! 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.080
 Lecca, please fix the oxygen machine! 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.960
 How should I work? 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.660
 Oh yeah, we need more of these 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.240
