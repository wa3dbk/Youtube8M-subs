00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.230
 with people and welcome to 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.660
 forming a further consequence and today 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.910
 It's about how to get real in gta 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.190
 recordings installed yes like the name 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.210
 already says that you just take real shots 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.029
 I have no fake names in the game 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.800
 but so from rockstar games 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.330
 because the bottom right when we now have a 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.519
 a car, for example, if it is one 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.180
 the data humans but you this place 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.730
 installed displayed as original name 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.930
 estimated in necessary and the people 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.800
 who do not know how that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 car means or just want to find out 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 like the car is in real time 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.820
 when installing this mat 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.140
 So have a lot of fun with me 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.820
 themselves then really like very much 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.160
 to know what it actually is 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.690
 If the market is hamburg too, it is quite 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.710
 simply we have to download here 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.260
 you're probably a tick 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.150
 set to download with opera that works 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.159
 I do not really want mozilla 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.939
 always said then just up 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.060
 download 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:17.920
 after you chew it hard 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.390
 would be done and then yes 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.439
 your year old trained opens the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.450
 folder then the phases needs this 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:36.700
 if he always reads that where he goes 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:39.340
 text just have to do the file here 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.310
 just here shows move copy 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.920
 and click replace and done has 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.560
 every model installed and now go 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.759
 we in games shows you that has, firstly 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.099
 works for the second trainings so 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.989
 now in the game 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.840
 I stole my sentinel 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:01.000
 looked like whatever in any case 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.569
 normally this would have to happen if 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.520
 you can see that at bmw m3 is that 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.759
 First, that works and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.709
 secondly that the sender is a wws so 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.760
 Variety of mod is really good 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:18.190
 So for the people who want to know what 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.260
 for him to share that is can with the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.160
 find out that today that is so 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.920
 It was definitely right 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.000
 I fill many who I know say 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.140
 let something else be that could be 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.430
 the murder is a very helpful and 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.800
 otherwise it is not really that way anymore 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.120
 much to say 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.980
 The market definitely works 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.450
 and if any did ask for 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.920
 the have something not understood a 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.540
