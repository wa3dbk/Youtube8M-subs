 cyanogenmod 11 distributed by some 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.799
 this is the day from the team 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.460
 so hopefully it won't be there either 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.370
 but in the future someone is found e 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.969
