00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
here and basically that's why Nintendo

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.090 
here and basically that's why Nintendo
will<00:03:48.120> not<00:03:48.300> release<00:03:48.720> Activision's<00:03:49.590> Matt<00:03:49.860> pack

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
will not release Activision's Matt pack

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.910 
will not release Activision's Matt pack
now<00:03:51.000> basically<00:03:51.330> what<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:51.630> heard<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.290> it's<00:03:52.800> a

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
now basically what I heard and it's a

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.590 
now basically what I heard and it's a
rumor<00:03:53.190> right<00:03:53.310> now<00:03:53.489> but<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.910> definitely<00:03:54.180> makes

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
rumor right now but it definitely makes

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.290 
rumor right now but it definitely makes
sense<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.080> Nintendo<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.300> Activision

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
sense is that Nintendo and Activision

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.580 
sense is that Nintendo and Activision
have<00:03:57.390> already<00:03:57.630> made<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> map<00:03:58.170> pack<00:03:58.380> or

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
have already made a map pack or

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.560 
have already made a map pack or
Activision<00:03:59.070> has<00:03:59.100> made<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> map<00:03:59.550> pack<00:03:59.760> but<00:04:00.360> it

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
Activision has made a map pack but it

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.540 
Activision has made a map pack but it
was<00:04:00.750> never<00:04:01.080> released<00:04:01.380> because<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.250> little

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
was never released because of the little

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.550 
was never released because of the little
dispute<00:04:02.880> that's<00:04:03.120> going<00:04:03.420> on<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.750> until<00:04:04.410> this

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
dispute that's going on and until this

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.710 
dispute that's going on and until this
dispute<00:04:05.340> is<00:04:05.519> resolved<00:04:05.550> they<00:04:06.420> will<00:04:06.600> not

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
dispute is resolved they will not

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.180 
dispute is resolved they will not
release<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.050> map<00:04:07.350> pack<00:04:07.560> for<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.830> wii<00:04:07.920> which<00:04:08.070> is

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
release a map pack for the wii which is

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.740 
release a map pack for the wii which is
kind<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.489> unfortunate<00:04:08.670> but<00:04:09.510> what<00:04:09.630> are<00:04:09.690> you

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
kind of unfortunate but what are you

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.660 
kind of unfortunate but what are you
gonna<00:04:09.810> do<00:04:10.050> now<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.530> me<00:04:10.860> this<00:04:11.160> makes<00:04:11.340> sense

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
gonna do now to me this makes sense

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.100 
gonna do now to me this makes sense
because<00:04:11.880> even<00:04:12.269> though<00:04:12.330> it's<00:04:12.480> just<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.750> rumor<00:04:12.900> it

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
because even though it's just a rumor it

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.810 
because even though it's just a rumor it
kind<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.410> explains<00:04:13.800> all<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.310> pre<00:04:14.519> measures

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
kind of explains all the pre measures

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.699 
kind of explains all the pre measures
that<00:04:15.000> were<00:04:15.120> taking<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:16.169> slot<00:04:16.470> under

that were taking you the slot under

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.310 
that were taking you the slot under
combat<00:04:17.489> training<00:04:17.959> which<00:04:18.959> will<00:04:19.140> basically

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
combat training which will basically

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.039 
combat training which will basically
open<00:04:19.979> up<00:04:20.150> what<00:04:21.150> would<00:04:21.390> have<00:04:21.510> opened<00:04:21.660> up<00:04:21.900> i

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049

change map just the little things like

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.000 
change map just the little things like

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
that that would explain the pre measures

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.060
