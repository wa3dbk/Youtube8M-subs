really<00:01:43.109> really<00:01:43.380> good<00:01:43.590> glitch<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.429> anyway

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
really really good glitch but anyway

really really good glitch but anyway
guys<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.090> think<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> actually<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> lot

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
guys I think this is actually a lot

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.840 
guys I think this is actually a lot
easier<00:01:46.469> than<00:01:46.889> the<00:01:47.100> other<00:01:47.249> glitches<00:01:47.579> I've

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
easier than the other glitches I've

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.359 
easier than the other glitches I've
uploaded<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.659> method<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.829> found<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.249> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
uploaded with this method we found it to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.099 
uploaded with this method we found it to
be<00:01:50.399> very<00:01:50.490> easy<00:01:50.999> when<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.389> actually<00:01:51.539> perform

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
be very easy when we actually perform

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.289 
be very easy when we actually perform
this<00:01:52.319> and<00:01:52.590> recorded<00:01:53.069> this<00:01:53.219> so<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.210> you
