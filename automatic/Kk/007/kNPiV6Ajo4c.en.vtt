00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.130 
he's got a 532 not a very strong side so
I<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:12.060> hoping<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> best<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.020> get

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
I was hoping for the best when we get

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.719 
I was hoping for the best when we get
things<00:01:13.290> started<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.740> little<00:01:13.890> bit<00:01:14.070> cocky<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
things started a little bit cocky a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.460 
things started a little bit cocky a
little<00:01:14.909> bit<00:01:15.210> overzealous<00:01:15.540> maybe<00:01:16.049> off<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
little bit overzealous maybe off the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
little bit overzealous maybe off the
kick<00:01:16.650> off<00:01:16.799> they're<00:01:17.009> generally<00:01:17.790> liked<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.090> feel

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
kick off they're generally liked to feel

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.300 
kick off they're generally liked to feel
out<00:01:18.479> my<00:01:18.659> opponents<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.140> little<00:01:19.409> bit<00:01:19.530> more<00:01:19.710> see

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
out my opponents a little bit more see

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.130 
out my opponents a little bit more see
if<00:01:20.430> they're<00:01:20.549> gonna<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.850> able<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.390> defend<00:01:21.720> skill

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
if they're gonna be able to defend skill

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
if they're gonna be able to defend skill
moves<00:01:22.320> right<00:01:22.470> there<00:01:22.650> he<00:01:22.770> didn't<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.340> bite

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
moves right there he didn't really bite

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
moves right there he didn't really bite
on<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> kind<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.840> figured<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.140> might

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
on that so I kind of figured I might

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.230 
on that so I kind of figured I might
have<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> chance<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> few<00:01:26.640> skills<00:01:26.970> here

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
have the chance to do a few skills here

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.870 
have the chance to do a few skills here
or<00:01:27.360> there<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.049> nice<00:01:28.290> worked<00:01:28.710> move<00:01:29.189> ends<00:01:29.759> up

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
or there but a nice worked move ends up

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.999 
or there but a nice worked move ends up
in<00:01:30.030> Feghouli<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.780> his<00:01:30.930> left<00:01:31.170> foot<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.560> weaker

essentially<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> driven<00:02:25.260> shot<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:25.800> keep

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
essentially a driven shot that you keep

low below the keepers waist those seem

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.810 
low below the keepers waist those seem
to<00:02:28.140> do<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.380> best<00:02:28.590> wonderful<00:02:29.220> work<00:02:29.370> here<00:02:29.610> from

much the XA to stop the player right
there<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.750> fantastic<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.710> use<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.100> all<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.310> time

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
there is fantastic I use it all the time

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.550 
there is fantastic I use it all the time
and<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:39.210> was<00:02:39.300> having<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:40.170> know<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> little<00:02:40.470> bit

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
and I was having you know a little bit

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.040 
and I was having you know a little bit
of<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.740> think<00:02:40.950> about<00:02:41.220> why<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.610> find<00:02:42.330> defending<00:02:42.900> to

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
of a think about why I find defending to

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.600 
of a think about why I find defending to
be<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> good<00:02:43.500> bit<00:02:43.710> difficult<00:02:44.250> or<00:02:44.340> more

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
be a good bit difficult or more

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.700 
be a good bit difficult or more
difficult<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.240> FIFA<00:02:45.570> 13<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.560> why<00:02:46.680> I

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
difficult in FIFA 13 and this is why I

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.680 
difficult in FIFA 13 and this is why I
was<00:02:46.920> playing<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.610> good<00:02:47.910> bit<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.090> clubs<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.600> so

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
was playing a good bit of clubs and so

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.870 
was playing a good bit of clubs and so
you're<00:02:48.810> using<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.140> generated<00:02:49.710> players<00:02:49.950> and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
you're using the generated players and

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.400 
you're using the generated players and
the<00:02:50.940> only<00:02:51.270> players<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.900> are<00:02:51.990> better<00:02:52.140> are

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
the only players that are better are

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.710 
the only players that are better are
your<00:02:52.560> virtual<00:02:52.920> pros<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.580> think<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> main

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
your virtual pros and I think the main

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.480 
your virtual pros and I think the main
reason<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.920> feels<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.310> much<00:02:56.370> more

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
reason that it feels so much more

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.520 
reason that it feels so much more
difficult<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.480> ease<00:02:57.750> at<00:02:58.080> which<00:02:58.110> your

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
difficult is the ease at which your

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.990 
difficult is the ease at which your
players<00:02:58.770> can<00:02:59.010> change<00:02:59.220> paced<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.850> that's

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
players can change paced and that's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000 
players can change paced and that's
that's<00:03:00.600> very<00:03:00.750> realistic<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.500> me<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.800> some

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
that's very realistic to me in some

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.280 
that's very realistic to me in some
senses<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.520> but<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.210> ease<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> changing<00:03:04.080> pace

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
senses and but that ease a changing pace

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.710 
senses and but that ease a changing pace
is<00:03:04.530> something<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.630> exaggerated<00:03:06.630> a

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
is something that is exaggerated a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.360 
is something that is exaggerated a
little<00:03:06.990> bit<00:03:07.110> more<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.470> Ultimate<00:03:07.920> Team<00:03:08.040> because

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
little bit more in Ultimate Team because

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.980 
little bit more in Ultimate Team because
of<00:03:08.520> chemistry<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.180> morale<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.720> things<00:03:09.870> of

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
of chemistry and morale and things of

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.960 
of chemistry and morale and things of
that<00:03:10.020> nature<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:11.100> don't<00:03:11.310> really<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.880> know

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
that nature so I don't really you know

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.640 
that nature so I don't really you know
as<00:03:12.180> I'm<00:03:12.390> starting<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.900> adapt<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.500> and

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
as I'm starting to adapt to it and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.590 
as I'm starting to adapt to it and
figure<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.100> out<00:03:14.340> I'm<00:03:14.550> getting<00:03:14.850> better<00:03:15.270> and

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
figure it out I'm getting better and

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.320 
figure it out I'm getting better and
better<00:03:15.980> defensively<00:03:16.980> which<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.459> excellent

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
better defensively which is excellent

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.240 
better defensively which is excellent
it's<00:03:18.420> something<00:03:18.690> that's<00:03:18.870> making<00:03:19.500> me<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.770> little

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
it's something that's making me a little

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.699 
it's something that's making me a little
bit<00:03:20.370> happier<00:03:20.550> because<00:03:21.060> after<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:21.959> 5<00:03:22.170> 2<00:03:22.380> 1<00:03:22.410> 2

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
bit happier because after that 5 2 1 2

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.140 
bit happier because after that 5 2 1 2
game<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:22.950> don't<00:03:23.160> know<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.400> was<00:03:23.670> feeling<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:24.000> little

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
game I don't know I was feeling a little

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.420 
game I don't know I was feeling a little
bit<00:03:24.360> nervous<00:03:24.510> about<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.080> but<00:03:25.980> we've<00:03:26.100> put<00:03:26.340> in

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
bit nervous about it but we've put in

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.640 
bit nervous about it but we've put in
some<00:03:26.580> good<00:03:26.790> performances<00:03:26.970> since<00:03:27.660> then<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.200> so

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
some good performances since then and so

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.840 
some good performances since then and so
I'm<00:03:28.739> starting<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:29.070> get<00:03:29.130> my<00:03:29.280> confidence<00:03:29.520> back

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
I'm starting to get my confidence back

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.460 
I'm starting to get my confidence back
and<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.180> little<00:03:30.360> bit<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.510> swagger<00:03:30.989> back<00:03:31.200> up<00:03:31.380> with

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
and a little bit of swagger back up with

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.440 
and a little bit of swagger back up with
a<00:03:31.530> FIFA<00:03:31.800> 13<00:03:31.830> swagger<00:03:32.520> if<00:03:32.670> there<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:33.090> indeed

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
a FIFA 13 swagger if there is indeed

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.750 
a FIFA 13 swagger if there is indeed
such<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.780> thing<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.350> guess<00:03:34.620> we're<00:03:35.190> working<00:03:35.370> on

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
such a thing I guess we're working on

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.270 
such a thing I guess we're working on
getting<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.209> 9<00:03:36.360> oh<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.750> 4<00:03:37.020> we<00:03:37.440> head<00:03:37.560> back<00:03:37.590> over

into the tournament to see if we can

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.440 
into the tournament to see if we can
find<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.870> match<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.320> we<00:03:40.470> eventually
