00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.420
 this Wednesday the São Paulo in partnership with the nobel stationery and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.900
 Bookstore inaugurated more space in the stadium of Morumbi and consecutive 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.949
 beating a wonder already has majeed and megaloja now bookstore will let 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.119
 ascari goes to the movies anyway the morumbi is going to be an alternative too 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.399
 on the weekdays of the São Paulo fan and not just on a game day like 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.660
 this in morumbi o são paulo debuted in the 2009 season before the ituano we 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.140
 we are entering the store joining the hand bookstore stage together with you in the 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.780
 colonists station and that we can not live does not follow from são paulo 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.370
 I felt a little there 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.199
 as it was a launch of this bookstore that everyone is paulo and the 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.210
 morumbi mayor 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.940
 and demolition as it loses its strength to compare itself with reserve and heart there 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.690
 of a bookstore on the side and I think with some interesting details 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.290
 for example from marley see the video house on the 11th between people 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.350
 it's a tree 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.129
 is that you motto of the month of May laid a clear lie within it 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.490
 a ball breaking appliance very nice decoration 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.390
 and the other side up or santinho do são paulo using paulo 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.710
 leaving also wall wall to prevent the breaking of the law 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.780
 quite interesting and then when you pass and the bathroom is not mindfully minded 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.580
 when you walk out of the bookstore outside to have a little place for one 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.120
 coffee 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.490
 there is a little boy with things today did not give everything for free 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.850
 launch the book launch you drink coffee tables finally have a 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.690
 odd space of limbs sectional of modeling we work with some project 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.940
 have a meeting and said there's the bar 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.820
 the coffee 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.740
 in the bookstore 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.420
 which is already very common in São Paulo in most places 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.590
 What are you going to do? 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.039
 along with a bookstore the image of the organ how does a very 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.120
 similar to the bar 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.549
 and also in the megaloja but then you see a deck is very interesting 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.350
 these measures and there in front a gradient you can my life that 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.979
 can not predict for example in the front you will have closer to the lawn to 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.960
 chalet and thales stays open for week all you can go wrong 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.050
 take a peek at the lawn and not just the words on some game day 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.129
 and the senate lion 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.269
 the image formed world line in the machine but anyway 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.840
 is the one of the proof if it accompanies to inaugurate in another inauguration of the paul 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.499
 that once again end of the year in Brazilian football already have bookstores already have 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:22.460
 shops already have bar will have cinema will have your city will have to live with the uncle 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.450
 and then the goal situation comes out of the store and you're together with us
