00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.210
 of pvc color chocolate 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.789

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:22.140
 It has a coating 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.010

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:41.530
 of the same color coating in 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 the on what is on the wall then a 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.770

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.820
 the sink box 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.000
 in this case, here we have the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.370
 cupboards we can see here what it is 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.830
 sterile 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.799
 in the molding is a wrap 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.800

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.390

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.220
 drawer in this case there is one between diaper 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.320

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.670
 fixed directly to the walls with their 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.670
 hidden hinges 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:38.240
 well this 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.240
 in this case we have two in three years 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.159
 with their 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.009

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.490

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.190
 And finally, we have what it is 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.380
 the cupboard of the top of the refrigerator 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.080
 that is, no space is left 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.950
 free and all well organized 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.700
 precisely to have this one 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.770
 better organization of what the area 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.630
 of cooking that we have then it is a 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.120
 extremely thick material of 20 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.630
 millimeters both on the floor or well 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.340
 It is square for what 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.930
 and all that is the drawer all the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.820
 pvc material precisely so that 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.470
 they can run well what they manage 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.080
 sliding 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:39.060
 and this is the sink area 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:44.090
 long work that is the afternoon 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.090

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.420
