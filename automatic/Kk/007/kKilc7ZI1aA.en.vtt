00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.789 
keeping contact with the string but
don't<00:02:06.479> press<00:02:06.719> into<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.170> wood<00:02:07.320> anymore

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
don't press into the wood anymore

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.669 
don't press into the wood anymore
okay<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:09.390> will<00:02:09.509> stop<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.080> notes

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
okay and that will stop the notes

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.819 
okay and that will stop the notes
so<00:02:11.579> you're<00:02:11.700> gonna<00:02:11.790> pick<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.209> let<00:02:13.110> go<00:02:13.379> but<00:02:13.620> don't

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
so you're gonna pick it let go but don't

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.100 
so you're gonna pick it let go but don't
let<00:02:14.220> go<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.730> let<00:02:15.060> go<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.450> pressure<00:02:15.780> is

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
let go just let go the pressure is

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.270 
let go just let go the pressure is
probably<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.530> best<00:02:16.680> way<00:02:16.829> of<00:02:16.860> putting<00:02:17.189> it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
probably the best way of putting it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.270 
probably the best way of putting it
still<00:02:17.849> come<00:02:18.030> into<00:02:18.180> contact<00:02:18.450> with<00:02:18.750> string<00:02:19.379> so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
still come into contact with string so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:35.539 
still come into contact with string so
we're<00:02:20.459> going<00:02:23.480> right<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:25.049> that's<00:02:30.349> okay<00:02:34.549> now

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
we're going right so that's okay now

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.789 
we're going right so that's okay now

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
I know it feels really weak and a little

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.530 
I know it feels really weak and a little
bit<00:02:46.500> nasty<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.129> beginning<00:02:47.519> but<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.359> more

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
bit nasty in the beginning but the more

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.509 
bit nasty in the beginning but the more
you<00:02:48.690> do<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.260> stronger<00:02:49.829> it'll<00:02:49.980> get<00:02:50.280> and

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
you do it the stronger it'll get and

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.979 
you do it the stronger it'll get and
this<00:02:50.579> is<00:02:50.639> a<00:02:50.760> great<00:02:51.060> riff<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.450> do<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.720> because<00:02:51.900> it

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
this is a great riff to do it because it

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.660 
this is a great riff to do it because it
sounds<00:02:52.319> called<00:02:52.560> only<00:02:52.889> making<00:02:53.190> your<00:02:53.400> finger

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670

first like you're thinking well why am I
putting<00:06:07.180> that<00:06:07.449> effort<00:06:07.780> in<00:06:07.960> if<00:06:08.949> there's<00:06:09.400> just

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
putting that effort in if there's just

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.360 
putting that effort in if there's just
silence<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.930> is<00:06:11.080> not<00:06:11.259> the<00:06:11.379> point<00:06:11.560> music<00:06:12.220> is

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
silence that is not the point music is

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.700 
silence that is not the point music is
nothing<00:06:12.849> without<00:06:13.000> rests<00:06:13.750> okay<00:06:14.169> so<00:06:14.229> if<00:06:14.650> you

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
nothing without rests okay so if you

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.290 
nothing without rests okay so if you
have<00:06:14.830> that<00:06:14.919> resting<00:06:15.430> music<00:06:15.729> that<00:06:15.879> that's<00:06:16.150> what

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
have that resting music that that's what

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.909 
have that resting music that that's what
creates<00:06:16.629> the<00:06:16.690> rhythm<00:06:17.080> that's<00:06:17.470> what<00:06:17.620> creates

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
creates the rhythm that's what creates

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.219 
creates the rhythm that's what creates
the<00:06:18.039> groove<00:06:18.400> okay<00:06:19.030> so<00:06:19.419> doing<00:06:19.659> those<00:06:19.780> misses

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
the groove okay so doing those misses

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.320 
the groove okay so doing those misses
it's<00:06:20.409> you<00:06:20.560> counting<00:06:21.250> okay<00:06:21.759> and<00:06:21.849> eventually

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
it's you counting okay and eventually

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.420 
it's you counting okay and eventually
you<00:06:22.750> won't<00:06:22.900> need<00:06:23.110> to<00:06:23.289> count<00:06:23.560> miss<00:06:23.889> miss<00:06:24.220> in

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
you won't need to count miss miss in

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.070 
you won't need to count miss miss in
your<00:06:24.460> head<00:06:24.729> you'll<00:06:25.210> just<00:06:25.419> know<00:06:25.659> what<00:06:25.900> that

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080
