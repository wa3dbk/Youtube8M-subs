videos<00:00:16.130> this<00:00:17.130> poetic<00:00:17.430> case<00:00:17.910> wasn't<00:00:18.869> exactly

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
videos this poetic case wasn't exactly

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
videos this poetic case wasn't exactly
cutting<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.060> fit<00:00:21.330> was<00:00:21.510> all<00:00:21.720> weird

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
cutting it the fit was all weird

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.210 
cutting it the fit was all weird
actually<00:00:22.350> how<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.500> put<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> little<00:00:22.890> sticky

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
actually how to put a little sticky

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.380 
actually how to put a little sticky
thing<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.580> here<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.850> kind<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.090> make<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
thing in here to kind of make it a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.200 
thing in here to kind of make it a
little<00:00:24.510> more<00:00:24.630> snug<00:00:25.070> it<00:00:26.070> seems<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.910> case

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
little more snug it seems that this case

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.179 
little more snug it seems that this case
might<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.779> been<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> better<00:00:28.500> suited<00:00:28.890> for<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
might have been a better suited for the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.710 
might have been a better suited for the
j<00:00:29.369> butterfly<00:00:29.640> which<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.179> slightly<00:00:30.420> thicker

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
j butterfly which is slightly thicker

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.990 
j butterfly which is slightly thicker
than<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> droid<00:00:31.170> DNA<00:00:31.610> verizon<00:00:32.610> droid<00:00:32.700> DNA

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
than the droid DNA verizon droid DNA

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.400 
than the droid DNA verizon droid DNA
that<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.329> here<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> states<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.140> i'm

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
that we have here in the states so i'm

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.970 
that we have here in the states so i'm
guessing<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.780> just<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.989> messed<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.380> part<00:00:37.680> on

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
guessing it's a just a messed up part on

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.610 
guessing it's a just a messed up part on
the<00:00:38.309> behalf<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.850> poetic<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.600> i<00:00:39.840> went<00:00:40.350> ahead<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the behalf of poetic so i went ahead and

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
just stops here on the sides too so you

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.520 
just stops here on the sides too so you

don't like this at all I didn't think it

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.089 
don't like this at all I didn't think it
would<00:02:36.299> bug<00:02:36.450> me<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.659> much<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.290> saw<00:02:37.799> it<00:02:37.980> it's
