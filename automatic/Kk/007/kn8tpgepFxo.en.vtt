00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
scratch loss of coding I can't actually

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.029 
scratch loss of coding I can't actually
show<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.339> the<00:00:48.489> code<00:00:48.699> because<00:00:49.239> I<00:00:49.390> don't<00:00:49.570> want

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
people to copy it this is all made in

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.599 
people to copy it this is all made in
HTML<00:00:54.519> coding<00:00:54.960> there<00:00:55.960> I<00:00:56.379> was<00:00:57.190> going<00:00:57.429> to<00:00:57.489> use<00:00:57.519> a

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:44.450 
everyone loses I don't know so the
connector<00:04:33.570> real<00:04:33.660> quick<00:04:40.070> so<00:04:41.070> type<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:43.650> here<00:04:44.280> is

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
connector real quick so type so here is

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.360 
connector real quick so type so here is
your<00:04:44.490> word<00:04:45.240> we're<00:04:45.540> gonna<00:04:45.660> be<00:04:45.720> using<00:04:45.750> it's<00:04:46.170> a

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
your word we're gonna be using it's a

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.340 
your word we're gonna be using it's a
modded<00:04:47.370> flatland<00:04:48.090> world<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.780> there's<00:04:49.140> no

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
modded flatland world so there's no

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.460 
modded flatland world so there's no
obstacles<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:51.120> so<00:04:51.720> this<00:04:52.050> is<00:04:52.140> just<00:04:52.260> where<00:04:52.410> you

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
obstacles and so this is just where you

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.070 
obstacles and so this is just where you
spawn<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:53.010> just<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.430> little<00:04:54.420> nice<00:04:55.050> little

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
spawn it's just a little nice little

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.390 
spawn it's just a little nice little
spawn<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:56.510> guess<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.810> made<00:04:58.650> this<00:04:58.800> in<00:04:58.920> like<00:04:59.040> three

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
spawn I guess I made this in like three

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.070 
spawn I guess I made this in like three
minutes<00:04:59.610> not<00:05:00.240> much<00:05:02.120> so<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.480> probably<00:05:03.840> first

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
minutes not much so the probably first

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.260 
minutes not much so the probably first
fenced<00:05:04.470> off<00:05:04.560> area<00:05:04.740> will<00:05:05.130> be<00:05:05.250> right<00:05:05.460> here<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:06.180> i

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
fenced off area will be right here and i

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.820 
fenced off area will be right here and i
think<00:05:06.630> is<00:05:06.720> gonna<00:05:06.900> be<00:05:07.310> 40<00:05:08.310> by<00:05:08.550> 40<00:05:09.150> i<00:05:09.530> guess<00:05:10.530> and

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
think is gonna be 40 by 40 i guess and

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.100 
think is gonna be 40 by 40 i guess and
i'll<00:05:11.610> probably<00:05:11.970> be<00:05:12.180> somewhere<00:05:12.480> up<00:05:12.630> there<00:05:12.810> on

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
i'll probably be somewhere up there on

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.730
