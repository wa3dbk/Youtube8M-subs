00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.040
 you enjoy being creative then 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:09.250
 are you a buy 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.750
 just right in the following video you see 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.750
 you make a few tweaks on the subject 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.419
 a red and a white square 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.500
 paper lie on each other and then too 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.500
 to fold a triangle 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.940
 the white sheet is theirs 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.699
 stop and from the other side too 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.010
 to fold a triangle 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.289
 small tip necessarily thin paper 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.289
 otherwise it will be tricky later 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.190
 because 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.110
 Men 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.690
 then from one side a corner in the 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.380
 in the middle fold so that out of the corner one 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.380
 edge becomes 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.580
 then turn the sheet and the corner 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.580
 this one knew how to fold in the middle 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.900
 same with the second corner of this 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.730
 knew the procedure 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.730
 it creates a new point 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.600
 the white ones knew the outside 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.600
 folding outer edges 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.409
 Turn the leaf and the red tip around 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.129
 fold so that only white 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.129
 paper looks 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.060
 open again and the point now on 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.830
 the resulting fall line then folds 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.629
 two more times to fold so that one 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.319
 small white bar the red top 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.319
 concludes
