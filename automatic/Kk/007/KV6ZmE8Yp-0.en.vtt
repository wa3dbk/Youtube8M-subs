00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:44.010
 and explain how it is a return to 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.629
 misano circuit with the truck in 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.899
 principle we have a straight end that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.750
 it's a s is pretty fast the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.270
 we do a braking in the short octave 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.489
 strong and we left there and we 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.350
 we find a right curve is 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.329
 pretty fast and let's go 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.399
 slipping a lot with the truck because 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.399
 we try to go as fast as possible 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.990
 a white 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.850
 and as soon as we get out of there we have a 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.030
 little girl with a very braking 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.250
 strong for a right curve that are 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.460
 they are two curves but they are taken 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.860
 as one we put 7th long seventh 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.420
 from there we have left and we have to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.789
 pick up the change very soon because 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.830
 we have another left curve that is very 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.990
 important because it is what gives us the 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.000
 exit to the back straight then very 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.190
 important to get out of there fast enough to 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.390
 pick up speed and do the straight to the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.840
 straight back in which at once 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.579
 we take 260 is a line that goes a 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.420
 little downhill had approval from 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.420
 the trail i'm 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.550
 we are long line from gurÃ­ fas with 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.550
 song feet 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.060
 with er and we came to a braking also 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.860
 a bit complicated because it's in support is 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.680
 one is one of the slow curves back 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.690
 of the Misano circuit we brake in support and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.900
 throwing us a little outwards from 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.450
 the curve there we go back to put seventh 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.370
 long we do this slow curve is a 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.440
 curve to the right is very important because 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.000
 it also gives us the exit to the whole part 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.170
 back where we're going to reach 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.170
 immediately the 260 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.170
 Light 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.880
 and we came to one of the parties for me 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.760
 most complicated of the circuit we get to 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.769
 160 and we have to slow down a lot for 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.060
 put seventh short does one of the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.950
 slower curves of the circuit is a 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.510
 curve to the right and the same too 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.360
 complicated as the other because in 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.819
 we left that curve we have to pick up 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.739
 much the truck try not to go very 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.870
 far to the right because we have another 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.389
 left curve that we also 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.230
 forces to change almost in support to change 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.230
 to octave 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.740
 you see 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.820
 and good there 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.740
 we take and we already lined up what is the 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.450
 next curve that is a curve 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.430
 left is that it is the entrance to the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.790
 key 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.260
 the main straight where the goal is and 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.930
 well that curve is also a curve 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.180
 fast is complicated because it is usually 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.219
 spit out and you go right away 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.799
 at the piano and we have to be careful of 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:01.079
 not give to the marker because they penalize us 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.560
 and it's also important because we come back 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.750
 to reach 160 and we've reached the 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.030
 goal 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.640
 the misano circuit and well that's this 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.150
 it's been a ride with the truck to 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.150
 misano circuit
