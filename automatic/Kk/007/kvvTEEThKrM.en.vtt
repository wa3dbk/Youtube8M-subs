those<00:01:15.960> players<00:01:16.229> need<00:01:16.650> day<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.430> day<00:01:17.520> out<00:01:17.640> I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
those players need day in and day out I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.290 
those players need day in and day out I
think<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.680> can

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
think that that can

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.240 
think that that can
make<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> big<00:01:22.080> difference<00:01:22.260> I<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.980> idea<00:01:23.070> of

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
make a big difference I like the idea of

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.980 
make a big difference I like the idea of
connecting<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.820> dots<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.510> said<00:01:24.750> there

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
connecting the dots that you said there

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.440 
connecting the dots that you said there
and<00:01:25.230> in<00:01:25.680> 1999<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.580> try<00:01:26.760> to<00:01:26.820> connect<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.180> dots<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and in 1999 we try to connect the dots a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.910 
and in 1999 we try to connect the dots a
little<00:01:27.660> bit<00:01:27.780> by<00:01:27.900> starting<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.350> residency

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
little bit by starting the residency

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.030 
little bit by starting the residency
program<00:01:29.310> u-17<00:01:30.000> program<00:01:30.720> down<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.260> bradenton

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.030 
program u-17 program down in bradenton
florida<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.450> program<00:01:33.720> really<00:01:34.470> idea<00:01:34.860> was

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
florida and that program really idea was

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.620 
florida and that program really idea was
putting<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.430> kids<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.910> elite<00:01:36.180> kids<00:01:36.450> across

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
model has been an incredible success I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
model has been an incredible success I
think<00:01:52.500> sometimes<00:01:53.420> we<00:01:54.420> look<00:01:54.720> at<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.290> some

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
think sometimes we look at the some

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.100 
think sometimes we look at the some
parts<00:01:56.730> of<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.940> program<00:01:57.150> that<00:01:57.660> could<00:01:57.930> improve

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
parts of the program that could improve

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.730 
parts of the program that could improve
and<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:59.070> forget<00:01:59.550> that<00:01:59.580> there's<00:02:00.120> been<00:02:00.740> many

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and we forget that there's been many

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.220 
and we forget that there's been many
players<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.910> have<00:02:03.180> spent<00:02:03.990> time<00:02:04.170> in

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
players that have spent time in

players that have spent time in

full<00:02:06.540> national<00:02:06.720> team<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.490> of<00:02:08.550> itself

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
full national team that in and of itself

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.930 
full national team that in and of itself
is<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.929> truly<00:02:10.200> amazing<00:02:10.490> but<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.640> ability

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
is it's truly amazing but the ability

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.230 
is it's truly amazing but the ability
now<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.390> broaden<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.500> base<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.610> have<00:02:14.880> in

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
now to broaden that base and to have in

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.490 
now to broaden that base and to have in
effect<00:02:15.480> more<00:02:16.440> bradington<00:02:16.860> seem<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:18.500> more

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
effect more bradington seem to have more

soccer<00:02:24.390> system<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.170> think<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.070> key<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.550> big<00:02:26.820> part

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
soccer system I think is key a big part

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.020

just<00:02:32.550> playing<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.850> lot<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.090> games<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.300> mean<00:02:33.420> kids

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
just playing a lot of games I mean kids

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.660 
just playing a lot of games I mean kids
love<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.140> play<00:02:34.170> games<00:02:34.350> but<00:02:35.160> obviously<00:02:35.459> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
love to play games but obviously the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.550 
love to play games but obviously the
training<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.330> really<00:02:36.570> what<00:02:36.720> helps<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.170> player

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
training is really what helps a player

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.470 
training is really what helps a player
develop<00:02:37.950> isn't<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.940> true<00:02:39.209> and

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
develop isn't that it's true and

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.760 
develop isn't that it's true and
ironically<00:02:41.060> when<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.330> have<00:02:42.510> had<00:02:42.780> under<00:02:43.260> 15

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
ironically when we have had under 15

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.229 
ironically when we have had under 15
players<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:45.000> youth<00:02:45.570> national<00:02:45.870> team<00:02:46.350> camps

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
players in youth national team camps

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.760 
players in youth national team camps
it's<00:02:48.239> those<00:02:48.630> players<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.170> have<00:02:49.530> actually

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
it's those players that have actually

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.130 
it's those players that have actually
told<00:02:50.489> us<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.209> they<00:02:51.420> play<00:02:51.660> too<00:02:51.720> many<00:02:52.020> games

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
told us that they play too many games

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.770 
told us that they play too many games
and<00:02:52.980> they<00:02:53.370> said<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:54.030> they<00:02:54.480> don't<00:02:54.630> play

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
and they said that they don't play

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.140 
and they said that they don't play
enough<00:02:54.959> good<00:02:55.230> games<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> think<00:02:56.820> when<00:02:57.000> we

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
enough good games and so I think when we

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.510 
enough good games and so I think when we
hear<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.660> message<00:02:57.989> from<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.500> players<00:02:58.709> and

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
hear that message from the players and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.850 
hear that message from the players and
when<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:01.290> many<00:03:01.440> coaches<00:03:01.890> at<00:03:02.370> these<00:03:02.580> clubs

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
when so many coaches at these clubs

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.380 
when so many coaches at these clubs
realize<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.070> that's<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.370> problem<00:03:05.610> but<00:03:05.970> but

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
realize that that's a problem but but

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.020 
realize that that's a problem but but
feel<00:03:06.720> like<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.860> clubs<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.400> they<00:03:08.580> compete

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
feel like the clubs that they compete

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.160 
feel like the clubs that they compete
with<00:03:09.060> all<00:03:09.570> play

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
with all play

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.360 
with all play
270<00:03:11.160> weekend<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.880> think<00:03:12.330> it's<00:03:12.569> it's<00:03:13.010> it's<00:03:14.010> it's

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
270 weekend I think it's it's it's it's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.520 
270 weekend I think it's it's it's it's
created<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.209> situation<00:03:15.420> where<00:03:15.930> everybody<00:03:16.440> is

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
created a situation where everybody is

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.059 
created a situation where everybody is
almost<00:03:17.010> forced<00:03:17.580> down<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.910> wrong<00:03:18.090> path<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:19.069> by

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
almost forced down the wrong path and by

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.400 
almost forced down the wrong path and by
making<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:21.030> strong<00:03:21.330> statement<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:22.140> there

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
making a strong statement that there

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.710 
making a strong statement that there
needs<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.890> be<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.370> better<00:03:24.060> bounce<00:03:24.360> between

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
needs to be a better bounce between

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.620 
needs to be a better bounce between
games<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.739> training<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.610> think<00:03:27.510> it's

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
games and training I think it's

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.330 
games and training I think it's
important<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.350> think<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.770> coaches<00:03:29.040> are

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
important and I think the coaches are

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.729 
important and I think the coaches are
excited<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.330> more<00:03:30.630> opportunity<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.530> work

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
excited to have more opportunity to work

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.070 
excited to have more opportunity to work
with<00:03:31.770> their<00:03:32.040> players<00:03:32.390> all<00:03:33.390> coaches<00:03:33.720> are

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
with their players all coaches are

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.850 
with their players all coaches are
excited<00:03:34.560> when<00:03:34.739> they<00:03:34.860> get<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.220> play<00:03:36.680> good<00:03:37.680> games

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
excited when they get to play good games

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.339 
excited when they get to play good games
competitive<00:03:38.670> games<00:03:38.880> games<00:03:39.569> against<00:03:40.260> teams

competitive games games against teams

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.400 
competitive games games against teams
that<00:03:40.739> will<00:03:41.069> test<00:03:41.550> them<00:03:41.970> at<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.750> highest<00:03:42.930> level

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.690 
that will test them at the highest level

plays<00:05:59.390> to<00:05:59.930> illustrate<00:06:00.440> areas<00:06:01.340> where<00:06:01.550> I<00:06:01.580> think

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
plays to illustrate areas where I think

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.070 
plays to illustrate areas where I think
we<00:06:02.120> can<00:06:02.890> improve<00:06:04.150> throw<00:06:05.150> out<00:06:05.300> ideas<00:06:05.330> as<00:06:06.050> to

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
we can improve throw out ideas as to

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.950 
we can improve throw out ideas as to
what<00:06:06.380> I<00:06:06.440> think<00:06:07.150> they<00:06:08.150> can<00:06:08.180> be<00:06:08.390> doing<00:06:08.780> with

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
what I think they can be doing with

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.170 
what I think they can be doing with
their<00:06:09.140> kids<00:06:09.440> and<00:06:09.650> again<00:06:10.580> there's<00:06:10.880> great

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
their kids and again there's great

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.000 
their kids and again there's great
discussion<00:06:11.900> at<00:06:12.050> that<00:06:12.170> point<00:06:12.440> and<00:06:12.650> then<00:06:12.860> the

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
discussion at that point and then the

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.360 
discussion at that point and then the
more<00:06:13.340> that<00:06:14.150> we<00:06:14.420> engage<00:06:14.750> each<00:06:14.990> other<00:06:15.470> in<00:06:16.160> real

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
more that we engage each other in real

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.150 
more that we engage each other in real
soccer<00:06:16.730> conversations<00:06:17.600> the<00:06:18.110> more<00:06:18.380> we<00:06:18.650> talk

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
soccer conversations the more we talk

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.060 
soccer conversations the more we talk
about<00:06:19.840> things<00:06:20.840> that<00:06:20.990> we<00:06:21.230> see<00:06:21.500> on<00:06:21.650> the<00:06:21.800> field

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
about things that we see on the field

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.240 
about things that we see on the field
then<00:06:22.790> I<00:06:23.170> think<00:06:24.170> it<00:06:24.290> will<00:06:24.410> ensure<00:06:24.800> that<00:06:25.040> we're

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
then I think it will ensure that we're

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.520 
then I think it will ensure that we're
all<00:06:25.490> working<00:06:25.790> in<00:06:26.180> the<00:06:26.420> same<00:06:26.570> direction<00:06:26.750> it

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
all working in the same direction it

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.900 
all working in the same direction it
doesn't<00:06:27.830> get<00:06:27.890> much<00:06:28.040> better<00:06:28.100> learning<00:06:28.610> from

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
doesn't get much better learning from

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.970 
doesn't get much better learning from
USA<00:06:29.360> brazil<00:06:29.540> bring<00:06:30.230> that<00:06:30.410> down<00:06:30.560> to<00:06:30.620> the<00:06:30.800> club
