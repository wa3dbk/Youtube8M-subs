00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
himself which actually this looks like a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.450 
himself which actually this looks like a
character<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.590> entirely<00:01:16.830> sure<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.310> it

is<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:17.939> honestly<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.450> reminds<00:01:18.720> me<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
is but honestly it reminds me of the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.149 
is but honestly it reminds me of the
character<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.530> something<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:19.950> got<00:01:20.040> like

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159

character for something it's got like
eyes<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.670> horns<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> durian

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
eyes and horns but there is the durian

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.859 
eyes and horns but there is the durian
arms<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.270> base<00:01:24.540> body

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
arms and then you have the base body

arms and then you have the base body
right<00:01:25.350> here<00:01:25.549> which<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.850> its<00:01:27.000> own<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.479> looks

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
single elbow joint some swiveling the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.480 
single elbow joint some swiveling the
double<00:01:45.149> hands<00:01:45.509> action<00:01:46.439> he's<00:01:47.009> got<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.369> the

bald right on his head can move up and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.600 
bald right on his head can move up and
down<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.060> around<00:01:51.439> we<00:01:52.439> got<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> little<00:01:52.979> hinge

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
down and around we got a little hinge

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.359 
down and around we got a little hinge
joint<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.240> swiveling<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.829> tight<00:01:56.040> there

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
joint here swiveling really tight there

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.090 
joint here swiveling really tight there
and<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:57.240> single<00:01:57.750> knee<00:01:57.869> joint<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.530> little<00:01:58.950> ball

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and then single knee joint a little ball

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280 
and then single knee joint a little ball
joint<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.610> all<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.240> same<00:02:00.420> stuff<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.020> come

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
joint so all the same stuff we have come

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.770 
joint so all the same stuff we have come
to<00:02:01.500> expect<00:02:01.740> from<00:02:02.070> these<00:02:02.219> figures<00:02:02.549> which<00:02:03.180> is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
to expect from these figures which is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.109 
to expect from these figures which is
that<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.979> mentioned<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.579> pretty<00:02:05.969> much

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
that as I mentioned is like pretty much

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.670 
that as I mentioned is like pretty much
between<00:02:06.299> Figgy<00:02:06.840> arts<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.290> like<00:02:07.469> Power

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
between Figgy arts and like Power

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.499 
between Figgy arts and like Power
Rangers<00:02:07.710> five<00:02:08.069> inch<00:02:08.220> figures<00:02:08.489> then<00:02:09.300> yeah

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
Rangers five inch figures then yeah

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.380 
Rangers five inch figures then yeah
let's<00:02:09.810> go<00:02:09.959> ahead<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.379> put<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.910> drill<00:02:11.910> arms<00:02:12.209> on

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
let's go ahead and put the drill arms on

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.340 
let's go ahead and put the drill arms on
as<00:02:13.260> always<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.830> also<00:02:13.950> does

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
as always it also does

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.290 
as always it also does
with<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.590> helmet<00:02:14.770> obviously<00:02:15.490> but<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.060> can

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
with the helmet obviously but you can

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.360 
with the helmet obviously but you can
store<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:16.960> in<00:02:17.020> there<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.710> already<00:02:18.040> went

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
store it in there so I already went

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.680 
store it in there so I already went
ahead<00:02:18.460> did<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.210> show<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.510> full

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
ahead did that to show the full

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.690 
ahead did that to show the full
transformation<00:02:20.080> now<00:02:21.010> then<00:02:21.220> pop<00:02:21.460> it<00:02:21.580> on<00:02:21.670> here

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
transformation now then pop it on here

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.270 
transformation now then pop it on here
on<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.120> four<00:02:22.380> corners<00:02:23.380> now<00:02:23.950> for<00:02:24.130> whatever

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
on the four corners now for whatever

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.000 
on the four corners now for whatever
reason<00:02:24.850> out<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.780> all<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.260> them<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.590> have<00:02:26.740> had<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
reason out of all of them I have had the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.070 
reason out of all of them I have had the
most<00:02:27.190> difficulty<00:02:27.850> getting<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.630> guy's<00:02:28.840> four

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
most difficulty getting this guy's four

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.900 
most difficulty getting this guy's four
corners<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.470> stick<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.520> doesn't<00:02:30.790> happen

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
corners to stick and it doesn't happen

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.460 
corners to stick and it doesn't happen
when<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.210> put<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.570> on<00:02:31.690> another<00:02:31.930> figure<00:02:32.230> it's

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
when I put it on another figure it's

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.200 
when I put it on another figure it's
just<00:02:32.530> him<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.490> sort<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.790> secured<00:02:34.120> on

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
just him so I have it sort of secured on

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.640 
just him so I have it sort of secured on
there<00:02:34.360> right<00:02:34.480> now<00:02:34.630> but<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.440> like<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.590> always

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
there right now but just like I always

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.760 
there right now but just like I always
pull<00:02:36.280> these<00:02:36.370> down<00:02:36.640> fold<00:02:37.450> them<00:02:37.660> fold<00:02:38.620> this

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
pull these down fold them fold this

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.950 
pull these down fold them fold this
forward<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:40.030> get<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.210> chest<00:02:40.420> Armour<00:02:40.780> and

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
forward you get the chest Armour and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.550 
forward you get the chest Armour and
then<00:02:41.590> let<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.250> let<00:02:42.790> go<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.210> Hat<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:44.290> there

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
then let that let go the Hat and there

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560 
then let that let go the Hat and there
you<00:02:44.680> mainly<00:02:45.040> have<00:02:45.190> during<00:02:46.030> armor<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:46.360> as<00:02:46.480> you

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
you mainly have during armor so as you

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.710 
you mainly have during armor so as you
can<00:02:46.660> see<00:02:46.720> it's<00:02:46.930> sort<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.170> wobbly<00:02:47.620> coming<00:02:48.310> off

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
can see it's sort of wobbly coming off

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.000 
can see it's sort of wobbly coming off
but<00:02:49.720> that's<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.110> essentially<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.650> main<00:02:50.800> look

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
but that's the essentially the main look

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.360 
but that's the essentially the main look
for<00:02:51.250> him<00:02:51.400> I'm<00:02:52.300> gonna<00:02:52.480> do<00:02:52.780> my<00:02:52.960> little<00:02:53.370> panning

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
for him I'm gonna do my little panning

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.830 
for him I'm gonna do my little panning
of<00:02:54.490> him<00:02:54.640> while<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.940> armor<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.240> staying<00:02:55.480> on<00:02:55.570> but

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
of him while the armor is staying on but

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.980 
of him while the armor is staying on but
he<00:02:55.930> looks<00:02:56.140> pretty<00:02:56.350> cool<00:02:56.650> as<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.520> can<00:02:57.670> see<00:02:57.990> but

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
he looks pretty cool as you can see but

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.140 
he looks pretty cool as you can see but
let's<00:02:59.200> go<00:02:59.350> ahead<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.890> put<00:03:00.670> him<00:03:00.730> up<00:03:00.940> on<00:03:01.120> a

let's go ahead and put him up on a
pedestal<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.800> take<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> spin<00:03:03.220> look<00:03:03.550> I'm

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
pedestal and take a spin look I'm

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.520 
pedestal and take a spin look I'm
actually<00:03:03.820> gonna<00:03:04.030> turn<00:03:04.240> him<00:03:04.360> this<00:03:04.540> way<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:05.380> the

actually gonna turn him this way so the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.620 
actually gonna turn him this way so the

by the time we get over here he's facing
you<00:03:07.780> oh<00:03:08.250> right<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:09.670> now<00:03:09.820> let<00:03:10.120> us<00:03:10.150> start<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.950> I

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
you oh right so now let us start like I

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.560 
you oh right so now let us start like I
said<00:03:12.280> he's<00:03:12.460> pretty<00:03:12.670> good<00:03:12.880> looking<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.300> think

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
said he's pretty good looking I think

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.820 
said he's pretty good looking I think
his<00:03:13.690> hit<00:03:13.900> that's<00:03:14.260> not<00:03:14.380> really<00:03:14.590> was<00:03:14.770> talking

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
his hit that's not really was talking

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.290 
his hit that's not really was talking
about<00:03:14.950> him<00:03:15.160> but<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:15.640> think<00:03:15.820> it's<00:03:15.940> head<00:03:16.030> sculpt

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
about him but I think it's head sculpt

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.700 
about him but I think it's head sculpt
looks<00:03:16.390> really<00:03:16.660> good<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.350> sort<00:03:17.650> of

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
looks really good and the sort of

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.980 
looks really good and the sort of
compound<00:03:18.130> look<00:03:18.310> really<00:03:18.550> comes<00:03:18.790> close<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.540> the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
compound look really comes close to the

it's so colourful I can't even handle it
but<00:05:21.140> yeah<00:05:21.290> I'm<00:05:21.440> not<00:05:21.500> sure<00:05:21.650> what<00:05:21.920> that<00:05:21.950> is<00:05:22.100> like

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
but yeah I'm not sure what that is like

but yeah I'm not sure what that is like
I<00:05:22.550> said<00:05:22.730> I<00:05:22.910> haven't<00:05:23.720> actually<00:05:23.960> heard<00:05:24.290> of

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
I said I haven't actually heard of

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.340 
I said I haven't actually heard of
anybody<00:05:24.860> else<00:05:25.040> that<00:05:25.160> I<00:05:25.250> know<00:05:25.310> that<00:05:25.550> has<00:05:25.700> this

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
anybody else that I know that has this

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.440 
anybody else that I know that has this
of<00:05:27.350> having<00:05:27.650> that<00:05:27.740> problem<00:05:27.800> so<00:05:28.550> it<00:05:28.730> could've

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
of having that problem so it could've

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.960 
of having that problem so it could've
very<00:05:29.480> easily<00:05:29.660> just<00:05:29.990> be<00:05:30.350> mine<00:05:30.640> but<00:05:31.640> just<00:05:31.850> be

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
very easily just be mine but just be

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.640 
very easily just be mine but just be
wary<00:05:32.210> of<00:05:32.300> that<00:05:32.510> there's<00:05:32.870> definitely<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.380> chance

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
wary of that there's definitely a chance

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.800 
wary of that there's definitely a chance
that<00:05:33.830> that<00:05:33.950> could<00:05:34.280> happen<00:05:34.400> to<00:05:34.640> you<00:05:34.730> with<00:05:35.600> the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
that that could happen to you with the

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.110 
that that could happen to you with the
arm<00:05:36.440> not<00:05:36.740> fully<00:05:37.220> staying<00:05:37.490> on<00:05:37.670> it's<00:05:37.880> pretty

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
arm not fully staying on it's pretty

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.210 
arm not fully staying on it's pretty
annoying<00:05:38.540> like<00:05:38.810> it'll<00:05:39.050> stay<00:05:39.290> on<00:05:39.320> but<00:05:40.070> it<00:05:40.160> will

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
annoying like it'll stay on but it will

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.100 
annoying like it'll stay on but it will
always<00:05:40.430> be<00:05:40.610> in<00:05:40.880> an<00:05:40.970> up<00:05:41.150> angle<00:05:41.480> because<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:41.810> can't

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
always be in an up angle because I can't

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.190 
always be in an up angle because I can't
get<00:05:42.290> it<00:05:42.410> to<00:05:42.590> stay<00:05:43.130> on<00:05:43.160> all<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:43.760> way<00:05:44.110> but<00:05:45.110> yeah

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
get it to stay on all the way but yeah

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.870 
get it to stay on all the way but yeah
overall<00:05:45.380> I<00:05:45.680> think<00:05:45.920> this<00:05:46.010> is<00:05:46.130> a<00:05:46.160> very<00:05:46.310> solid<00:05:46.700> arm

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
overall I think this is a very solid arm

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.820 
overall I think this is a very solid arm
change<00:05:47.150> figure<00:05:47.480> I'm<00:05:47.960> like<00:05:48.230> booj<00:05:48.440> Inc<00:05:48.650> I'm

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
change figure I'm like booj Inc I'm

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.980 
change figure I'm like booj Inc I'm
which<00:05:49.130> while<00:05:49.280> I<00:05:49.310> like<00:05:49.640> the<00:05:49.820> figure<00:05:50.150> I<00:05:50.360> couldn't

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
which while I like the figure I couldn't

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.870 
which while I like the figure I couldn't
fully<00:05:51.410> recommend<00:05:51.920> as<00:05:52.220> much<00:05:52.400> unless<00:05:52.700> you're<00:05:52.850> a

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
fully recommend as much unless you're a

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.360 
fully recommend as much unless you're a
huge<00:05:53.210> fan<00:05:53.390> of<00:05:53.450> the<00:05:53.660> design<00:05:54.020> because<00:05:54.830> it<00:05:55.160> was

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
huge fan of the design because it was

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.190 
huge fan of the design because it was
just<00:05:55.580> a<00:05:55.670> repaint<00:05:56.060> so<00:05:56.420> you're<00:05:56.630> not<00:05:56.810> getting

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
just a repaint so you're not getting

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.620 
just a repaint so you're not getting
quite<00:05:57.560> as<00:05:57.740> much<00:05:57.950> of<00:05:58.160> a<00:05:58.280> variety<00:05:58.820> in<00:05:59.000> terms<00:05:59.480> of

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
quite as much of a variety in terms of

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.510 
quite as much of a variety in terms of
the<00:05:59.750> armor<00:06:00.110> but<00:06:00.500> this<00:06:00.710> one<00:06:00.890> I<00:06:00.920> can<00:06:01.160> definitely

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
the armor but this one I can definitely

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.740 
the armor but this one I can definitely
recommend<00:06:01.670> whether<00:06:02.180> you're<00:06:02.330> fan<00:06:02.540> of<00:06:02.660> the

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
recommend whether you're fan of the

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.990 
recommend whether you're fan of the
character<00:06:02.900> the<00:06:03.260> design<00:06:03.680> it's<00:06:04.460> definitely<00:06:04.970> a

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
character the design it's definitely a

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.970 
character the design it's definitely a
decent<00:06:05.390> looking<00:06:05.600> figure<00:06:05.840> on<00:06:06.110> its<00:06:06.260> own<00:06:06.500> but

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
decent looking figure on its own but

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.770 
decent looking figure on its own but
also<00:06:07.160> the<00:06:07.430> armor<00:06:07.760> is<00:06:07.910> so<00:06:08.090> different<00:06:08.360> that<00:06:08.570> it

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
also the armor is so different that it

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.500 
also the armor is so different that it
adds<00:06:08.960> a<00:06:09.230> bunch<00:06:09.560> of<00:06:09.740> different<00:06:10.270> armored<00:06:11.270> looks

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
adds a bunch of different armored looks

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.850 
adds a bunch of different armored looks
to<00:06:11.690> all<00:06:11.870> of<00:06:12.020> your<00:06:12.170> current<00:06:12.350> arms<00:06:12.650> change

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
to all of your current arms change

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.430 
to all of your current arms change
