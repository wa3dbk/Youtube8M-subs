let's get started so i made this

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.679 
let's get started so i made this
actually<00:00:27.990> quite<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.590> while<00:00:28.949> ago<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
actually quite a while ago it's a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.500 
actually quite a while ago it's a
croquembouche<00:00:31.650> i'm<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.640> quite<00:00:32.880> sure<00:00:32.910> if<00:00:33.149> i

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
croquembouche i'm not quite sure if i

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.530 
croquembouche i'm not quite sure if i
said<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.020> right<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:35.130> really<00:00:35.760> realized

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
said it right it's not really realized

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.209 
said it right it's not really realized
too<00:00:36.690> compared<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> actual<00:00:37.500> thing<00:00:37.860> but

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
too compared to the actual thing but

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
too compared to the actual thing but
basically<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.760> croquembouche<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
basically a croquembouche is like a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.490 
basically a croquembouche is like a
tower<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.950> puff<00:00:41.910> paste<00:00:42.390> not<00:00:42.750> puff<00:00:42.960> pastry<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
tower of puff paste not puff pastry a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.130 
tower of puff paste not puff pastry a
choux<00:00:43.950> pastry<00:00:44.520> which<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> basically<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
choux pastry which is basically just a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.770 
choux pastry which is basically just a
tower<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.530> cream<00:00:47.039> puffs<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.570> put

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
tower of cream puffs and they just put

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.860 
tower of cream puffs and they just put
decorations<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:50.129> everything<00:00:50.219> but<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.120> made

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
decorations and everything but I made

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.380 
decorations and everything but I made
each<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.379> every<00:00:52.800> individual<00:00:53.460> individual

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
each and every individual individual

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.410 
each and every individual individual
cream<00:00:54.780> puffs<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.680> didn't<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:57.210> well

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420

slacked off on them I also did make the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.000 
slacked off on them I also did make the
base<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.539> rolled<00:01:03.750> out<00:01:03.960> some<00:01:04.290> scrap<00:01:04.710> clay

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.000 
into a cone and I painted it white and
then<00:01:07.770> i<00:01:07.950> stacked<00:01:08.520> every<00:01:09.119> cream<00:01:09.390> puff<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.010> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
then i stacked every cream puff and I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.649 
then i stacked every cream puff and I
put<00:01:11.340> some<00:01:11.610> kind<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.479> white<00:01:12.869> glaze<00:01:13.619> with<00:01:14.659> some

put some kind of white glaze with some

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.710 
put some kind of white glaze with some
blueberries<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.770> some<00:01:17.009> roses<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.659> said

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
blueberries and some roses but as I said

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.690 
blueberries and some roses but as I said
before<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.229> kind<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.770> slacked<00:01:20.159> off<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
before I kind of slacked off on the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.080 
before I kind of slacked off on the
decorations<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.689> did<00:01:21.990> add<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> bow<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.770> top<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:24.030> I

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
glazed it again just to see how it's

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.399 
glazed it again just to see how it's
going<00:04:51.189> to<00:04:51.279> stand<00:04:51.669> and<00:04:52.029> I<00:04:52.659> think<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.020> did<00:04:53.169> pretty

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
going to stand and I think it did pretty

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.619 
going to stand and I think it did pretty
well<00:04:53.729> but<00:04:54.729> it's<00:04:54.909> a<00:04:55.000> little<00:04:55.210> bit<00:04:55.330> clumpy

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
well but it's a little bit clumpy

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.420 
well but it's a little bit clumpy
because<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.080> did<00:04:56.349> add<00:04:56.529> glaze<00:04:56.830> over<00:04:57.009> it<00:04:57.189> once

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
because I did add glaze over it once

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.339 
because I did add glaze over it once
again<00:04:59.490> so<00:05:00.490> i<00:05:00.520> made<00:05:01.029> a<00:05:01.060> pretzel<00:05:01.509> with<00:05:01.900> this<00:05:02.110> one

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
again so i made a pretzel with this one

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.309 
again so i made a pretzel with this one
and<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.650> didn't<00:05:03.039> glaze<00:05:03.849> it<00:05:04.090> over<00:05:04.539> the<00:05:04.719> sugar<00:05:05.020> I

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
and I didn't glaze it over the sugar I

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.929 
and I didn't glaze it over the sugar I
just<00:05:05.650> left<00:05:05.860> it<00:05:06.069> and<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.340> looks<00:05:06.550> much<00:05:06.729> more

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:06.939 
just left it and it looks much more

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.820 
just left it and it looks much more
realistic<00:05:07.360> but<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:07.990> little<00:05:08.199> bits<00:05:08.409> of<00:05:08.529> sugar

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
realistic but the little bits of sugar

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.339 
realistic but the little bits of sugar
still<00:05:09.189> do<00:05:09.400> come<00:05:09.669> off<00:05:09.849> and<00:05:10.210> for<00:05:10.870> this<00:05:10.990> one<00:05:11.199> I

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
still do come off and for this one I

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.079 
still do come off and for this one I
don't<00:05:11.500> know<00:05:11.589> why<00:05:11.770> this<00:05:12.189> parts<00:05:12.520> like<00:05:12.669> perfectly

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:13.089 
don't know why this parts like perfectly

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:14.999 
don't know why this parts like perfectly
fine<00:05:13.389> and<00:05:13.689> then<00:05:13.779> this<00:05:13.930> part<00:05:14.199> just<00:05:14.439> like<00:05:14.650> burned

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
fine and then this part just like burned

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.399 
fine and then this part just like burned
really<00:05:15.819> badly<00:05:16.180> but<00:05:16.629> I<00:05:16.659> still<00:05:16.900> think<00:05:17.110> this<00:05:17.199> came

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
really badly but I still think this came

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.070 
really badly but I still think this came
out<00:05:17.439> pretty<00:05:17.949> realistic<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.779> turned<00:05:19.990> out

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
out pretty realistic and it turned out

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.800 
out pretty realistic and it turned out
better<00:05:20.289> than<00:05:20.409> I<00:05:20.650> thought<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.889> would<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:24.810> then

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
better than I thought it would and then

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.689 
better than I thought it would and then
I<00:05:25.839> have<00:05:26.229> this<00:05:26.409> little<00:05:26.469> marshmallow<00:05:27.279> on<00:05:27.639> a
