how we would love if white captures the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.959 
how we would love if white captures the
pawn<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> d5<00:00:29.630> so<00:00:30.630> instead<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:32.430> were<00:00:32.550> talking

pawn to d5 so instead we were talking
about<00:00:33.030> how<00:00:33.480> white<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.290> play<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.920> move<00:00:35.130> e5<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
about how white can play the move e5 to

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.350 
about how white can play the move e5 to
not<00:00:36.809> give<00:00:37.140> black<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:38.160> he<00:00:38.640> wants<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.149> out

not give black what he wants to get out

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.940

your pieces quickly for which piece of
ours<00:01:03.719> should<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.260> develop<00:01:04.559> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
ours should we develop you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.300 
ours should we develop you
of<00:01:05.189> course<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> Bishop<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.000> f5<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.310> after

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
of course the Bishop to f5 and after

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.890 
of course the Bishop to f5 and after
Bishop<00:01:08.460> f5<00:01:09.200> white<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.470> play<00:01:10.500> Knight<00:01:10.950> f3

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
Bishop f5 white can play Knight f3

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.950 
Bishop f5 white can play Knight f3
well<00:01:12.920> not<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.600> there<00:01:15.600> are<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> lot<00:01:15.930> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
well not can but there are a lot of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.100 
well not can but there are a lot of
possibilities<00:01:16.790> math<00:01:17.790> must<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.990> know

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
possibilities math must but you know

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.469 
possibilities math must but you know
it's<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.740> normal<00:01:20.430> looking<00:01:20.759> developing<00:01:21.299> move

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
it's a normal looking developing move

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.170 
it's a normal looking developing move
and<00:01:21.860> now<00:01:22.860> we're<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> play<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.759> 6<00:01:24.030> of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and now we're going to play a 6 of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.880 
and now we're going to play a 6 of
course<00:01:24.330> before<00:01:24.659> playing<00:01:25.080> easy<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.680> would

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
course before playing easy we would

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.310 
course before playing easy we would
absolutely<00:01:26.460> absolutely<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.600> play

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
absolutely absolutely have to play

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.530 
absolutely absolutely have to play
Bishop<00:01:28.500> f5<00:01:28.950> first<00:01:29.250> because<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.939> play<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.299> 6

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
Bishop f5 first because if we play a 6

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.190 
Bishop f5 first because if we play a 6
immediately<00:01:31.670> then<00:01:32.670> our<00:01:32.850> bishop<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.450> c8<00:01:33.960> gets

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
immediately then our bishop on c8 gets

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.260 
immediately then our bishop on c8 gets
stuck<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> long<00:01:35.130> time<00:01:35.159> very<00:01:35.549> very

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
stuck there for a long time very very

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
stuck there for a long time very very
bad<00:01:36.570> Bishop<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.890> good

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
bad Bishop but now it's good

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.249 
bad Bishop but now it's good
so<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:39.030> controlling<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> very<00:01:39.720> long<00:01:39.900> diagonal

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
so it's controlling a very long diagonal

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.580 
so it's controlling a very long diagonal
h7<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.280> one<00:01:41.430> diagonal<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:42.780> course<00:01:43.079> what

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
h7 to be one diagonal of course what

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.330 
h7 to be one diagonal of course what
develops<00:01:44.040> naturally<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.820> Bishop<00:01:45.299> e2<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
develops naturally with Bishop e2 and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
develops naturally with Bishop e2 and
our<00:01:47.340> next<00:01:47.909> step<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:49.490> play<00:01:50.490> Queen<00:01:50.700> d7<00:01:50.850> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
our next step is to play Queen d7 so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.840 
our next step is to play Queen d7 so
this<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> start<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.380> how<00:01:53.310> you're<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.729> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
this is the start of how you're going to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.120 
this is the start of how you're going to
remember<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.810> well<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.799> it's

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
remember what to do well it's it's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.670 
remember what to do well it's it's
simple<00:01:56.700> we're<00:01:57.689> going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.140> try<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.409> develop

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
simple we're going to try and develop

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.740

because when your pawn storming and

you're advancing your pawns before
playing<00:03:16.530> g4<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.550> have<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.910> watch<00:03:18.090> out<00:03:18.330> for<00:03:18.360> it

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
playing g4 you have to watch out for it

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.860 
playing g4 you have to watch out for it
possible<00:03:19.170> tonight<00:03:19.740> h4<00:03:20.430> here<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.730> knight<00:03:21.420> h4

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
possible tonight h4 here a knight h4

possible tonight h4 here a knight h4
stops<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.440> blocks<00:03:22.650> your<00:03:22.830> pawn<00:03:23.070> your<00:03:23.490> H<00:03:23.670> born

stops and blocks your pawn your H born

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.530 
stops and blocks your pawn your H born
from<00:03:24.180> event<00:03:24.570> advancing<00:03:25.200> therefore<00:03:26.300> it<00:03:27.300> will

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
from event advancing therefore it will

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.410 
from event advancing therefore it will
slow<00:03:27.810> down<00:03:27.840> your<00:03:28.110> attack<00:03:28.820> therefore<00:03:29.820> Bishop

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
slow down your attack therefore Bishop

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.570 
slow down your attack therefore Bishop
e7<00:03:30.720> prevents<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.710> and<00:03:31.980> there's<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.250> second

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
e7 prevents that and there's a second

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.420 
e7 prevents that and there's a second
reason<00:03:32.610> why<00:03:33.000> because<00:03:33.840> after<00:03:34.500> Bishop<00:03:34.650> e7<00:03:35.070> now

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
reason why because after Bishop e7 now

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.580 
reason why because after Bishop e7 now
a3<00:03:35.880> he<00:03:36.030> wants<00:03:36.240> to<00:03:36.360> start<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.870> pawn<00:03:37.080> storming

a3 he wants to start the pawn storming

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.560 
a3 he wants to start the pawn storming

and<00:05:49.870> white<00:05:50.710> is<00:05:50.860> probably<00:05:51.310> very<00:05:51.400> unhappy<00:05:52.120> ER

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
and white is probably very unhappy ER

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.529 
and white is probably very unhappy ER
because<00:05:52.590> there<00:05:53.590> is<00:05:53.940> going<00:05:54.940> it's<00:05:55.180> gonna<00:05:55.330> be

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
because there is going it's gonna be

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.510 
because there is going it's gonna be
very<00:05:55.720> hard<00:05:55.930> for<00:05:56.050> him<00:05:56.229> to<00:05:56.380> continue<00:05:56.680> attacking

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
very hard for him to continue attacking

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.340 
very hard for him to continue attacking
since<00:05:57.970> you<00:05:58.090> can't<00:05:58.300> really<00:05:58.360> open<00:05:58.690> files<00:05:59.080> for

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.550 
his rooks or great squares for his
pieces<00:06:02.700> so<00:06:03.700> b6<00:06:04.090> is<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:04.599> best<00:06:04.810> chance<00:06:05.440> for

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
pieces so b6 is the best chance for

pieces so b6 is the best chance for
white<00:06:06.130> but<00:06:06.460> we<00:06:06.580> can<00:06:06.729> easily<00:06:06.880> kill<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.450> attack

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340

just a quick recap very simple way of

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.690 
just a quick recap very simple way of
remembering<00:06:36.420> it<00:06:37.220> we're<00:06:38.220> going<00:06:38.310> to<00:06:38.370> start<00:06:38.460> from

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
remembering it we're going to start from

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.630 
remembering it we're going to start from
the<00:06:38.790> very<00:06:38.850> beginning<00:06:39.740> after<00:06:40.740> your<00:06:41.400> opponent

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
you can play C six so you got to take

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.360 
you can play C six so you got to take
out<00:06:57.870> Bishop<00:06:58.200> to<00:06:58.320> fi<00:06:58.530> first<00:06:58.770> so<00:06:58.980> when<00:06:59.100> you<00:06:59.190> play

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370
