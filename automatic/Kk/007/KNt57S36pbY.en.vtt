00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
okay just like that the trap is usually

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.190 
okay just like that the trap is usually
or<00:01:30.159> basically<00:01:30.880> set<00:01:31.299> up<00:01:31.420> in<00:01:32.020> this

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
or basically set up in this

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.440 
or basically set up in this
configuration<00:01:32.560> on<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.790> trail<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:37.210> want<00:01:37.390> to

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
configuration on the trail you want to

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.020 
configuration on the trail you want to
keep<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.689> up<00:01:37.780> off<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.080> ground<00:01:38.290> so<00:01:38.650> that<00:01:39.490> it

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
keep it up off the ground so that it

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.069 
keep it up off the ground so that it
doesn't<00:01:40.659> dump

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
doesn't dump

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.200 
doesn't dump
if<00:01:41.170> it<00:01:41.530> rains<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:42.130> won't<00:01:42.280> get<00:01:42.400> muddy<00:01:42.640> around<00:01:43.000> it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
if it rains it won't get muddy around it

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.990 
if it rains it won't get muddy around it
or<00:01:44.200> if<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.829> ground<00:01:45.070> gets<00:01:45.340> cold<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:45.820> won't

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
or if the ground gets cold it won't

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.289 
or if the ground gets cold it won't
freeze<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.570> into<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.869> ground<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:48.130> like<00:01:49.090> to

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
freeze it into the ground I like to

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.149 
freeze it into the ground I like to
actually<00:01:49.540> take<00:01:49.840> sticks<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.680> drive<00:01:50.920> them<00:01:51.040> in

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
actually take sticks and drive them in

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.899 
actually take sticks and drive them in
the<00:01:51.250> ground<00:01:51.430> like<00:01:51.610> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:02.819 

so<00:01:54.909> that's<00:01:55.149> on<00:01:55.540> this<00:01:55.780> side<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:58.360> this<00:01:58.689> side<00:02:01.829> so

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
so that's on this side on this side so

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.980 
so that's on this side on this side so
that<00:02:02.860> it's<00:02:03.189> actually

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
that it's actually

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.830 
that it's actually
thoughts<00:02:05.710> in<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:05.979> ground<00:02:06.220> like<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:06.840> sits

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
thoughts in the ground like that sits

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.729 
thoughts in the ground like that sits
nice<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.200> sturdy

put sticks underneath it to keep it up
off<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.540> ground<00:02:19.690> as<00:02:19.930> well<00:02:20.190> these<00:02:21.190> work

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
off of the ground as well these work

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.410 
off of the ground as well these work
very<00:02:21.459> well<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:23.050> can<00:02:23.230> actually<00:02:24.420> take

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
very well you can you can actually take

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.900 
very well you can you can actually take
this<00:02:25.599> trap<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.680> can<00:02:29.860> pinch<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.640> log

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
this trap you can pinch it on this log

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.979 
this trap you can pinch it on this log
and<00:02:31.209> then<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.170> can<00:02:32.319> actually<00:02:32.890> wire<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:34.630> log

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
and then you can actually wire this log

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.330 
and then you can actually wire this log
to<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> tree<00:02:36.540> pitch<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.900> on<00:02:38.110> there<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.650> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
to a tree pitch this on there in the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.039 
to a tree pitch this on there in the
path<00:02:39.549> of<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.850> squirrel<00:02:42.299> you<00:02:43.299> can<00:02:43.450> actually<00:02:43.630> take

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
path of a squirrel you can actually take

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.199 
path of a squirrel you can actually take
these<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.590> trigger<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:45.910> stretch

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
these this trigger and you can stretch

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.309 
these this trigger and you can stretch
these<00:02:46.450> out<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:48.040> you're<00:02:48.190> covering<00:02:48.549> more<00:02:48.700> area

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
these out so you're covering more area

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.320 
these out so you're covering more area
sometimes<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.470> like<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.739> pound<00:02:51.100> these<00:02:51.400> ends<00:02:52.120> out

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
sometimes I like to pound these ends out

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.930 
sometimes I like to pound these ends out
flap<00:02:52.900> drill<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.769> little<00:02:53.980> hole<00:02:54.130> in<00:02:54.340> them<00:02:54.670> and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
flap drill a little hole in them and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.330 
flap drill a little hole in them and
then<00:02:55.299> run<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.780> piece<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.319> monofilament<00:02:56.650> in

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
then run a piece of monofilament in

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.970 
then run a piece of monofilament in
between<00:02:58.180> them<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:59.110> when<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.650> comes<00:02:59.739> in

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
between them so that when it comes in

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.199 
between them so that when it comes in
there<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.340> animal<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:00.700> actually<00:03:01.000> going<00:03:01.120> to

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
there the animal is actually going to

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:20.910 
there the animal is actually going to
get<00:03:01.330> stuck<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.810> capable<00:03:02.200> really<00:03:02.950> quick<00:03:19.920> so

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
get stuck and capable really quick so

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.210 
get stuck and capable really quick so
you<00:03:21.040> want<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.280> be<00:03:21.370> really<00:03:21.700> careful<00:03:21.910> with<00:03:22.209> these

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
you want to be really careful with these

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.819 
you want to be really careful with these
and<00:03:24.220> that's<00:03:24.930> basically<00:03:25.930> setting<00:03:26.440> up<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.650> one

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
and that's basically setting up a one

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.949 
and that's basically setting up a one
pin<00:03:27.100> trap<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.700> really<00:03:28.090> should<00:03:28.269> have<00:03:28.299> somebody

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
pin trap I really should have somebody

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.620 
pin trap I really should have somebody
teach<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.829> exactly<00:03:30.489> where<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.000> put<00:03:31.299> it

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
teach you exactly where to put it

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.870 
teach you exactly where to put it
setting<00:03:32.170> up<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.440> trap<00:03:32.709> that's<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:33.280> is<00:03:33.489> 10%

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
setting up the trap that's just is 10%

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.680 
setting up the trap that's just is 10%
of<00:03:34.209> it

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.980 

the<00:03:36.930> other<00:03:37.080> 90%<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:39.030> can't<00:03:39.270> just<00:03:39.540> take<00:03:39.660> one<00:03:39.870> of

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
the other 90% you can't just take one of

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.120 
the other 90% you can't just take one of
these<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.440> set<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.800> middle<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.040> a

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
these and set it in the middle of a

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.860 
these and set it in the middle of a
field<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:42.080> expect<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:44.210> trap<00:03:45.210> an<00:03:45.360> animal<00:03:45.420> you

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
field and expect to trap an animal you

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.130 
field and expect to trap an animal you
need<00:03:46.020> to<00:03:46.110> place<00:03:46.350> it<00:03:46.430> where<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.460> animal<00:03:47.850> lives

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
need to place it where the animal lives

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.280 
need to place it where the animal lives
so<00:03:49.940> this<00:03:50.940> Bobby<00:03:51.180> flew<00:03:51.450> from<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.930> quick<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.260> a

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
so this Bobby flew from a quick to a

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.930 
so this Bobby flew from a quick to a
door<00:03:52.560> if<00:03:52.830> you're<00:03:53.070> not<00:03:53.190> always<00:03:53.370> prepared

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
door if you're not always prepared

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.960 
door if you're not always prepared
you're<00:03:54.300> never<00:03:54.480> prepared

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.030 

you
