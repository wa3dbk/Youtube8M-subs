down the same fiber and has a lot of

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.020 
down the same fiber and has a lot of
it's<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.520> enables<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.000> 3d<00:00:36.329> broadcast

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
it's what enables a 3d broadcast

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.400 
it's what enables a 3d broadcast
configuration<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.719> that's<00:00:39.870> irwindale

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
configuration so that's irwindale

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.880 
configuration so that's irwindale
speedway<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> let's<00:00:49.260> take<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> look<00:00:49.649> here<00:00:49.680> on

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
speedway so let's take a look here on

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.590 
speedway so let's take a look here on
the<00:00:49.980> back<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> camera<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.879> HDFC<00:00:51.360> eyes

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the back of the camera the to HDFC eyes

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.260 
the back of the camera the to HDFC eyes
you<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:51.960> there<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.969> signal<00:00:53.969> when<00:00:54.120> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you see there one is a signal when is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.380 
you see there one is a signal when is
genlock<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.469> power<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:57.149> last

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
genlock that's power and that last

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.810 
genlock that's power and that last
connector<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.680> remote<00:00:59.370> control

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
connector there is the remote control

connector there is the remote control
for<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.059> camera<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.899> shade<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.469> from

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
for the camera so you can shade it from

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.880 
for the camera so you can shade it from
the<00:01:02.219> truck<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.809> looking<00:01:04.080> at<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> HD<00:01:04.589> FA

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
see right there and the other lens has a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.040 
see right there and the other lens has a
similar<00:02:19.790> cable<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.360> goes<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.840> zoom

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
similar cable that goes to the zoom

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.030 
similar cable that goes to the zoom
handle<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.970> then<00:02:22.970> there's<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.959> second<00:02:24.860> cable

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
handle and then there's the second cable

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.620 
handle and then there's the second cable
there<00:02:25.280> actually<00:02:25.580> connects<00:02:25.880> each<00:02:26.120> lens<00:02:26.420> to

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
there actually connects each lens to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.710 
there actually connects each lens to
each<00:02:26.750> other<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:28.239> there's<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.300> little<00:02:29.540> just

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
each other and there's a little just

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.449 
each other and there's a little just
digital<00:02:30.200> display<00:02:30.560> on<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.800> back<00:02:30.980> there<00:02:31.250> that

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
digital display on the back there that

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:40.840 
digital display on the back there that
you<00:02:31.580> use<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.850> set<00:02:32.269> up<00:02:32.390> offsets<00:02:39.580> that's<00:02:40.580> me

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
you use to set up offsets that's me

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.050 
you use to set up offsets that's me
eating<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.300> lot<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.750> rubber<00:02:42.370> one<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:46.030> one<00:02:47.030> of

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
eating a lot of rubber one of the one of

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.860 
eating a lot of rubber one of the one of
the<00:02:47.180> downsides<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.140> job<00:02:48.440> is<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:49.810> lot<00:02:50.810> of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
the downsides of this job is a lot of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.330 
the downsides of this job is a lot of
noise<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.780> yeah<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:57.380> constant<00:02:57.950> cleaning<00:02:58.220> that

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
noise so yeah you constant cleaning that

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.920 
noise so yeah you constant cleaning that
mirror<00:02:58.519> box<00:02:58.760> on<00:02:59.000> these<00:02:59.150> events<00:02:59.450> but<00:02:59.720> we're

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
mirror box on these events but we're

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.289 
mirror box on these events but we're
only<00:03:00.049> out<00:03:00.200> there<00:03:00.530> as<00:03:00.860> convergence<00:03:01.310> pullers<00:03:01.820> to

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
only out there as convergence pullers to

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.880 
only out there as convergence pullers to
set<00:03:02.540> up<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.780> rig<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:02.989> do<00:03:03.350> our<00:03:03.380> initial

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
set up the rig and do our initial

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.069 
set up the rig and do our initial
alignment<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:04.489> then<00:03:04.640> we<00:03:05.420> head<00:03:05.600> back<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.989> the

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
alignment and then we head back to the

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.530 
alignment and then we head back to the
trucks<00:03:06.519> let's<00:03:07.519> take<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.730> look<00:03:07.940> here<00:03:07.970> inside<00:03:08.360> the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
convergence truck as we call it there

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.069 
convergence truck as we call it there
are<00:03:11.540> 10<00:03:12.110> or<00:03:12.350> 11<00:03:12.709> convergence<00:03:13.250> stations<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:14.079> at

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
are 10 or 11 convergence stations and at

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.620 
are 10 or 11 convergence stations and at
each<00:03:15.290> station<00:03:15.680> you'll<00:03:16.070> see<00:03:16.280> there<00:03:16.519> three<00:03:17.390> sets

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
each station you'll see there three sets

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.100 
each station you'll see there three sets
of<00:03:17.750> screens<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:19.660> reality<00:03:20.660> technica

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
of screens and a reality technica

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.130 
of screens and a reality technica
handset<00:03:21.850> so<00:03:22.850> these<00:03:23.239> display<00:03:23.630> lots<00:03:23.959> of

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
handset so these display lots of

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.870 
handset so these display lots of
information<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.950> see<00:03:25.340> there's<00:03:25.519> someone's

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
information you see there's someone's

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.840 
information you see there's someone's
cleaning<00:03:26.269> lens<00:03:26.570> but<00:03:27.560> yeah<00:03:28.010> there's<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.400> stereo

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
cleaning lens but yeah there's a stereo

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.580 
cleaning lens but yeah there's a stereo
analysis<00:03:29.570> that<00:03:29.750> shows<00:03:29.810> you<00:03:30.140> your<00:03:30.290> death

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
analysis that shows you your death

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.620 
analysis that shows you your death
budget<00:03:31.010> they're<00:03:31.220> negative<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:31.970> positive<00:03:32.000> and

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
budget they're negative to positive and

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.080 
budget they're negative to positive and
if<00:03:32.930> you're<00:03:33.079> exceeding<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.650> we<00:03:34.519> always<00:03:34.730> usually

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
if you're exceeding it we always usually

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.789 
if you're exceeding it we always usually
have<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.690> difference<00:03:36.110> mode<00:03:36.320> there<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:36.680> can

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
have the difference mode there you can

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.640 
have the difference mode there you can
see<00:03:36.829> the<00:03:37.040> rig's<00:03:37.280> pretty<00:03:37.579> well<00:03:37.790> aligned<00:03:38.090> and

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
see the rig's pretty well aligned and

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.440 
see the rig's pretty well aligned and
then<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:39.799> also<00:03:39.950> have<00:03:40.130> that's<00:03:40.730> that's<00:03:41.150> where<00:03:41.359> we

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
then we also have that's that's where we

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.560 
then we also have that's that's where we
make<00:03:41.630> all<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:42.019> adjustments<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:43.489> optical<00:03:44.000> and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
make all the adjustments the optical and

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.990 
make all the adjustments the optical and
some<00:03:45.260> mechanical<00:03:45.890> adjustments<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.519> the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
some mechanical adjustments and the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.360 
some mechanical adjustments and the
handsets<00:03:47.480> actually<00:03:47.870> it's<00:03:48.620> just<00:03:48.799> that<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.190> can

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
handsets actually it's just that you can

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.400 
handsets actually it's just that you can
use<00:03:49.820> your<00:03:50.000> mouse<00:03:50.209> if<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.570> want<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.049> it's<00:03:51.290> a

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
use your mouse if you want but it's a

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.660 
use your mouse if you want but it's a
much<00:03:51.560> better<00:03:51.829> way<00:03:52.040> of<00:03:52.070> pulling<00:03:52.430> the

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
much better way of pulling the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.200 
much better way of pulling the

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.420 
cameras and give us instructions and
stuff<00:04:05.020> so<00:04:06.020> the<00:04:06.290> store<00:04:06.560> closes<00:04:06.890> while<00:04:07.280> we're

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
stuff so the store closes while we're

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.360 
stuff so the store closes while we're
shooting<00:04:07.610> so<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.230> we<00:04:09.230> can<00:04:09.410> concentrate<00:04:09.800> and

that's<00:04:10.490> a<00:04:10.670> work<00:04:11.300> area<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:12.370> let's<00:04:13.370> take<00:04:13.550> a<00:04:13.610> peek

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
that's a work area and let's take a peek

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:29.950 
that's a work area and let's take a peek
outside<00:04:14.300> see<00:04:14.750> what's<00:04:14.900> going<00:04:15.080> on
