00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.479
 hello friends today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.280
 delicious sponge cake Genovese the sponge cake 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.799
 that do not drink is going to be in our fund 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.230
 of cupboard in the cupcakes because we 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.969
 will serve to prepare many 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.980
 pies because it supports any filling 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.810
 that we want to put even that what 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.810
 let's go with a delicious syrup 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.369
 to prepare our Genoese sponge cake 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.079
 we are going to need very few ingredients 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.449
 as we can see only three 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.260
 ingredients we are going to need 5 eggs 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.660
 large size 250 grams of flour 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.730
 pastry that we have already sifted 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.820
 that is very important the flour must 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.860
 be sifted and 250 grams of sugar 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.510
 with these three ingredients we are going to 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.510
 make a delicious sponge cake 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.240
 The first thing we are going to do is with the 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.940
 help of an electric mixer 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:00.420
 preferably we are going to lay the eggs 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.060
 whole is also important that the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.520
 eggs and flour the sugar have the 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.800
 same temperature that helps the 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.590
 eggs go riding with much more 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.479
 ease 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.530
 take advantage of everything we have 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.530
 very well washed hands 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.390
 that we do not have an electric mixer 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.180
 because on the one hand we are going to beat the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.340
 clear at the point of snow and on the other hand 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.510
 the yolk together with the sugar until it 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.650
 are frothy yes and look like 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.650
 to have gone up is a world 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.200
 eggs 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.200
 we put the sugar 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.470
 and we're going to beat it, we're going to have it 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.750
 beating for about 7 or 8 minutes 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.750
 assemble and minimize your volume 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.320
 ah 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.330
 Well, we have already assembled well 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.460
 our eggs with sugar look at what 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.460
 aspect has been so great 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.350
 we're going to put it to a minimum and we're going to go 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.540
 little by little incorporating the flour 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.600
 and we do not have the machine as before 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.790
 or that for now this same this the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.400
 we would incorporate flour with rods 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.050
 and with little enveloping movements to 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.390
 little until it was well integrated 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.670
 we will not add a following spoonful 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.830
 until it is not well integrated 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.069
 tell you that while I have been 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.590
 mounted the eggs I prepared a mold 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.500
 is more non-stick with which I have 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.830
 put a vegetable paper base 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.080
 in the background and another and other strips of 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.090
 plant paper also around what 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.310
 I painted with a little butter and 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.100
 I already have it ready and I have also 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.540
 set to preheat the oven to 170 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.120
 degrees heat up and down 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.310
 because my oven has the function 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.920
 fan we have no function 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.920
 Fan up and down 180 degrees 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.870
 let's add the rest of the flour that 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.640
 let us stay 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.860
 if we are going to wait for it to be 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.090
 also well integrated and we can already 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.090
 see our mold 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.640
 we have already removed it from the machine and with 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.260
 enveloping movements we are going to finish 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.160
 to mix well the flour that has 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.160
 stayed by the walls 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.730
 it has a very fluffy texture this 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.560
 very light cake because it does not carry 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.540
 no type of fat with which 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.090
 the end result for a snack 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.150
 breakfast is an ideal cake but on 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.690
 everything so that it serves as a sponge cake 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.140
 for a wonderful cake we're going to 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.090
 to put 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.090
 all the mix of our sponge cake 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.020
 I already have it well put in the mold 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.460
 we give a slight sway this always 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.190
 blows so that the mass sits well 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.250
 This mold has 25 centimeters of 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.620
 diameter for a cake split by the 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.200
 half and filled the measurement is perfect 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.299
 If we want to make big cakes, 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.150
 We can put two smaller molds or 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.850
 three and bake it individually and 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.720
 so we do not have to split it by the 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.750
 half let's bake it for 25 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.940
 minutes at 170 degrees accord you heat 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.150
 up and down and fan if not 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.460
 We have a 180 degree heat fan 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.860
 up and down 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.840
 Well, it's been 25 minutes already 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.210
 we have our baked sponge cake 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.120
 say that after 25 minutes 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.310
 checking that is already cooked me 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.960
 like to leave it between 5 and 7 minutes 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.699
 inside the oven with the door 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.160
 ajar for the change of 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.319
 temperature is not too rough when not 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.180
 carry no enhancer as only 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.370
 with the air of the sponge cake and that 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.849
 go down as little as possible has been very 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.030
 fluffy and delicious when you're 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.979
 we're going to completely chill and 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.500
 then decorate putting a little bit of 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.449
 sugar icing on top and some anises 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.550
 crashed and some cinnamon sticks that 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.259
 I have here even if it's a simple sponge cake 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.830
 It is always convenient to bring it to the table 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:27.810
 as beautiful as possible and we'll have it 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.940
 good friends, we are already cold 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.800
 Genoese cake and as I said for 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.840
 present it to the table what sprinkled 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.090
 with a little icing sugar I put 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.180
 some cinnamon sticks and some flowers 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.890
 a star anise and we have it ready 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.830
 to drink it with good coffee with milk 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.860
 or a cool tail, try it 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.860

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.540
 and
