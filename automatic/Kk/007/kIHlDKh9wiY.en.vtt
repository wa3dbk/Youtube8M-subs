 triumph ' yes I think it was something that 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.500
 they put the square that 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.319
 it broadcasts without internet 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.649
 my father saw it wrong when 'operation 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:24.470
 triumph 'what some of the artists 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.299
 of the first edition managed to win 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.640
 life with it in the following 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.549
 issues increasingly were less than 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.250
 they succeeded in highlighting successively was each 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:38.950
 more difficult to be popular and let's not 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.630
 and to settle as an international artist 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.549
 where do you want to go all this is very 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.250
 confused the new generation of 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.439
 triunfitos looked at the previous and every time 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.110
 they entered more with the intention of petar 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.500
 what the previous ones that to fulfill their 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.929
 precious musical dream in the same way 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.259
 many youtubers today begin to 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.960
 start in this social network thinking about 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.929
 how much they want to be famous and that 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.960
 The wet panties plasticize your photos 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.929
 in the folder and less in if really 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.930
 they have something to say something to offer 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:18.940
 you think you have something to offer to 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.980
 anacleto and that of things do not try to 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.200
 dupe nor with technicalities damn voice 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.940
 tell me now how to succeed on youtube 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.650
 I've been an hour since it makes me 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.450
 made the channel and I still have pictures of 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.760
 tits or anything there are three ways to 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.849
 succeed on youtube the first of them 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.340
 is eating asses with a lot of emphasis on 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.530
 all those with more than 50,000 subs 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.760
 Save saliva for those who have more than 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.189
 100,000 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.799
 you will have to dedicate many hours of 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.810
 unjustified rally the most normal is 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.390
 that they ignore you well because your content 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.849
 be it shit or because your faults 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.980
 spelling be criminal or just 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.440
 because they receive many meals from eyelet 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.049
 a day and can not cope yet 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.420
 there is always the remote possibility of 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.780
 that in one of these to one you fall is a 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.349
 not very nice and I owe you giving way to 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.720
 an affluent of its river of subscribers 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.319
 directed towards your person could do 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.489
 that 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.620
 dignity where it comes from and many are the 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.650
 examples of people to whom this has 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.900
 worked but the drawback is that 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.970
 little will last if you are not able to 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.730
 manage it properly and most 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.430
 It's likely that you, like so many others 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.970
 Soon you will be forgotten which 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.760
 broken triumph of ot 5 another way is 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.980
 parody and mockingly mocking the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.319
 malotes and inbreeding that are the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.810
 main youtubers of this country and 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.700
 when their ego makes them react to 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.340
 your attack your vote pair 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.590
 of your subscribers could do that if 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.660
 the capacity for young self-criticism for 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.209
 ba one is not something that everyone 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.360
 own so it's very likely that by 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.550
 this way becomes something like 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.650
 what you criticized you think that what 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.290
 you have everything done because you have three 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.780
 weeks waiting for you and accommodate you like a 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.280
 lord rivalries much reus 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.280
 and principles where several principles 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.350
 good to close the door with the third 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.419
 way is to start from scratch create 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.490
 content without thinking of itself what now 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.919
 you're doing is what's in fashion is 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.350
 put yourself before the opinion of your friends and 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.570
 Know your limits and where you can 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.630
 really get there with that trial and error 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.850
 learn along the way do not give up having 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.919
 patience and wait for that click that 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.770
 moment when suddenly you have your 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.870
 own voice your own style and you take that 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.240
 material that a friend passes to another 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.060
 friend and this one to another and not pure spam 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.030
 but because they really like them makes them 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.669
 laugh or find it funny works and 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.919
 think about what you do plans you organize 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.419
 your creations and do not follow trend 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.610
 make yours 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.680
 after years of chopping rock to feel 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.290
 proud of what you do you will have your 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.690
 place in this circus and what is better 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.830
 reality will be solid and true to what you 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.830
 really worth 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.130
 to fuck it's worth nothing thanks young
