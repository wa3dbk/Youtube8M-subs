00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.160
 new reno sandero stepway 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.600
 managed to surprise even before 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.840
 direct acquaintance with 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.679
 whether the car is a joke for 25 thousand 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.630
 rubles is cheaper than its predecessor 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.609
 but the train on it became clear that this 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.949
 the car can surprise not only the price 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.109
 oddly enough but one of the main 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.510
 The benefits of the previous stepway were 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.820
 that in addition to increased clearance he had 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.250
 version with a gun which is not so 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.840
 Enough Logan 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.120
 one of the most affordable cars with 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.920
 automatic transmission on the market is not in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.600
 the model's favor played rather peculiar 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.989
 design that came to taste 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.570
 far from all the newcomer is clearly prettier 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.250
 Unlike regular sander with to play as 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.730
 and earlier got a pseudo off-road 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.890
 body kit 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.379
 door sill extenders 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.340
 unpainted plastic arches and new 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.350
 stylish bumper 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.600
 but what is interesting is the design 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.820
 front end only applies 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.160
 on cars for russian and brazilian 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.260
 markets a new sandero stepway and really 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.030
 looks like a small crossover and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.920
 pretty stylish not painted plastic 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.020
 around the perimeter of the lower part of the body 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 composite bumpers and more massive 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.400
 railings than before emphasize share 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.890
 brutality which is so thorough to him 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.750
 planted its creators seemingly 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.090
 few strokes and here's the target 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.979
 car audience has already changed from 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.869
 humble manager or housewife 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.090
 for lovers of outdoor activities and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.080
 travel want to pay attention to 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.060
 wheel disks 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.220
 even in the base steel 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.259
 the wheels are no different in appearance 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.630
 cast secret in a special form 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.549
 stamping and imitating caps 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.829
 alloy wheel compared to 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.570
 ordinary sander interior stp and not 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.369
 changed unless new ones appeared 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.890
 seats created specifically for this 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.380
 models with the original molding design 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.270
 and embroidered place logo play and here 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.560
 appeared ornament on the digitization 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.750
 speedometer and tachometer 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.579
 clearly worsened their informativeness in 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.649
 the rest is all the same sandero with 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.780
 its pluses and minuses the same 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.759
 inexpensive plastic but good ergonomics 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.280
 high seating though new seats 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.290
 seemed more comfortable but the rear 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.909
 passengers from warm continue to tolerate 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.310
 with a modest margin of space for 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.500
 lap and large central tunnel a 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.319
 Here is the trunk surprised by the fact that despite 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.060
 right shape and nice up 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.530
 he is for his class of developers 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.269
 somehow regretted the plastic lining 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.549
 on the lower part of the doorway 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.290
 imagine what will happen to this painted 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.069
 metal after even half a year 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.659
 operation 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.730
 when through it will constantly carry 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.260
 bags and suitcases 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.659
 loading height and absence 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.670
 we will write off various fastenings of pockets 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:36.159
 on the layout feature and low 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.280
 the cost of the car itself technical 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:41.209
 specifications 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.430
 engine capacity of 1.6 liters capacity 82 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.900
 horsepower and 30 thousand revolutions per 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.469
 a minute 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.810
 torque 134 newton meter three 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:52.370
 2800 rpm minute ground clearance 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.129
 one hundred and ninety five millimeters 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.370
 maximum speed of 165 kilometers in 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:00.919
 hour average fuel consumption of 7.3 liters per 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.079
 100 kilometers on the move new sandero 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.939
 stepway is surprised that he is in principle and 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.159
 used to have a stunning leg 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.079
 suspension capacity but now he also 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.930
 began to behave better on the track 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.819
 due to the fact that engineers are slightly under 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.400
 gathered pursed suspension she became 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.069
 a little tougher but important 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.519
 it is striking that now the new Sanders 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.099
 to play 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.109
 ground clearance is 195 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.489
 millimeters so parameters can 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.620
 boast not every good 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.449
 SUV why am I so sharp 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.099
 attention to clearance yes because it 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.060
 really very good help 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.280
 for tap dance and 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.009
 storming and stony paths in the mountains 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.109
 Greece sometimes looking very scary 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:39.530
 the car was moving slowly but surely 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.479
 forward 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.939
 never hooking big and sharp 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:46.430
 stones of opportunity were limited only 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.799
 coupling properties of tires that are fast 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.780
 clogged wet ground and of course 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.759
 obviously not enough all-wheel drive 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.739
 as for the engines here 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.479
 you need to clearly define how you 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.909
 are going to operate the car 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:01.099
 if only in the city then more than 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.840
 there will be enough 8 valve engine 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.299
 overpay for more powerful no 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.489
 no point if supposed 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.989
 frequent trips on the highway and raids on 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.629
 what no off road 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.699
 it is better to add and buy 16 valve 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.889
 base engine version will not 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.509
 grab torque on bottoms that 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.199
 make it difficult to overcome difficult 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.449
 obstacles 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.289
 summing up I want to say that the new 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.690
 sandero stepway 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.440
 has now even more trumps on his 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.300
 account 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.370
 when compared to its predecessor then 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.200
 newcomer boasts much more 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.200
 rich equipment and heated windshield 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.970
 glass and navigation and heated seats and 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.610
 good multimedia system 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.830
 by the way specifically for stepway engineers 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.050
 equipped with a stabilization system function 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.730
 prevent tipping sorry here 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.860
 automatic transmission only 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.990
 disappeared from the list of complete sets though 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.420
 company spokesman promise that this 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.370
 just a matter of time to wait 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.290
 not for long as in the case with the previous one 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.330
 the generation of sander foot and never ceases 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.370
 surprise and not so much accessibility 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.650
 how much is the ratio between price and 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.080
 the amount of car its quality 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.580
 now added to this list even if 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.580
 so you can say off-road potential
