00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.420
 instructions for using the machine smoke 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.019
 the car comes all very kind of separately 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.429
 comes such a unit comes separately 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.609
 liquid container of which 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.810
 it turns out smoke and come separately such 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.510
 the straws are actually straws that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.820
 have a diameter of 8 millimeters they are perfect 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.650
 fit for you think and 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.080
 so that these tubes turned into details 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.620
 before the car is necessary for 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.910
 this harmonica for example cut off part 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.100
 which goes to spout choose 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.079
 color that suits you 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.079
 the second detail you cut about such 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.739
 height in order to get part 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.469
 which we go air here and 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.239
 it turns out so yes the car at the smoke machine 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.320
 there is a control such as keys 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.320
 turn on and 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:10.020
 as if the key that boosts 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:15.479
 fluid to the organ that does 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:20.869
 the smoke itself is poured 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.869
 liquid in the part where it is written feel 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.390
 pouring out the waste liquid from 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.719
 written place to charge 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.399
 here the liquid must take a bottle 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:45.110
 with liquid 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:46.970
 separate the gold separate the protective 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.119
 flew 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.100
 screw this cap here 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:59.009
 I already have this ready 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.649
 how much we remove the protective spout 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:06.659
 cap 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:12.920
 open the plug on the hole of whom 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.920
 called fil pour liquid there 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.200
 the liquid is poured so that when 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.599
 cap level closed reached 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.599
 it was him 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:32.900
 when you protrude fluid from here 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:37.400
 arrives at the element that converts 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.209
 this liquid is smoke and smoke comes out through this 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.730
 empty waste tube 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.670
 flows back and accumulates in the tank 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.430
 where is it written mwt and after a few 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.390
 speeches 5-6 speeches required 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.930
 just open and pour what is there 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.200
 it has accumulated as far as 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.720
 use is also necessary 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.040
 know what to insert here are needed 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.450
 batteries 6 aaa batteries 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.200
 that is, a finger-type battery is not 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.890
 Mizinchikovye for this need to unscrew 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.790
 one bolt 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.400
 neatly open and insert one by one 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.049
 6 batteries to insert here 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.239
 battery and you need these 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.400
 partitions in the amount of three pieces 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.250
 lie that is, this is the lowest 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.620
 the middle one and this top one 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.799
 partition in this case here will be 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.180
 go in and batteries it will be much 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.390
 more economically worn while using 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.590
 batteries 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.010
 observing the polarity insert all 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.010
 batteries 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:01.400
 we put in place the battery cover 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:06.409
 the compartment and back and I screw it up 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:10.040
 working hard now up the car 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:13.129
 ready to work include in this case 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.970
 the light bulb comes on and that means already 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.680
 Now the batteries are running and they will 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.720
 work all the time while turn on 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.510
 switch so if you don't 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.030
 use for the number in the car and 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.150
 you must turn off now you can see 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:36.889
 that smoke filled the smoke machine 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:38.900
 and you can already blow smoke into the bubble after 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.889
 you can give out one more 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.410
 movement or two 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.470
 to pump up or pump up three 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.919
 liquid formed a very thick white 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.919
 smoke 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.070
 it can be visually seen literally 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.650
 two or three well maybe five seconds and 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.330
 again, you can issue 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.340
 so that the bubble does not burst when 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.740
 you blow them up with smoke machines 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.110
 be sure to wet the spout which 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.060
 dip into the bubble 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.060
 moisten in a solution for soap bubbles and 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.880
 this way as many times as 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.639
 necessary you press during the number 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.669
 after that, do not forget to turn off 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.870
 after you turned off i usually 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:26.419
 I keep this table 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:28.280
 this car there is not on the table for 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.900
 the whole room and on the floor 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.970
 in order not to fall because when 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:37.460
 from the table falls to the car, then it can 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.789
 batteries are usually damaged 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.770
 break off battery cover 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:48.289
 or there may be some other violations 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.080
 Here, but during the number you need to follow 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.270
 so that not the audience could not bear waved 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.650
 her on the floor with a table because everything 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.340
 still some time on the table 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.320
 while you show smoke tricks 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.470
 it requires special 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.600
 firstly 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:10.350
 do not take hands that are in solution for 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.750
 smoke machine second after performances 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.820
 when you come home do not need to wash it 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:22.760
 water or need a third wipe 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:27.830
 dry with a rag during transportation usually 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.830
 take out all the ducts
