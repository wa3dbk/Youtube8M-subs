take<00:03:15.360> an<00:03:15.480> age<00:03:15.570> from<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.200> try

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.720 

I<00:03:23.930> don't<00:03:24.930> really<00:03:25.260> think<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:25.710> I<00:03:25.740> mean<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.550> an

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
I don't really think so I mean it is an

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.690 
I don't really think so I mean it is an
edge<00:03:27.000> if<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.780> can<00:03:27.960> make<00:03:28.320> people<00:03:28.500> like<00:03:29.280> having

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
edge if you can make people like having

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.020 
edge if you can make people like having
you<00:03:29.790> at<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.000> table<00:03:31.490> then<00:03:32.490> that<00:03:32.640> since<00:03:32.850> that's

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
you at the table then that since that's

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.940 
you at the table then that since that's
an<00:03:33.150> advantage<00:03:33.270> if<00:03:33.990> people<00:03:34.260> want<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.740> be<00:03:34.860> at

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
an advantage if people want you to be at

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.260 
an advantage if people want you to be at
the<00:03:35.040> table<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.520> whatever<00:03:35.730> reason<00:03:36.030> because

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
the table for whatever reason because

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.570 
the table for whatever reason because
the<00:03:36.900> famous<00:03:37.350> or<00:03:37.680> because<00:03:38.010> they<00:03:38.250> think<00:03:38.310> they

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
the famous or because they think they

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.430 
the famous or because they think they
can<00:03:38.760> hook<00:03:38.940> up<00:03:39.090> with<00:03:39.240> you<00:03:39.360> or<00:03:39.630> they<00:03:40.140> were<00:03:40.260> like

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
can hook up with you or they were like

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.990 
can hook up with you or they were like
you're<00:03:40.590> just<00:03:40.740> nice<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:40.980> them<00:03:41.310> they<00:03:41.760> are<00:03:41.790> with

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
you're just nice to them they are with

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.360 
you're just nice to them they are with
then<00:03:42.810> then<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.260> subconscious<00:03:43.740> typically

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
then then the subconscious typically

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.800 
then then the subconscious typically
gonna<00:03:44.580> want<00:03:44.790> your<00:03:44.880> own<00:03:44.940> lava<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:45.630> that's

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
gonna want your own lava so that's

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.120 
gonna want your own lava so that's
that's<00:03:46.110> an<00:03:46.350> edge<00:03:46.470> but<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.710> don't<00:03:46.890> think<00:03:46.950> it's

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
that's an edge but I don't think it's

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.770 
that's an edge but I don't think it's
only<00:03:47.400> something<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:47.790> mean<00:03:48.060> if<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.450> woman<00:03:48.690> is

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
only something that I mean if a woman is

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.240
