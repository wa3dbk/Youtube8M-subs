so<00:01:11.299> how<00:01:11.509> has<00:01:11.720> teachers<00:01:12.079> can<00:01:12.259> we<00:01:12.409> facilitate<00:01:12.590> a

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
so how has teachers can we facilitate a

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.580 
so how has teachers can we facilitate a
growth<00:01:13.430> mindset<00:01:13.840> Dweck<00:01:14.840> says<00:01:15.140> that<00:01:15.320> we<00:01:15.409> can

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
growth mindset Dweck says that we can

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.289 
growth mindset Dweck says that we can
facilitate<00:01:15.799> a<00:01:16.250> growth<00:01:16.549> mindset<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.210> our

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
facilitate a growth mindset and our

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.149 
facilitate a growth mindset and our
students<00:01:17.780> by<00:01:17.930> giving<00:01:17.960> process<00:01:18.829> praise

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
students by giving process praise

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.789 
students by giving process praise
instead<00:01:19.430> of<00:01:19.700> person<00:01:20.119> praise<00:01:20.329> an<00:01:20.680> example<00:01:21.680> of

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
instead of person praise an example of

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.920 
instead of person praise an example of
person<00:01:22.220> praises<00:01:22.700> you're<00:01:23.119> very<00:01:23.450> smart

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
person praises you're very smart

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.109 
person praises you're very smart
Dwyer<00:01:24.439> says<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:24.950> process<00:01:25.369> praise<00:01:25.610> is<00:01:25.820> much

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
Dwyer says that process praise is much

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.380 
Dwyer says that process praise is much
more<00:01:26.360> likely<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.869> help<00:01:27.229> students<00:01:27.710> succeed<00:01:28.040> an

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
more likely to help students succeed an

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.510 
more likely to help students succeed an
example<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.450> process<00:01:29.930> praise<00:01:30.229> is<00:01:30.470> I<00:01:30.710> like<00:01:31.340> the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
example of process praise is I like the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.280 
example of process praise is I like the
way<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.700> tried<00:01:32.030> all<00:01:32.240> kinds<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.630> strategies<00:01:33.140> on

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
way you tried all kinds of strategies on

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.109 
way you tried all kinds of strategies on
the<00:01:33.320> math<00:01:33.560> problem<00:01:34.009> until<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.490> finally<00:01:34.790> got

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
the math problem until you finally got

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.880 
the math problem until you finally got
it<00:01:35.299> you<00:01:35.780> thought<00:01:35.960> of<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.200> lot<00:01:36.409> of<00:01:36.469> different

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
it you thought of a lot of different

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.620 
it you thought of a lot of different
ways<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:37.040> do<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:37.399> and<00:01:37.640> found<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.270> one<00:01:38.420> that

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
ways to do it and found the one that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.840 
ways to do it and found the one that
worked<00:01:39.009> giving<00:01:40.009> students<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.490> kind<00:01:40.790> of

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
worked giving students this kind of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.240 
worked giving students this kind of
process<00:01:41.390> feedback<00:01:41.899> signals<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.829> things<00:01:43.070> that

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
process feedback signals the things that

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.920 
process feedback signals the things that
are<00:01:43.340> important<00:01:43.820> like<00:01:44.090> trying<00:01:44.450> multiple

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
are important like trying multiple

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.630 
are important like trying multiple
strategies<00:01:45.200> instead<00:01:45.829> of<00:01:45.920> simply<00:01:46.310> getting<00:01:46.549> the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
strategies instead of simply getting the
