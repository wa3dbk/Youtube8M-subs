00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.570 
packs but I think that we have made a
little<00:05:17.630> bit<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:18.139> there<00:05:18.410> he<00:05:18.500> go<00:05:18.710> they<00:05:19.250> go<00:05:19.430> in

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
little bit so there he go they go in

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.980 
little bit so there he go they go in

to<00:06:06.530> edit<00:06:06.740> this<00:06:07.310> clip<00:06:07.910> before<00:06:08.270> you<00:06:08.570> see<00:06:08.780> what

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
to edit this clip before you see what

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.700 
to edit this clip before you see what
happens<00:06:09.349> next<00:06:09.590> as<00:06:10.300> kicks<00:06:11.300> off<00:06:11.539> and<00:06:12.320> he

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
happens next as kicks off and he

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.620 
happens next as kicks off and he
basically<00:06:13.310> runs<00:06:13.580> straight<00:06:13.910> down<00:06:13.970> through<00:06:14.210> the

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
basically runs straight down through the

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.180 
basically runs straight down through the
middle<00:06:14.720> of<00:06:14.870> the<00:06:14.930> pitch<00:06:15.139> i<00:06:15.320> hate<00:06:15.620> this<00:06:15.800> about<00:06:16.039> my

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
middle of the pitch i hate this about my

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.920 
middle of the pitch i hate this about my
defense<00:06:16.550> they<00:06:16.760> just<00:06:16.970> do<00:06:17.090> not<00:06:17.120> track<00:06:17.479> back<00:06:17.690> from

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
defense they just do not track back from

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.779 
defense they just do not track back from
the<00:06:18.020> midfield<00:06:18.380> and<00:06:18.530> they<00:06:19.099> really<00:06:19.400> need<00:06:19.580> two

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
the midfield and they really need two

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.060 
the midfield and they really need two
passes<00:06:20.720> out<00:06:20.960> here<00:06:21.260> and<00:06:21.500> you<00:06:21.590> see<00:06:21.800> that<00:06:21.950> he<00:06:22.039> gets

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
passes out here and you see that he gets

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.629 
passes out here and you see that he gets
into<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.580> box<00:06:22.789> and<00:06:23.030> then

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
into the box and then

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.790 
into the box and then
he<00:06:24.270> was<00:06:24.449> running<00:06:24.840> alongside<00:06:25.050> him<00:06:25.439> didn't

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
he was running alongside him didn't

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.350 
he was running alongside him didn't
really<00:06:25.919> do<00:06:26.129> much<00:06:26.340> wrong<00:06:26.639> but<00:06:26.879> I<00:06:26.909> fortunately

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
really do much wrong but I fortunately

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.839 
really do much wrong but I fortunately
clips<00:06:27.629> him<00:06:27.870> and<00:06:28.020> ends<00:06:28.800> up<00:06:28.889> taking<00:06:29.189> him<00:06:29.460> down<00:06:29.639> in

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
clips him and ends up taking him down in

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:31.249 
clips him and ends up taking him down in
the<00:06:29.879> box<00:06:30.210> which<00:06:30.449> means<00:06:30.659> that<00:06:30.900> he<00:06:31.080> has<00:06:31.110> a

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
the box which means that he has a

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.519 
the box which means that he has a
penalty<00:06:31.830> and<00:06:32.039> he<00:06:32.759> does<00:06:33.060> in<00:06:33.330> fact<00:06:33.389> convert<00:06:34.289> it

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:34.529 
penalty and he does in fact convert it

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.200 
penalty and he does in fact convert it
so<00:06:34.560> there<00:06:34.919> you<00:06:35.009> go<00:06:35.039> one<00:06:35.490> all<00:06:35.669> at<00:06:35.789> this<00:06:35.879> point

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
so there you go one all at this point

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.269 
so there you go one all at this point
and<00:06:36.389> that's<00:06:36.900> not<00:06:37.319> what<00:06:37.469> I<00:06:37.499> was<00:06:37.710> hoping<00:06:37.770> I<00:06:38.219> was

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:38.279 
and that's not what I was hoping I was

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.999 
and that's not what I was hoping I was
hoping<00:06:38.400> to<00:06:38.819> at<00:06:38.939> least<00:06:39.060> go<00:06:39.270> into<00:06:39.629> the<00:06:39.900> go<00:06:40.770> in<00:06:40.889> at

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
hoping to at least go into the go in at

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.619 
hoping to at least go into the go in at
halftime<00:06:41.039> one<00:06:41.729> know<00:06:41.909> our<00:06:42.090> path<00:06:42.300> to<00:06:42.479> getting

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:42.629 
halftime one know our path to getting

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:45.170 
halftime one know our path to getting
her<00:06:42.749> own<00:06:42.810> penalty<00:06:43.460> but<00:06:44.460> we<00:06:44.550> did<00:06:44.729> take<00:06:44.909> the<00:06:44.969> lead

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
her own penalty but we did take the lead

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.719 
her own penalty but we did take the lead
again<00:06:45.300> this<00:06:45.870> time<00:06:46.080> a<00:06:46.289> cross<00:06:46.680> and<00:06:46.919> Hernandez

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
again this time a cross and Hernandez

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.149 
again this time a cross and Hernandez
managed<00:06:48.060> to<00:06:48.240> score<00:06:48.599> and<00:06:48.870> the<00:06:49.680> only<00:06:49.889> way<00:06:50.129> I

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:50.159 
managed to score and the only way I

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.860 
managed to score and the only way I
could<00:06:50.279> break<00:06:50.520> this<00:06:50.639> guy<00:06:50.819> down<00:06:51.060> was<00:06:51.360> to<00:06:51.509> go<00:06:51.659> down

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
could break this guy down was to go down

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.929 
could break this guy down was to go down
the<00:06:52.020> wings<00:06:52.259> as<00:06:52.469> he<00:06:53.099> was<00:06:53.279> playing<00:06:53.490> five<00:06:53.759> the

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:53.939

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:55.439 
back and it was just no space in the

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:57.230 
back and it was just no space in the
midfield<00:06:55.759> unfortunately<00:06:56.759> in<00:06:56.849> the<00:06:56.909> 90th

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
midfield unfortunately in the 90th

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.179 
midfield unfortunately in the 90th
minute<00:06:57.330> this<00:06:57.750> time<00:06:57.960> it<00:06:58.139> was<00:06:58.289> against<00:06:58.710> us<00:06:58.830> and

00:06:59.179 --> 00:06:59.189 
minute this time it was against us and

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:02.300 
minute this time it was against us and

he ended up chipping over and scoring
into<00:07:02.580> the<00:07:02.699> empty<00:07:03.060> net<00:07:03.090> which<00:07:03.479> was<00:07:03.659> really

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 
into the empty net which was really

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.619 
into the empty net which was really
really<00:07:04.349> unfortunate<00:07:05.099> to<00:07:05.520> be<00:07:05.610> honest<00:07:05.909> I<00:07:06.060> don't

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:06.629 
really unfortunate to be honest I don't

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:08.959 
really unfortunate to be honest I don't
know<00:07:06.810> what<00:07:06.960> happened<00:07:07.349> I<00:07:07.500> was<00:07:07.650> up<00:07:07.860> the<00:07:08.430> field

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:08.969 
know what happened I was up the field

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:10.640 
know what happened I was up the field
holding<00:07:09.419> the<00:07:09.539> possession<00:07:10.050> and<00:07:10.199> then<00:07:10.620> I

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
holding the possession and then I

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.170 
holding the possession and then I
decided<00:07:11.069> to<00:07:11.279> go<00:07:11.370> out<00:07:11.550> on<00:07:11.580> the<00:07:11.759> counter<00:07:11.939> attack

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
decided to go out on the counter attack

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.480 
decided to go out on the counter attack
in<00:07:12.479> the<00:07:12.599> 90th<00:07:12.930> minute<00:07:13.050> plus<00:07:13.439> three<00:07:13.889> thought

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
in the 90th minute plus three thought

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.920 
in the 90th minute plus three thought
the<00:07:14.610> referee<00:07:14.939> would<00:07:15.089> blow<00:07:15.300> when<00:07:15.539> he<00:07:15.599> can<00:07:15.810> to

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
the referee would blow when he can to

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.159 
the referee would blow when he can to
attack<00:07:16.169> me<00:07:16.409> and<00:07:17.419> he<00:07:18.419> didn't<00:07:18.689> so<00:07:18.900> there<00:07:19.080> you<00:07:19.139> go
