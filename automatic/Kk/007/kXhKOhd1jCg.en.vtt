00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:07.700 

how<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.569> register<00:00:07.170> them<00:00:07.230> they're<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> little

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
how you register them they're a little

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.370 
how you register them they're a little
different<00:00:08.099> than<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.370> 3ds<00:00:08.790> so<00:00:09.660> we're<00:00:10.200> going<00:00:10.320> to

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
different than the 3ds so we're going to

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.470 
different than the 3ds so we're going to
go<00:00:10.500> over<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.860> flips<00:00:11.130> there's<00:00:11.580> two<00:00:11.880> kinds<00:00:12.389> of

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
go over the flips there's two kinds of

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.860 
go over the flips there's two kinds of
flips<00:00:13.070> horizontal<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.280> vertical<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:15.509> one

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
flips horizontal and vertical this one

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.550 
flips horizontal and vertical this one
is<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> horizontal<00:00:16.710> as<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:18.000> flip<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.510> back<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
is a horizontal as I flip it back and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.759 
is a horizontal as I flip it back and
forth<00:00:20.330> it<00:00:21.330> will<00:00:21.510> flip<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.470> change

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
forth it will flip on you and change

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.160 
forth it will flip on you and change
images<00:00:23.369> now<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.060> images<00:00:24.510> as<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.840> know<00:00:25.019> if<00:00:25.109> you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
images now the images as you know if you

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.929 
images now the images as you know if you
took<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.529> course<00:00:25.769> after<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.490> extremely

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
took the course after the extremely

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.599 
took the course after the extremely
lined<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:28.260> what<00:00:28.800> you're<00:00:28.980> trying<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.460> is

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
lined up but what you're trying to do is

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.359 
lined up but what you're trying to do is
get<00:00:29.880> an<00:00:30.300> image<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.109> as<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.470> walk<00:00:31.679> towards<00:00:32.219> it

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
get an image so as you walk towards it

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.639 
get an image so as you walk towards it
if<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> frame<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.840> will<00:00:34.050> flip<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
if it's in a frame it will flip on you

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.790 
if it's in a frame it will flip on you
okay<00:00:35.550> or<00:00:35.760> if<00:00:35.850> you're<00:00:36.000> doing<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.480> small<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
okay or if you're doing a small one that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.950 
okay or if you're doing a small one that
somebody<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.309> carry<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.760> them<00:00:39.000> they<00:00:39.690> flip

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
somebody can carry with them they flip

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.720 
somebody can carry with them they flip
it<00:00:40.110> back<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.469> forth<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.890> my<00:00:41.040> business<00:00:41.430> card

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it back and forth like my business card

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.209 
it back and forth like my business card
vertical<00:00:42.690> they're<00:00:43.500> getting<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> lines<00:00:44.040> are

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
vertical they're getting the lines are

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.660 
vertical they're getting the lines are
running<00:00:44.489> straight<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.090> down<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:46.770> I'm

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
running straight up and down and I'm

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.650 
running straight up and down and I'm
going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.879> turn<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> sideways<00:00:48.500> like<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:50.660> so

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
going to turn it sideways like this so

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.819 
going to turn it sideways like this so
that<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.199> see<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.660> flip<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.530> is

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that you can see that the flip this is

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.510 
that you can see that the flip this is
four<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.399> wall<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.360> people<00:00:57.809> walk<00:00:57.989> by<00:00:58.520> it

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
four on the wall so as people walk by it

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.160 
four on the wall so as people walk by it
will<00:00:59.730> change<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.329> those<00:01:00.539> are<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> two<00:01:00.960> kinds

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
will change so those are the two kinds

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.560 
will change so those are the two kinds
and<00:01:01.530> they're<00:01:01.879> registered<00:01:02.879> two<00:01:03.149> different

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and they're registered two different

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.820 
and they're registered two different
ways<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.350> show<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
ways that I'm going to show you that

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.399 
ways that I'm going to show you that
real<00:01:05.070> quick<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.820> registration<00:01:06.240> lines<00:01:07.020> look

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
real quick but registration lines look

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.270 
real quick but registration lines look
the<00:01:07.590> same<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:09.229> you're<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> same

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the same but you're going to do the same

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.880 
the same but you're going to do the same
exact<00:01:11.790> thing<00:01:11.909> except<00:01:12.720> here's<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> different

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
exact thing except here's the different

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.710 
exact thing except here's the different
component<00:01:14.430> now<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.909> won't<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.299> able<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.570> see

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
component now you won't be able to see

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.960 
component now you won't be able to see
it<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.049> clear<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.860> video<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.909> you

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
it really clear on this video but you

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.539 
it really clear on this video but you
will<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:19.110> clear<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:20.040> you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
will do see it really clear when you

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.249 
will do see it really clear when you
actually<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:24.119> lines<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.080> want

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
actually do it so the lines you want

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.679 
actually do it so the lines you want
these<00:01:25.380> lines<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.979> line<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
these lines to line up and and be a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.830 
these lines to line up and and be a
solid<00:01:28.140> black<00:01:28.320> line<00:01:28.590> right<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.180> if<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.420> push

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
solid black line right here if I push

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.399 
solid black line right here if I push
this<00:01:31.079> over<00:01:31.409> once<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.119> done<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.290> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
this over once it is it is done but if I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
this over once it is it is done but if I
push<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.799> over<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.880> turns<00:01:36.150> white<00:01:38.240> that

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
push it over and it turns white that

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.620 
push it over and it turns white that
gives<00:01:39.600> me<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:41.430> other<00:01:41.670> picture<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.420> know

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
gives me the other picture I know

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.359 
gives me the other picture I know
there's<00:01:42.930> two<00:01:43.110> pictures<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.560> here

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
there's two pictures in here

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.959 
there's two pictures in here
so<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.479> happens<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:46.920> choose<00:01:47.399> which

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
so what happens is you can choose which

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
one you want them to see first in this

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
photo first so I make it the white line

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.779 
photo first so I make it the white line
and<00:01:56.340> then<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:58.020> walk<00:01:58.289> past<00:01:58.319> it<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.579> will

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
and then as they walk past it it will

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.760 
and then as they walk past it it will
turn<00:02:00.000> into<00:02:00.179> the<00:02:00.450> fantasy<00:02:00.929> photo<00:02:01.110> now<00:02:01.649> I'm

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
turn into the fantasy photo now I'm

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.380 
turn into the fantasy photo now I'm
going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> get<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> close-up<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.270> you

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
going to get a close-up on this so you

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.980 
going to get a close-up on this so you
can<00:02:03.569> see<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.990> now<00:02:04.880> since<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:06.179> are<00:02:06.209> we<00:02:06.780> don't

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
can see this now since we are we don't

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.830 
can see this now since we are we don't
have<00:02:07.319> this<00:02:07.910> laminated<00:02:08.910> I'm<00:02:09.060> holding<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.629> down

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
have this laminated I'm holding it down

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.259 
have this laminated I'm holding it down
and<00:02:10.530> I'm<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.160> camera<00:02:11.700> move<00:02:12.000> to

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
and I'm going to have the camera move to

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.930 
and I'm going to have the camera move to
the<00:02:12.420> right<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.950> should<00:02:14.160> see<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.430> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
the right and you should see that the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.500 
the right and you should see that the
change<00:02:15.269> she<00:02:15.930> turns<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.380> little<00:02:16.650> purple<00:02:17.480> okay

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
change she turns a little purple okay

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.839 
change she turns a little purple okay
and<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.019> comes<00:02:19.230> out<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:20.640> hasn't<00:02:20.940> moved<00:02:21.180> back

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
and it comes out it hasn't moved back

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.550 
and it comes out it hasn't moved back
and<00:02:23.849> then<00:02:23.940> she<00:02:24.090> goes<00:02:24.239> back<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.540> straight<00:02:25.019> so

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and then she goes back to straight so

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.680 
and then she goes back to straight so
that's<00:02:25.829> the<00:02:26.010> idea<00:02:26.340> okay<00:02:26.579> now<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.450> only

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
that's the idea okay now the only

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.850 
that's the idea okay now the only
difference<00:02:28.560> between<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:30.540> vertical<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.560> the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
difference between the vertical and the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.250 
difference between the vertical and the
horizontal<00:02:31.890> which<00:02:32.549> back<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.180> forth<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.930> on<00:02:34.230> a

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
horizontal which back and forth is on a

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.080 
horizontal which back and forth is on a
vertical<00:02:34.530> you're<00:02:34.980> looking<00:02:35.340> at<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.790> sides

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
vertical you're looking at the sides

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.119 
vertical you're looking at the sides
here<00:02:36.599> that's<00:02:37.230> where<00:02:37.530> you're<00:02:37.709> looking<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.040> the

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
here that's where you're looking for the

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.100 
here that's where you're looking for the
registration<00:02:38.879> mark<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.930> horizontal

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
registration mark on the horizontal

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.619 
registration mark on the horizontal
beside<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.250> fact<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:41.940> tell<00:02:42.329> it<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.540> be

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
beside the fact that you tell it to be

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.990 
beside the fact that you tell it to be
horizontal<00:02:42.959> when<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:43.950> actually<00:02:44.160> make<00:02:44.579> it<00:02:44.760> and

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
horizontal when you actually make it and

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.400 
horizontal when you actually make it and
again<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.450> should<00:02:45.480> know<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.930> already

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
again you should know that already

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.160 
again you should know that already
if<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:46.980> took<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.340> course<00:02:47.579> is<00:02:47.849> that<00:02:48.840> you're

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
if you took the course is that you're

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.020 
if you took the course is that you're
going<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.470> look<00:02:49.590> at<00:02:49.739> this<00:02:49.920> bottom<00:02:50.579> line<00:02:50.760> down

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
going to look at this bottom line down

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.229 
going to look at this bottom line down
here<00:02:51.480> same<00:02:52.109> thing<00:02:52.139> white<00:02:53.040> or<00:02:53.250> black<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.760> you

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
here same thing white or black and you

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.050 
here same thing white or black and you
can<00:02:54.450> choose<00:02:54.720> which<00:02:55.380> one<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:56.340> comes<00:02:56.579> to<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.819> top

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
can choose which one it comes to the top

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.449 
can choose which one it comes to the top
and<00:02:57.359> which<00:02:57.480> one<00:02:57.720> flips<00:02:58.170> but<00:02:58.980> or<00:02:59.750> horizontal

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
and which one flips but or horizontal

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.099 
and which one flips but or horizontal
then<00:03:02.459> line<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.060> up<00:03:03.269> with<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.569> registration

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
then line it up with this registration

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.650 
then line it up with this registration
marks<00:03:04.530> down<00:03:04.680> here<00:03:05.120> vertical<00:03:06.120> you're<00:03:06.420> going<00:03:06.599> to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
marks down here vertical you're going to

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.690 
marks down here vertical you're going to
do<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.989> like<00:03:07.139> this<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.560> kind<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.099> makes

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
do it like this it just kind of makes

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.170 
do it like this it just kind of makes
sense<00:03:08.940> since<00:03:09.329> it's<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.630> vertical<00:03:09.780> picture<00:03:10.349> and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
sense since it's a vertical picture and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.300 
sense since it's a vertical picture and
they're<00:03:12.180> again<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:13.139> lines<00:03:13.410> over<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.250> should

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
they're again the lines over I should

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.670 
they're again the lines over I should
mention<00:03:14.669> the<00:03:15.480> lines<00:03:15.720> on<00:03:16.669> vertical<00:03:18.139> again<00:03:19.139> run

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
mention the lines on vertical again run

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.750 
mention the lines on vertical again run
up<00:03:19.919> and<00:03:20.160> down<00:03:21.139> okay<00:03:22.139> so<00:03:22.739> as<00:03:22.859> you<00:03:22.980> walk<00:03:23.130> by<00:03:23.370> it

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
up and down okay so as you walk by it

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.640 
up and down okay so as you walk by it
changes<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.599> can<00:03:24.750> actually<00:03:25.109> make<00:03:25.319> this<00:03:25.470> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
changes I can actually make this the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.339 
changes I can actually make this the
horizontal<00:03:26.160> flip<00:03:26.370> if<00:03:26.639> I<00:03:26.760> turn<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.349> horizontal

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
horizontal flip if I turn it horizontal

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.300 
horizontal flip if I turn it horizontal
and<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.680> lines<00:03:28.950> run<00:03:29.340> horizontal<00:03:31.310> vertical

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
and the lines run horizontal vertical

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.789 
and the lines run horizontal vertical
horizontal<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:34.079> you<00:03:34.169> just<00:03:34.319> have<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.530> keep<00:03:34.620> that

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
horizontal so you just have to keep that

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.470 
horizontal so you just have to keep that
in<00:03:34.859> mind<00:03:35.099> this<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.459> for<00:03:35.489> if<00:03:36.000> you're<00:03:36.269> going<00:03:36.389> to

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
in mind this is for if you're going to

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.479 
in mind this is for if you're going to
flip<00:03:36.660> back<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.019> forth<00:03:37.230> like<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:38.250> if

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
flip back and forth like this this if

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.860 
flip back and forth like this this if
you're<00:03:38.700> going<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.060> flip<00:03:39.209> back<00:03:39.419> and<00:03:39.599> forth<00:03:39.690> like

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
you're going to flip back and forth like

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.440 
you're going to flip back and forth like
this<00:03:40.200> walking<00:03:40.530> sideways<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.940> remember<00:03:42.329> that

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
this walking sideways just remember that

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.089 
this walking sideways just remember that
cut<00:03:42.690> sometimes<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.260> screws<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.709> up<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.950> lot

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
cut sometimes that screws you up a lot

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.099 
cut sometimes that screws you up a lot
when<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.790> forget<00:03:45.690> if<00:03:45.810> you're<00:03:45.959> doing

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
when you forget if you're doing

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.460 
when you forget if you're doing
horizontal<00:03:46.440> or<00:03:46.799> vertical<00:03:46.829> again<00:03:47.669> you<00:03:47.910> have<00:03:48.060> to

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
horizontal or vertical again you have to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.830 
horizontal or vertical again you have to
the<00:03:48.620> lenses<00:03:49.010> like<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:50.000> want<00:03:50.240> them<00:03:50.420> unless<00:03:50.660> you

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
the lenses like you want them unless you

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.930 
the lenses like you want them unless you
want<00:03:51.020> a<00:03:51.050> little<00:03:51.260> short<00:03:51.530> horizontal<00:03:51.820> this<00:03:52.820> is

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
want a little short horizontal this is

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.410 
want a little short horizontal this is
work<00:03:53.090> but<00:03:53.780> anyway<00:03:54.050> that's<00:03:54.320> how<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.740> register

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
work but anyway that's how to register

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.180 
work but anyway that's how to register
vertical<00:03:56.420> black<00:03:57.380> or<00:03:58.280> white<00:03:58.880> on<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.930> side

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
vertical black or white on the side

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.800 
vertical black or white on the side
horizontal<00:04:01.190> back<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.880> right<00:04:02.030> on<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.270> bottom<00:04:02.600> I

horizontal back to right on the bottom I

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.630 
horizontal back to right on the bottom I
mean<00:04:02.990> you<00:04:03.140> can<00:04:03.290> move<00:04:03.500> it<00:04:03.650> up<00:04:03.740> and<00:04:03.950> change<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.490> so

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
mean you can move it up and change it so
