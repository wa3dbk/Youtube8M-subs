00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
going over how to bunnyhop higher um

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.640 
going over how to bunnyhop higher um
this<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.639> exact<00:00:09.150> thing<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.929> did<00:00:10.320> in

this is the exact thing that I did in

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.980 
this is the exact thing that I did in
order<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.920> bunnyhop<00:00:11.700> higher<00:00:11.910> I'm<00:00:12.750> going<00:00:12.929> to

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
order to bunnyhop higher I'm going to

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.910 
order to bunnyhop higher I'm going to
start<00:00:13.290> out<00:00:14.599> hopping<00:00:15.599> over<00:00:15.809> one<00:00:16.049> block<00:00:16.350> then<00:00:16.650> -

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
start out hopping over one block then -

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.950 
start out hopping over one block then -
and<00:00:17.220> then<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.699> know<00:00:17.760> keep<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.150> going<00:00:18.449> up<00:00:18.690> and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and then you know keep on going up and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.450 
and then you know keep on going up and
up<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.439> that's<00:00:19.619> just<00:00:19.830> how<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.949> learned<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.310> bunny

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
up and that's just how I learned a bunny

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.130 
up and that's just how I learned a bunny
hop<00:00:20.640> higher<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.119> also<00:00:21.270> go<00:00:21.840> through<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
hop higher but also go through the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.810 
hop higher but also go through the
motion<00:00:22.619> um

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
motion um

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.240 
motion um
this<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.330> 30<00:00:24.570> inches<00:00:24.750> tall<00:00:25.140> before<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.680> ask<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this is 30 inches tall before you ask I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.179 
this is 30 inches tall before you ask I
can<00:00:26.460> get<00:00:26.699> well<00:00:27.060> over<00:00:27.359> 3<00:00:27.660> feet<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.230> wind<00:00:28.740> wasn't

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
can get well over 3 feet but wind wasn't

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.460 
can get well over 3 feet but wind wasn't
cooperating<00:00:30.060> with<00:00:30.599> me<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> towels<00:00:31.320> just

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
cooperating with me and the towels just

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
cooperating with me and the towels just
to<00:00:31.590> wipe<00:00:31.740> off<00:00:31.920> my<00:00:31.949> feet<00:00:32.309> because<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.700> was<00:00:32.850> wet

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
to wipe off my feet because it was wet

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.799 
to wipe off my feet because it was wet
so<00:00:33.899> let's<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.260> started<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:35.809> okay

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
so let's get started with this okay

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.049 
so let's get started with this okay
first<00:00:37.380> things<00:00:37.680> first<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.430> are<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.850> want

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
first things first you are going to want

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.049 
first things first you are going to want
to<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.870> set<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.170> 1<00:00:40.379> 2<00:00:40.739> by<00:00:40.890> 4<00:00:41.129> hop<00:00:41.370> over<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
to just set up 1 2 by 4 hop over it and

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.720 
to just set up 1 2 by 4 hop over it and
then<00:00:42.719> set<00:00:43.200> up<00:00:43.230> another<00:00:43.590> one<00:00:43.860> hop<00:00:44.309> over<00:00:44.700> that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
then set up another one hop over that

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.360 
then set up another one hop over that
set<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.719> 3rd<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.079> 4th<00:00:46.320> 5th<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.309> 6th<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.570> on

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
set up a 3rd to 4th 5th or 6th and so on

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.400 
set up a 3rd to 4th 5th or 6th and so on
that's<00:00:50.370> what<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> did<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.870> I'll<00:00:51.989> go<00:00:52.170> through

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
that's what I did and I'll go through

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.979 
that's what I did and I'll go through
the<00:00:52.530> motion<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.100> you

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
the motion for you

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.180 
the motion for you
alright<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.440> first<00:00:56.370> off<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.879> few<00:00:57.210> general<00:00:57.870> rules

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
alright so first off a few general rules

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.849 
alright so first off a few general rules
the<00:00:59.190> higher<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.850> go<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.510> farther<00:01:01.230> away<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the higher you go the farther away you

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.630 
the higher you go the farther away you
want<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.840> when<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.960> start<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> pick<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.640> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
want to be when you start to pick up the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.670 
want to be when you start to pick up the
farther<00:01:06.150> you're<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> want<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.049> push<00:01:07.409> out

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
farther you're going to want to push out

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.539 
farther you're going to want to push out
with<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.760> bars<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:10.979> you're<00:01:11.400> going

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
with your bars and the more you're going

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
with your bars and the more you're going
to<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:12.060> back<00:01:12.390> behind<00:01:12.750> your<00:01:13.229> back

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
to want to get back behind your back

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.499 
to want to get back behind your back
tighter<00:01:14.030> if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> focus<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.689> those<00:01:15.990> 3<00:01:16.950> things

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
tighter if you focus on those 3 things

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.969 
tighter if you focus on those 3 things
getting<00:01:18.509> higher<00:01:18.869> bunny<00:01:19.140> hops<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.740> much

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
getting higher bunny hops will be much

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.450 
getting higher bunny hops will be much
easier<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.869> first<00:01:21.869> off<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.770> see<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.310> at

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
easier for you first off you see that at

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.490 
easier for you first off you see that at
the<00:01:23.549> beginning<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.090> started<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.689> compression<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the beginning I started my compression a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.359 
the beginning I started my compression a
lot<00:01:26.460> earlier<00:01:26.880> than<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.810> previous<00:01:28.560> bunny

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
lot earlier than in the previous bunny

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.149 
lot earlier than in the previous bunny
hops<00:01:30.049> when<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.229> hop<00:01:31.409> higher<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.860> would<00:01:31.950> want

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
hops when you hop higher you would want

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.749 
hops when you hop higher you would want
to<00:01:32.220> compress<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.880> lot<00:01:33.299> harder<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.159> also<00:01:35.159> when

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to compress a lot harder and also when

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.219 
to compress a lot harder and also when
you<00:01:35.909> go<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> lift<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.659> you're<00:01:36.900> going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> want

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you go to lift up you're going to want

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.460 
you go to lift up you're going to want
to<00:01:37.290> lift<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.829> lot<00:01:38.310> more<00:01:38.520> vertically<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:40.079> if

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
to lift up a lot more vertically then if

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.240 
to lift up a lot more vertically then if
that's<00:01:40.680> even<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.009> word

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that's even a word

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.660 
that's even a word
then<00:01:42.229> then<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> previous<00:01:44.100> ones<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
then then in the previous ones the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.330 
then then in the previous ones the
harder<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.390> lift<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.979> vertical

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
harder you lift up to get the vertical

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.480 
harder you lift up to get the vertical
hot<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> higher<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.479> will<00:01:48.659> go<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:50.250> also

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
hot and the higher you will go you also

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.600 
hot and the higher you will go you also
have<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> take<00:01:50.880> any<00:01:51.090> consideration<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
have to take any consideration the

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.859 
have to take any consideration the
pushing<00:01:53.610> out<00:01:53.759> with<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.030> handlebars<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
pushing out with the handlebars and the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.039 
pushing out with the handlebars and the
picking<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:57.540> scooping<00:01:57.899> motion

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
picking up of the the scooping motion

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.280 
picking up of the the scooping motion
with<00:01:58.409> your<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.280> legs<00:01:59.490> though<00:01:59.700> but<00:01:59.969> a

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
with your with your legs though but a

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
your knees up there just

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
your knees up there just
your<00:02:13.560> ways<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:13.980> do<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.240> for<00:02:15.240> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
your ways you can do this for the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.790 
your ways you can do this for the
pushing<00:02:15.780> out<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:15.930> your<00:02:16.110> arms<00:02:16.350> it's<00:02:16.530> pretty

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
pushing out on your arms it's pretty

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.310 
pushing out on your arms it's pretty
simple<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.370> push<00:02:18.240> out<00:02:18.450> try<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> get<00:02:19.140> them

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
simple you just push out try to get them

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.880 
simple you just push out try to get them
as<00:02:19.560> straight<00:02:19.950> as<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.340> if<00:02:20.790> they're<00:02:21.000> bad

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
as straight as you can if they're bad

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.830 
as straight as you can if they're bad
that<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.130> kind<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.580> drop<00:02:24.000> your<00:02:24.180> back<00:02:24.360> end<00:02:24.660> a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
that can kind of drop your back end a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.720 
that can kind of drop your back end a
bit<00:02:25.110> more<00:02:25.350> or<00:02:25.560> make<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.920> drop<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.250> early<00:02:26.550> and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
bit more or make you drop it early and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.860 
bit more or make you drop it early and
hit<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> thing<00:02:27.120> you're<00:02:27.240> trying<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.540> hop<00:02:27.690> over

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
hit the thing you're trying to hop over

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.610 
hit the thing you're trying to hop over
and<00:02:28.170> that's<00:02:28.380> no<00:02:28.620> fun<00:02:28.650> as<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:30.870> getting<00:02:31.200> your

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
and that's no fun as for getting your

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.000 
and that's no fun as for getting your
back<00:02:31.800> end<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:32.480> there<00:02:33.510> um<00:02:33.870> there's<00:02:34.470> really<00:02:34.680> two

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
back end up there um there's really two

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.980 
back end up there um there's really two
main<00:02:35.280> ways<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.940> guess<00:02:36.000> one<00:02:36.360> way<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.570> going

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
main ways I guess one way is going

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.640 
main ways I guess one way is going
straight<00:02:37.770> over<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:39.030> back<00:02:39.240> tire<00:02:39.570> that's<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
straight over the back tire that's the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.440 
straight over the back tire that's the
way<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.800> tend<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.370> do<00:02:41.460> it<00:02:41.610> sometimes<00:02:42.060> I'll<00:02:42.270> push

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
way I tend to do it sometimes I'll push

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.310 
way I tend to do it sometimes I'll push
the<00:02:42.600> tire<00:02:42.810> off<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.160> side<00:02:45.140> pushing<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.230> off

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
the tire off to the side pushing it off

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.110 
the tire off to the side pushing it off
to<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.560> side<00:02:46.800> helps<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.459> get<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.760> few

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
to the side helps you just get a few

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.720 
to the side helps you just get a few
more<00:02:48.360> inches<00:02:48.600> if<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.530> if<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.370> need<00:02:50.580> them

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
more inches if you if you need them

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.440 
more inches if you if you need them
because<00:02:51.440> your<00:02:52.459> butt<00:02:53.459> can't<00:02:53.850> hit<00:02:54.090> your<00:02:54.180> tire

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
because your butt can't hit your tire

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.180 
because your butt can't hit your tire
pretty<00:02:54.840> much<00:02:55.080> that'll<00:02:55.470> get<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.950> extra

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
pretty much that'll get you that extra

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.250 
pretty much that'll get you that extra
inch<00:02:56.580> or<00:02:56.730> two<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.000> need<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.209> get<00:02:57.510> over<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
inch or two you need to get over the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.550 
inch or two you need to get over the
object<00:02:58.709> you're<00:02:58.980> hopping<00:02:59.280> over<00:03:00.050> so<00:03:01.050> if<00:03:01.410> you

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
object you're hopping over so if you

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.440 
object you're hopping over so if you
just<00:03:01.709> focus<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:02.280> those<00:03:02.490> few<00:03:02.760> things<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:04.310> just

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
just focus on those few things and just

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.870 
just focus on those few things and just
get<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> few<00:03:06.720> items<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.230> hop<00:03:07.410> over<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.880> won't

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
get a few items to hop over that won't

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.300 
get a few items to hop over that won't
make<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.480> go<00:03:10.050> over<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.470> bars<00:03:10.680> if<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.040> clip

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
make you go over the bars if you clip

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.010 
make you go over the bars if you clip
them<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.700> gain<00:03:11.880> some<00:03:12.090> confidence<00:03:12.270> hopping

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
them to gain some confidence hopping

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.530 
them to gain some confidence hopping
over<00:03:13.170> stuff<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:14.850> just<00:03:14.970> keep<00:03:15.150> on<00:03:15.270> building

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
over stuff and you just keep on building

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.470 
over stuff and you just keep on building
