00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.890
 You the books I read in the month of 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.929
 and it is good to train in the fifth 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.750
 noting that there are not many books in 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.540
 Truths are very few and I bought 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.150
 and that hollie at last you will see me 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.289
 I started trading reading so it was 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.350
 I started reading 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.990
 It was not the one I started even reading. 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.109
 Endless night of the war criticizes me 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.460
 knows she knows is favorite author and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.160
 good neither end was a very easy book to 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.980
 read very fast and very tasty 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.540
 if we do not know yet but maybe 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.989
 It was the best book I had. 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.450
 read it even better today than 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.050
 Witches end night without end is very cool is 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.920
 a couple that fixes but cries if they know 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.710
 buys a house and a land of the gypsies 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.840
 which is the land that is cursed and there 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.350
 then the story goes on and still 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.949
 besides the normal kinetic book arrives in the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.200
 end and my god does this book then 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.659
 It's very smooth from the crisis I do not have a father or 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.270
 I mean oh please teach me to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.229

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.619
 a lining and pronounces love because it is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.340
 so, but this video of this video 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.080
 in this book that does not appear a powder but is 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.990
 very cool the first book I read from her 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.360
 without appearing to give up and then 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.259
 continue without end of the christi war 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:39.000
 I started reading frank's wizard 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.579
 baumann and so on and this is a 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.040
 collection that makes the bottle more 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.920
 country is that of the country of 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.799
 wonders and the other I do not have to 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.040
 fairy tale that there are several tales 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.549

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.520
 the wizard of oz and he the same me 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.340

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.679
 had read the wizard of oz and this edition 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.539
 is a very well crafted edition 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.649
 I believe you have this great edition. 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.970
 pocket purse 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:14.739
 She is from Radica as she talks hard cover and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.010
 people the book is all illustrated it all 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.040
 worked and the illustrations you have here 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.040
 are the original illustrations from the book 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.980
 Original even people end up dine I 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.260
 I had never read the wizard of oz and I'm 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.150
 in love that he is very cute and 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.079
 You can buy it and it's called a lot. 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.940
 cheap 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.030
 it's worth it because it's very very 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.340
 Good, and ours I loved. 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.319
 after the magic of steel I started to read 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.099
 the restaurant at the end of the universe 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.440
 douglas adams which is the second book of 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.640
 galaxy backpacker guide if not 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.099
 knows the Hitchhiker's Guide to the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.910
 galaxies or have never heard of 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.739
 It's time for this world but this book is 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.230
 science fiction but it's a fiction 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.900
 very cool scientist I really liked 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.139
 between books and two that were chosen 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.130
 I liked it more than I think more. 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.829
 exciting and here to read more 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.000
 fast less dense in my 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.739
 You're welcome. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.950
 and more I think the story of a 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.200
 more engaging yes I find more emotional 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.790
 And Brazil, do you want to know? 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.530
 Continued already announced to be 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.380
 difference is the continuation two here 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.590
 then economic journalism was in the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.870
 very annoying book to read from sony caldas 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.269
 Thursday went to college you can see 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.120
 hair or it says here 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.340
 in short it is that is at your college ever 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.889
 It's late not to pay my life because 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.430
 book but last I read that book too 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.079
 I'm going to put it here because it was the book I 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.450
 I still read that I gave it a whirl 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.700
 doing is very good, but it is not 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.799
 here then look at this book in the month of 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.389
 August too and now let's go to the 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.370
 August companies I 'm going to start 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.500
 by the sugar logic I already talked to him 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.980
 but I met in August and another 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.980
 in a lot 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.720
 i then look at them who wellington them 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.280
 two are radicova and the issues are very 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.750
 well- crafted by your choices 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.790
 as in illustration and in all people 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.070
 every edition is wonderful, I'm 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.530
 in love and there's one more that I want 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.449
 but not to any help but when I 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.600
 I think I'll count on this 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.580
 I have cultural journalism and 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.229
 journalism then the 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.080
 teachers passed a list of books 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.729
 lÃ©o for us throughout life not only 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.160
 in the chairs 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.440
 some I've read some I have and others 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.449
 had not then bought narrative that 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.620
 do if it is there it concludes 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:46.400
 so I bought the only name 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:50.630
 this book here people were kind 2 real 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:54.080
 and he calls himself travels from the 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.300
 paul from the auster bread and folks are going to say that 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.470
 This was the book that I did not understand. 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.610
 that people no teacher nor 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.979
 nobody 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.979
 in fact this book was in the promotion 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:07.220
 I read the synopsis too much on top I found 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.500
 very cool very interesting 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.490
 tomorrow will be subordinated file he has 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.520
 a diet 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.160
 so here is a decade the book is well 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.960
 pretty sure I do not know if it's good but 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.740
 I believe it is a quick read through 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.810
 fast because it's fine animation 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.539
 but the cool recording reads and the 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.250
 leaves are yellow then just when 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.410
 for you it would be good if he is not what 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.860
 he talks because he does not train now he sees the 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.479
 books teachers recommend 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.500
 confessions of a young novelist of the 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.800
 merit eco 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.840
 I have seen very year the people talking around this 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.500
 book says it's very good I do not do 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.139
 idea whether it's good or not 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.539
 Anyway, I do not know what he's right about. 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.240
 But he talked about semiotics and I 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.370
 I love semiotics, I see here now more 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.680
 Let's see if you 've read some books 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.410
 That I'm going to win now convinced me. 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.160
 even if it's worth spending the time 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:07.220
 then this one's athletic other than 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.349
 from franz kafka to metamorphosis 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.000
 in fact I know all the history of this 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:15.950
 book is like a spoiler 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.650
 but I read the book I do not know how it is 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.060
 I know his story is that people 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.390
 Tell me how this book everything 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.190
 But then let's see, I'll read about the 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.250
 Insect Egypt I already know I have 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:31.280
 A self I do not know is for me right, right? 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.390
 I do not know, but let's see if it's good. 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.860
 same 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.930
 she already had people say that it is very 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.930
 good to read, did not even hear that 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.330
 It's good that people kind of 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.850
 overestimated this beige book by 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.060
 last but not least of the 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:49.010
 cold blood that is from the class bonnet 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.020
 capote and this book I did not like the 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.110
 cover I found a lot of journalism cover 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.660
 literary and literary company let's 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.910

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.310
 journalism and talks about a 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.800
 murder that really happened all 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.440
 the legislation and I think it 's very cool 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.210
