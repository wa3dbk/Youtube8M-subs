feel<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:52.949> squash<00:00:53.309> together<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.539> units

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
feel a little squash together the units

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.270 
feel a little squash together the units
made<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> plastic<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:55.500> feels<00:00:55.860> incredibly

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
made of plastic but feels incredibly

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.400 
made of plastic but feels incredibly
solid<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.360> will<00:00:57.480> last<00:00:57.600> many<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.989> backpack

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
solid and it will last many a backpack

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.130 
solid and it will last many a backpack
so<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.309> less<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.059> wife<00:01:00.239> beginner<00:01:00.719> DJ's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
so this is less of a wife beginner DJ's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.700
