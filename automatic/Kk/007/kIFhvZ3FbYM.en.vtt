00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
even three right there um actually I

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.169 
even three right there um actually I
might<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.220> able<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.429> get<00:01:56.580> those<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.940> use<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
might be able to get those if I use the

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.820 
might be able to get those if I use the
hover<00:01:57.360> nozzle<00:01:59.000> yeah<00:02:00.200> it's<00:02:01.200> really<00:02:01.590> not

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
hover nozzle yeah it's really not

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.589 
hover nozzle yeah it's really not
difficult<00:02:02.039> actually<00:02:02.789> yeah<00:02:02.940> see<00:02:03.210> that's<00:02:03.450> what

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
difficult actually yeah see that's what

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.180 
difficult actually yeah see that's what
I<00:02:03.690> mean<00:02:03.840> they<00:02:04.140> go<00:02:04.349> into<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.679> water<00:02:04.890> really

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
I mean they go into the water really

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.219 
I mean they go into the water really
easily<00:02:05.550> so<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.330> can<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.599> a<00:02:06.630> pain<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.929> the<00:02:06.959> butt

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
easily so it can be a pain in the butt

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.440 
easily so it can be a pain in the butt
but<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.800> that's<00:02:08.009> why<00:02:08.160> I'm<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.789> doing<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.360> this

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
but so that's why I'm just doing it this

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
then uh I really hope that in galaxy 2

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.370 
then uh I really hope that in galaxy 2
though<00:05:09.729> you<00:05:09.789> actually<00:05:10.479> get<00:05:10.630> to<00:05:10.780> use<00:05:10.900> Yoshi<00:05:11.229> a

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
though you actually get to use Yoshi a

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.200 
though you actually get to use Yoshi a
lot<00:05:11.590> like<00:05:11.889> I<00:05:11.919> really<00:05:12.610> hope<00:05:12.789> they<00:05:12.910> do<00:05:12.970> that

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
lot like I really hope they do that

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.050 
lot like I really hope they do that
though<00:05:13.330> because<00:05:13.979> Yoshi<00:05:14.979> just<00:05:15.160> doesn't<00:05:15.760> see

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
though because Yoshi just doesn't see

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.659 
though because Yoshi just doesn't see
very<00:05:16.570> much<00:05:16.780> why<00:05:17.289> today<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:17.830> any<00:05:18.010> like<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.340> 3d
