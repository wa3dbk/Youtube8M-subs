00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.019
 hi to all these evil dominoes I hope 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.120
 that you're fine 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.670
 for me it's going very well today 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.350
 we meet for a video that I 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.080
 you had already said I was going to do 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.369
 it's a video as you see on the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.599
 title in description 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:34.070
 here is a presentation of monster rames ter 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:39.590
 domino fire are worth this level 199 so 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:43.520
 I have a purely pvm total stuff specified 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.260
 I do not have a frigost ste 3g yet 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.539
 that's what i 'm not optimized iations 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.860
 much better to do as his end so 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.480
 when you see enough damage 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.480
 friendly or 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.070
 at random 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.559
 so we're going to go through the term so the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.469
 half of his life he really needs it 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.110
 I do not make big rock often the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.950
 sneakiness not terrible either at 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:13.289
 distance in 1 martel attacks 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.289
 for a father fire his watch to 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.640
 I'm going to boost myself 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.670
 this 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.870
 the next carter will no longer stay 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.870
 points of life him 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.530
 No, it's hot to go home 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.270
 good thing i'm going to kill it i'm going to you 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.330
 show after what I wanted you 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.330
 show 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.560
 it was only 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.450
 this is my 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.640
 main camp combo when I do some 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.180
 traps 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.310
 so launched I showed you pretty much 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.680
 Auxerre my rock shows I'm doing 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.790
 where I want to show my combo of traps 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.650
 our boost when I'm a visible 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.960
 the invisible doing that is enough 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.530
 fun when there is no sound in front of it 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.930
 the belted hard and on 2 0% reason 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.930
 resistor 1 anyway it's a specified 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.230
 we'll get a little boost 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.010
 so 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.910
 I invite you to wait for a 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.780
 for the next videos in roudayre 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.230
 the dofus at the same rhodes 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.550
 because in fact I really have not hurt 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.640
 struggling to capture the wanted bandits 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.620
 because that's what it's simple brothel 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.790
 I do not know where NPCs are and so what 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.490
 that hot enough what for all who 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.770
 to find out what because there are six 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.300
 at 6 pm finally 6 to 6 pm is going to be 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.410
 respawn time 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.170
 it's not great what 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.220
 so to me should do pnj I 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.990
 think because otherwise it would be a 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.490
 simple brothel so so I'm going to you 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.590
 show a little bit the staff that has 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.790
 already sent his headdress and maybe his 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.569
 cape is readable 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:19.889
 I will finish this little putsch 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:23.999
 so we will start with the stif then 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:27.209
 the stif I have a colossal panoply with 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:29.819
 an otomai panoply and a sail of ink 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.790
 so just the panoply 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.030
 colossal the cap 344 vitara 38 strength 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.930
 34,37 wisdom 38 power in peace at 12 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.510
 of master neutral tribute 10% rest 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.049

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.129
 otomai over vitality 75 8 to 24 wise x3 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:52.889
 cc in vo 15 funeral tribute 393 says 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:56.730
 the resistances fixed max the tac the nine 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:58.980
 and 2d what makes a knee prpm sailing 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.469
 of ink 352 vita are four forces 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.280
 dark of intel 32 wisdom three 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:06.739
 critical hits a p / e 10 damage 10% 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.139
 13% thanks to 10% 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.510
 and for those who may have seen the 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.310
 diop presentation video exactly the 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.710
 same ink track that I had on my 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.850
 job 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.850
 so then the otomai boots over 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:26.360

 resistance of the 1 I totally awesome 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.440
 then belt of colossal 347 quickly to 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.470
 29,35 his chair 28 power a little 11 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.620
 Neutron damage this match such show 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:47.030
 because 5 skiff can be 10% finally no 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:51.070
 not 10% 10 fixed live colossal 233 8 to 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.630
 38 strong 29 wisdom in 29 power 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.310
 four critical hits 3 damage being 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.990
 but I price it like that because I 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.500
 I did not care a bit because I rocks 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.360
 not at all neutral so 12 of master 194 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.710
 nor five top-5 and that amounts to 4s 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.200
 creed neutral 4s 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.750
 amulets in the green jersey quick to 78 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.920
 intel 47 wisdom cisse it's a pea 16 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.930
 fire damage 707% 7% of which excludes offense 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.660
 awad that will soon leave when I get 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.660
 the famous love dofus on the scholar 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.920
 major the clever major the pest 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.170
 major fact that is great for the 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.350
 chakra concentration the madman 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:33.310
 major and the major initiator 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.880
 I regret everything said I think she 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.880
 is characteristic 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:45.310
 2500 of eight a380 of wise and 569 of 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:48.040
 force 596 intelligence guide it's not 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.410
 huge but I feel I have 120 of 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.820
 power through breakdown or colossal 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.320
 which is not bad that's why I have the 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.840
 fold and also for something else I 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.770
 want to show after so 110 agility of 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.940
 ends in 1 2 of three hostages shares 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.590
 first 572.8 to 11 6 pm 2253 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.250
 initiative we get lost 6 pm it's 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.220
 really great 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.479
 if po so thanks the colossal sign 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.170
 that's why I was talking to you 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.220

 show 51 10 This was done to 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.440
 only 38 skiffs pm world g8 pm 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.720
 in visibility so it's not too bad the 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.180

 go see this world finally I come back I 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.040
 would not see me well then 61 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.510
 tackle it's downright awesome for the 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.100
 double while I do not have much 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.780
 of agility but the panoply otomaÃ¯ 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.230
 colossal gives style or it's great 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.860
 95 power to exhale more 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.030
 forced that a set I had 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.910
 frankly it's good for multi 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.310
 elements there colossal panels of 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:57.270
 fixed resistors a year that's the 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:57.270
 damage 83 damage fire 35 of munster 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.010
 then in resistance 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.850
 I was showing you a thumbs up 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.850
 level 25 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:16.000
 so resistances 0% our 24% 24 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:20.560
 fixed born 10% earth 10% 10 fixed earth 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.550
 said fixed fire fixed 30 at dif xrdj% r 10 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.760
 7% fire and 17% to wali voilou 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.760
 who 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.310
 so here was the presentation 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.380
 monster soul now I'm doing all the 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.570
 time videos with this character that 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.330
 I love you so much indeed I epra

 an emerald that's guessing with the 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.710
 color good bah it is not a very pretty 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:49.020
 ski of a soul monster i prefer 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.009
 save for now for for 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.650
 wet up 

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:56.409
