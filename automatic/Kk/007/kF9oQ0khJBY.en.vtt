00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:41.809

 bring another school to 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:26.360
 it was possible to spend more time 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:30.659
 here and even if the memory is a little closer 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.439
 then close the door here is the inscription on 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.130
 every time here is the theme of our slogan 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.439
 au 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:45.000

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.720
 the movement is not that i'm natasha and this 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.460
 Krylov is a miller 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.820
 here they are in shorts because they used to 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.260
 something was drawn here 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.270
 type yes earlier there 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.160
 now there was nothing written by wolves 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.890
 not to be afraid of going to the forest like this 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.220
 top touch and this is a sticker of 5 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.610
 Sochi stars when we conceded in 2006 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.920
 now it hangs on here really 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.530
 how many we have been here 6 years 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.680
 rehearsing us of course changed 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.000
 kombik because half burned 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.310
 even doing a lot 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.120
 yes it was here that we composed most 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.730
 our songs 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.860
 lecture base during rehearsals all 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.620
 The first album is probably a taxi driver because 2 and 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.510
 right here we are if our name is rannet 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.180
 2 sit there next room now I'm 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.520
 show you this place sipping tea and 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.850
 going through all the words name bird 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:54.910
 vegetables and fruits and it came to this 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:57.459
 title angle right here and valuable 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:02.230
 bitch was here without girls true on 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.980
 that they were on the set of drums 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.230
 which now 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.550
 closed by us they are already such 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.670
 here we hope that we have one more time 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.820
 we had a very so strange fan 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.739
 remember what his name is but 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.530
 we occasionally had repairs here 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.100
 the deck itself and there were such shelves on 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.650
 the street that is, there went the builders and 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.590
 he is periodically shorter we rehearse and in 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:35.019
 the window appears it climbs through the window 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:37.900
 believe hello how are you still still us 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.269
 there was a mascot you see such a plush 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.150
 beaver and here he was just sitting answer 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.090
 in the holes in the barrel and when that is 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.030
 inside playing drums over those not 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.590
 the corpus danced and he lived here 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.230
 three if you're good you Th 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:04:01.390
 yes one more so far the new year is understandable 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.640
 that it is a fact when we are further here 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.900
 arrived here was absolutely empty 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.670
 room and just we had it all 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.650
 need to carry everything here 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.849
 equipment how things should be very 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.370
 for a long time they decided where to put 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.799
 drum and put a bird in the corner 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.910
 bodies in that corner they ended up 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:25.389
 in the middle so that nobody can see yes 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.770
 and here the only minus is that 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.419
 when people come here a lot 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.610
 people had to look at us like us 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:36.070
 we play they are on this sofa but 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:38.710
 when we play we sing always because 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.300
 that we cannot turn around 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.889
 whistle wind up the microphone so all 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.060
 how to find out perhaps races today 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:49.810
 dad always play 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.550
 and usually make all kinds of faces and not 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.440
 everyone else everyone they see is building 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.590
 faces 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.470
 because this is our house so warm too 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.470
 creative it was exactly the gallop 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.470
 left 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.669
 and not alone 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.470
 the key is now who has it here 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.970
 religion is actually my key then 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.479
 there is this stand 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.520
 which is my new korg here these 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.970
 stand just the same 6 years that is, we 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.039
 from the first day of our making music and she 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.010
 same not work on all words to avoid and 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:27.190
 current scotch the very first line 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:31.960
 dear therefore also does not throw out on an adhesive tape 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.760
 and here on the table 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.300
 periodically we are afraid that he 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.610
 ever can that is why well 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.770
 may falter as it stands 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.830
 That's how we got a huge column there 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.870
 heavy actually and the chair itself 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.770
 we actually unscrewed ourselves together 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.229
 and are not sure what they could run 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.819
 correct in full before the ration 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.690
 besides creative stories here 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:02.199
 there was a lot of jokes 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:04.780
 laughter personal drama personal drawn and sometimes 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.060
 when we came why sewer 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.830
 earring base Melnichenko to decide first 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:14.500
 joke he drops Vladimir twice 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.050
 or three even very much everything was closed he 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.729
 came here before us undressed there 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.129
 somewhere there is a type we come where 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:25.199
 closed open barannikov ribbons this 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:30.580
 this is it we go and he runs out with a knife to 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:31.990
 participants even left traces and see 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.780
 there are little black dots 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.509
 it is spray that is, the situation was I 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.240
 lay here from on the floor yet stood 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:43.030
 long ago from the kefir bank pink color and and 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.919
 wondered whether it would fall into my mouth or not and 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.780
 he ran and I was very scared when 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.090
 drove the moment there is not started to pour out 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.520
 so kefir he himself is interesting that he 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.129
 I replenished the bill that is, I did not spill it anywhere 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.949
 not on the head not on the eye and distortion 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:58.990
 started laughing earlier i went down on 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:06.360
 the wall of poverty on the game itself 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:06.360
 so the wall we can not brake yet
