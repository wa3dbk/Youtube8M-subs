00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
the electronics that this one have that

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.870 
the electronics that this one have that
beats<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.790> new<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.270> old<00:02:17.420> one<00:02:17.680> doesn't<00:02:18.680> have

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
beats the new the old one doesn't have

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.990 
beats the new the old one doesn't have
well<00:02:20.350> all<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.470> bikes<00:02:21.650> are<00:02:21.890> equipped<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.400> to

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
well all the bikes are equipped to to

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.420 
well all the bikes are equipped to to
have<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.660> map<00:02:23.840> for<00:02:24.050> each<00:02:24.110> bike<00:02:24.410> it's<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.950> it's

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
have the map for each bike it's a it's

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.890 
have the map for each bike it's a it's
an<00:02:25.520> additional<00:02:26.140> map<00:02:27.140> change<00:02:27.440> from<00:02:27.650> KTM<00:02:28.900> so

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
an additional map change from KTM so

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.800 
an additional map change from KTM so
from<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.650> race<00:02:30.800> bike<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.790> from<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.600> road

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
from the race bike to the from the road

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.150 
from the race bike to the from the road
bike<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.200> risk<00:02:33.410> by<00:02:33.560> believes<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.130> only

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
bike to the risk by believes the only

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.800 
bike to the risk by believes the only
difference<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.790> we<00:02:35.000> have<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> full

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
difference that we have is a full

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.979 
difference that we have is a full
exhaust<00:02:36.140> system<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.190> suspension<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:38.030> slightly

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
exhaust system and suspension a slightly

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.110 
exhaust system and suspension a slightly
more<00:02:39.230> responsive<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.959> we<00:02:42.170> make<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.040> mapping<00:02:43.880> a

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
more responsive so we make the mapping a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.250 
more responsive so we make the mapping a
little<00:02:44.420> bit<00:02:44.540> more<00:02:44.930> direct<00:02:45.350> for<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.010> race<00:02:46.130> bike

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
little bit more direct for the race bike

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.840 
little bit more direct for the race bike
