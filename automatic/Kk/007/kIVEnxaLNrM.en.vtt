is<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.670> pretty<00:01:32.030> beam<00:01:32.210> especially<00:01:32.690> in<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.900> first

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
is a pretty beam especially in the first

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.830 
is a pretty beam especially in the first
couple<00:01:33.680> of<00:01:33.830> hunger<00:01:34.070> games<00:01:34.250> i<00:01:35.030> think<00:01:35.720> those<00:01:35.810> are

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
couple of hunger games i think those are

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.420 
couple of hunger games i think those are
pretty<00:01:36.020> big<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.010> dangers<00:01:37.310> like<00:01:37.400> a

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
pretty big and the dangers like a

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.980 
pretty big and the dangers like a
separation<00:01:37.909> like<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.120> ninety-nine<00:01:38.750> percent

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
separation like the ninety-nine percent

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.230 
separation like the ninety-nine percent
of<00:01:39.230> one<00:01:39.350> person<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.040> that<00:01:40.150> disparity<00:01:41.150> and

complexities of war are the things that
Josh<00:01:53.960> was<00:01:53.990> speaking<00:01:54.890> about<00:01:54.950> early<00:01:55.400> earlier

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
Josh was speaking about early earlier

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.980 
Josh was speaking about early earlier
and<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:57.560> idea<00:01:58.430> of<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.640> sort<00:01:58.940> of<00:01:59.060> gray<00:01:59.330> quality

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
and the idea of the sort of gray quality

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.380 
and the idea of the sort of gray quality
of<00:02:00.110> war<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.860> it's<00:02:01.100> it's<00:02:01.400> confusing<00:02:02.060> and

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
of war to that it's it's confusing and

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.170 
of war to that it's it's confusing and
it's<00:02:02.510> complex<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:03.440> it's<00:02:04.159> never<00:02:04.820> an<00:02:05.030> easy

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
it's complex and it's never an easy

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.380 
it's complex and it's never an easy
decision<00:02:05.830> whether<00:02:06.830> you<00:02:07.370> know<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.850> war<00:02:08.239> is

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
decision whether you know a war is

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.869 
decision whether you know a war is
needed<00:02:08.780> or<00:02:08.869> not<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.409> even<00:02:10.039> if<00:02:10.159> one<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.519> needed

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
needed or not and even if one is needed

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.570 
needed or not and even if one is needed
there's<00:02:11.120> going<00:02:11.269> to<00:02:11.330> be<00:02:11.390> consequence<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:13.190> you

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
there's going to be consequence and you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.009 
there's going to be consequence and you
know<00:02:13.670> unfortunately<00:02:13.849> we're<00:02:14.540> surrounded<00:02:14.840> by

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
know unfortunately we're surrounded by

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.259 
know unfortunately we're surrounded by
war<00:02:15.319> all<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.590> time<00:02:15.799> and<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:16.909> think<00:02:16.970> the

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
war all the time and so I think the

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.630 
war all the time and so I think the
themes<00:02:17.510> hit

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
themes hit

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.390 
themes hit
has<00:02:19.910> complete<00:02:20.270> control<00:02:20.390> over<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.770> media<00:02:22.069> in

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
has complete control over the media in

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.830 
has complete control over the media in
the<00:02:23.240> first<00:02:23.480> movie<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:25.060> Katniss<00:02:26.060> begins<00:02:26.630> to

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
break that with PETA at the end of the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.770 
break that with PETA at the end of the
first<00:02:28.880> movie<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:30.760> over<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.880> course<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.480> this

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
and what they do with it becomes

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.740 
and what they do with it becomes
enormously<00:02:41.830> important<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.610> outcome<00:02:43.970> yeah

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
enormously important to the outcome yeah

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.120 
enormously important to the outcome yeah
this<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.020> a<00:02:45.050> question<00:02:45.230> for<00:02:45.470> Jennifer<00:02:45.800> Lawrence

believes in the revolution in the in
this<00:02:50.420> final<00:02:50.750> movie<00:02:50.989> or<00:02:51.110> do<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:51.290> think<00:02:51.470> she's

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
this final movie or do you think she's

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.229 
this final movie or do you think she's
just<00:02:51.770> playing<00:02:52.070> her<00:02:52.310> role<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.880> just<00:02:53.060> kind<00:02:53.209> of

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
just playing her role and just kind of

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.280 
just playing her role and just kind of
getting<00:02:53.420> sucked<00:02:53.720> into<00:02:53.870> doing<00:02:54.140> what's

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
getting sucked into doing what's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.500 
getting sucked into doing what's
expected<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.800> her<00:02:55.180> do<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.239> think<00:02:56.330> she

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
expected of her do you think she

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.060 
expected of her do you think she
actually<00:02:56.989> knows<00:02:57.320> what<00:02:57.530> she's<00:02:57.650> doing<00:02:57.680> anymore

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
actually knows what she's doing anymore

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.550 
actually knows what she's doing anymore
she's<00:02:58.400> just<00:02:58.610> being<00:02:58.760> manipulated<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.600> think

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
she's just being manipulated I think

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.350 
she's just being manipulated I think
that<00:03:00.709> for<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.920> long<00:03:01.130> time<00:03:01.519> I<00:03:01.550> wouldn't<00:03:02.090> say<00:03:02.330> that

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
that for a long time I wouldn't say that

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.330 
that for a long time I wouldn't say that
it<00:03:02.630> was<00:03:02.750> manipulated<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.530> would<00:03:03.980> call<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.310> more

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
it was manipulated it would call it more

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.420 
it was manipulated it would call it more
of<00:03:04.519> a<00:03:04.790> sense<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.209> survival<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:06.650> don't<00:03:07.370> think

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
of a sense of survival I don't think

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.610 
of a sense of survival I don't think
that<00:03:07.700> there<00:03:07.820> was<00:03:07.940> really<00:03:08.269> believable<00:03:09.080> hope<00:03:09.410> of

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
that there was really believable hope of

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.370 
that there was really believable hope of
a<00:03:09.739> revolution<00:03:10.870> at<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.959> beginning<00:03:12.290> of

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
a revolution at the beginning of

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.900 
a revolution at the beginning of
Katniss's<00:03:12.920> story<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.310> think<00:03:13.670> she<00:03:13.790> was<00:03:13.850> trying

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
Katniss's story I think she was trying

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.430 
Katniss's story I think she was trying
to<00:03:14.209> save<00:03:14.450> her<00:03:14.600> sister<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.110> then<00:03:15.230> she<00:03:15.350> was

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
to save her sister and then she was

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.290 
to save her sister and then she was
trying<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.680> save<00:03:15.860> herself<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.430> then<00:03:16.519> pita<00:03:16.820> and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.080 

waking<00:03:20.300> up<00:03:20.390> in<00:03:20.570> district<00:03:20.959> 13<00:03:21.910> changed<00:03:22.910> things

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
waking up in district 13 changed things

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.740 
waking up in district 13 changed things
losing<00:03:23.570> pita<00:03:23.780> changed<00:03:24.290> things<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:25.750> believe

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
losing pita changed things and I believe

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.970 
losing pita changed things and I believe
that<00:03:27.380> she<00:03:28.959> kind<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.079> grows<00:03:30.350> into<00:03:30.620> her<00:03:30.799> position

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
that she kind of grows into her position

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.810 
that she kind of grows into her position
and<00:03:31.579> takes<00:03:32.450> control<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.870> her<00:03:33.079> own<00:03:33.790> destiny<00:03:34.790> and

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
and takes control of her own destiny and

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.479 
and takes control of her own destiny and
in<00:03:35.510> that<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.900> revolution<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.070> something<00:03:37.400> that

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
in that the revolution so something that

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.930 
in that the revolution so something that
I<00:03:37.579> really<00:03:38.030> love<00:03:38.299> about<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.630> second<00:03:38.930> movie<00:03:39.200> as

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
I really love about the second movie as

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.740 
I really love about the second movie as
that's<00:03:40.940> when<00:03:41.239> she<00:03:41.980> takes<00:03:42.980> power<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.750> decides

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
that's when she takes power and decides

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.569 
that's when she takes power and decides
that<00:03:45.620> she<00:03:45.890> does<00:03:46.040> want<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.280> be<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.430> Mockingjay

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
that she does want to be the Mockingjay

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.360 
that she does want to be the Mockingjay
that<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.180> she<00:03:47.360> does<00:03:47.510> believe<00:03:47.690> in<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:47.989> cause

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
that that she does believe in this cause

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.390 
that that she does believe in this cause
but<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.459> took<00:03:49.610> many<00:03:49.940> years<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.570> many<00:03:50.930> books<00:03:51.400> to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
but it took many years and many books to

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.920 
but it took many years and many books to
get<00:03:52.549> there<00:03:52.700> it's<00:03:53.150> also<00:03:53.299> there's<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.630> difference

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
get there it's also there's a difference

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.810 
get there it's also there's a difference
between<00:03:53.959> being<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.560> warrior<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.310> being<00:03:55.640> the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
between being a warrior and being the

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.470 
between being a warrior and being the
symbol<00:03:56.060> of<00:03:56.269> a<00:03:56.390> revolution<00:03:56.989> and<00:03:57.260> Yanis<00:03:57.680> is<00:03:57.860> a

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
symbol of a revolution and Yanis is a

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.660 
symbol of a revolution and Yanis is a
character<00:03:59.480> who<00:03:59.660> wants<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.709> take<00:04:00.950> action<00:04:01.459> and

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
character who wants to take action and

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.420 
character who wants to take action and
to<00:04:02.239> do<00:04:02.390> what<00:04:02.570> needs<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.810> be<00:04:02.989> done<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:03.440> I<00:04:04.190> think

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
to do what needs to be done and I think

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.449 
to do what needs to be done and I think
doesn't<00:04:04.790> always<00:04:05.030> want<00:04:05.209> to<00:04:05.269> have<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.630> be<00:04:06.459> you

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
doesn't always want to have to be you

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.770 
doesn't always want to have to be you
know<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:08.120> sound<00:04:08.390> bite<00:04:08.660> or<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.769> poster<00:04:10.130> child

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
know the sound bite or the poster child

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.449 
know the sound bite or the poster child
so<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:11.810> think<00:04:12.079> she<00:04:12.230> might<00:04:12.380> be<00:04:12.410> willing<00:04:12.799> to<00:04:13.130> give

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
so I think she might be willing to give

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.640 
so I think she might be willing to give
up<00:04:13.610> being<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.450> Mockingjay<00:04:14.930> but<00:04:15.110> not<00:04:15.290> in

up being the Mockingjay but not in
Europe<00:04:15.890> not<00:04:16.310> give<00:04:16.579> up<00:04:16.669> being<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:16.910> revolution

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500
