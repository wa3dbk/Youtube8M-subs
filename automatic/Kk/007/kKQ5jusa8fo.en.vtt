just<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:11.909> really<00:01:12.060> confused<00:01:12.600> during<00:01:12.990> action

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
just get really confused during action

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.570 
just get really confused during action
scenes<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.799> there's<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.430> much

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
scenes because there's just so much

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.969 
scenes because there's just so much
going<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> lot<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> take<00:01:16.740> in

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
going on and it's just a lot to take in

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.679 
going on and it's just a lot to take in
but<00:01:17.280> Victoria<00:01:17.700> Aveyard<00:01:17.850> did<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.420> great

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689

we've got mayor who is a very unique
character<00:02:16.629> I<00:02:17.079> really<00:02:17.140> like<00:02:17.409> the<00:02:17.530> way<00:02:17.620> she<00:02:17.829> held

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
herself and how she handled different

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.240 
herself and how she handled different
situations<00:02:20.109> I<00:02:20.379> think<00:02:20.409> we<00:02:20.680> often<00:02:21.010> see<00:02:21.129> these

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
situations I think we often see these

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.530 
situations I think we often see these
characters<00:02:21.609> who<00:02:21.760> try<00:02:21.909> to<00:02:21.939> hold<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.359> together

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
characters who try to hold it together

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.089 
characters who try to hold it together
when<00:02:23.230> they're<00:02:23.349> going<00:02:23.560> through<00:02:23.709> trials<00:02:23.950> and

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
when they're going through trials and

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.559 
when they're going through trials and
tribulations<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.969> I<00:02:25.030> felt<00:02:25.239> like<00:02:25.329> mayor's

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
tribulations and I felt like mayor's

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.089 
tribulations and I felt like mayor's
character<00:02:26.019> was<00:02:26.260> willing<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.590> face<00:02:26.890> her

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
character was willing to face her

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.979 
character was willing to face her
emotions<00:02:27.549> head-on<00:02:27.970> when<00:02:28.540> something<00:02:28.900> was

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
emotions head-on when something was

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.599 
emotions head-on when something was
going<00:02:29.200> wrong<00:02:29.409> she<00:02:29.739> wasn't<00:02:30.010> afraid<00:02:30.069> to<00:02:30.280> feel

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
going wrong she wasn't afraid to feel

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.069 
going wrong she wasn't afraid to feel
and<00:02:30.909> it<00:02:30.970> was<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.209> really<00:02:31.299> nice<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.720> see<00:02:31.870> her

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
and it was just really nice to see her

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.990 
and it was just really nice to see her
be<00:02:32.230> vulnerable<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:33.579> let<00:02:33.760> herself

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
be vulnerable and to just let herself

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.390 
be vulnerable and to just let herself
feel<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.079> feels<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.709> know<00:02:35.829> I'm<00:02:35.920> saying<00:02:36.159> I

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.330

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
characters because they think that
