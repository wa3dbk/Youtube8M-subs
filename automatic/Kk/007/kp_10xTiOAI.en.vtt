um so this is a map I'll bring it up
this<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> map<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.850> found<00:00:33.360> online<00:00:33.690> that

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
this is a map that I found online that

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.110 
this is a map that I found online that
shows<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.489> blood<00:00:36.180> theme<00:00:36.540> locations<00:00:36.899> um<00:00:38.120> now

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
basically took between like 5 or 10

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.910 
basically took between like 5 or 10
seconds<00:01:29.070> um<00:01:30.020> before<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.500> were<00:01:31.680> actually

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
seconds um before we were actually

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.120 
seconds um before we were actually
infected<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> once<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.380> get<00:01:34.619> suits

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
before you run away or kill them you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.319 
before you run away or kill them you
want<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> check<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:38.909> whether<00:01:39.090> you've

the bear prism our we ran away and the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.330 
the bear prism our we ran away and the
reason<00:01:51.270> why<00:01:51.329> was<00:01:51.479> ran<00:01:51.630> away<00:01:51.750> because<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.680> was

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
