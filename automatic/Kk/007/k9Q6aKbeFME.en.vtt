pillar<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.170> hat<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.950> whip<00:01:32.670> has<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
pillar and hat so that whip has a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.510 
pillar and hat so that whip has a
tremendous<00:01:34.350> fuckin<00:01:34.770> range<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.280> able<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
tremendous fuckin range to be able to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.069 
tremendous fuckin range to be able to
hit<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.850> freaking<00:01:36.240> far<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.810> it's

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
hit that freaking far and it's

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.840 
hit that freaking far and it's
devastating<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.920> even<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.220> able<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.579> cut

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
devastating to be even to able to cut

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.219 
devastating to be even to able to cut
that<00:01:39.000> building<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.570> half<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.110> was

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
that building in half because that was

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.280 
that building in half because that was
like<00:01:40.259> solid<00:01:41.220> stone<00:01:41.640> solid<00:01:42.360> concrete<00:01:42.570> whatever

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
like solid stone solid concrete whatever

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.039 
like solid stone solid concrete whatever
it<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.680> Dolphy<00:01:44.520> cut<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.210> half<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.720> far

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
it was Dolphy cut that in half that far

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.679 
it was Dolphy cut that in half that far
away<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.799> precision<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:48.180> shows<00:01:48.479> you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
away with that precision so it shows you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.780 
away with that precision so it shows you
even<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.350> let's<00:01:49.619> say<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.979> instance<00:01:50.009> Nami<00:01:50.549> used

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
even if let's say for instance Nami used

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.550 
even if let's say for instance Nami used
to<00:01:50.880> make<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.149> little<00:01:51.390> circle<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.140> no<00:01:52.259> clouds

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
to make this little circle but no clouds

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.649 
to make this little circle but no clouds
above<00:01:52.979> them<00:01:53.159> Dolphy<00:01:53.909> most<00:01:54.119> likely<00:01:54.509> could

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
above them Dolphy most likely could

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.660 
above them Dolphy most likely could
still<00:01:54.899> reach<00:01:55.110> them<00:01:55.409> with<00:01:55.649> his<00:01:55.860> string<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.549> we

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
still reach them with his string so we

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880 
still reach them with his string so we
don't<00:01:56.850> really<00:01:57.090> know<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.810> range<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.680> his

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
don't really know the range of his

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.170 
don't really know the range of his
strings<00:01:59.219> we<00:01:59.340> don't<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.579> how<00:01:59.670> far<00:01:59.909> his

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
strings we don't know how far his

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.660 
strings we don't know how far his
strings<00:02:00.509> really<00:02:00.719> go<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.890> find<00:02:02.189> out<00:02:02.369> what

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
strings really go but we find out what

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.880 
strings really go but we find out what
he<00:02:02.909> has<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.509> use<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.020> able<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.350> fly<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
he has to use to be able to fly in the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.609 
he has to use to be able to fly in the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
nothing important there it's kind of

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.560 
nothing important there it's kind of
like<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> status<00:03:27.250> update<00:03:27.430> but<00:03:27.880> honestly<00:03:28.420> if<00:03:28.510> you

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
like a status update but honestly if you

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.360 
like a status update but honestly if you
look<00:03:28.780> at<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:28.959> scene<00:03:29.170> critically<00:03:29.620> nothing

really happened there was nothing really

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.750 
really happened there was nothing really
important<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.500> overall<00:03:32.560> episode<00:03:33.220> it's

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
important to the overall episode it's

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.070 
important to the overall episode it's
pretty<00:03:34.000> much<00:03:34.120> fought<00:03:34.420> or<00:03:34.600> getting<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.840> shit

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
pretty much fought or getting the shit

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.630 
pretty much fought or getting the shit
kicked<00:03:35.110> out<00:03:35.470> of<00:03:35.530> them<00:03:35.680> by<00:03:35.890> Cavendish<00:03:36.400> and

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
kicked out of them by Cavendish and

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.330 
kicked out of them by Cavendish and
Rebecca<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:38.170> scene<00:03:38.470> kind<00:03:38.830> of<00:03:39.040> was

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
Rebecca so that scene kind of was

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.250 
Rebecca so that scene kind of was
useless<00:03:39.730> but<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.239> understand<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.930> one<00:03:41.080> piece

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
useless but I understand that one piece

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.050 
useless but I understand that one piece
needs<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.560> use<00:03:41.739> these<00:03:41.920> scenes<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.640> be<00:03:42.760> able<00:03:42.970> to

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
needs to use these scenes to be able to

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.580 
needs to use these scenes to be able to
make<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.360> where<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.840> doesn't<00:03:43.989> catch<00:03:44.260> up<00:03:44.440> with

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
make it where it doesn't catch up with

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.920 
make it where it doesn't catch up with
the<00:03:44.709> manga<00:03:45.190> now<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.760> ending<00:03:46.180> of<00:03:46.330> this<00:03:46.450> episode

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
is when it gets really interesting

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.280

usually<00:03:48.880> one<00:03:49.239> piece<00:03:49.420> episodes<00:03:49.840> get<00:03:49.989> really

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
usually one piece episodes get really

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.360

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.309 
way I like the episode the way it ended
off<00:04:28.270> because<00:04:28.509> it<00:04:28.629> definitely<00:04:28.749> adds<00:04:29.080> that

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
off because it definitely adds that

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.809 
off because it definitely adds that

character which really makes his

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:39.839 
character which really makes his
character<00:04:37.449> more<00:04:37.629> complex<00:04:38.499> now<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.430> episode

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849

core<00:04:42.370> was<00:04:42.490> solid<00:04:42.849> progression<00:04:43.330> even<00:04:43.659> though

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
core was solid progression even though

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.899 
core was solid progression even though
if<00:04:44.020> you<00:04:44.229> look<00:04:44.409> at<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:45.159> was<00:04:45.310> kind<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:45.639> slow

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
if you look at it it was kind of slow
