good driving car the rear it features
all<00:00:47.010> new<00:00:47.250> suspension<00:00:47.580> so<00:00:48.540> this<00:00:48.720> multi-link

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
all new suspension so this multi-link

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380 
all new suspension so this multi-link
suspension<00:00:49.340> is<00:00:50.340> designed<00:00:50.880> to<00:00:51.060> improve

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
suspension is designed to improve

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.710 
suspension is designed to improve
lateral<00:00:52.230> grip<00:00:52.470> and<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:53.010> done<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.610> by<00:00:53.940> just

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
lateral grip and it's done so by just

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.720 
lateral grip and it's done so by just
really<00:00:55.140> beefing<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.830> components<00:00:56.490> that

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
really beefing up the components that

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.350 
really beefing up the components that
add<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.720> stiffness<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.740> the<00:00:58.860> links<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.400> US

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
add to stiffness so the links and the US

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.330 
add to stiffness so the links and the US
and<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.810> wheel<00:01:00.990> hubs<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.800> been<00:01:01.920> beefed<00:01:02.160> up

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and the wheel hubs have been beefed up

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.640 
and the wheel hubs have been beefed up
to<00:01:02.610> add<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.060> stiffness<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:03.720> that<00:01:03.870> way<00:01:04.110> lateral

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
to add to stiffness and that way lateral

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.599 
to add to stiffness and that way lateral
grip<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.979> increased<00:01:05.510> as<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.630> move<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> car

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:07.609 
grip is increased as you move up the car

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.719 
grip is increased as you move up the car
you<00:01:08.609> can<00:01:08.759> see<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> attention<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:10.009> nvh<00:01:11.009> so

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
you can see the attention to nvh so

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.149 
you can see the attention to nvh so
there's<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.140> nvh<00:01:13.140> package<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.920> sound

that<00:03:25.720> went<00:03:25.900> on<00:03:25.989> at<00:03:26.170> Nuremberg<00:03:26.530> ring<00:03:26.739> but<00:03:27.280> we

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
that went on at Nuremberg ring but we

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.880 
that went on at Nuremberg ring but we
also<00:03:27.519> developed<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.180> brake<00:03:28.420> cooling<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.739> need

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
also developed a brake cooling you need

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.920 
also developed a brake cooling you need
a<00:03:29.920> very<00:03:30.610> high<00:03:30.700> speed<00:03:30.760> track<00:03:31.209> to<00:03:31.330> do<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:31.690> you

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
a very high speed track to do so so you

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.840 
a very high speed track to do so so you
can<00:03:32.049> see<00:03:32.230> these<00:03:32.350> vents<00:03:32.650> here<00:03:32.860> so<00:03:33.430> these<00:03:33.549> vents

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
can see these vents here so these vents

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.460
