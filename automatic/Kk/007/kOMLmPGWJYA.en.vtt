note<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:30.960> go<00:01:31.020> ahead<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.170> swipe<00:01:31.409> back

and<00:01:31.950> that's<00:01:32.430> pretty<00:01:32.939> much<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and that's pretty much all there is to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.870 
and that's pretty much all there is to
it<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.200> new<00:01:34.320> notes<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:35.159> really<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:35.729> it

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
I think it's much much better than the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.100 
I think it's much much better than the
the<00:01:38.490> old-style<00:01:38.939> notes<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.600> easier<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the old-style notes it's easier on the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.990 
the old-style notes it's easier on the
eyes<00:01:40.229> easier<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.890> use<00:01:41.100> quicker<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.579> use<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
eyes easier to use quicker to use and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.179 
eyes easier to use quicker to use and
