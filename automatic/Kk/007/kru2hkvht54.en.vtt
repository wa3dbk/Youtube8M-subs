secondary<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.110> main<00:00:40.290> reason<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.940> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
secondary but the main reason is for it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.840 
secondary but the main reason is for it
to<00:00:42.180> look<00:00:42.360> nice<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.129> switch<00:00:44.129> your<00:00:44.160> weapon

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
to look nice and switch your weapon

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.760 
to look nice and switch your weapon
faster<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.690> mean<00:00:46.140> nobody's<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.620> be

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
faster but I mean nobody's going to be

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.750 
faster but I mean nobody's going to be
like<00:00:46.890> shooting<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.250> something<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.579> switch

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
like shooting at something then switch

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.130 
like shooting at something then switch
their<00:00:47.910> weapon<00:00:48.149> using<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> mean<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.899> might

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
their weapon using that I mean you might

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.479 
their weapon using that I mean you might
feel<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.620> professional<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.370> you're

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
feel like that professional and you're

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.479 
feel like that professional and you're
so<00:00:51.059> good<00:00:51.239> at<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.690> chances<00:00:52.410> are<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.430> don't

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
so good at it but chances are you don't

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.060 
so good at it but chances are you don't
want<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> use<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.910> for<00:00:53.940> trick<00:00:54.180> shotting<00:00:54.420> so

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070

if I want I can go like this so I switch
really<00:01:12.540> quickly<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.890> does<00:01:14.010> is

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
I cancel it out with my shock charge and
then<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.080> cancel<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.560> struck<00:01:22.770> charge<00:01:23.009> so

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
