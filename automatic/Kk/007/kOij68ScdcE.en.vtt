00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello very good cities that are here 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.020
 We are in minecraft and we are in my 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.360
 small series of tricks in this case 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.630
 let's do a few varied tricks 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.860
 let's do three tricks and nothing are going to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.550
 go to it okay let's go directly 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.260
 or jump from the top very good 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.880
 Well here you can see a few tricks 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.560
 that I have already done previously and if 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.369
 you want to see how they are made you know 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.390
 check the previous videos and vice and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.930
 what is this is a chunk a piece of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.130
 floating sand not so nothing how it is done 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.130
 Well, it's very simple, you put 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.010
 the casino what happens and what happened 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.839
 the sand fall 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.560
 I want to make a test for you to see 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.380
 that the sand 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.230
 it falls that down because the gravity 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.140
 is that yes and what happens that this is here 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.010
 floating and how this is done because nothing 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.510
 very simple where I put it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.059
 peliculero to the good thing well for 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.400
 example we put a little bit like that a bit 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.390
 of land is worth so that so more or 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.650
 least a dizzy jump hits me a tie 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.790
 but from the super cool we go and use 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.420
 the vine is worth, for example, here 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.119
 and now we put the block this and what 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.920
 we can put this here you can not and 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.650
 now what happens what 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.510
 Of course that is the case of sand does not fall 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.300
 and if we break this here 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.880
 ok we have it up here can we 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.600
 serve to do what for parkour 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.820
 or anything like that is worth it 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.170
 now let's bring this is the first 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.650
 trick curiosity and now let's go to 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.430
 bring this is the normal world worth and 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.010
 I have a throat 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.450
 Well, let's make a command that 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.240
 they put it, I think version 1.74 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.790
 ok and this is going to attract the super 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.300
 mega dragon of leander vale 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.030
 bar 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.550
 sumo 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.550
 walk but do not put 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.989
 dragon 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.540
 dragon this is important issue of the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.250
 capitals in the and of ender the first 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.620
 is and in that of dragon summum added a 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.160
 dragon we give to and we bring to 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.440

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.280

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.240
 hair or is it right now 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.650
 or we leave it quiet here is that 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.460
 I decided that it is going to load here already I know 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.810
 load everything not 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.209

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.750
 filthy dog that is loading 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:02.360
 all my things and my tricks and all 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.360
 come outside out of here 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.770
 go cloth uncle 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.530
 Well, here you liked to imagine 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.840
 do this in a village or something or 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.280
 it is brown 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.830
 well, well 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.320
 you can bring them 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.800
 the blocks that give life to the dragon 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.770
 ok it's also funny we're going to 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.260
 finish scare the ones I do not know if I 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.850
 follow now if you follow me I'll 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.840
 kill them 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.890
 he killed him and we continue recording 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.500
 one piece of shot or that has happened to 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.340
 poor dragon 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.340
 each voice 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:55.849
 millions of experiences 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.650
 Okay let's get out of here and please 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:02.060
 Well, I've explained the first 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.560
 trick that is the sand block 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.379
 floating then to bring the 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.510
 command to bring the dragon leander and 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:13.769
 Now I'm going to show you another little thing that 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.109
 for me it is the most interesting and can 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.850
 serve for example if you live with your hand 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.680
 is giving these ties that are 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.430
 incredible then if in the video it 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.350
 you will not notice, if for example, you share 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.229
 parcels with someone on a server or 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.180
 something like that and you want to hide a chest 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.100
 Nothing can be very useful for you but 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.580
 very pretty good here you see a wall 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.180
 normal and current and now I do not know if 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.599
 you will notice but for a moment the stripe 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.010
 which divides the two blocks disappears 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:48.090
 well, let's do it if you want to 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.270
 less than normal nothing mod me 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:55.130
 I have put 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.620
 but now for you to see the so that 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.740
 see if the trick is good you see the 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.140
 hairline in the middle that is black is worth 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.800
 it disappears for one second 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:10.520
 You see disappears then we give and open 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.400
 today we find a complete chest of 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.410
 everything in diamond plan and all that not what 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.260
 we put on and do what we always do and 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.030
 we run someone not because there 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.310
 back then nothing here behind there is a 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.680
 chest is worth a chest then it is 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.860
 it is hidden super well why 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.860
 do not 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.499
 Until the view is valid and how we do it 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.669
 Well, I'll explain it out here 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:35.729
 because I think it's better to see 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:38.639
 pretty good, do not model me 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.739
 come on we put it like that another jerk cillo 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:44.599
 my mother excuse me if you see it in plan 

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:46.960
 jerks 200 heaps let's take a 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:51.490
 chest 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:56.919
 if we put it back here for example is 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:59.760
 here and the chest we put it here and now 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:03.450
 Well, nothing we do like that 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.390
 so I'm not going to put it for now and 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.390
 that's fine and now we put the block of 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:12.690
 ladder here so very well and this what 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.480
 we put then for example I think it was yes 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.740
 no yes no 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:23.060
 and it has not been like that, come on, I think it was like that 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.139
 ok but I know we're going to try it 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.240
 we approach 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.599
 for a little while you have to 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.599
 disappear 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.419
 ok was sorry forgiveness let's repeat it 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.510
 a second voucher worth voucher 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:41.060
 we continue good then the one of this 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.540
 ladder like that and now to see if now I 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.480
 it comes out 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:49.200
 it's worth this corner way and now 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.580
 for example we put here and here and 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.740
 now what happens then from here you can not see 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.890
 nothing is worth it, we do not think it seems 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.600
 a normal wall we removed the mod 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.500
 so there does not seem to be a trap 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.650
 line by style 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.740
 we approach that I want to put the stripe 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.740
 is in the middle fair and disappears 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.230
 we open the chest worth nothing is very simple 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.130
 Well then, I do not expect anything 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:18.160
 liked these tricks a salutary 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:20.650
 nice that you are liking me are 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.330
 quite liking these tricks and nothing 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.640
 see you in the next video is that 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.720
 makes x bat 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.720
 come to the people see you later
