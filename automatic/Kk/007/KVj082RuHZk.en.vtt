00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 what happens more fans today I bring you a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.520
 small video in which we will see how 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.589
 the elephant moves 7 look moving 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.589
 some heavy games we started 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.720
 before I start with the video I'm going to 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.270
 teach what is the latest version that 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.210
 I have installed on my device we 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.910
 to adjustments information update and 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.020
 As you can see, the last one is from the 17th 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.130
 June 2015 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.950
 there you see it 2015 06 17 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.510
 let's check not being there 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.809
 some update today but good 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.820
 as you see is the last one so some 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.210
 once seen this we are going to move the games 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.360
 among them will be the blog will 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.530
 asphalt 8 the nova 3 and the cni for speed 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.530
 let's see how it moves 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.260
 As you can see I can see the mobile 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.030
 It develops quite well in almost all 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.830
 the games there have been maybe some 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.090
 download of frames in 93 nothing 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.060
 important of the game is perfectly 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.430
 playable and on asphalt 8 is where more 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.340
 it has been noticed that it is done a little more 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.350
 difficult the gameplay I would say is 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.870
 quite difficult to play asphalt 8 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.590
 then also watched out of curiosity how 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.030
 the model was moving comba 5 and equal more 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.140
 that nothing has not been done because a lot of people 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.600
 says that this game is pretty 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.730
 ungovernable on the mobile from here then 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.890
 confirmed that if the truth is that it's a bit 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.680
 in playable as for other games like 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.850
 it can be we love for speed because then not 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.950
 I had no problem like after 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.830
 to see and it's perfectly playable what 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.320
 move like 5 misses me because more or 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.880
 minus a new type 3 game is a 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.970
 shooter like he does not go test too 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.230
 requires a lot of graphic power and does not 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.060
 has virtually no problem 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.980
 move it as I say a download of frames 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.390
 very punctual from time to time but 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.880
 good perfectly playable games 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:24.030
 thing that with the modern combat 5 not 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.150
 it happens possibly it's software theme 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.220
 in the update s 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.840
 but but you have already seen that in the 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.450
 most games the terminal is 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.160
 perfectly functional and moves without 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.510
 no kind of problem so nothing 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.470
 up to here the video and see you in the 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.470
 next up to the wow
