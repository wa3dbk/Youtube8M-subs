00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.940
 Look who's the boss of the rocio. 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.599
 Tell me guys, what should this gamer bring? 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.449
 one more video and the guys you should already 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.980
 perceived there by the video that is a 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.140
 different thing 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.169
 in fact both in how you can 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.750
 being seen of a stone block of a 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.449
 ore stock we say so 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.900
 every time it is revealed in it will light 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.400
 light as if it were a lamp but not 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.629
 it's a toy 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.600
 I had seen it's this very toy 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.360
 time there on maine crash.net and I stayed 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.760
 looking and I wanted to buy that and 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.689
 When did you buy a Wii on the site? 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.699
 at the time and was arriving today 16 10 

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:03.460
 the first thing I did was there 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.500
 record unboxing know there is sorry 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.170
 the quality of the video that is not so 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.049
 Good thing I was with a little nation. 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.650
 so it gets a little bad even the 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.630
 quality but then people are there 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.650
 block that I was expecting for a lot 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.960
 time 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.220
 It would be really cool, I already knew he 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.040
 I needed a stack 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.460
 so I've prepared the knife for us 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.280
 open the lid and put the daughters 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.180
 because I could not wait to see this 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.200
 to function 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.380
 good after he was there all over with 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.240
 skin like julie elie he did not give a 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.630
 result so great 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.850
 looking in the light I gave a glow there not 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.280
 in a video that you can see more 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.700
 But I could not see you at the time. 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.710
 right there afterwards I decided to take 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.540
 a darker place but like you 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.790
 can see every time it is revealed in it 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.540
 he learns until he arrives in a 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.670
 shine more luck and then erase I know 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.190
 it's practically useless but it's one thing 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.319
 that I wanted to buy a long time ago and 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.659
 I find it interesting in the dark to 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.080
 video quality turned out to be worse 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:15.970
 then he ended up putting the cell phone 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.860
 but that's the video guys I hope 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.580
 you have enjoyed more forward 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.650
 another exit locke you both wait 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.220
 worry that I 'll bring more 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.220
 understood this until the next video and went
