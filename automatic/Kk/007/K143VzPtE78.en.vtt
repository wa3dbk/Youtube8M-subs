pacificocean terminally contaminated
there's<00:00:05.460> been<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> great<00:00:05.970> concern<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.420> outcry

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
there's been a great concern and outcry

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.740 
there's been a great concern and outcry
over<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.740> air<00:00:08.069> quality<00:00:08.400> from<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.389> nuclear

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
over the air quality from the nuclear

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.570 
over the air quality from the nuclear
fallout<00:00:10.019> how<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.530> wind<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.460> blow

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
fallout how this wind is going to blow

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.070 
fallout how this wind is going to blow
this<00:00:11.880> contaminated<00:00:12.599> air<00:00:12.840> all<00:00:13.830> across<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
this contaminated air all across the

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.710 
this contaminated air all across the
planet<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.410> especially<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.160> u.s.<00:00:17.460> now

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
planet and especially in the u.s. now

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.880 
planet and especially in the u.s. now
but<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> real<00:00:19.080> thing<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.619> should<00:00:19.650> be

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
but the real thing that we should be

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.590 
but the real thing that we should be
worried<00:00:20.100> about<00:00:20.160> isn't<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> air<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.480> air

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
worried about isn't the air and the air

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.080 
worried about isn't the air and the air
currents<00:00:22.140> as<00:00:22.350> much<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.130> something<00:00:23.490> even<00:00:23.910> more

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
currents as much as something even more

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.359 
currents as much as something even more
serious<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.830> most<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.220> this

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
serious and that is that most of this

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.980 
serious and that is that most of this
contamination<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.420> fall<00:00:27.599> into<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
contamination is going to fall into the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.849 
contamination is going to fall into the
ocean<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.039> contamination<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.880> huge

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
ocean and it's the contamination is huge

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.030 
ocean and it's the contamination is huge
this<00:00:31.859> pictures<00:00:32.369> show<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:34.040> contaminated

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
this pictures show that the contaminated

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.860 
this pictures show that the contaminated
particles<00:00:35.430> collect<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> clouds<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.540> in

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
particles collect in the clouds and in

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.990 
particles collect in the clouds and in
the<00:00:36.960> rain<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> ocean<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.940> that

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the rain and going to the ocean but that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.790 
the rain and going to the ocean but that
actually<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.660> contamination<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.620> we're

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
actually that contamination that we're

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.190 
actually that contamination that we're
talking<00:00:40.950> about<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:42.180> only<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.540> small<00:00:42.840> part

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
talking about here is only a small part

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.959 
talking about here is only a small part
of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.710> total<00:00:44.600> contamination<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.489> this<00:00:47.489> next

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
of the total contamination and this next

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.330 
of the total contamination and this next
picture<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.840> shows<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.079> energy<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:50.039> came

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
picture that shows the energy that came

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.639 
picture that shows the energy that came
from<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.879> tsunami<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.140> how<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.410> flowed

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
from the tsunami and and how it flowed

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.139 
from the tsunami and and how it flowed
out<00:00:52.680> into<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> ocean<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.520> look<00:00:53.730> at<00:00:53.850> how<00:00:53.940> it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
out into the ocean you look at how it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.490 
out into the ocean you look at how it
the<00:00:54.539> pattern<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.989> when<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.230> different

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the pattern that when it's different

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.069 
the pattern that when it's different
from<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.829> air<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.300> even<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:57.629> so

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
from the air and this is even more so

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.310 
from the air and this is even more so
true<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.309> ocean<00:00:59.840> because<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.109> this

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
true for the ocean because in this

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.229 
true for the ocean because in this
picture<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> explosion<00:01:02.760> that

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
picture you can see the explosion that

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.320 
picture you can see the explosion that
sent<00:01:03.480> hundreds<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> thousands<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
sent hundreds of thousands of

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.840 
sent hundreds of thousands of
contaminated<00:01:06.330> fuel<00:01:06.570> rods<00:01:06.960> from<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.950> plant

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
contaminated fuel rods from the plant

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.750 
contaminated fuel rods from the plant
power<00:01:09.270> plant<00:01:09.600> into<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> ocean<00:01:10.470> all<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.610> this

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
power plant into the ocean all of this

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.460 
power plant into the ocean all of this
contamination<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.810> into<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> ocean

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
contamination is going into the ocean

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.010 
contamination is going into the ocean
and<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> contamination<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.760> huge<00:01:15.119> this

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and the contamination is huge this

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.280 
and the contamination is huge this
picture<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:18.150> roof<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> building<00:01:18.960> in

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
picture is a the roof of the building in

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.190 
picture is a the roof of the building in
Japan<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.360> surf<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
Japan you can see that this surf in the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.219 
Japan you can see that this surf in the
circle<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> crane<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.310> holds<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.229> that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
circle is a crane that holds the that

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.440 
circle is a crane that holds the that
moves<00:01:25.560> these<00:01:25.799> rods<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.820> if<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.119> crane<00:01:27.420> is

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
moves these rods so if that crane is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.060 
moves these rods so if that crane is
exposed<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.170> means<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.500> all<00:01:28.619> those<00:01:28.770> rods

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
exposed that means that all those rods

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.859 
exposed that means that all those rods
are<00:01:29.310> exposed<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.270> contamination

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
are exposed and all this contamination

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.429 
are exposed and all this contamination
is<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.490> end<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.720> air<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.140> even

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
is going to end up in the air but even

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.830 
is going to end up in the air but even
more<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.189> huge<00:01:35.909> quantity<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.720> going

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
more so a huge quantity of it is going

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.289 
more so a huge quantity of it is going
to<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:37.049> right<00:01:37.229> into<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> ocean<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.729> now<00:01:38.970> what

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
to go right into the ocean and now what

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.749 
to go right into the ocean and now what
we<00:01:39.420> need<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.810> concerned<00:01:40.200> about<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.759> what

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
we need to be concerned about is what

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.280 
we need to be concerned about is what
the<00:01:41.939> air<00:01:42.090> currents<00:01:42.540> are<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the air currents are going to be the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.740 
the air currents are going to be the
water<00:01:43.500> currents<00:01:43.890> I'm<00:01:44.009> sorry<00:01:44.600> where<00:01:45.600> these

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
water currents I'm sorry where these

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.200 
water currents I'm sorry where these
water<00:01:45.990> currents<00:01:46.409> flow<00:01:46.680> because<00:01:47.670> where<00:01:48.060> they

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
water currents flow because where they

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.760 
water currents flow because where they
flow<00:01:48.540> they're<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> carry<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.100> huge

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
flow they're going to carry this huge

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.560 
flow they're going to carry this huge
contamination<00:01:52.770> into<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> water<00:01:53.450> into<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
contamination into the water into the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.130 
contamination into the water into the
oceans<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.320> we're<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.860> start<00:01:56.100> seeing

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
oceans and we're going to start seeing

this<00:04:11.720> long-term<00:04:12.049> effect<00:04:12.650> is<00:04:12.769> going<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:12.980> be<00:04:13.070> if

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
this long-term effect is going to be if

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.940 
this long-term effect is going to be if
you<00:04:13.400> look<00:04:13.519> at<00:04:13.640> these<00:04:13.790> currents<00:04:14.269> how<00:04:14.360> they<00:04:14.510> blow

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
you look at these currents how they blow

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.770 
you look at these currents how they blow
this<00:04:15.950> is<00:04:16.130> gonna<00:04:16.310> hit<00:04:16.579> it's<00:04:17.060> gonna<00:04:17.269> flow<00:04:17.570> and

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
this is gonna hit it's gonna flow and

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.979 
this is gonna hit it's gonna flow and
swirl<00:04:18.109> all<00:04:18.350> around<00:04:18.790> Australia<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.389> he's

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
swirl all around Australia and he's

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.439 
swirl all around Australia and he's
in<00:04:21.289> South<00:04:21.650> America<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.550> of<00:04:22.789> course<00:04:22.819> Central

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
in South America and of course Central

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.200 
in South America and of course Central
America<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.310> United<00:04:25.639> States<00:04:25.880> all<00:04:26.180> the

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
America and the United States all the

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.939 
America and the United States all the
way<00:04:26.330> up<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.630> Alaska<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.169> these<00:04:27.350> are<00:04:28.419> fantastic

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
way up to Alaska and these are fantastic

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:35.620 
way up to Alaska and these are fantastic
areas<00:04:30.949> for<00:04:31.400> fishing<00:04:31.849> so<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:34.000> huge<00:04:35.000> buttes<00:04:35.419> of

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
areas for fishing so a huge buttes of

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.420 
areas for fishing so a huge buttes of
food<00:04:35.960> supply<00:04:36.259> is<00:04:36.319> going<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.590> be<00:04:36.680> contaminated

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
food supply is going to be contaminated

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.960 
food supply is going to be contaminated
and<00:04:38.229> these<00:04:39.229> poor<00:04:39.470> animals<00:04:39.500> are<00:04:40.220> all<00:04:40.460> going<00:04:40.699> to

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
and these poor animals are all going to

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.710 
and these poor animals are all going to
be<00:04:41.470> suffering<00:04:42.470> enormous<00:04:43.280> Lee<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:43.880> of<00:04:44.509> course

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
be suffering enormous Lee and of course

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.749 
be suffering enormous Lee and of course
the<00:04:45.080> humans<00:04:45.470> too<00:04:45.710> are<00:04:45.860> going<00:04:46.039> to<00:04:46.160> suffer<00:04:46.490> a<00:04:46.520> lot

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
the humans too are going to suffer a lot

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.690 
the humans too are going to suffer a lot
from<00:04:47.479> this<00:04:47.630> event

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.970 

now<00:04:51.360> let's<00:04:51.570> look<00:04:51.690> at<00:04:51.870> Revelation<00:04:52.440> chapter<00:04:52.470> 8

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
now let's look at Revelation chapter 8

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.210 
now let's look at Revelation chapter 8
says<00:04:53.280> next<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:53.850> verse<00:04:54.120> 12<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:55.260> just<00:04:55.950> first

says next and verse 12 and just first

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.400 
says next and verse 12 and just first
well<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:57.330> fourth<00:04:57.570> angel<00:04:57.810> blew<00:04:58.200> his

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
well and the fourth angel blew his

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.770 
well and the fourth angel blew his
trumpet<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:59.100> a<00:04:59.790> third<00:05:00.030> of<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.300> Sun<00:05:00.570> was

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
trumpet and a third of the Sun was

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.420 
trumpet and a third of the Sun was
smitten<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.470> third<00:05:01.710> of<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.920> moon<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:02.370> a

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
smitten and a third of the moon and a

third<00:05:02.670> of<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:02.880> stars<00:05:03.090> in<00:05:03.420> order<00:05:03.660> that<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:04.050> third

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
third of the stars in order that a third

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.950 
third of the stars in order that a third
of<00:05:04.800> them<00:05:04.980> might<00:05:05.190> be<00:05:05.220> darkened<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.180> day

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
of them might be darkened and the day

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.440 
of them might be darkened and the day
might<00:05:07.830> not<00:05:08.070> have<00:05:08.280> illumination<00:05:08.970> for<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.180> third

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
might not have illumination for a third

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.290 
might not have illumination for a third
of<00:05:09.600> it<00:05:09.750> and<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.320> night<00:05:10.500> likewise<00:05:11.010> so<00:05:11.970> this<00:05:12.150> is

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
of it and the night likewise so this is

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.820 
of it and the night likewise so this is
what<00:05:12.450> we'll<00:05:12.600> be<00:05:12.630> looking<00:05:13.020> for<00:05:13.230> next<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:13.740> this

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
what we'll be looking for next and this

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.350 
what we'll be looking for next and this
should<00:05:14.010> be<00:05:14.100> happening<00:05:14.250> very<00:05:14.520> soon

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
should be happening very soon

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.470 
should be happening very soon
and<00:05:15.990> of<00:05:16.050> course<00:05:16.490> it's<00:05:17.490> curious<00:05:17.970> that<00:05:18.240> we're

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
and of course it's curious that we're

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.700 
and of course it's curious that we're
having<00:05:18.630> a<00:05:18.810> lot<00:05:19.020> of<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:21.300> called<00:05:21.540> comets<00:05:22.410> and

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
having a lot of so called comets and

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.790 
having a lot of so called comets and
asteroids<00:05:23.690> coming<00:05:24.690> very<00:05:25.050> close<00:05:25.320> to<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.650> earth

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
asteroids coming very close to the earth

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.730 
asteroids coming very close to the earth
this<00:05:26.010> is<00:05:26.160> a<00:05:26.190> very<00:05:26.490> curious<00:05:27.740> interesting

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
this is a very curious interesting

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.390 
this is a very curious interesting
parallel<00:05:29.160> and<00:05:29.780> even<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:31.350> gravitational<00:05:32.220> pull

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
parallel and even the gravitational pull

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.180 
parallel and even the gravitational pull
of<00:05:32.430> these<00:05:32.730> objects<00:05:33.600> has<00:05:34.170> been<00:05:34.410> already<00:05:34.590> noted

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
of these objects has been already noted

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.940 
of these objects has been already noted
by<00:05:37.190> coinciding<00:05:38.190> events<00:05:38.610> on<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.910> planet<00:05:39.530> so<00:05:40.530> I

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
by coinciding events on the planet so I

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.460 
by coinciding events on the planet so I
I<00:05:41.640> think<00:05:41.850> we've<00:05:42.180> been<00:05:42.390> getting<00:05:43.020> prepared<00:05:43.350> for

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
I think we've been getting prepared for

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.560 
I think we've been getting prepared for
these<00:05:43.710> things<00:05:44.040> and<00:05:44.400> of<00:05:44.970> course<00:05:45.210> a<00:05:45.360> lot<00:05:45.480> of

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
these things and of course a lot of

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.410 
these things and of course a lot of
people<00:05:45.780> have<00:05:45.870> been<00:05:46.370> recommending<00:05:47.420> buying

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
people have been recommending buying

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.520 
people have been recommending buying
food<00:05:48.750> and<00:05:48.930> water<00:05:49.110> and<00:05:49.760> kind<00:05:50.760> of<00:05:51.530> restricting

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
food and water and kind of restricting

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.400 
food and water and kind of restricting
your<00:05:53.420> travel<00:05:54.420> when<00:05:54.780> these<00:05:54.930> are<00:05:55.050> all<00:05:55.170> good

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
your travel when these are all good

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.670 
your travel when these are all good
ideas<00:05:55.830> I<00:05:55.980> think<00:05:56.750> but<00:05:57.750> this<00:05:57.960> is<00:05:58.170> just<00:05:58.290> a<00:05:58.470> very

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
ideas I think but this is just a very

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.120 
ideas I think but this is just a very
interesting<00:05:58.980> series<00:05:59.580> of<00:05:59.790> events<00:06:00.030> but<00:06:00.270> I

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
interesting series of events but I

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.560 
interesting series of events but I
surely<00:06:02.130> think<00:06:02.370> that<00:06:02.550> this<00:06:02.700> is<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:03.000> next<00:06:03.150> event

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
surely think that this is the next event

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.690 
surely think that this is the next event
to<00:06:03.720> occur<00:06:03.840> is<00:06:04.230> that<00:06:04.380> the<00:06:04.440> we're<00:06:05.250> gonna<00:06:05.340> see<00:06:05.580> the

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
to occur is that the we're gonna see the

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.450 
to occur is that the we're gonna see the
Sun<00:06:05.910> darkened
