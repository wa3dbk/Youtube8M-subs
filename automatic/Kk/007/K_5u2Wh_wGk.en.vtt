they're receiving and understanding so

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.640 
they're receiving and understanding so
if<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.310> person<00:01:17.520> has<00:01:17.700> problems<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.650> attention

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
if a person has problems with attention

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.399 
if a person has problems with attention
or<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.400> problems<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:21.150> memory<00:01:21.409> they

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
or they have problems with memory they

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.690 
or they have problems with memory they
don't<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> same<00:01:23.009> information<00:01:23.490> that

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
don't have the same information that

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.030 
don't have the same information that
somebody<00:01:24.180> else<00:01:24.360> may<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.799> need<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
somebody else may have and so we need to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.580 
somebody else may have and so we need to
understand<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.060> need<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
understand that and we need to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.510 
understand that and we need to
understand<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> capacities<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
understand the capacities of the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.609 
understand the capacities of the
individual<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.049> work<00:01:31.229> within<00:01:31.409> those

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
individual and to work within those

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.380 
individual and to work within those
capacities<00:01:32.360> for<00:01:33.360> example<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.329> I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
capacities for example if you and I

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.670 
capacities for example if you and I
spoke<00:01:36.659> two<00:01:36.869> different<00:01:37.140> languages<00:01:37.530> we

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
spoke two different languages we

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.190 
spoke two different languages we
couldn't<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.220> discussion<00:01:38.579> right<00:01:38.759> now

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
couldn't have this discussion right now

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.690 
couldn't have this discussion right now
so<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.380> would<00:01:40.530> need<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.829> support<00:01:41.340> which<00:01:41.549> would

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
so we would need a support which would

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.219 
so we would need a support which would
be<00:01:41.880> an<00:01:42.540> interpreter<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.780> one<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> things

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
be an interpreter so one of the things

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.679 
be an interpreter so one of the things
we<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.560> talk<00:01:46.740> about<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.909> being<00:01:48.240> able<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
we can talk about is being able to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.069 
we can talk about is being able to
interpret<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:50.100> person<00:01:50.579> helping<00:01:51.450> to

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
interpret for a person helping to

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.499 
interpret for a person helping to
provide<00:01:52.619> information<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> person<00:01:54.180> we

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
provide information to the person we

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.389 
provide information to the person we
