00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
armor than what we use on this vehicle

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.430 
armor than what we use on this vehicle
but<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:41.060> will<00:01:41.240> be<00:01:41.360> used<00:01:41.630> in<00:01:41.750> other<00:01:41.899> vehicles

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440

and<00:01:42.560> we're<00:01:42.710> working<00:01:42.890> on<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:43.720> an<00:01:44.720> array<00:01:45.470> of<00:01:45.500> it

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
and we're working on on an array of it

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.450 
and we're working on on an array of it
that<00:01:46.009> will<00:01:46.160> work<00:01:46.340> on<00:01:46.580> this<00:01:46.759> vehicle<00:01:46.970> as<00:01:47.300> well

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
that will work on this vehicle as well

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.980 
that will work on this vehicle as well
I've<00:01:49.460> been<00:01:49.700> driving<00:01:49.970> this<00:01:50.300> thing<00:01:50.360> every<00:01:50.959> day

very<00:02:22.940> well<00:02:23.209> it'll<00:02:24.020> take<00:02:24.440> inclines<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.550> take

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
very well it'll take inclines and take

you hit the gas pedal then we'll use the

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.890 
you hit the gas pedal then we'll use the

is<00:05:02.479> going<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.690> give<00:05:02.900> you

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:03.529 
is going to give you

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:06.249 
is going to give you
an<00:05:04.179> additional<00:05:05.179> 200<00:05:05.389> horsepower<00:05:05.929> electric

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
an additional 200 horsepower electric

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.349 
an additional 200 horsepower electric
horsepower<00:05:06.949> is<00:05:07.099> different<00:05:07.459> from<00:05:07.609> your

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:08.359 
horsepower is different from your

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:11.019

standard fuel style engine because the

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.639 
standard fuel style engine because the
electric<00:05:11.449> horsepower<00:05:11.869> is<00:05:12.049> right<00:05:12.289> when<00:05:12.529> you

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:12.649 
electric horsepower is right when you

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:15.039 
electric horsepower is right when you
touch<00:05:12.889> the<00:05:13.159> accelerator<00:05:13.759> it's<00:05:14.479> 200

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:15.049 
touch the accelerator it's 200

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:16.869 
touch the accelerator it's 200
horsepower<00:05:15.349> right<00:05:15.799> then<00:05:16.069> there's<00:05:16.669> no

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:16.879 
horsepower right then there's no

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.119 
horsepower right then there's no
hesitation<00:05:17.569> there's<00:05:17.749> no<00:05:17.899> lag<00:05:18.169> time<00:05:18.199> that

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
hesitation there's no lag time that

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.069 
hesitation there's no lag time that
combined<00:05:19.699> with<00:05:19.909> the<00:05:20.059> diesel<00:05:20.509> engine<00:05:20.809> is<00:05:20.929> going

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:21.079 
combined with the diesel engine is going

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:23.289 
combined with the diesel engine is going
to<00:05:21.139> give<00:05:21.319> you<00:05:21.469> unbelievable<00:05:22.369> acceleration

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:23.299 
to give you unbelievable acceleration

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:25.779 
to give you unbelievable acceleration
with<00:05:23.929> a<00:05:23.959> second<00:05:24.529> so<00:05:24.889> if<00:05:25.069> you<00:05:25.189> needed<00:05:25.519> to<00:05:25.549> get

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
with a second so if you needed to get

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.639 
with a second so if you needed to get
out<00:05:25.939> of<00:05:25.999> a<00:05:26.179> situation<00:05:26.209> or<00:05:26.959> into<00:05:27.349> a<00:05:27.379> situation

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:27.649 
out of a situation or into a situation

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:31.419 
out of a situation or into a situation
very<00:05:28.309> quickly<00:05:28.639> this<00:05:29.419> would<00:05:29.689> do<00:05:30.679> the<00:05:30.829> job<00:05:30.859> very

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:31.429 
very quickly this would do the job very

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:33.599 
very quickly this would do the job very
well<00:05:31.519> it's<00:05:32.029> going<00:05:32.149> to<00:05:32.239> give<00:05:32.329> you<00:05:32.479> just<00:05:32.989> just<00:05:33.349> a

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:33.609 
well it's going to give you just just a

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:36.639 
well it's going to give you just just a
extremely<00:05:34.609> powerful<00:05:35.079> vehicle<00:05:36.079> if<00:05:36.349> you<00:05:36.469> need

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:36.649 
extremely powerful vehicle if you need

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:38.919 
extremely powerful vehicle if you need
to<00:05:36.769> plow<00:05:36.979> through<00:05:37.009> something<00:05:37.759> you've<00:05:38.629> got<00:05:38.809> the

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
power to plow through it the armor is

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.799 
power to plow through it the armor is
actually<00:05:41.149> designed<00:05:41.509> with<00:05:41.839> a<00:05:41.949> dual<00:05:42.949> layer<00:05:43.249> of

philosophy about this vehicle is that

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.369 
philosophy about this vehicle is that
although<00:06:55.909> it's<00:06:55.939> great<00:06:56.389> and<00:06:56.569> it<00:06:56.779> outperforms

the overall performance of the vehicle
is<00:07:33.710> just<00:07:34.700> far<00:07:34.940> surpasses<00:07:35.720> what's<00:07:35.960> out<00:07:36.140> there

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:36.320 
is just far surpasses what's out there

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.320 
is just far surpasses what's out there
right<00:07:36.560> now<00:07:36.590> it<00:07:37.130> looks<00:07:37.160> like<00:07:37.580> it's<00:07:37.790> going<00:07:37.970> fast

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.330 
right now it looks like it's going fast

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.300 
right now it looks like it's going fast
even<00:07:38.840> just<00:07:38.990> like<00:07:39.230> while<00:07:39.620> it's<00:07:39.770> sitting<00:07:40.010> there

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:40.310 
even just like while it's sitting there
