five<00:00:45.350> LED<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.810> I'm<00:00:47.810> making<00:00:48.200> it<00:00:48.520> rechargeable

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
five LED and I'm making it rechargeable

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.300 
five LED and I'm making it rechargeable
I<00:00:49.670> don't<00:00:50.030> like<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.450> three<00:00:50.990> triple<00:00:51.650> a<00:00:51.830> battery

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
I don't like the three triple a battery

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.870 
I don't like the three triple a battery
that<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:52.820> uses<00:00:53.410> so<00:00:54.410> what<00:00:54.650> i<00:00:54.680> did<00:00:54.830> i<00:00:55.040> just<00:00:55.430> opened

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
that it uses so what i did i just opened

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.010 
that it uses so what i did i just opened
the<00:00:55.970> case<00:00:56.330> and<00:00:57.310> i<00:00:59.140> use<00:01:00.140> some<00:01:00.440> tapping<00:01:00.860> wise<00:01:01.100> and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
the case and i use some tapping wise and

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.670 
the case and i use some tapping wise and
soldered<00:01:03.020> it<00:01:03.339> onto<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.670> negative<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:06.050> the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
soldered it onto the negative and the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.150 
soldered it onto the negative and the
positive<00:01:07.040> terminal<00:01:07.550> and<00:01:08.360> then<00:01:09.350> i<00:01:09.590> pass<00:01:09.890> the

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
positive terminal and then i pass the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.730 
positive terminal and then i pass the
wires<00:01:10.460> through<00:01:11.300> a<00:01:11.390> small<00:01:11.810> hole<00:01:11.840> i<00:01:12.290> drove<00:01:12.560> that

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
wires through a small hole i drove that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.359 
wires through a small hole i drove that
hole<00:01:12.979> there<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:14.170> then<00:01:15.170> just<00:01:17.500> cover<00:01:18.500> slice

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
hole there and then just cover slice

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.080 
hole there and then just cover slice
back<00:01:19.729> on<00:01:20.000> here<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:22.540> this<00:01:23.540> is<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:24.610> lithium<00:01:25.610> ion

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
back on here and this is the lithium ion

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.150 
back on here and this is the lithium ion
battery<00:01:26.680> three<00:01:27.680> point<00:01:27.950> seven<00:01:28.160> volt<00:01:29.860> 5000<00:01:30.860> ma

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
battery three point seven volt 5000 ma

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.210 
battery three point seven volt 5000 ma
and<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.540> is<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.990> charge<00:01:33.410> controller<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:35.600> i

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
and this is the charge controller so i

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.890 
and this is the charge controller so i
just<00:01:37.600> put<00:01:38.600> everything<00:01:38.960> in<00:01:39.550> through<00:01:40.550> this

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
just put everything in through this

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.800 
just put everything in through this
wiring<00:01:41.900> connector<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:43.180> that's<00:01:44.180> it<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.570> now

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
wiring connector and that's it and now

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.550 
wiring connector and that's it and now
all<00:01:45.020> i<00:01:45.140> have<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.350> do<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:45.890> glue<00:01:46.310> this<00:01:47.320> with<00:01:48.320> some

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
all i have to do is glue this with some

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.290 
all i have to do is glue this with some
hot<00:01:48.770> glue<00:01:49.310> in<00:01:49.580> place<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:50.420> I'm<00:01:51.200> in<00:01:51.409> business

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:06.320 

just<00:01:56.300> at<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:58.450> melt<00:01:59.450> glue

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.499 

and<00:02:07.330> this<00:02:08.080> is<00:02:08.229> ready<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.680> go<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.850> battery<00:02:10.390> is

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
and this is ready to go this battery is

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.190 
and this is ready to go this battery is
actually<00:02:11.040> charged<00:02:12.040> already<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:16.420> if<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.840> woulda

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
actually charged already but if I woulda

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.060 
actually charged already but if I woulda
charged<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:18.040> just<00:02:18.520> use<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.970> USB<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.860> one

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
charged it just use the USB this one

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.030 
charged it just use the USB this one
here<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:22.140> lithium-ion<00:02:23.140> battery<00:02:23.620> charge

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
here this lithium-ion battery charge

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.910 
here this lithium-ion battery charge
controller<00:02:24.550> uses<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.650> micro<00:02:26.650> USB<00:02:27.310> connector

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
controller uses the micro USB connector

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.220 
controller uses the micro USB connector
as<00:02:29.920> opposed<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:33.580> mini<00:02:34.000> USB<00:02:34.360> or<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
as opposed to the mini USB or the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.880 
as opposed to the mini USB or the
regular<00:02:35.650> USB<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.360> plug<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.930> in<00:02:38.080> green

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
regular USB so you plug it in green

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.730 
regular USB so you plug it in green
actually<00:02:39.640> is<00:02:39.820> fully<00:02:40.300> charged<00:02:40.690> because<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.560> is

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
actually is fully charged because it is

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.420 
actually is fully charged because it is
charged<00:02:42.610> already<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:45.130> now<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:45.940> have<00:02:46.360> something

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
charged already and now I have something

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:57.660 
charged already and now I have something
that<00:02:48.430> can<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:51.390> rechargeable<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:57.160> can<00:02:57.370> even

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
that can be rechargeable and I can even

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.390 
that can be rechargeable and I can even
make<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:57.880> solar<00:02:58.530> rechargeable<00:02:59.530> if<00:02:59.860> I<00:03:00.010> wanted

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
make it solar rechargeable if I wanted

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.530 
make it solar rechargeable if I wanted
to<00:03:00.640> but<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.830> think<00:03:02.830> it's<00:03:03.060> easy<00:03:04.060> enough<00:03:04.300> to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
to but I think it's easy enough to

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.620 
to but I think it's easy enough to
recharge<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:06.720> pretty<00:03:07.720> bright<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:10.120> set

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
recharge and pretty bright so just set

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.330 
recharge and pretty bright so just set
it<00:03:10.780> down<00:03:10.810> like<00:03:11.290> that

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.700 

thanks<00:03:18.340> for<00:03:18.550> watching
