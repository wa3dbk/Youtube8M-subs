00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hey people welcome on this channel 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.609
 Cup winner and I'm glad that 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.529
 you have to be here what the topic 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.719
 read aloud from the colleagues of us that 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.719
 grave has written which experiences 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.990
 he did what he did before 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.910
 At the end of 2013, his typical music life was like this 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.760
 from musician's apology so out 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.939

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.610
 mug every day vegetables and fruits maximum 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.350
 five percent extremely much alcohol very much 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.840
 long irregular real and long 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.670
 mainly food restaurants 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.430
 and fuck concerts and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.280
 parties have been around since the beginning of 2014 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.670
 mixture of vegan raw food rottweil 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.649
 in front 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.070
 So that's exactly what we all are 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.239
 I already have a mix of heiko 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.550
 said sleep regulates daily sports 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.370
 result in words not to be described 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.059
 that means it's mega happy he cares a lot 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.059
 much better 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.150
 and exactly this point people 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.189
 quality of life quality of life let that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.010
 word melt on the tongue 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.689
 You can not buy that somewhere 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.640
 get any abbreviation somewhere 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.460
 yes, there are still people who hope 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.799
 almost to the ultimate medical 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.420
 technical revolution what we live 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.040
 doubled lengthened yes there must be 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.350
 exactly twice as much work and 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.570
 watch tv twice as much if it is 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.369
 according to which according to the opinion of some there 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.990
 or that is that these people are the ones 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.119
 hey man thinks we all can 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.630
 cure diseases and two of the top 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.400
 bullshit 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.020
 do not be fooled look today 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.409
 but at times on which we stand today 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.450
 are 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.780
 we are on the technological stand 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.970
 in particular also medical stand 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.259
 which we have never had 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.820
 at least the last few thousand 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.070
 years before that you never know 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.110
 had my glass ball but we are up 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.390
 the supreme stand and look at you 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.500
 But take a look 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.810
 just I always have the two 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.570
 points to health general 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.060
 health public health yes, above all 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.890
 in the western world and theme 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.530
 nutrition 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.709
 we would have to have them all over 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.450
 I'm getting totally fit with technology everywhere 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.700
 shit has turned to extreme 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.220
 But the quality of the food is always 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.590
 further down and that the point 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.599
 quality of life that is when you are every day 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.550
 Get up when you are happy when you are 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.790
 Feels good when you feel vital 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.239
 and for some fair the solar are like that 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.370
 so not intangible words because they 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.680
 sometimes even so young are where it is easy 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.959
 no role plays but people 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.420
 I say I tell you a thing now 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.620
 from personal experience 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.620
 probably belonging to the 0 1 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.959
 percent the power so blatant their 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.720
 lifestyle have changed everything 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.280
 nutrition &amp; co 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.599
 although they are not any 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.610
 had health problems or 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.390
 were sick yes how was it tipptopp 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.620
 birgit hoppe but still and that is 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.910
 again very important to tell me here 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.329
 People were jumping the improvement 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.340
 really extreme yes really extreme 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.880
 it's okay if you say so 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.560
 shit i have this and that about 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.140
 digestive difficulties now bad 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.750
 skin or no idea what I put 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.959
 that's why I like everything 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.450
 therefore improve 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.480
 but if you leave it virtually free 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.430
 then you get out of it 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.620
 as many advantages it is always like that 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.139
 people are getting more out of it than that 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.019
 she's in there, yes, I think it's funny 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.750
 how something like this as you pervades 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.910
 if I am here but of radical me 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.420
 I 'll have to scourge myself behind him 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.180
 and as if I have to torture me because 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.220
 this cool feeling every day 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.380
 to be in a good mood 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.079
 it's just that you can go through 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.790
 nothing to replace pay by nothing 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.310
 that is also more and more people like that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.930
 Companies see it that way because a coworker 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.079
 he is fit 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.180
 who is healthy which feels good the 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.450
 is a hundred times more productive than someone 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.950
 who tortures himself every day and me 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.590
 many people see each other every day 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.880
 torment 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.919
 on the other side and that's me 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.590
 quasi important as a second point 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.070
 I write quite a lot in this video 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.900
 to martin my buddies simon party and 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.610
 drink 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.070
 this and that and that's just not 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.800
 but I believe the lifestyle for me 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.539
 I do not get any support for that either 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.539
 same of people who say hey my 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.500
 partner or my family 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.080
 they have no understanding whatsoever 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.900
 and they even make fun of themselves 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.970
 it's ridiculous about it 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:51.220
 find this ridiculous and I say that 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:56.210
 you people one does not require any 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:58.010
 from us or from you that you 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.630
 equal to all others in your environment to 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.699
 change over and say hey knows if you 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.110
 says i want to improve my diet 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.729
 do not drive sport over more 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.850
 I want to be that fucking thing 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.350
 Nobody wants everybody to be the same 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.780
 cries out and says yes I do with him 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.449
 supported you and laura dollar though 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.370
 we still want the least understanding 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.889
 for that and if somebody 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.479
 ridiculous or funny about it and 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.440
 the whole thing in the sense not even 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:27.380
 he has to accept one thing for you 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.130
 its people there for you nothing more 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.020
 to pull out 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.750
 yes there is nothing for you out there 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.960
 pull and you have the willy- nilly the 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.789
 go alone alone in the sense 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.010
 that your partner family is not there 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.449
 join in because these people you can 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.039
 Do not pick the partner you could 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.099
 choose but do not want to 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.479
 become so radically the same 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.229
 for me, only one partner comes into question 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.539
 Definitely in any case 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.740
 a bit of sport and a little bit 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.630
 Health-interested is not one 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.180
 it must be the same if you do not like that 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.699
 a basic concern then it is 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.190
 Just for me, for example, no go 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.830
 a no-go because that's one of those 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.830
 value base yes it's just an enormous one 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.919
 values ​​basis for me that's why I am 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.659
 Also so happy with my girlfriend, yes that 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:19.190
 is so extremely good we are training 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:20.990
 extremely good symbiosis and it is 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.520
 so people if i do not have your family 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.849
 support nothing else remains for you 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.250
 left to go through that alone but 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.659
 please also tell the people hey you can 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.820
 Doing what you want is really mine 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:32.719
 Shit I've got that I accept that 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.450
 still understanding 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:36.190
 but I want to try something now 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.560
 so 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.820
 have that in the back of my mind and lend it 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.200
 I 'm always and make up 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:46.690
 not funny about it because that is no go 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.420
 you really have to have a value base too 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.770
 build up for you then pulls too 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.080
 even though it's the first moment 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.420
 unpleasant is yes, the step goes like 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.400
 then you have to go because these people 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.980
 such things as news I 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.870
 just read by people who there 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.700
 you can already tell by 180 degrees 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:09.130
 they are really transformed that way now 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.320
 full of energy and motivation and 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.990
 Vitality and everything are coming 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.840
 every now and then and motivate 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.990

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:23.110
 really so to speak to the infos too 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:25.900
 give and I never get tired 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.800
 looked my first videos purely yes i 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.980
 was a bit shy maybe 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.930
 but I burned for it too yes 

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.330
 I am burning for it today as on the first day 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:37.390
 like me over three years ago 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.770
 started and then before believe 

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.500
 Two years with me over two years 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.810
 I started burning youtube 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:47.200
 just because that's just one 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.570
 awesome thing people every day is really 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.000
 so people are attracted by the quality of life 

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:55.480

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.050
 important and still for your sake
