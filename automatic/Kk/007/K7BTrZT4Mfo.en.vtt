00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:14.960
 and the one who waves as they are, I hope very 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.340
 well as you can see today 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.619
 I have an introduction to you 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.539
 I usually have it because I do not know since 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.220
 Yesterday he had a lot of bad luck yesterday 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.740
 I felt really bad because girls already 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.230
 you know those days of the month so I know 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.880
 I felt terrible and I started to record my 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.880
 introduction and how can you see 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.590
 my sound was worth it but that's not 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.650
 No problem because we can 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.180
 add voice to the videos and how could they 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.890
 see an introduction I have this 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.050
 makeup that I really do in 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.730
 10 minutes and do the makeup when 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.559
 I'm in a hurry that I have to go to 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.420
 the school or that I have to go with my 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.880
 boyfriend to eat and he tells me is to hurry up 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.620
 hurry up that you're already taking 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.230
 so I always use like that 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.870
 makeup focused on my lips and nothing 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.670
 more I use only one shade color then 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.920
 the first thing we are going to do is delineate 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.440
 our lips with a pencil obviously 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.880
 you choose the color you want if you 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.130
 you want to put the rosita so put on the 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.110
 Rosita but I like red because that's the way 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.300
 I do not have to battle and nothing harder 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.369
 second to grab my favorite lipstick not 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.680
 I have to go there experimenting 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.140
 nothing of that and then I will use a 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.410
 red lipstick to last this 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.910
 makeup all day and I put it with 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.399
 a brush to make it look like 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.830
 rather if the video existed but you 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.750
 I put straight from the tube does not matter 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.380
 nothing else I did it like that to make it 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 best 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.079
 and now let's go with the eyebrows I decided 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.630
 use this gel with dawn color this 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.090
 gel is super good and super fast for 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.950
 accommodate those little megan celebrities and 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.390
 also that I change the color one more 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.520
 or less because as I want my 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.500
 focus be the lips then for me 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.929
 It is super easy to make eyebrows very 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.880
 natural and this studies it in color 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.869
 more clarito here in the box below 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.159
 I will leave you 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.439
 all the information of all the 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.210
 products that I am using although not the 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.009
 show on the screen obviously here 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.780
 Abajito can see how I use it to 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.939
 the eyebrows that observe the lips and 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.950
 all those things and after that I 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.400
 like to use a pencil for the eyebrows to 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.860
 fill those holes those little things that 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.080
 they look ugly to accommodate the eyebrows and they do not 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.250
 see how scattered as 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.980
 I usually bring it 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.200
 and now to not see me so pale and so 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.450
 I do not know how zombie I'm going to contour well 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.690
 fast my face and what I do is that 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.850
 He used a very matte coffee color 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.340
 but very clear and I put it in the 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.870
 lines of my cachet and obviously also 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.750
 like that on the forehead and all those things 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.300
 the nose and you put it where you want and 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.490
 I use a light color like the ones above 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.950
 as they saw to blur like that so 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.440
 not having to be so perfectionist of 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.300
 that there was not good there is no one left 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.880
 line anything else is better as that 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.030
 blur it with a little powder more clearly and 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.630
 so that it looks like I do not know better and that 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.050
 that nothing else took like about 20 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.910
 seconds next step is one of my 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.860
 favorites that is to see us a little bit 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.840
 more awake and cooler we are going to 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.750
 illuminate the high parts of our 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.360
 face example the middle the nose up 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.940
 of the cheekbones the middle of the forehead in 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.440
 the arch of the lips and basically in 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.080
 all those parts that you want to be 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.239
 notice more before the shadows I like 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.550
 apply a primer because that's how I 'm going to 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.920
 ensure that my makeup will last 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.050
 and now we 're going to go with the shadows 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.870
 as you can see I am using this shadow 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.390
 coffee but that has a lot of red example 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.580
 a brown coffee more than anything because 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.920
 I feel that the coffees that have the red 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.500
 quite not marked are they made to me 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.860
 super natural and what I want from 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.200
 this makeup is a tuxedo then 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.870
 I'm going to grab a shadow more or less 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.090
 coffee that is natural you are not going to win 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.070
 black because it's going to be like that very much 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.660
 cook and obviously we want to 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.160
 stay with our subject that 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.930
 we last 10 minutes doing this 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.320
 makeup remember that you are not going to 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.110
 put neither green nor do not know black or something 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.570
 how can you see something very natural and what 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.700
 what are you going to do, you are going to grab a brush 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.560
 half flat of the brush that you 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.580
 you prefer and you are going to apply the product 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.320
 with little touches on the entire mobile eyelid 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.750
 then you are going to leave that company and 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.420
 then you're going to grab another brush that 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.910
 brush is clean and with that brush you go 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.800
 to blur all your eyelid as if 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.870
 outside a windshield like that from one side towards 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.240
 the other one and he will keep going up to the 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.310
 eye socket obviously you can also 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.740
 another shadow a little softer 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.620
 to take it higher up I like it 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.780
 it looks like a little bit pulled the 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.240
 shade and I like it to get higher 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.610
 from the eye socket because I love 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.860
 the makeup as my eyes can see 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.419
 they are a little bit more sleepy and it's because 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.490
 that this makeup the truth 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.249
 I love I feel that it looks pretty 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.499
 photos and in person too 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:01.329
 and so that my eyes look bigger 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.879
 and more awake I will outline them with 

00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:05.979
 this pencil on the inside 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.529
 my eyes in the water part with a 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.109
 Very natural color flesh color or a day 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:13.479
 and now so that my eyes look more 

00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:15.279
 like smoke and there I will grab the same 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.009
 shadow that I used on the top with 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:20.229
 a smaller brush and I'm going to blur 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.149
 all super good at the bottom of 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.159
 my eye I recommend that you put the 

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:26.049
 direct product to the root of 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.179
 lashes this will make it look more 

00:05:26.049 --> 00:05:29.639
 blurred and with that effect of is like 

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:31.830
 waths up 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.479
 and to finish my makeup I'm going to 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.729
 teach my eyelashes and then I'll 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.800
 apply my favorite mask making sure 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.569
 to put the product very well in the root 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.909
 of the eyelashes this will make the eyes 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.379
 they will be a little bit bigger and good 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.479
 I hope you liked this 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:47.639
 video remember that they can do it in 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.889
 10 minutes obviously you use the colors 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.360
 that you prefer and remember that the 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.150
 I want very much very much I send you a 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.340

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.210

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.210
