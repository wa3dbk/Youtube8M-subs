recently someone asking me if I'd do
another<00:00:16.370> test<00:00:16.700> on<00:00:17.530> these<00:00:18.550> stab<00:00:19.550> proof<00:00:19.730> vest

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
another test on these stab proof vest

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.470 
another test on these stab proof vest
panels<00:00:21.100> now<00:00:22.100> this<00:00:22.250> is<00:00:22.310> an<00:00:22.550> upgrade<00:00:22.700> panel<00:00:23.360> that

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
panels now this is an upgrade panel that

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.499 
panels now this is an upgrade panel that
you<00:00:23.600> put<00:00:24.190> in<00:00:25.190> your<00:00:25.430> vest<00:00:25.730> on<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:28.160> heart<00:00:29.029> in<00:00:29.360> a

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509 
you put in your vest on the heart in a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.790 
you put in your vest on the heart in a
chest<00:00:29.900> like<00:00:30.169> that<00:00:30.590> ah<00:00:31.960> now<00:00:32.960> this<00:00:33.110> one<00:00:33.410> is<00:00:35.800> knife

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
chest like that ah now this one is knife

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.210 
chest like that ah now this one is knife
and<00:00:37.480> spike<00:00:38.710> protection<00:00:39.710> one<00:00:40.630> all<00:00:41.630> right<00:00:42.220> this

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
and spike protection one all right this

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.780 
and spike protection one all right this
goes<00:00:43.520> up<00:00:43.760> to<00:00:43.910> never<00:00:44.090> free<00:00:44.980> so<00:00:48.640> obviously<00:00:49.640> if

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
goes up to never free so obviously if

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.150 
goes up to never free so obviously if
this<00:00:50.030> withstands<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.080> knife<00:00:51.650> and<00:00:51.920> spike

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
this withstands the knife and spike

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.260 
this withstands the knife and spike
tests<00:00:52.780> obviously<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:54.370> higher<00:00:55.370> up<00:00:55.730> ones<00:00:56.000> are

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
tests obviously the higher up ones are

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.440 
tests obviously the higher up ones are
gonna<00:00:56.420> protect<00:00:56.810> even<00:00:57.260> more<00:00:58.000> I'll<00:00:59.000> test<00:00:59.300> this

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
gonna protect even more I'll test this

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.620 
gonna protect even more I'll test this
before<00:00:59.870> with<00:01:00.290> lots<00:01:00.530> of<00:01:00.650> spikes<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.630> knives

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.779 
compared to being stabbed in heart
there's<00:01:26.600> nothing<00:01:26.719> is<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:27.520> anyway<00:01:28.520> they

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
there's nothing is it so anyway they

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.510 
there's nothing is it so anyway they
asked<00:01:29.179> if<00:01:29.299> I<00:01:29.479> would<00:01:29.749> do<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.770> test<00:01:31.100> with<00:01:31.689> the

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
asked if I would do the test with the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.550 
asked if I would do the test with the
Magnum<00:01:34.520> combat<00:01:35.149> dagger<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.689> I've<00:01:35.840> got<00:01:36.109> so<00:01:36.530> I

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
Magnum combat dagger and I've got so I

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.669 
Magnum combat dagger and I've got so I
thought<00:01:37.100> I'd<00:01:37.280> do<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.319> because<00:01:39.319> I<00:01:39.530> never

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
thought I'd do this and because I never

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.080 
thought I'd do this and because I never
did<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.490> last<00:01:40.700> on<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.539> what<00:01:42.079> I'd<00:01:42.579> do<00:01:43.579> test<00:01:43.909> with

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
did it last on of what I'd do test with

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.809 
did it last on of what I'd do test with
Maya<00:01:44.240> furball<00:01:45.079> Sykes<00:01:45.490> fighting<00:01:46.490> knife<00:01:46.639> as

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
Maya furball Sykes fighting knife as

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.660 
Maya furball Sykes fighting knife as
well<00:01:47.710> so<00:01:48.710> I'll<00:01:48.859> test<00:01:49.359> both<00:01:50.359> of<00:01:50.569> these<00:01:51.670> against

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
well so I'll test both of these against

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.849 
well so I'll test both of these against
the<00:01:53.060> stab<00:01:53.509> proof<00:01:53.689> panel<00:01:54.259> I'll<00:01:54.469> just<00:01:54.679> move

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
the stab proof panel I'll just move

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.029 
the stab proof panel I'll just move
camera<00:01:55.159> down<00:01:55.369> in<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.579> minute<00:01:56.079> and<00:01:57.079> then<00:01:57.799> all<00:01:57.979> our

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
camera down in a minute and then all our

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.020 
camera down in a minute and then all our
do<00:01:58.759> Tesla<00:01:59.179> right<00:01:59.509> so<00:01:59.780> this<00:01:59.869> is<00:02:00.049> what<00:02:00.200> I'll<00:02:00.350> be

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
do Tesla right so this is what I'll be

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.260 
do Tesla right so this is what I'll be
stabbing<00:02:02.530> into<00:02:03.530> it's<00:02:04.399> a<00:02:04.520> bit<00:02:04.639> soft<00:02:04.999> because

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
stabbing into it's a bit soft because

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.249 
stabbing into it's a bit soft because
that's<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.749> replicate<00:02:06.289> a<00:02:06.469> body<00:02:07.069> a<00:02:07.219> body<00:02:07.459> isn't

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
that's the replicate a body a body isn't

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.050 
that's the replicate a body a body isn't
gonna<00:02:09.259> be<00:02:09.500> rock<00:02:09.890> hard<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.399> it's<00:02:10.729> gonna<00:02:10.850> have

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
gonna be rock hard is it it's gonna have

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.550 
gonna be rock hard is it it's gonna have
better<00:02:11.209> give<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:13.780> let's<00:02:14.780> just<00:02:15.020> move<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.350> down

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
better give so let's just move this down

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.290 
better give so let's just move this down
a<00:02:15.620> bit<00:02:15.830> more

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.070 

so<00:02:21.650> I'll<00:02:22.650> show<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.920> what<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.280> does<00:02:23.959> put<00:02:24.959> this

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
so I'll show you what it does put this

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:41.540 
so I'll show you what it does put this
line<00:02:25.319> lid<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:39.739> it<00:02:40.739> goes<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.220> couple<00:02:41.459> of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
line lid on it goes in a couple of

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.150 
line lid on it goes in a couple of
millimeters<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:45.680> don't<00:02:46.680> want<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.940> go<00:02:47.940> too<00:02:48.000> mad

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
millimeters I don't want to go too mad

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.430 
millimeters I don't want to go too mad
that's<00:02:50.160> Stanley<00:02:50.400> slip<00:02:50.850> but<00:02:53.720> also<00:02:54.720> use<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.380> a

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
that's Stanley slip but also use this a

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.040 
that's Stanley slip but also use this a
lot<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.680> times<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:57.030> there's<00:02:57.269> pretty<00:02:57.570> badly

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
lot of times so there's pretty badly

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:10.550 
lot of times so there's pretty badly
worn<00:02:58.530> now<00:03:06.830> nothing<00:03:07.830> at<00:03:07.950> all<00:03:09.140> don't<00:03:10.140> even<00:03:10.350> go

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
worn now nothing at all don't even go

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.100 
worn now nothing at all don't even go
through<00:03:10.769> glass<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:12.209> might<00:03:12.450> do<00:03:12.690> if<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.900> did

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
through glass that might do if you did

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.229 
through glass that might do if you did
that<00:03:13.140> on<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.500> heart<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.010> surface<00:03:17.150> doing<00:03:18.150> the
