00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
just want to compare it to one side of

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.029 
just want to compare it to one side of
my<00:04:47.210> face<00:04:47.509> and<00:04:47.569> let's<00:04:48.080> see<00:04:48.319> what<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.620> looks<00:04:48.830> like

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
my face and let's see what it looks like

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.680 
my face and let's see what it looks like
I<00:04:51.099> love<00:04:52.099> the<00:04:52.220> way<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.460> feels<00:04:52.639> feels<00:04:53.150> really

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
I love the way it feels feels really

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.809 
I love the way it feels feels really
light<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.169> zom--<00:04:54.349> it<00:04:54.710> almost<00:04:54.979> feels<00:04:55.250> like<00:04:55.340> I'm

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
light the zom-- it almost feels like I'm

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:01.689 
light the zom-- it almost feels like I'm
just<00:04:56.030> using<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.389> damp<00:04:56.629> sponge<00:04:57.050> on<00:04:57.470> my<00:04:57.650> face<00:05:00.699> the

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
just using a damp sponge on my face the

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.430 
just using a damp sponge on my face the
side<00:05:01.969> that<00:05:02.240> I<00:05:02.300> just<00:05:02.750> apply<00:05:03.669> the<00:05:04.669> foundation

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
side that I just apply the foundation

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.050 
side that I just apply the foundation
and<00:05:06.440> this<00:05:06.620> is<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:06.949> side<00:05:07.219> that<00:05:07.250> doesn't<00:05:07.759> have

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
and this is the side that doesn't have

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.689 
and this is the side that doesn't have
foundation<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.349> as<00:05:10.009> you<00:05:10.099> can<00:05:10.250> see<00:05:10.490> it's<00:05:10.639> a

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
foundation and as you can see it's a

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.279 
foundation and as you can see it's a
really<00:05:10.969> good<00:05:11.150> match<00:05:11.389> there<00:05:11.690> really<00:05:11.870> isn't

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
really good match there really isn't

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.830 
really good match there really isn't
that<00:05:12.800> much<00:05:13.190> of<00:05:13.400> a<00:05:13.610> color<00:05:13.849> difference<00:05:14.090> not<00:05:14.479> not

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069 
feels extremely lightweight and the

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.999 
feels extremely lightweight and the
color<00:05:25.940> well<00:05:26.719> the<00:05:26.840> application<00:05:26.990> is<00:05:27.590> buildable

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
color well the application is buildable

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.580 
color well the application is buildable

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.210 

I<00:06:05.930> like<00:06:06.930> this<00:06:07.140> foundation<00:06:07.740> a<00:06:07.830> lot<00:06:07.980> is

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
I like this foundation a lot is

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.300 
I like this foundation a lot is
definitely<00:06:08.280> is<00:06:09.150> lightweight<00:06:09.780> a<00:06:10.310> lightweight

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310

foundation<00:06:11.550> it<00:06:12.030> goes<00:06:12.240> on<00:06:12.480> shear<00:06:12.870> and<00:06:13.170> then<00:06:13.740> you

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
foundation it goes on shear and then you

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.280 
foundation it goes on shear and then you
can<00:06:14.100> build<00:06:14.370> up<00:06:14.730> the<00:06:15.360> coverage<00:06:15.570> you<00:06:15.810> can<00:06:16.080> build

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
can build up the coverage you can build

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.720 
can build up the coverage you can build
your<00:06:16.410> coverage<00:06:16.680> because<00:06:17.100> I<00:06:17.160> had<00:06:17.310> some<00:06:17.490> dark

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
your coverage because I had some dark

dark<00:06:18.120> spots<00:06:18.510> some<00:06:18.750> black<00:06:18.960> spots<00:06:19.350> and<00:06:19.800> it

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
dark spots some black spots and it

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.490 
dark spots some black spots and it
covered<00:06:21.300> it<00:06:21.390> very<00:06:21.420> nicely<00:06:21.840> it<00:06:22.080> didn't<00:06:22.350> make<00:06:22.440> it

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
covered it very nicely it didn't make it

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.550 
covered it very nicely it didn't make it
go<00:06:22.830> away<00:06:23.010> I<00:06:23.520> could<00:06:24.330> still<00:06:24.540> see<00:06:24.810> a<00:06:24.840> little<00:06:25.350> bit

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
go away I could still see a little bit

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.020 
go away I could still see a little bit
of<00:06:25.740> it<00:06:26.220> but<00:06:26.460> basically<00:06:27.150> it's<00:06:27.480> gone<00:06:28.610> in<00:06:29.610> regards

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
of it but basically it's gone in regards

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.880 
of it but basically it's gone in regards
to<00:06:30.090> the<00:06:30.180> weight<00:06:30.300> look<00:06:30.510> before<00:06:30.720> I<00:06:30.930> applied<00:06:31.320> the

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
to the weight look before I applied the

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.840 
to the weight look before I applied the
cushion<00:06:32.790> foundation<00:06:34.310> again<00:06:35.310> this<00:06:35.460> is<00:06:35.640> so

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
cushion foundation again this is so

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.940 
cushion foundation again this is so
lightweight<00:06:36.210> I<00:06:36.660> love<00:06:37.290> the<00:06:37.470> way<00:06:37.590> this<00:06:37.770> feels

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
lightweight I love the way this feels

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.770 
lightweight I love the way this feels
this<00:06:38.160> for<00:06:38.400> me<00:06:38.520> is<00:06:38.700> perfect<00:06:39.030> for<00:06:39.420> the<00:06:39.510> summer

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
this for me is perfect for the summer

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.710 
this for me is perfect for the summer
because<00:06:40.080> it<00:06:40.440> doesn't<00:06:40.770> feel<00:06:40.950> like<00:06:41.130> I'm<00:06:41.370> wearing

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
because it doesn't feel like I'm wearing

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.010 
because it doesn't feel like I'm wearing
foundation<00:06:42.720> does<00:06:42.960> it<00:06:43.110> feel<00:06:43.320> like<00:06:43.350> the<00:06:44.130> Lancome

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
foundation does it feel like the Lancome

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.450 
foundation does it feel like the Lancome
24-hour<00:06:46.020> foundation<00:06:46.620> which<00:06:46.980> is<00:06:47.100> a<00:06:47.130> little

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
24-hour foundation which is a little

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.580 
24-hour foundation which is a little
thicker<00:06:47.700> and<00:06:47.850> it's<00:06:48.090> meant<00:06:48.300> to<00:06:48.360> be<00:06:48.450> a<00:06:48.810> heavier

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
thicker and it's meant to be a heavier

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.090 
thicker and it's meant to be a heavier
heavier<00:06:49.980> coverage<00:06:50.790> and<00:06:51.530> this<00:06:52.530> is<00:06:52.710> quite<00:06:52.950> the

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
heavier coverage and this is quite the

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.060 
heavier coverage and this is quite the
opposite<00:06:53.840> when<00:06:54.840> I<00:06:54.930> first<00:06:55.170> put<00:06:55.350> it<00:06:55.440> on<00:06:55.560> my<00:06:55.800> face

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
opposite when I first put it on my face

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.970 
opposite when I first put it on my face
did<00:06:56.550> feel<00:06:56.850> a<00:06:57.090> little<00:06:57.120> a<00:06:57.780> little<00:06:58.440> sticky<00:06:58.950> I

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:58.980 
did feel a little a little sticky I

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.220 
did feel a little a little sticky I
would<00:06:59.220> say<00:06:59.400> but<00:06:59.940> once<00:07:00.510> you<00:07:00.630> let<00:07:00.780> it<00:07:00.900> dry<00:07:01.170> down

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
would say but once you let it dry down

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.800 
would say but once you let it dry down
or<00:07:01.800> once<00:07:02.340> once<00:07:02.790> you<00:07:02.910> put<00:07:03.180> your<00:07:03.390> setting

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
or once once you put your setting

or once once you put your setting
powders<00:07:04.200> over<00:07:04.530> whatever<00:07:04.950> you<00:07:05.160> use<00:07:05.430> today<00:07:05.670> I
