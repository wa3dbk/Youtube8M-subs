00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.000 
the roadmap for getting beat cone
mainstream<00:03:16.519> I<00:03:16.819> think<00:03:17.299> starts<00:03:17.690> here<00:03:18.079> like<00:03:18.769> we

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
mainstream I think starts here like we

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.119 
mainstream I think starts here like we
have<00:03:19.159> a<00:03:19.190> finally<00:03:19.989> development<00:03:20.989> off<00:03:21.140> of<00:03:21.170> secure

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
have a finally development off of secure

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.860 
have a finally development off of secure
and<00:03:22.400> convenient<00:03:22.849> wallets<00:03:23.299> full<00:03:23.569> disick

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
and convenient wallets full disick

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.170 
and convenient wallets full disick
wallets<00:03:24.230> all<00:03:24.980> kinds<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.400> new<00:03:25.610> things<00:03:25.640> that

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
wallets all kinds of new things that

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.490 
wallets all kinds of new things that
will<00:03:26.299> make<00:03:26.329> a<00:03:26.540> bit<00:03:26.750> go<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.079> at<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.290> same<00:03:27.440> time

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
will make a bit go and at the same time

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.130 
will make a bit go and at the same time
or<00:03:27.980> secure<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.519> use<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.970> more<00:03:29.180> easy<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.900> use

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
or secure to use and more easy to use

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.920 
or secure to use and more easy to use
and<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:31.340> will<00:03:31.549> allow<00:03:31.790> regular<00:03:32.359> people<00:03:32.720> use

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
and that will allow regular people use

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.000 
and that will allow regular people use
pin<00:03:33.200> code<00:03:33.440> securely<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.519> easily<00:03:34.970> and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
pin code securely and easily and

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.569 
pin code securely and easily and
hopefully<00:03:37.010> we<00:03:37.129> will<00:03:37.220> see<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.400> lot<00:03:37.549> of

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
hopefully we will see a lot of

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.660 
hopefully we will see a lot of
development<00:03:38.180> on<00:03:38.269> that<00:03:38.420> side

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
development on that side

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.230 
development on that side
next<00:03:40.330> year<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:41.400> think<00:03:42.400> there's<00:03:42.610> probably<00:03:42.760> never

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
next year I think there's probably never

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.140 
next year I think there's probably never
been<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:43.870> many<00:03:44.140> like<00:03:44.550> central<00:03:45.550> keep<00:03:45.880> it

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
been so many like central keep it

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.320 
been so many like central keep it
configures<00:03:46.810> in<00:03:47.410> one<00:03:47.739> conference<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.700> think

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
configures in one conference I think

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.410 
configures in one conference I think
this<00:03:49.630> color<00:03:49.870> versus<00:03:50.290> almost<00:03:51.130> everyone<00:03:51.640> so

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
this color versus almost everyone so

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.510 
this color versus almost everyone so
that's<00:03:52.840> kind<00:03:53.110> of<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.770> really<00:03:53.830> good<00:03:54.220> opportunity

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
that's kind of a really good opportunity

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.120 
that's kind of a really good opportunity
for<00:03:54.910> networking<00:03:55.410> getting<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.530> know<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.950> key

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
for networking getting to know the key

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.760 
for networking getting to know the key
people<00:03:57.340> here<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.450> think<00:03:58.690> that<00:03:58.900> at<00:03:59.560> least

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
people here and I think that at least

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.729 
people here and I think that at least
for<00:03:59.950> us<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.880> worked<00:04:01.150> out<00:04:01.330> successfully<00:04:02.080> with

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
for us it worked out successfully with

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.729 
for us it worked out successfully with
bit<00:04:02.980> code<00:04:03.220> 2014<00:04:04.000> it's<00:04:04.810> going<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.140> cut<00:04:05.350> huge

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
bit code 2014 it's going to cut huge

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.479 
bit code 2014 it's going to cut huge
step<00:04:06.130> forward<00:04:06.519> it's<00:04:07.239> much<00:04:07.750> more<00:04:07.959> serious

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
step forward it's much more serious

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.920 
step forward it's much more serious
there's<00:04:09.489> a<00:04:09.580> lot<00:04:09.790> more<00:04:09.819> companies<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.690> much

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
there's a lot more companies is much

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.620 
there's a lot more companies is much
bigger<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:12.400> level<00:04:12.670> of<00:04:12.730> innovation<00:04:13.120> is

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
bigger and the level of innovation is

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.740 
bigger and the level of innovation is
incredible<00:04:14.410> and<00:04:15.329> it's<00:04:16.329> going<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.540> be<00:04:16.600> really

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
incredible and it's going to be really

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.990 
incredible and it's going to be really
interested<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.229> see<00:04:17.470> all<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.190> these<00:04:18.430> develops

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
interested to see all of these develops

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.519 
interested to see all of these develops
over<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.750> next<00:04:19.959> six<00:04:20.139> months<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.709> next<00:04:21.250> year
