00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629 

this<00:00:00.390> is<00:00:00.570> a<00:00:00.599> very<00:00:00.870> cool<00:00:01.140> product<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:01.860> uh<00:00:02.100> I

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
this is a very cool product this is uh I

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.110 
this is a very cool product this is uh I
believe<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.510> second<00:00:04.170> fanless<00:00:05.100> power<00:00:05.549> supply

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
believe the second fanless power supply

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.330 
believe the second fanless power supply
that<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.420> have<00:00:06.660> unboxed<00:00:07.290> but<00:00:07.770> what's<00:00:07.980> really

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
that I have unboxed but what's really

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.190 
that I have unboxed but what's really
special<00:00:08.490> about<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:09.179> one<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.780> fact<00:00:10.050> that

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
special about this one is the fact that

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.280 
special about this one is the fact that
it<00:00:10.500> achieves<00:00:10.950> its<00:00:11.280> fanless<00:00:11.730> design<00:00:12.150> not<00:00:13.080> by

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
it achieves its fanless design not by

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.709 
it achieves its fanless design not by
the<00:00:13.349> use<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.730> extremely<00:00:14.730> heavy<00:00:14.969> heat<00:00:15.269> sinks

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
the use of extremely heavy heat sinks

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.470 
the use of extremely heavy heat sinks
but<00:00:16.230> rather<00:00:16.560> through<00:00:17.279> incredible<00:00:18.119> efficiency

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
but rather through incredible efficiency

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.349 
but rather through incredible efficiency
so<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> 400<00:00:20.100> watt<00:00:20.130> unit<00:00:20.580> from<00:00:20.730> C<00:00:20.939> sonic

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
so this is a 400 watt unit from C sonic

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.200 
so this is a 400 watt unit from C sonic
and<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.080> 80<00:00:22.350> plus<00:00:22.680> gold<00:00:22.710> certified<00:00:23.670> we're

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
and it is 80 plus gold certified we're

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.790 
and it is 80 plus gold certified we're
starting<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.720> see<00:00:24.869> more<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.140> more<00:00:25.260> 80<00:00:25.500> plus

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
starting to see more and more 80 plus

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.189 
starting to see more and more 80 plus
gold<00:00:25.830> certified<00:00:26.519> power<00:00:26.760> supplies<00:00:27.180> but<00:00:27.930> this

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
gold certified power supplies but this

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.500 
gold certified power supplies but this
is<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.590> first<00:00:28.859> one<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.189> uses<00:00:29.699> that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
is the first one that uses that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.359 
is the first one that uses that
incredible<00:00:31.170> efficiency<00:00:31.410> now<00:00:31.920> remember

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
incredible efficiency now remember

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.150 
incredible efficiency now remember
efficiency<00:00:33.120> means<00:00:33.329> how<00:00:34.110> much<00:00:34.290> power<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.980> can

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
efficiency means how much power it can

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.270 
efficiency means how much power it can
produce<00:00:35.370> versus<00:00:36.210> how<00:00:36.360> much<00:00:36.570> excess<00:00:37.280> random

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
produce versus how much excess random

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
produce versus how much excess random
heat<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.879> outputs<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> uses<00:00:39.930> that

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
heat that it outputs so it uses that

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.740 
heat that it outputs so it uses that
efficiency<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.890> output<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.579> little<00:00:41.910> heat<00:00:42.120> that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
efficiency to output so little heat that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.369 
efficiency to output so little heat that
it<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.440> run<00:00:43.710> without<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.460> fan<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.510> so

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it can just run without a fan at all so

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.569 
it can just run without a fan at all so
you<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.590> see<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> summary<00:00:47.550> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
you can see here we have a summary of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.760 
you can see here we have a summary of
the<00:00:47.730> connectors<00:00:48.210> always<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.440> also

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the connectors always this is also

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.119 
the connectors always this is also
really<00:00:50.100> cool<00:00:50.190> single<00:00:50.940> 12<00:00:51.539> volt<00:00:51.870> 33<00:00:52.649> amp<00:00:52.829> rail

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
really cool single 12 volt 33 amp rail

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.299 
really cool single 12 volt 33 amp rail
so<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> single<00:00:54.539> rail<00:00:54.750> design<00:00:55.230> 80<00:00:55.890> plus

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
so this is a single rail design 80 plus

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.389 
so this is a single rail design 80 plus
gold<00:00:56.780> fanless<00:00:57.780> power<00:00:58.379> supply<00:00:58.949> let's<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
gold fanless power supply let's have a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.619 
gold fanless power supply let's have a
look<00:00:59.520> at<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> back<00:00:59.879> here<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.780> see<00:01:01.079> sonic<00:01:01.350> has<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
look at the back here so see sonic has a

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.670 
look at the back here so see sonic has a
slightly<00:01:03.629> different<00:01:03.809> design<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.369> output

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
slightly different design for the output

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.929 
slightly different design for the output
okay<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.159> I'll<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.369> let<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> look<00:01:08.820> at

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
okay you know I'll just let you look at

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.310 
okay you know I'll just let you look at
the<00:01:09.030> diagram<00:01:09.210> because<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.840> haven't<00:01:10.020> really

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the diagram because I haven't really

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.580 
the diagram because I haven't really
studied<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.710> ahead<00:01:10.979> ton<00:01:11.189> ahead<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.640> time<00:01:11.850> but

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
studied that ahead ton ahead of time but

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.469 
studied that ahead ton ahead of time but
basically<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:14.250> they're<00:01:14.460> able<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.210> by

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
basically what they're able to do is by

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.690 
basically what they're able to do is by
keeping<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.200> amperage<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.830> lower<00:01:17.189> within<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
keeping the amperage is lower within the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.210 
keeping the amperage is lower within the
power<00:01:17.880> supply<00:01:18.360> overall<00:01:19.320> they're<00:01:19.770> able<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
power supply overall they're able to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.090 
power supply overall they're able to
lose<00:01:20.430> less<00:01:20.880> efficiency<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:22.049> way<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.979> they

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
lose less efficiency that way so they

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.800 
lose less efficiency that way so they
have<00:01:23.189> high<00:01:23.340> current<00:01:23.759> gold-plated<00:01:24.420> terminals

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
have high current gold-plated terminals

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.300 
have high current gold-plated terminals
I<00:01:24.900> guess<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.290> start<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.650> unboxing<00:01:25.770> now

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
I guess we can start the unboxing now

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.469 
I guess we can start the unboxing now
high<00:01:26.939> reliability<00:01:27.829> 105<00:01:28.829> degree<00:01:29.610> rated

high reliability 105 degree rated
capacitors<00:01:31.100> conductive<00:01:32.100> okay<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.700> solid

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
capacitors conductive okay so solid

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.109 
capacitors conductive okay so solid
solid<00:01:33.810> capacitors<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:35.400> five-year

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
solid capacitors and a five-year

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
solid capacitors and a five-year
warranty<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.869> unit<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.320> fanless<00:01:37.829> zero

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
warranty on this unit is fanless zero

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.740 
warranty on this unit is fanless zero
decibels<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.700> would<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.970> great<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.600> a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
decibels so this would be great for a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.940 
decibels so this would be great for a
media<00:01:43.020> PC<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:46.020> would<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.350> great<00:01:46.649> for

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
media PC or this would be great for

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.460 
media PC or this would be great for
almost<00:01:47.310> any<00:01:47.729> PC<00:01:48.360> because<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.840> reality<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
almost any PC because the reality of it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.399 
almost any PC because the reality of it
is<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:50.159> you're<00:01:50.430> running<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:51.060> single<00:01:51.810> graphics

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
is if you're running a single graphics

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.609 
is if you're running a single graphics
card<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.770> single<00:01:53.340> PCI<00:01:53.729> b6<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.659> or<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.200> pin

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.590 
the power supply out of the satiny
sleeve<00:03:53.830> that<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.190> comes<00:03:54.400> packed<00:03:54.700> in<00:03:54.910> we<00:03:55.360> see<00:03:55.570> a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
sleeve that it comes packed in we see a

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.420 
sleeve that it comes packed in we see a
sticker<00:03:55.900> on<00:03:55.989> top<00:03:56.140> with<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:56.830> says<00:03:57.040> install

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
sticker on top with that says install

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.420 
sticker on top with that says install
with<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.330> ventilation<00:03:58.780> top<00:03:59.110> cover<00:03:59.410> facing<00:04:00.250> up

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
with the ventilation top cover facing up

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.060 
with the ventilation top cover facing up
and<00:04:00.610> please<00:04:01.030> remove<00:04:01.300> this<00:04:01.540> label<00:04:01.900> before<00:04:02.410> use

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
and please remove this label before use

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.310 
and please remove this label before use
so<00:04:03.850> let's<00:04:04.120> go<00:04:04.269> around<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.570> the<00:04:04.690> side<00:04:04.720> where<00:04:05.230> we

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
so let's go around to the side where we

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.890 
so let's go around to the side where we
also<00:04:05.470> have<00:04:05.769> some<00:04:06.010> more<00:04:06.190> ventilation<00:04:06.820> here<00:04:07.720> at

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
also have some more ventilation here at

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.479 
also have some more ventilation here at
the<00:04:08.019> front<00:04:08.260> we<00:04:08.410> have<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.560> modular<00:04:09.040> interface

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
the front we have the modular interface

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.860 
the front we have the modular interface
we're<00:04:09.670> gonna<00:04:09.760> go<00:04:10.000> ahead<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.480> remove<00:04:10.840> that

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
we're gonna go ahead and remove that

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.080 
we're gonna go ahead and remove that
label<00:04:11.410> on<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:12.070> other<00:04:12.190> side<00:04:12.459> we<00:04:12.730> have<00:04:12.850> some

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
label on the other side we have some

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.479 
label on the other side we have some
more<00:04:13.269> ventilation<00:04:13.630> holes<00:04:14.140> so<00:04:14.830> I<00:04:15.190> guess

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
more ventilation holes so I guess

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.240 
more ventilation holes so I guess
presumably<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.450> way<00:04:16.570> this<00:04:16.750> works<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:17.290> simply

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
presumably the way this works is simply

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.029 
presumably the way this works is simply
by<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.430> convection<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.720> as<00:04:20.020> components<00:04:20.739> in<00:04:21.010> here

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
by a convection so as components in here

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.140 
by a convection so as components in here
heat<00:04:21.400> up<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:22.240> heat<00:04:22.450> gets

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
heat up the heat gets

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.210 
heat up the heat gets
exhausted<00:04:24.020> out<00:04:24.110> here<00:04:24.350> just<00:04:24.560> because<00:04:24.860> of<00:04:25.070> the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
exhausted out here just because of the

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.520 
exhausted out here just because of the
simple<00:04:25.550> fact<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.880> he<00:04:26.000> does<00:04:26.419> rise<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.080> then

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
simple fact that he does rise and then

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.400 
simple fact that he does rise and then
see<00:04:27.770> sonic<00:04:28.040> has<00:04:28.479> strategically<00:04:29.479> placed<00:04:29.930> the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
see sonic has strategically placed the

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.340 
see sonic has strategically placed the
intake<00:04:31.070> holes<00:04:31.340> which<00:04:32.060> are<00:04:32.270> presumably<00:04:33.050> at<00:04:33.229> the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
intake holes which are presumably at the

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.700 
intake holes which are presumably at the
back<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:33.940> here<00:04:34.940> along<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.210> sides<00:04:35.840> so<00:04:36.680> that

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
back and here along the sides so that

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.620 
back and here along the sides so that
and<00:04:36.949> the<00:04:37.130> front<00:04:37.430> so<00:04:37.699> that<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.940> air<00:04:38.060> comes<00:04:38.360> in

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
and the front so that the air comes in

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.930 
and the front so that the air comes in
cools<00:04:39.289> the<00:04:39.530> most<00:04:39.710> critical<00:04:40.190> components<00:04:40.220> first

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
cools the most critical components first

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.659 
cools the most critical components first
and<00:04:41.300> then<00:04:41.990> once<00:04:42.320> it's<00:04:42.530> heated<00:04:42.740> Rises<00:04:43.430> at<00:04:43.550> the

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
and then once it's heated Rises at the

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.580 
and then once it's heated Rises at the
top<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.030> power<00:04:44.210> supply<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:45.229> it's<00:04:45.410> very

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
top of the power supply so it's very

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.290 
top of the power supply so it's very
cool<00:04:45.830> looking<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.190> know<00:04:46.250> it's<00:04:46.430> not<00:04:46.580> nearly<00:04:47.030> as

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
cool looking you know it's not nearly as

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.870 
cool looking you know it's not nearly as
heavy<00:04:47.539> as<00:04:47.870> as<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.039> other<00:04:49.190> fanless<00:04:49.610> power

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
heavy as as the other fanless power

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.610 
heavy as as the other fanless power
supply<00:04:50.210> that<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.449> had<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.660> look<00:04:50.870> at<00:04:51.080> which<00:04:51.590> is

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
supply that I had a look at which is

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.950 
supply that I had a look at which is
kind<00:04:52.130> of<00:04:52.250> kind<00:04:52.820> of<00:04:52.880> refreshing<00:04:53.449> in<00:04:53.570> some<00:04:53.780> ways

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
kind of kind of refreshing in some ways

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.600 
kind of kind of refreshing in some ways
because<00:04:54.199> it<00:04:54.410> means<00:04:54.530> that<00:04:54.650> your<00:04:55.250> system

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
because it means that your system

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.390 
because it means that your system
doesn't<00:04:55.789> already<00:04:56.060> weigh<00:04:56.510> as<00:04:56.810> much<00:04:57.350> as<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.770> like

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
doesn't already weigh as much as a like

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.340 
doesn't already weigh as much as a like
wheelbarrow<00:04:58.940> full<00:04:59.330> of<00:04:59.389> bricks<00:04:59.780> before<00:05:00.289> you

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
wheelbarrow full of bricks before you

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.779 
wheelbarrow full of bricks before you
even<00:05:00.530> start<00:05:00.830> putting<00:05:01.070> other<00:05:01.190> components<00:05:01.699> in

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
even start putting other components in

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.400 
even start putting other components in
it<00:05:01.910> so<00:05:02.330> there's<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.660> full<00:05:02.840> specs<00:05:03.139> there<00:05:03.380> I

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
it so there's the full specs there I

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.870 
it so there's the full specs there I
think<00:05:03.650> we<00:05:03.830> already<00:05:03.949> showed<00:05:04.220> this<00:05:04.370> on<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.639> side

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
think we already showed this on the side

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.060 
think we already showed this on the side
and<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:06.020> can<00:05:06.169> see<00:05:06.199> even<00:05:06.500> at<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.710> bottom<00:05:06.830> of

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
and you can see even at the bottom of

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.529 
and you can see even at the bottom of
the<00:05:07.160> unit<00:05:07.310> there<00:05:07.580> are<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.729> few<00:05:07.970> ventilation

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
the unit there are a few ventilation

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.360 
the unit there are a few ventilation
holes<00:05:08.780> so<00:05:08.960> these<00:05:09.110> are<00:05:09.350> likely<00:05:09.530> strategically

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
holes so these are likely strategically

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.460 
holes so these are likely strategically
placed<00:05:10.940> so<00:05:11.210> they<00:05:11.660> can<00:05:11.840> get<00:05:11.930> a<00:05:11.990> little<00:05:12.169> bit<00:05:12.380> of

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
placed so they can get a little bit of

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.500 
placed so they can get a little bit of
airflow<00:05:12.740> to<00:05:12.949> some<00:05:13.130> critical<00:05:13.550> component<00:05:14.120> that

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
airflow to some critical component that

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.839 
airflow to some critical component that
needs<00:05:14.720> to<00:05:14.900> get<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.229> little<00:05:15.680> bit<00:05:15.979> of<00:05:16.160> cooling

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
needs to get a little bit of cooling

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.850 
needs to get a little bit of cooling
done<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:17.750> let's<00:05:17.990> have<00:05:18.080> a<00:05:18.169> look<00:05:18.260> at<00:05:18.410> the<00:05:18.500> modular

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
done so let's have a look at the modular

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.310 
done so let's have a look at the modular
cables<00:05:19.220> that<00:05:19.340> are<00:05:19.370> included<00:05:19.729> the<00:05:22.030> 400<00:05:23.030> watt

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
cables that are included the 400 watt

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:40.270 
cables that are included the 400 watt
supply<00:05:37.300> all<00:05:38.300> right<00:05:38.510> so<00:05:39.050> inside<00:05:39.620> here<00:05:39.650> we<00:05:40.099> will

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
supply all right so inside here we will

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.360 
supply all right so inside here we will
find<00:05:42.340> one<00:05:43.340> modular<00:05:43.880> 2<00:05:44.180> 2<00:05:44.510> for<00:05:45.020> up<00:05:45.229> to<00:05:45.409> a<00:05:45.440> 4<00:05:45.830> +<00:05:46.070> 4

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
find one modular 2 2 for up to a 4 + 4

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.399 
find one modular 2 2 for up to a 4 + 4
pin<00:05:46.669> power<00:05:46.909> connector<00:05:47.060> so<00:05:47.599> that's<00:05:47.750> either<00:05:47.930> a<00:05:48.110> 4

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
pin power connector so that's either a 4

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.469 
pin power connector so that's either a 4
pin<00:05:48.590> or<00:05:49.039> an<00:05:49.220> 8<00:05:49.400> pin<00:05:49.610> depending<00:05:50.060> on<00:05:50.180> what<00:05:50.360> your

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
pin or an 8 pin depending on what your

Ceyda<00:06:15.349> and<00:06:15.649> molex<00:06:16.219> cables<00:06:16.669> okay<00:06:28.360> clearly<00:06:29.360> see

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
Ceyda and molex cables okay clearly see

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:35.529 
Ceyda and molex cables okay clearly see
what<00:06:29.809> I'm<00:06:29.899> doing<00:06:33.879> all<00:06:34.879> right<00:06:34.939> what<00:06:35.240> do<00:06:35.300> we<00:06:35.330> have

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
what I'm doing all right what do we have

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:40.419 
what I'm doing all right what do we have
so<00:06:36.169> this<00:06:36.319> one<00:06:36.559> has<00:06:36.830> to<00:06:37.309> set<00:06:37.550> up<00:06:38.889> this<00:06:39.889> one<00:06:40.159> has

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:40.429 
so this one has to set up this one has

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:43.749 
so this one has to set up this one has
this<00:06:40.909> is<00:06:41.059> a<00:06:41.089> molex<00:06:41.360> to<00:06:41.689> too<00:06:41.839> floppy<00:06:42.110> adapter<00:06:42.759> so

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 
this is a molex to too floppy adapter so

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.129 
this is a molex to too floppy adapter so
you<00:06:43.789> can<00:06:43.909> use<00:06:44.059> that<00:06:44.300> if<00:06:44.449> you<00:06:44.569> still<00:06:44.869> require

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
you can use that if you still require

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:46.929 
you can use that if you still require
one<00:06:45.349> of<00:06:45.379> those<00:06:45.529> connectors<00:06:45.919> we<00:06:46.069> have<00:06:46.189> a<00:06:46.219> triple

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:46.939 
one of those connectors we have a triple

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:50.739 
one of those connectors we have a triple
theta<00:06:47.409> connector<00:06:48.409> and<00:06:48.619> then<00:06:49.399> we<00:06:49.639> have<00:06:49.879> three

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:50.749 
theta connector and then we have three

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:53.439 
theta connector and then we have three
molex<00:06:51.199> and<00:06:51.499> a<00:06:51.979> to<00:06:52.490> molex<00:06:52.879> so<00:06:53.029> that's<00:06:53.209> all<00:06:53.360> the

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
molex and a to molex so that's all the

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.480 
molex and a to molex so that's all the
modular<00:06:53.839> cables<00:06:54.229> now<00:06:54.409> I'm<00:06:54.860> just<00:06:55.129> gonna<00:06:55.219> check

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
modular cables now I'm just gonna check

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.010 
modular cables now I'm just gonna check
really<00:06:55.729> quickly<00:06:56.119> if<00:06:56.209> you<00:06:56.300> can<00:06:56.449> actually<00:06:56.599> plug

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
really quickly if you can actually plug

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.709 
really quickly if you can actually plug
in<00:06:57.259> all<00:06:57.830> modular<00:06:58.580> cables<00:06:59.029> at<00:06:59.149> the<00:06:59.240> same<00:06:59.449> time

00:06:59.709 --> 00:06:59.719 
in all modular cables at the same time

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:01.959 
in all modular cables at the same time
and<00:07:00.020> it<00:07:00.499> looks<00:07:00.680> like<00:07:00.800> you<00:07:01.069> cannot<00:07:01.490> so<00:07:01.819> you're

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:01.969 
and it looks like you cannot so you're

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:06.040 
and it looks like you cannot so you're
gonna<00:07:02.059> have<00:07:02.300> to<00:07:02.330> decide<00:07:03.789> which<00:07:04.789> which<00:07:05.539> three

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
gonna have to decide which which three

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.040 
gonna have to decide which which three
of<00:07:06.319> these<00:07:06.919> four<00:07:07.430> connectors<00:07:07.999> you<00:07:08.539> are<00:07:08.779> going

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.389 
of these four connectors you are going
to<00:07:09.199> want<00:07:09.349> to<00:07:09.469> plug<00:07:09.709> in<00:07:09.860> so<00:07:10.039> you<00:07:10.129> can<00:07:10.279> either
