00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
you know to be honest it's not really

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.479 
you know to be honest it's not really
significant<00:03:10.680> because<00:03:10.769> there<00:03:11.099> are<00:03:11.190> never<00:03:11.370> any

brucellosis dies when it's exposed to

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.010 
brucellosis dies when it's exposed to
sunlight<00:03:18.350> so<00:03:19.190> even<00:03:20.090> if<00:03:20.180> there<00:03:20.330> was<00:03:20.480> any<00:03:20.720> bruce

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
sunlight so even if there was any bruce

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.100 
sunlight so even if there was any bruce
priscilla<00:03:21.800> bacteria<00:03:22.430> here<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:23.000> would<00:03:23.150> he'll

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
priscilla bacteria here it would he'll

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.640 
priscilla bacteria here it would he'll
be<00:03:24.200> dead<00:03:24.440> very<00:03:24.730> fast<00:03:27.250> but<00:03:28.250> yeah<00:03:28.670> you<00:03:29.300> know<00:03:29.330> a

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
be dead very fast but yeah you know a

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.140 
be dead very fast but yeah you know a
lot<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.680> mammals<00:03:31.160> will<00:03:31.400> clean<00:03:31.640> up<00:03:31.820> their<00:03:32.120> own

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
lot of mammals will clean up their own

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.290 
lot of mammals will clean up their own
placenta<00:03:32.600> afterwards<00:03:33.500> because<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.670> reduces

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
placenta afterwards because it reduces

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.530 
placenta afterwards because it reduces
predation<00:03:35.930> if<00:03:36.200> wolves<00:03:36.620> are<00:03:36.740> coming<00:03:36.920> around

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
predation if wolves are coming around

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.820 
predation if wolves are coming around
they<00:03:38.540> would<00:03:38.660> be<00:03:38.750> attracted<00:03:38.990> to<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:39.500> kind<00:03:39.560> of

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
they would be attracted to that kind of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.640 
they would be attracted to that kind of
material<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.610> so<00:03:41.270> they<00:03:41.420> you<00:03:42.410> know<00:03:42.530> they

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
material and so they you know they

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.330 
material and so they you know they
really<00:03:42.860> clean<00:03:43.220> up<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:47.020> was<00:03:48.020> so<00:03:48.290> excited<00:03:48.860> to<00:03:49.070> see

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
really clean up I was so excited to see

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.610 
really clean up I was so excited to see
this<00:03:49.550> new<00:03:49.820> life<00:03:50.090> but<00:03:50.450> yet<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.690> knew<00:03:51.050> that<00:03:51.290> it<00:03:51.410> had

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
this new life but yet I knew that it had

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.740 
this new life but yet I knew that it had
a<00:03:51.650> really<00:03:51.950> difficult<00:03:52.400> journey<00:03:52.940> ahead<00:03:53.390> for<00:03:53.720> it

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
a really difficult journey ahead for it

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.460 
a really difficult journey ahead for it
and<00:03:54.020> so<00:03:54.880> it<00:03:55.880> just<00:03:56.120> really<00:03:56.390> made<00:03:56.690> me<00:03:56.870> have<00:03:57.140> such
