00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
hit or miss in a few areas but for the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.229 
hit or miss in a few areas but for the
most<00:03:25.370> part<00:03:25.489> it<00:03:25.700> was<00:03:25.790> good

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
most part it was good

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.449

the<00:03:26.600> dashboard<00:03:27.080> is<00:03:27.140> like<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.350> hard<00:03:27.650> vinyl<00:03:28.250> but

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
the dashboard is like a hard vinyl but

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.650 
the dashboard is like a hard vinyl but
again<00:03:28.700> it's<00:03:28.820> cushiony<00:03:29.239> soft<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.570> touch

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
the air back there's no glovebox there I

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.240 
the air back there's no glovebox there I
think<00:03:32.900> in<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.230> earlier<00:03:33.590> years<00:03:33.650> this<00:03:33.980> was<00:03:34.220> a

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
think in the earlier years this was a

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.090 
think in the earlier years this was a
glovebox<00:03:34.790> at<00:03:35.000> one<00:03:35.150> point<00:03:35.390> until<00:03:35.950> Mercedes<00:03:36.950> had

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
glovebox at one point until Mercedes had

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.699 
glovebox at one point until Mercedes had
to<00:03:37.310> add<00:03:37.760> an<00:03:37.910> airbag<00:03:38.209> in<00:03:38.269> there<00:03:38.510> instead<00:03:38.840> the

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
to add an airbag in there instead the

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.430 
to add an airbag in there instead the
dome<00:03:40.160> light<00:03:40.190> for<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.610> backseat<00:03:41.030> hazards<00:03:41.750> air

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440
