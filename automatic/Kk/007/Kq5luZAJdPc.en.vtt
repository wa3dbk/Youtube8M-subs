 how is this exercise done 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.610
 lifting correctly you have to lift a little 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.310
 above horizontal 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.990
 hold a moment to let it go 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.340
 releasing as not relaxing hands should 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.490
 lower slightly touch you need either 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.370

 touched also slowly without 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.670
 giving a raise up touched on 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.090
 touched raise no need to relax 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.970
 that hung hair as needed 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.620
 intertwine brush look right 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.960
 brush should be diagonally 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.260
 to logical satan content here 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.860
 such why because if you will 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.870
 do so will you take away the middle 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.600
 a bunch of hay mate mask not everything 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.990
 take part if to do so here at 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.040
 biceps will help you here and 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.540
 front upper compartment people 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.230
 the outer surface of the chest would take away 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.300
 if you need to make the diagonal 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.900
 here the load is distributed more 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.170
 power will be the front beam 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.660
 the average budget is less take the load 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.360
 farther like 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.960
 what are the biggest mistakes mistakes 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.900
 mostly so many guys 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.410
 reduce it so that sitting on to a quarrel and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.470
 raise fill and understand bastards 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.150
 it is wrong so basically here 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.270
 take the load of polite pectoral muscles 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.560

 a3 have your chest been stretched and how 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.650
 maybe less but she is tense if you 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.860
 keep you closer to like 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.380
 you will be the entire load go chest and 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.890
 whole half exactly if you took away 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.680
 backwards 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.040
 because the dishes are relaxed you raise already 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.940
