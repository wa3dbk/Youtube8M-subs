00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
think it is very essential on started by

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.410 
think it is very essential on started by
because<00:00:34.860> there<00:00:35.219> are<00:00:35.399> snipers<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:36.000> there<00:00:36.239> who

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
because there are snipers out there who

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.630 
because there are snipers out there who
were<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.110> which<00:00:37.260> i've<00:00:37.380> been<00:00:37.590> sniping<00:00:37.860> who

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
were you in which i've been sniping who

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880

just<00:00:38.879> wanted<00:00:39.149> place<00:00:39.450> kill<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.559> think

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
just wanted place kill you so I do think

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.779 
just wanted place kill you so I do think
it's<00:00:41.160> easier<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.000> use<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.450> console<00:00:42.960> prejudices

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789
