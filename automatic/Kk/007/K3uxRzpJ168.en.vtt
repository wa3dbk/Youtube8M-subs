00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
the install it took like a few minutes

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.469 
the install it took like a few minutes
um<00:04:57.930> as<00:04:58.930> far<00:04:59.229> as<00:04:59.350> this<00:04:59.470> hair<00:04:59.710> goes<00:04:59.979> if<00:05:00.400> I<00:05:01.180> was
