00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
section of the course and I made about

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.940 
section of the course and I made about
seven<00:01:09.630> turns<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.229> little<00:01:10.590> bit<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> my

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
seven turns a little bit out of my

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.370 
seven turns a little bit out of my
comfort<00:01:11.189> zone<00:01:11.340> skiing<00:01:11.760> very<00:01:11.970> fast<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
comfort zone skiing very fast and I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.370 
comfort zone skiing very fast and I

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
guess I pushed my feet to a mogul and it

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.679 
guess I pushed my feet to a mogul and it
felt<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.860> had<00:01:16.890> my<00:01:17.700> knee<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
felt like I had my knee like the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.940 
felt like I had my knee like the
equivalent<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.170> jamming<00:01:19.590> your<00:01:19.710> finger

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
equivalent of jamming your finger

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.440

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
start bending it and that's a step in

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.310 
start bending it and that's a step in
the<00:04:12.510> right<00:04:12.690> direction

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
the right direction

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.720 
the right direction
it's<00:04:13.650> tough<00:04:13.860> walking<00:04:14.100> into<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.340> store<00:04:14.400> I

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
it's tough walking into a store I

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.759 
it's tough walking into a store I
actually<00:04:15.150> walked<00:04:15.780> into<00:04:16.169> my<00:04:16.260> surgery<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.680> was

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
actually walked into my surgery I was

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.039 
actually walked into my surgery I was
perfectly<00:04:17.340> fine<00:04:17.940> for<00:04:18.000> activities<00:04:18.870> such<00:04:18.900> as

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
perfectly fine for activities such as

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.080 
perfectly fine for activities such as
walking<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.739> then<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.459> wake<00:04:20.609> up<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:20.910> have<00:04:20.970> to

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
walking and then to wake up and have to

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.850 
walking and then to wake up and have to
be<00:04:21.150> on<00:04:21.239> crutches<00:04:21.450> seems<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.500> step<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:22.740> the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
be on crutches seems like a step in the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.400 
be on crutches seems like a step in the
wrong<00:04:22.979> direction<00:04:23.190> but<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.539> now<00:04:24.780> have<00:04:24.810> an<00:04:25.140> ACL

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
wrong direction but you now have an ACL

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.670 
wrong direction but you now have an ACL
so<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:25.710> will<00:04:26.390> eventually

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.230 
the surgery and from the recovery
process<00:05:54.139> before<00:05:54.770> that<00:05:55.010> I<00:05:55.280> had<00:05:55.699> taken<00:05:55.970> for

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
granted that I could just ski and I

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.219 
granted that I could just ski and I
didn't<00:05:58.639> really<00:05:58.789> know<00:05:58.880> how<00:05:59.030> my<00:05:59.210> body<00:05:59.330> worked<00:05:59.750> or

didn't really know how my body worked or
how<00:06:00.470> to<00:06:00.530> train<00:06:00.979> it<00:06:01.190> to<00:06:02.169> be<00:06:03.169> the<00:06:03.260> best<00:06:03.409> tool<00:06:03.710> it

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
how to train it to be the best tool it

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.219 
how to train it to be the best tool it
could<00:06:04.520> be<00:06:04.639> for<00:06:05.090> my<00:06:05.270> sport<00:06:05.599> and<00:06:05.870> through<00:06:06.139> the

could be for my sport and through the

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.600 
could be for my sport and through the
end<00:06:06.349> rate<00:06:06.500> I<00:06:06.620> learned<00:06:06.860> all<00:06:07.010> about<00:06:07.039> that<00:06:07.430> all

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
end rate I learned all about that all

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.370 
end rate I learned all about that all
about<00:06:07.849> the<00:06:08.000> joints<00:06:08.300> and<00:06:08.389> the<00:06:08.449> muscles<00:06:08.599> and<00:06:09.020> how

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
about the joints and the muscles and how

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.960 
about the joints and the muscles and how
everything<00:06:09.620> is<00:06:09.800> connected<00:06:09.949> and<00:06:10.430> what<00:06:10.880> you

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
everything is connected and what you

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.100 
everything is connected and what you
need<00:06:11.120> to<00:06:11.240> build<00:06:11.539> to<00:06:12.199> improve<00:06:13.180> your<00:06:14.180> squats<00:06:14.840> or

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
need to build to improve your squats or

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.680 
need to build to improve your squats or
your<00:06:15.260> speed<00:06:15.740> and<00:06:15.979> so<00:06:16.400> through<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.180> injury<00:06:17.479> I

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
your speed and so through the injury I

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.040 
your speed and so through the injury I
became<00:06:18.110> a<00:06:18.169> better<00:06:18.470> mobile<00:06:18.830> skier<00:06:19.130> actually<00:06:19.639> I

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
became a better mobile skier actually I

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.330 
became a better mobile skier actually I
think<00:06:21.050> it<00:06:21.289> took<00:06:21.380> more<00:06:21.620> than<00:06:21.650> a<00:06:21.800> year<00:06:21.830> for<00:06:22.190> me<00:06:22.310> to

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
think it took more than a year for me to

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.120 
think it took more than a year for me to
be<00:06:23.180> fully<00:06:23.479> convinced<00:06:24.050> that<00:06:24.110> I<00:06:24.229> was<00:06:24.680> healed

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
be fully convinced that I was healed

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.159 
be fully convinced that I was healed
because<00:06:25.400> it's<00:06:25.940> one<00:06:26.120> thing<00:06:26.300> to<00:06:26.479> run<00:06:26.599> sprints

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
because it's one thing to run sprints

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:28.779 
because it's one thing to run sprints
after<00:06:27.409> surgery<00:06:27.919> it's<00:06:28.280> another<00:06:28.490> thing<00:06:28.729> to

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
after surgery it's another thing to

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.580 
after surgery it's another thing to
actually<00:06:29.030> ski<00:06:29.539> moguls<00:06:29.720> and<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.199> first<00:06:30.380> time<00:06:30.530> I

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
after my surgery so I knew everything

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.670 
after my surgery so I knew everything
was<00:06:47.300> still<00:06:47.479> stable<00:06:47.930> and<00:06:48.020> I<00:06:48.050> had<00:06:48.169> an<00:06:48.259> ACL<00:06:48.410> and

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
was still stable and I had an ACL and

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.390 
was still stable and I had an ACL and
the<00:06:48.979> graph<00:06:49.340> had<00:06:49.520> taken<00:06:49.910> but<00:06:50.680> pain<00:06:51.680> is<00:06:51.979> your

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
the graph had taken but pain is your

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.890 
the graph had taken but pain is your
brains<00:06:52.639> way<00:06:52.789> of<00:06:52.819> telling<00:06:53.120> you<00:06:53.180> the<00:06:53.330> slowdown

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
brains way of telling you the slowdown

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.270 
brains way of telling you the slowdown
maybe<00:06:54.259> something's<00:06:54.590> wrong<00:06:54.740> so<00:06:54.919> I<00:06:54.979> was<00:06:55.130> a<00:06:55.160> bit

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
maybe something's wrong so I was a bit

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.120 
maybe something's wrong so I was a bit
nervous<00:06:55.460> then<00:06:55.819> the<00:06:56.599> following<00:06:57.080> season<00:06:57.500> I<00:06:57.710> had

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
nervous then the following season I had

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.430 
nervous then the following season I had
a<00:06:58.160> pain-free<00:06:58.490> season<00:06:59.479> of<00:06:59.720> skiing<00:07:00.110> and<00:07:00.319> the

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
a pain-free season of skiing and the

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.499 
a pain-free season of skiing and the
best<00:07:00.770> season<00:07:01.130> in<00:07:01.190> my<00:07:01.310> career<00:07:01.669> and<00:07:01.910> so<00:07:02.240> at<00:07:02.479> that

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:02.509 
best season in my career and so at that

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:04.420 
best season in my career and so at that
point<00:07:02.870> I<00:07:02.990> think<00:07:03.110> I<00:07:03.289> was<00:07:03.500> fully<00:07:03.889> aware<00:07:04.370> that

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
point I think I was fully aware that

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.300 
point I think I was fully aware that
this<00:07:05.210> knee<00:07:05.479> was<00:07:05.810> not<00:07:06.349> only<00:07:06.650> as<00:07:06.889> good<00:07:07.039> as<00:07:07.099> it<00:07:07.220> was

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
this knee was not only as good as it was

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.330 
this knee was not only as good as it was
before<00:07:07.460> it<00:07:07.729> was<00:07:07.759> probably<00:07:08.090> better
