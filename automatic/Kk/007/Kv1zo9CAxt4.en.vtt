00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
that chris is going to tune up is

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.099 
that chris is going to tune up is
probably<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.240> one<00:00:21.420> you'll<00:00:21.689> ever<00:00:21.840> pick

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
probably the first one you'll ever pick

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.870 
probably the first one you'll ever pick
up<00:00:22.140> it's<00:00:22.470> called<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.769> block<00:00:23.010> plane<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.550> it's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
up it's called a block plane and it's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.230 
up it's called a block plane and it's
inexpensive<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.689> one's<00:00:24.900> only<00:00:25.080> $45<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:27.000> is

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
inexpensive this one's only $45 this is

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.910 
inexpensive this one's only $45 this is
great<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.810> smoothing<00:00:28.410> edges<00:00:29.449> like<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.480> one

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
great for smoothing edges like this one

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.500 
great for smoothing edges like this one
this<00:00:31.920> surface<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.550> already<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.180> finishing

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
this surface is already for finishing

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.690 
this surface is already for finishing
perfect<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.739> also<00:00:34.920> good<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.190> breaking

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
perfect and it's also good for breaking

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.069 
perfect and it's also good for breaking
edges<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.090> putting<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.390> little<00:00:36.600> bevel<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
edges and putting a little bevel or a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.869 
edges and putting a little bevel or a
chamfer<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.620> them<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.489> work<00:00:38.640> by

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
chamfer on them and you can just work by

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:39.310 
chamfer on them and you can just work by
eye

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320

bringing<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.430> surface<00:00:44.700> level<00:00:45.180> down<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
bringing one surface level down to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.240 
bringing one surface level down to
another<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.500> wood<00:00:46.770> plug<00:00:47.010> that's

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
another like this wood plug that's

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
another like this wood plug that's
covering<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> screw<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.420> couple<00:00:48.870> strokes<00:00:49.110> with

covering a screw a couple strokes with
the<00:00:49.379> block<00:00:49.649> plane<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.550> flush<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the block plane and it's flush with the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.939 
the block plane and it's flush with the
surface<00:00:51.719> all<00:00:52.079> around<00:00:52.379> much<00:00:52.559> better<00:00:52.800> than

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
surface all around much better than

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.130 
surface all around much better than
sandpaper<00:00:53.399> could<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.789> planes<00:00:54.570> come<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:54.989> all

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
sandpaper could do planes come in all

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
sandpaper could do planes come in all
shapes<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> sizes<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> steps<00:00:56.670> here

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
shapes and sizes but the steps here

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.010 
shapes and sizes but the steps here
we're<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> show<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.600> how<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.750> tune

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
we're going to show you is how to tune

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
we're going to show you is how to tune
up<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.260> block<00:00:58.469> plane<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.160> let's<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.489> familiar

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
up a block plane so let's get familiar

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.869 
up a block plane so let's get familiar
with<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> parts<00:01:00.920> first<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> plane

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
with the parts first you have the plane

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.670 
with the parts first you have the plane
iron<00:01:03.120> which<00:01:03.420> does<00:01:03.660> all<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.840> cutting<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.530> want

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
iron which does all the cutting you want

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.560 
iron which does all the cutting you want
to<00:01:04.739> make<00:01:04.860> sure<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.250> sharp<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> cap

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
to make sure that's sharp you have a cap

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
to make sure that's sharp you have a cap
that<00:01:06.810> holds<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.229> down<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> underside

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
that holds it down and on the underside

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.969 
that holds it down and on the underside
is<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> sole<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.780> plane<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.350> rides

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
is the sole of the plane and that rides

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.399 
is the sole of the plane and that rides
flush<00:01:11.340> against<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> surface<00:01:12.210> you're<00:01:12.330> working

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
flush against the surface you're working

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.840 
flush against the surface you're working
then<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.590> block<00:01:13.830> planes<00:01:14.189> which<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:14.760> we're

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
then on block planes which is what we're

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.100 
then on block planes which is what we're
going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.030> show<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
going to show you here you have the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.499 
going to show you here you have the
