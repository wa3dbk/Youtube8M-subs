ranch you have to make deal with what
you<00:00:14.460> have<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.240> as<00:00:16.109> kids<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:17.029> invented

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
you have and so as kids we invented

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.000 
you have and so as kids we invented
things<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.510> was<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:18.810> part<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.560> did

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
things that was just part of what we did

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.390 
things that was just part of what we did
I<00:00:20.510> enjoyed<00:00:21.510> engineering<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.830> pursued

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
I enjoyed engineering and so I pursued

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400 
I enjoyed engineering and so I pursued
that<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.699> college<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.210> graduate<00:00:24.600> school<00:00:24.630> but

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
that in college and graduate school but

Jarrell is looking for new ideas right
you're<00:00:27.119> always<00:00:27.240> trying<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.689> figure<00:00:28.470> out

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
you're always trying to figure out

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.999 
you're always trying to figure out
problems<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.730> solve<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:31.140> me<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
problems to solve and for me the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.590 
problems to solve and for me the
creative<00:00:32.460> process<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> design<00:00:33.329> process

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
creative process the design process

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.790 
creative process the design process
itself<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.320> something<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.160> enjoy<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.800> so

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
itself is something that I enjoy and so

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.580 
itself is something that I enjoy and so
way<00:00:38.579> back<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.030> early<00:00:39.239> 2000<00:00:39.840> 2003<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.469> so

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
way back in the early 2000 2003 and so

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.700 
way back in the early 2000 2003 and so
forth<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.160> picked<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.149> piece<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.480> rubber<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
forth I picked up a piece of rubber and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.639 
forth I picked up a piece of rubber and
I<00:00:43.890> held<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.460> realized<00:00:44.879> aha

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
I held it up and I realized aha

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.430 
I held it up and I realized aha
I<00:00:46.680> wonder<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.660> took<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.260> piece<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
I wonder if and so I I took the piece of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.189 
I wonder if and so I I took the piece of
rubber<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.489> took<00:00:50.730> two<00:00:50.879> guitar<00:00:51.180> picks<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.660> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
rubber and I took two guitar picks and I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.979 
rubber and I took two guitar picks and I
strum<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.160> guitar<00:00:53.190> thinking<00:00:54.030> gosh<00:00:54.270> if<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
strum the guitar thinking gosh if you

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
strum the guitar thinking gosh if you
were<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.230> switch<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> functionality<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.399> one

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
were to switch the functionality of one

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.639 
were to switch the functionality of one
pick<00:00:57.329> striking<00:00:57.750> two<00:00:57.899> strings<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> full

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
pick striking two strings on a full

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.979 
pick striking two strings on a full
string<00:00:58.890> guitar<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.430> making<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.270> pick

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
string guitar and making it to pick

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.750 
string guitar and making it to pick
heads<00:01:01.199> striking<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:02.100> string<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.640> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
heads striking one string on a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.579 
heads striking one string on a
six-string<00:01:03.149> guitar<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:04.110> might<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.500> an

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
six-string guitar it might be an

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.590 
six-string guitar it might be an
interesting<00:01:04.710> sound<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.460> Oh<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.970> lot<00:01:06.210> actually

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
interesting sound and Oh a lot actually

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.780 
interesting sound and Oh a lot actually
worked<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> beginning<00:01:08.400> of

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
worked and so that was the beginning of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.940 
worked and so that was the beginning of
the<00:01:08.909> process<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.770> developing<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.400> plutonium

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
the process of developing the plutonium

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.219 
the process of developing the plutonium
I've<00:01:13.950> had<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> opportunity<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:15.780> work<00:01:15.960> with

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
I've had the opportunity to work with

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.630 
I've had the opportunity to work with
some<00:01:16.500> national<00:01:17.040> labs<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.520> New<00:01:17.610> Mexico

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
some national labs here in New Mexico

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.179 
some national labs here in New Mexico
and<00:01:18.299> what<00:01:18.900> I've<00:01:19.020> been<00:01:19.170> looking<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
and what I've been looking for is the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.190 
and what I've been looking for is the
ability<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.610> understand<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> dynamics<00:01:22.110> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
ability to understand the dynamics of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.679 
ability to understand the dynamics of
using<00:01:23.159> two<00:01:23.310> picks<00:01:23.520> simultaneously<00:01:24.299> using<00:01:24.479> my

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
using two picks simultaneously using my

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.520 
using two picks simultaneously using my
product<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.890> idea<00:01:25.920> was<00:01:26.549> was<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.270> use

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
product the idea was was to use

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
product the idea was was to use
high-speed<00:01:28.530> digital<00:01:29.009> cameras<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.090> case

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
high-speed digital cameras in this case

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.840 
high-speed digital cameras in this case
phantom<00:01:30.780> cameras<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.590> capture<00:01:31.979> images<00:01:32.640> at

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
phantom cameras they capture images at

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.819 
phantom cameras they capture images at
5,000<00:01:33.600> frames<00:01:33.810> per<00:01:34.020> second<00:01:34.439> which<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.650> pretty

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
5,000 frames per second which is pretty

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.940 
5,000 frames per second which is pretty
amazing<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.270> literally<00:01:36.869> slows<00:01:37.380> time<00:01:37.710> down

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
amazing and it literally slows time down

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.190 
amazing and it literally slows time down
so<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.430> begin<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:39.060> how<00:01:39.689> each<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so you can begin to see how each of the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.249 
so you can begin to see how each of the
pics<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.590> moving<00:01:41.420> individually<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.600> also<00:01:42.659> how

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
pics is moving individually but also how

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.289 
pics is moving individually but also how
the<00:01:43.320> whole<00:01:43.560> system<00:01:43.590> works<00:01:44.159> together<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.970> it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the whole system works together as it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.660 
the whole system works together as it
strikes<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> guitar<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.380> wanted<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.340> propose

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
strikes the guitar I wanted to propose

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.429 
strikes the guitar I wanted to propose
that<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.299> could<00:01:48.750> use<00:01:48.930> two<00:01:49.170> pics

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that you could use two pics

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.109 
that you could use two pics
simultaneously<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.340> how<00:01:50.490> would<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:50.909> that

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
simultaneously and how would you do that

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.010 
simultaneously and how would you do that
you<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.380> by<00:01:52.740> creating<00:01:53.780> functioning<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
you do that by creating functioning the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.630 
you do that by creating functioning the
finger<00:01:55.409> essentially<00:01:55.920> between<00:01:56.100> these<00:01:56.460> two

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
finger essentially between these two

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.550 
finger essentially between these two
pics<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.060> when<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.299> hold<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.659> up<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
pics and when you hold it up the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.160 
pics and when you hold it up the
interesting<00:01:59.070> part<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> design<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.869> how

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.290 

concept<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.770> double<00:02:23.010> pick<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.370> fairly

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
concept of the double pick is fairly

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.990 
concept of the double pick is fairly
intuitive<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:26.550> first<00:02:26.790> string

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
intuitive in that the first string

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.360 
intuitive in that the first string
strikes<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.600> string<00:02:27.990> let's<00:02:28.709> do<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.130> this

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
strikes a string let's do it like this

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.660 
strikes a string let's do it like this
and<00:02:29.959> then<00:02:30.959> it's<00:02:31.110> followed<00:02:31.290> up<00:02:31.560> by<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:32.370> second

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
and then it's followed up by the second

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.120 
and then it's followed up by the second
pick<00:02:32.819> striking<00:02:33.350> okay<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.770> as<00:02:34.950> you're

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
pick striking okay and so as you're

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.040 
pick striking okay and so as you're
strumming

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.590 

you<00:02:38.620> can<00:02:38.770> hear<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.070> double<00:02:39.190> pulse<00:02:39.520> so<00:02:40.480> the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
you can hear the double pulse so the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.630 
you can hear the double pulse so the
trick<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.840> now<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.410> can<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.860> can<00:02:42.070> hear<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.490> double

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
trick is now I can I can hear the double

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.980 
trick is now I can I can hear the double
pulse<00:02:42.910> when<00:02:43.150> you're<00:02:43.270> when<00:02:43.540> you're<00:02:43.570> strumming

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
pulse when you're when you're strumming

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.270 
pulse when you're when you're strumming
slowly<00:02:44.410> at<00:02:44.590> slow<00:02:44.830> velocities<00:02:46.380> right<00:02:47.380> but<00:02:48.130> what

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
slowly at slow velocities right but what

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.050 
slowly at slow velocities right but what
happens<00:02:48.610> when<00:02:48.760> you're<00:02:48.880> doing<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.150> normal<00:02:49.270> strum

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
happens when you're doing a normal strum

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.199 
happens when you're doing a normal strum
what's<00:02:51.959> happening<00:02:52.500> at<00:02:52.740> those<00:02:52.980> rates

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.809 

alright<00:02:59.209> looks<00:02:59.390> like<00:02:59.480> we<00:02:59.599> got<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.700> one<00:03:01.700> of

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
alright looks like we got that one of

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.059 
alright looks like we got that one of
the<00:03:01.910> neat<00:03:02.060> things<00:03:02.300> about<00:03:02.420> using<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.769> know<00:03:03.890> the

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
the neat things about using you know the

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.979 
the neat things about using you know the
high<00:03:04.220> frame<00:03:04.519> rate<00:03:04.760> digital<00:03:05.090> cameras<00:03:05.510> it

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
high frame rate digital cameras it

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.720 
high frame rate digital cameras it
allows<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.590> see<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.160> dynamics<00:03:07.670> that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
allows you to see the dynamics that

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.460 
allows you to see the dynamics that
you've<00:03:07.940> been<00:03:08.090> imagining<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.780> whole<00:03:08.810> time<00:03:09.140> you

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
you've been imagining the whole time you

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.930 
you've been imagining the whole time you
can<00:03:09.500> talk<00:03:09.769> about<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:10.190> concept<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:10.640> can<00:03:10.790> talk

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
can talk about the concept you can talk

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.280 
can talk about the concept you can talk
about<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.330> double<00:03:11.569> pulse<00:03:11.750> and<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.019> can<00:03:12.170> even

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
about the double pulse and you can even

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.470 
about the double pulse and you can even
imagine<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.489> on<00:03:13.610> first<00:03:13.910> principle<00:03:14.330> you

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
imagine and and on first principle you

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.720 
imagine and and on first principle you
can<00:03:14.599> imagine<00:03:14.810> how<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:15.590> thing<00:03:15.769> behaves<00:03:15.890> but

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
can imagine how this thing behaves but

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.000 
can imagine how this thing behaves but
to<00:03:16.849> actually<00:03:17.209> watch<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.540> at<00:03:17.900> 5,000<00:03:18.620> frames<00:03:18.860> a

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
to actually watch it at 5,000 frames a

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.490 
to actually watch it at 5,000 frames a
second<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.519> pretty<00:03:19.819> astounding<00:03:20.299> not<00:03:21.080> least<00:03:21.290> of

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
second is pretty astounding not least of

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.199 
second is pretty astounding not least of
which<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:22.069> watch<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.280> strings<00:03:22.760> vibrate

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
which is to watch the strings vibrate

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.610 
which is to watch the strings vibrate
when<00:03:23.390> there's<00:03:23.599> the<00:03:23.780> one<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:23.989> pic<00:03:24.170> hits<00:03:24.379> and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
when there's the one the pic hits and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.920 
when there's the one the pic hits and
then<00:03:25.129> to<00:03:25.250> see<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.760> two<00:03:25.910> pics<00:03:26.150> bending<00:03:26.629> by

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
then to see that the two pics bending by

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.870 
then to see that the two pics bending by
themselves<00:03:27.440> independently<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.190> how<00:03:28.670> they

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
themselves independently and how they

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.210 
themselves independently and how they
react<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.660> how<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.840> timing<00:03:30.470> is<00:03:30.590> changed<00:03:31.040> when

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
react and how the timing is changed when

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.430 
react and how the timing is changed when
the<00:03:31.370> first<00:03:31.640> pic<00:03:32.269> is<00:03:32.450> moving<00:03:32.840> already<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.349> the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
the first pic is moving already to the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.050 
the first pic is moving already to the
second<00:03:33.829> string<00:03:34.040> when<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.430> second<00:03:34.760> pic<00:03:34.910> is

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
second string when the second pic is

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.360 
second string when the second pic is
just<00:03:35.269> encountering<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.620> first<00:03:36.860> one<00:03:36.980> and

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
just encountering the the first one and

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.690 
just encountering the the first one and
so<00:03:37.970> it's<00:03:38.269> that<00:03:38.480> idea<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.440> attaching<00:03:40.400> a

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
so it's that idea of of attaching a

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.400 
so it's that idea of of attaching a
visual<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.660> something<00:03:42.049> that<00:03:42.079> you've<00:03:42.379> been

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
visual to something that you've been

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.300 
visual to something that you've been
able<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.799> hear<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:44.480> sense<00:03:45.019> on<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.680> macro<00:03:46.099> and

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
able to hear and sense on the macro and

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.569 
able to hear and sense on the macro and
and<00:03:47.120> feel<00:03:47.450> by<00:03:47.989> using<00:03:48.319> the<00:03:48.769> visual<00:03:49.190> thing<00:03:49.400> is<00:03:49.549> a

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
and feel by using the visual thing is a

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.940 
and feel by using the visual thing is a
very<00:03:49.819> powerful<00:03:50.060> way<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.420> confirm<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.230> also

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
very powerful way to confirm and also

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.220 
very powerful way to confirm and also
communicate<00:03:52.849> the<00:03:53.030> idea<00:03:53.390> that<00:03:53.599> the<00:03:53.750> dynamics

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
communicate the idea that the dynamics

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.979 
communicate the idea that the dynamics
are<00:03:54.349> a<00:03:54.379> lot<00:03:54.620> more<00:03:55.180> more<00:03:56.180> interesting<00:03:56.840> than

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
are a lot more more interesting than

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.980 
are a lot more more interesting than
even<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.379> imagined
