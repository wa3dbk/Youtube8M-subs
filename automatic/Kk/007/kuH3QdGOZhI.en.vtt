00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.369
 hello people in this video I show 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.610
 you have the drunk trecker app here 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.220
 we already have the icon on the homescreen 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.270
 looks like we open the off and 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.349
 then we already have the interface 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.390
 is held relatively simple from the me 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.669
 first go to the settings then 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.440
 you see here what the app is all about 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:39.829
 can or where is for the app actually 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.270
 the app records your gps data and 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.949
 show you later on a map 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.629
 where he was everywhere 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.789
 the app is quite handy for you 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.260
 if she drinks more often and 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.769
 then do not know where you are 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.780
 waiting everywhere and what they've done 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.730
 because that makes it possible here now 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.879
 if i turn this switch on 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.980
 So he turns on then turns green 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.710
 draws the iphone video around her expensive 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.860
 gps data on there you switch the best 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.650
 before you drank something and you 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.540
 then you can also go out of the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.670
 gps data would still be recorded 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.710
 I think it's really great when you are 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.200
 goes back in, everything goes on and on 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.940
 You can then stop again 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.210
 Now let's turn it on 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.440
 go with a few buddies and drink something 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.440
 The next morning I have no idea 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.420
 more of what I did and where I am 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.280
 ever was I'll go turn on 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.920
 here and then go up here 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.330
 this entrance or inbox and then 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.430
 all my records are recorded here 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.860
 places are displayed when I am here now 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.690
 the fact that, for example then you see 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.690
 I was there and then I went around it 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:51.830
 went to the second because you can see now 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.630
 here only a small red dot 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.450
 because I did not move 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.870
 but I was just here on the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.730
 location 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.360
 but you see it when you move 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.100
 then this red dot will become that 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.550
 be emphasized what long gone 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.780
 and then you can do it the next day 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.480
 understand where you are going around 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.040
 I think that's super handy if you 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.930
 Also the drink goes and the problem 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.849
 You do not remember where he was 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.200
 what the app currently costs i can 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.280
 unfortunately not say because in the app store 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.560
 I will not see the price anymore 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.480
 but i have a link in the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.359
 description below probably buy the app 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.269
 can and then even for you 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.400
 I do not know if he can try it 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.000
 you see the app is unfortunately still 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.639
 not adapted to iphone 5 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.409
 an update will hardly think so 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:43.139
 very soon then it really is 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.389
 optimized and then she was totally great 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:48.900
 and I have to say it one 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.579
 practical and yes I do not know what 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.599
 he can do it wrong with such an app 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.250
 to have on iphone 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.709
 I can never say more about that now 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.739
 is a relatively simple app but does 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.780
 which is relatively cool and then I say 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.430
 something there with the video as I said a 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.310
 link is in the description probably the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.599
 can download app and then how 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.139
 I'm looking forward to a thumb 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.349
 up 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.219
 and if you subscribe that will make me happy 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.409
 Of course, also great 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.730
 then it was also me thank you for that 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.169
 watch and then we see the 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.169
 next video until then
