00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.820
 find today for a new 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.650
 video opening a single booster 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.689
 pokemon because yes indeed today that 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 is going to be a pretty special video she 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.040
 announce a new concept on my channel 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.540
 which is likely to bring renewal 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.189
 this video will be a little longer than 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.140
 others who will not follow what is going 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.599
 they need to explain the concept etc 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.130
 it's normal but I really want 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.020
 know in the comments if that you 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.579
 please and if it will work because it is 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.620
 could it not work at all? 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.600
 that you do not appreciate then indeed 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.960
 you must have noticed it is 7:30 of 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.309
 morning 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.380
 I do not know at what time 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.210
 I will put the videos here it will be 7 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.980
 hours or 8 o'clock but this new 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.500
 concept is meant to make you 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.490
 videos in the morning at breakfast because in 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.900
 effect me I remember that before 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.980
 to go to class I get up for my 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.120
 shower took my breakfast 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.220
 and during this little games watching 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.200
 a video on youtube at the time 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.940
 they were videos of darko fire 0.22 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.380
 besides I advise you if you 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.570
 do not know him but good in my opinion 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.040
 you know him and that's it 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.450
 why today from 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.869
 now it's every day that 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.850
 follow 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.920
 you will have a video every morning 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.950
 of a single booster so this will be a video 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.719
 very short obviously but that one 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.399
 could have pickaxe that could 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.200
 to be very interesting and I would like 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.179
 know a lot in the comments that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.409
 you are interested or not because I 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.850
 knew that at the time I would like 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.399
 see a video like this at 7 o'clock 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.319
 morning before leaving in class then 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.960
 today to do this I decided to 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:34.170
 take syria xy three furious points 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.189
 obviously with the booster megas 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.079
 carreno 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.409
 because it's a pokÃ©mon that's a lot to me 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.969
 hung in the series here rec 3 and he 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.469
 was always falling into 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.039
 all my videos and if he falls 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.619
 today 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.749
 it could be huge so here at 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.880
 early morning a video every morning 

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:52.560
 between 7:30 am and 8:00 am for early risers 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.959
 for those who take their child 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.219
 lunch I found it very original and 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.990
 it will allow you to have a video 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.549
 really everyday on the other hand 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.469
 watch out what kind of videos do not 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.119
 will not replace my other videos there 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.459
 will always be at the same pace a little 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.740
 irregular all the other videos but 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.479
 these will be every day between 7am 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.220
 and 8am gives obviously 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.630
 programmed because me and to moor 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.140
 the plans are there I'm trying to 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.120
 saw wood 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.520
 I do not do my video at 6 o'clock 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.800
 morning good month we're gone for 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.840
 the opening of this little booster I'm doing 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.180
 a little macro for those who would like 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.950
 say 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.349
 description because the video is going to be 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.900
 very short and here we are with 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.930
 Syria fixed with 30 curious points and 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.579
 the mega karine besides booster 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.319
 just opened up like paper mache 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.060
 if you want to see the bottom of the little ones 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.579
 lunches down it's done on purpose for the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.109
 wake up a year ago flex sleeping and the 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.930
 three little characters who want the 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.939
 wake up regis with or green with the bo 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.370
 with a flute she with a pocket 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.620
 flute and the best raid with bags 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.230
 are unfortunately we do not see very much 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.269
 well on the bottom of the video are you going 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.760
 offer this little codeonline that will be the case 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.680
 in all the videos anyway and we 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.849
 left to discover what little this 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.260
 little booster reserves us and 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.549
 frankly an ex for the first 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.220
 Video brekkie number 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.719
 it could really be huge then 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.849
 what are we going to reserve for us 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.500
 left with a 6-foot pot and the 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.659
 little mushroom behind that 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.180
 frankly I appreciate very much it is 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:21.419
 super nice we continue with a melo done 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.469
 a little evolved in the meadow 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:26.650
 electric at best pay attention to this 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:28.479
 pokemon there I go a little quickly scrutinize 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.549
 in pokemon it's not a pokemon 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.169
 I appreciate a lot 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.819
 behind we have a little rat deduce 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.260
 help not bad am here too he has 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.569
 outright not published in the tcg 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.709
 besides, we do not often see 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.760
 beautiful maybe it's the only time we 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.340
 saw it for the moment I believe 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.590
 by the way too much alone a small key 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.879
 pokemon is going to already go the river 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.470
 no it is not the case 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.799
 excuse me I was wrong this is 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.349
 a lick followed by a raze 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.989
 rivers is lucky because fo henrard 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.009
 pour in small break because you have 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.120
 well noticed there are paramedics 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:03.099
 necessarily it could not miss a 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.419
 new concept necessarily says the 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.250
 ambulances he goes through all my 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.750
 videos it's now very rare that this 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.189
 is not the case and even in a 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.689
 video that will not make more than five 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.280
 minutes except this one I'll get it to you 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.579
 remember it's normal it's a little bit 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.009
 long 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.930
 they found the way to pass it's 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:19.630
 impressive but I get annoyed even 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.820
 the more I'm used to it so I said a 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.139
 tarpon henrard winter is a very 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.330
 good pick especially we open that one 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.949
 only booster it's fun and I know 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.889
 that darling explains at 1000m a lot 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.749
 are we going to be spoiled behind 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.150
 we will see our eyes 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.860
 will have a noise towards in the graph 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.860
 it's a very good pickaxe a great 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.659
 holographic the dragon type the pokemon 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.159
 which I like the most in fact 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.620
 really the dragon title and the best 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.060
 type to my eyes in the tcg 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.259
 I love and sounds verne and naulleau 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.689
 Super beautiful 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.389
 I am super happy very good pick 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.349
 to boost it's nice fun 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.939
 to monographic 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.979
 and here it is for breakfast 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.330
 I hope you are well served 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.710
 any case says less in the comments 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.909
 it's this kind of videos you're interested in 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.529
 in the future because it's a concept 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.180
 that I will therefore establish every day you 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:03.719
 will in this way have more content 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.879
 on the chain 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:07.289
 in addition to other videos and more 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:09.120
 like that when I sometimes spend 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.319
 periods of 3 to 5 days without video and ben 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.539
 you will still have these videos at 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:15.029
 breakfast so I would really like 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.800
 a lot to know if you like it 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.150
 want me to continue or not I 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.430
 plant can be completely I do not know 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.870
 not in any case me I tell you good 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.870
 day to all and good luck
