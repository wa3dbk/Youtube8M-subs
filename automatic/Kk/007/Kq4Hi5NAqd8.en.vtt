00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.250
 and your palate 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.070
 and of kitchen tools 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.780

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.380
 saw and another without transparent film 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.580
 we cut the corners and the bread 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.910
 four o'clock so when we tell them we do not 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:56.110
 the bell remains 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.110
 Now we take the world and treat it 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.810
 we take the floor I think and step to spread 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.810
 what we put together 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.890
 we take the tomato 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.240
 says a little leaf and the coast we 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.240
 special work 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.120
 and not 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.520
 and we can 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.080
 Do not put too much because if you do not leave 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.080
 and put it in half 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.770
 we take the pepper we cut the tip 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.760
 and we cut them into pieces 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.690
 small as we have done with the 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.690
 bat 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.380
 and we throw it here 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.149
 and if you want, it can be 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.149
 to 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.950
 we take some paper and we put it 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.739
 we take the roll 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.670
 let's go take a little hard to 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.900
 half and we put it but if that were the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.900
 glue that I managed 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.770
 and now we have it, we put it on paper 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.069
 film and we roll it well 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.980
 and we do it like that 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.560
 and we are doing like this 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.670
 when we have it, we can put it 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.450
 10 minutes in the refrigerator and past 10 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.340
 minutes 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.340
 this would be the result 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.940
