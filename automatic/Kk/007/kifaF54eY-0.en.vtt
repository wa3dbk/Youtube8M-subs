try and train through those and it's a
guessing<00:01:56.520> game<00:01:56.549> about<00:01:57.000> whether<00:01:57.240> you're<00:01:57.390> gonna

have not caused any damage and you know

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.070 
have not caused any damage and you know
my<00:02:22.670> feeling<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.180> even<00:02:23.690> though<00:02:23.810> someone

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
my feeling is that even though someone

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.030 
my feeling is that even though someone
can't<00:02:24.770> run<00:02:24.950> outside<00:02:25.840> without<00:02:26.840> paying<00:02:27.319> if<00:02:27.860> they

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
can't run outside without paying if they

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.260 
can't run outside without paying if they
can<00:02:28.220> run<00:02:28.340> in<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.520> g-trainer<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.090> they<00:02:29.150> have

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
can run in the g-trainer and they have

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.120 
can run in the g-trainer and they have
no<00:02:29.450> pain<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.989> they're<00:02:30.260> not<00:02:30.380> sore<00:02:30.739> afterwards

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
no pain and they're not sore afterwards

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.850 
no pain and they're not sore afterwards
I<00:02:31.580> know<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.750> we<00:02:32.870> haven't<00:02:33.050> done<00:02:33.260> any<00:02:33.410> damage

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
I know that we haven't done any damage

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.680 
I know that we haven't done any damage
and<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.580> fact<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.910> firmly<00:02:35.239> believe<00:02:35.660> that

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
and that in fact I firmly believe that

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.470 
and that in fact I firmly believe that
they<00:02:35.959> actually<00:02:35.989> rehab<00:02:36.739> faster<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.520> believe

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
they actually rehab faster I believe

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.130 
they actually rehab faster I believe
that<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.720> lot<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.170> injuries<00:02:39.590> are<00:02:40.550> shortened<00:02:41.180> if

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
that a lot of injuries are shortened if

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.320 
that a lot of injuries are shortened if
you<00:02:42.349> can<00:02:42.530> find<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.950> way<00:02:43.099> to<00:02:43.160> train<00:02:43.760> through<00:02:44.150> them

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
you can find a way to train through them

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.199 
you can find a way to train through them
without<00:02:44.870> any<00:02:45.110> pain<00:02:46.209> absolutely<00:02:47.209> know<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.540> I

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
without any pain absolutely know that I

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.229 
without any pain absolutely know that I
have<00:02:50.209> often<00:02:50.390> used<00:02:50.720> an<00:02:51.140> an<00:02:52.120> analogy<00:02:53.120> or<00:02:53.150> an

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
have often used an an analogy or an

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.130 
have often used an an analogy or an
illustration<00:02:54.040> concept<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.250> athletes<00:02:55.670> I

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
illustration concept for athletes I

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.960 
illustration concept for athletes I
asked<00:02:57.140> them<00:02:57.260> when<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.310> go<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.640> starting

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
asked them when you go to the starting

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.100 
asked them when you go to the starting
line<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.750> race<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:02.180> are<00:03:02.420> going<00:03:03.019> up

workouts who do you think cast the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.390 
workouts who do you think cast the
advantage<00:03:19.299> it's<00:03:20.299> pretty<00:03:20.510> simple<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.709> guy<00:03:21.920> or

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
advantage it's pretty simple the guy or

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.020 
advantage it's pretty simple the guy or
gal<00:03:22.609> that's<00:03:22.880> worked<00:03:23.209> harder<00:03:23.630> done<00:03:24.320> more

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
gal that's worked harder done more

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.330 
gal that's worked harder done more
volume<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.269> still<00:03:27.019> had<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.620> same<00:03:27.799> quality

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
volume and still had the same quality

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.349 
volume and still had the same quality
workouts<00:03:29.200> well<00:03:30.200> nine<00:03:30.380> times<00:03:30.410> out<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:30.829> ten<00:03:31.040> when

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
workouts well nine times out of ten when

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.220 
workouts well nine times out of ten when
that's<00:03:32.359> simple<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:35.180> volume<00:03:35.600> part<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:36.019> so

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
that's simple and the volume part is so

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.090 
that's simple and the volume part is so
important<00:03:36.709> now<00:03:37.329> unfortunately<00:03:38.329> we<00:03:38.900> all<00:03:39.109> have

important now unfortunately we all have
I<00:03:40.609> think<00:03:40.870> genetically<00:03:41.870> or<00:03:42.290> as<00:03:42.820> a<00:03:43.820> matter<00:03:44.030> of

I think genetically or as a matter of

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.050 
I think genetically or as a matter of
our<00:03:44.269> training<00:03:44.720> how<00:03:44.870> we've<00:03:45.079> developed<00:03:45.910> we<00:03:46.910> are

our training how we've developed we are

our training how we've developed we are

limited in terms of how much volume we

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.640 
limited in terms of how much volume we
can<00:03:49.100> do<00:03:49.250> every<00:03:50.209> athlete<00:03:50.570> knows<00:03:50.600> at<00:03:51.109> a<00:03:51.170> certain

going to start to get injured or their
quality<00:03:57.410> is<00:03:57.500> going<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.739> go<00:03:57.859> down<00:03:58.329> all<00:03:59.329> of<00:03:59.540> a

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
quality is going to go down all of a

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.720 
quality is going to go down all of a
sudden<00:03:59.840> with<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.049> G<00:04:00.230> trainer<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:01.250> really

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
sudden with the G trainer it really

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.479 
sudden with the G trainer it really
gives<00:04:02.000> us<00:04:02.269> for<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.569> first<00:04:02.780> time<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:04.130> ability

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
gives us for the first time the ability

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.009 
gives us for the first time the ability
to<00:04:04.549> do<00:04:04.640> some<00:04:04.850> of<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.060> form<00:04:05.329> of<00:04:05.450> cross-training

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019

increased and it's not in a linear
fashion<00:04:47.160> you<00:04:47.940> know<00:04:47.970> if<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.800> drop<00:04:49.800> somebody's

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
fashion you know if you drop somebody's

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.730 
fashion you know if you drop somebody's
weight<00:04:50.490> by<00:04:50.700> 10%<00:04:51.360> can<00:04:51.810> they<00:04:51.900> do<00:04:52.020> 10%<00:04:52.290> more

mileage<00:04:53.060> you<00:04:54.060> know<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.210> think<00:04:54.780> that<00:04:55.050> it's<00:04:55.200> an

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
mileage you know I think that it's an

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.190 
mileage you know I think that it's an
exponential<00:04:56.040> increase<00:04:56.690> that<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:57.840> can<00:04:57.990> drop

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
exponential increase that you can drop

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.730 
exponential increase that you can drop
somebody's<00:04:58.620> weight<00:04:58.800> by<00:04:58.980> 10%<00:04:59.580> and<00:04:59.700> perhaps<00:04:59.880> do

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
somebody's weight by 10% and perhaps do

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.490 
somebody's weight by 10% and perhaps do
15<00:05:01.740> to<00:05:01.890> 20<00:05:02.190> percent<00:05:02.310> more<00:05:02.840> mileage<00:05:03.840> than<00:05:04.380> you

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
15 to 20 percent more mileage than you

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.840 
15 to 20 percent more mileage than you
normally<00:05:04.650> would<00:05:04.860> have<00:05:05.130> and<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:05.580> all<00:05:05.730> of<00:05:05.760> a

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
normally would have and so all of a

normally would have and so all of a
sudden<00:05:06.120> it<00:05:06.180> gives<00:05:06.390> you<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.690> ability<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:07.310> do

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
sudden it gives you the ability to do

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.360 
sudden it gives you the ability to do
higher<00:05:08.760> volumes<00:05:09.360> of<00:05:09.600> training<00:05:10.280> getting<00:05:11.280> that

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
higher volumes of training getting that

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.430 
higher volumes of training getting that

cardiovascular effect getting the

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
turnover effect and you're actually

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.170 
turnover effect and you're actually
training<00:05:17.010> harder<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.670> you<00:05:17.850> know<00:05:17.940> I've<00:05:18.150> used

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
training harder and you know I've used

training harder and you know I've used
that<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:18.780> know<00:05:19.020> rule<00:05:19.170> of<00:05:19.290> thumb<00:05:19.500> that<00:05:19.650> I<00:05:19.680> use

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
that you know rule of thumb that I use

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.370 
that you know rule of thumb that I use
with<00:05:20.070> my<00:05:20.220> runners<00:05:20.550> is<00:05:20.760> that<00:05:20.940> if<00:05:21.060> a<00:05:21.380> runner

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
with my runners is that if a runner

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.110 
with my runners is that if a runner
could<00:05:22.710> run<00:05:22.920> normally

100 miles a week outside I tell them

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
outside plus 30 on the G trainer they

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.880 
outside plus 30 on the G trainer they
get<00:05:36.450> a<00:05:36.480> total<00:05:36.870> of<00:05:36.930> 110<00:05:37.380> the<00:05:38.310> total<00:05:38.640> impacts

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
get a total of 110 the total impacts

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.130 
get a total of 110 the total impacts
negative<00:05:40.890> aspects<00:05:41.310> of<00:05:41.430> running<00:05:41.750> are<00:05:42.750> only

negative aspects of running are only

they've got that extra ten miles a week
of<00:05:47.700> running<00:05:48.890> cardiovascularly<00:05:50.000> which<00:05:51.000> is

of running cardiovascularly which is

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.660 
of running cardiovascularly which is

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
going to improve them and I believe

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.590 
going to improve them and I believe
neuromuscular<00:05:54.570> doing<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.050> faster<00:05:55.470> turnover

running the 30 miles which they usually

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.500 
running the 30 miles which they usually

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
will run faster on the gt-r and then

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.700 
will run faster on the gt-r and then
they<00:06:00.600> would<00:06:00.780> outside<00:06:01.170> that<00:06:01.440> they<00:06:01.650> are

they would outside that they are

their<00:06:03.480> speed<00:06:03.810> better<00:06:04.770> than<00:06:05.040> if<00:06:05.160> they<00:06:05.280> had<00:06:05.400> run

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
their speed better than if they had run

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.470 
their speed better than if they had run
that<00:06:05.700> 30<00:06:06.000> miles<00:06:06.300> that<00:06:06.600> just<00:06:06.810> the<00:06:07.410> slow<00:06:07.680> relaxed

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
that 30 miles that just the slow relaxed

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.430 
that 30 miles that just the slow relaxed
aerobic<00:06:09.480> type<00:06:09.630> efforts<00:06:10.050> that<00:06:10.200> they<00:06:10.290> would

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
aerobic type efforts that they would

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.770 
aerobic type efforts that they would
have<00:06:10.530> run<00:06:10.680> those<00:06:10.860> miles<00:06:11.100> at<00:06:11.340> outside<00:06:11.750> so<00:06:12.750> I

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
have run those miles at outside so I

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.150 
have run those miles at outside so I
really<00:06:13.080> believe<00:06:13.350> that<00:06:13.380> it<00:06:13.590> gives<00:06:13.830> us<00:06:13.980> an

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
really believe that it gives us an

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.090 
really believe that it gives us an
opportunity<00:06:14.220> to<00:06:14.760> do<00:06:14.910> more<00:06:15.710> volume<00:06:16.710> and<00:06:17.010> do

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
opportunity to do more volume and do

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.820 
opportunity to do more volume and do
more<00:06:17.280> quality<00:06:17.700> and<00:06:18.110> when<00:06:19.110> you<00:06:19.230> step<00:06:19.470> the<00:06:19.590> line
