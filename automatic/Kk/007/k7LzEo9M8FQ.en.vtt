00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.460
 in g 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.460
 USA 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.079
 hearing we begin repair from improvised means 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.699
 it is natural here for motorcycles 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.480
 in 2000, the reagent opens due to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.019
 the fact that she broke down 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.369
 and he succeeded 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.560
 exactly EU 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.529
 renders services a trap let's say 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.109
 footboard 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.940
 do not 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.020
 I'll try to do 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.050
 hundreds of thousands 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.050
 I thought after that the box could 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.430
 more fit 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.430
 ok so sounds taut box 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.350
 pulled up for the best things 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.650
 Now we are dealing with problems 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.650
 think over 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.390
 this way 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.390
 watch gear 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.000
 and how I don't communicate can't 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.730
 traffic cop can not 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.220
 solidly 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.320
 d 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.320
 raise box 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.310
 so probably if they will support 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.310
 boyarchuk ga 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.240

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.040
 oao 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.869
 couple 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:18.319
 dollars 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.340
 true 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.450

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.869
 rub 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:29.869
 will take place today 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.209
 you should understand why 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.209
 1 thousand people 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.209
 and two hands 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.909
 share here is 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.909
 the reason is 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.009
 Kirov

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:12.109
 over these clubs 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.799
 It is also an option 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.959
 where it will be at the level 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.909
 titova services

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.689
 so are other rivals 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.829
 we raise 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.899
 under 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.659

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.659
