00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
have to do this over a pre-recording

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.220 
have to do this over a pre-recording
because<00:00:05.040> it<00:00:05.160> wasn't<00:00:05.370> recording<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.940> mic

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
because it wasn't recording of the mic

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.830 
because it wasn't recording of the mic
so<00:00:07.230> basically<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.429> shows<00:00:08.700> how<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:09.090> get<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.510> set

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
so basically this shows how to get a set

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.200 
so basically this shows how to get a set

mod<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:13.170> place<00:00:13.410> cook<00:00:13.710> pork<00:00:13.950> chop<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
mod you place cook pork chop in the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.910 
mod you place cook pork chop in the
furnace<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.089> one<00:00:15.929> cook<00:00:16.199> pork<00:00:16.500> chop<00:00:16.650> will<00:00:16.800> give

furnace and one cook pork chop will give

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.000 
furnace and one cook pork chop will give
you<00:00:17.070> one<00:00:17.400> piece<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.880> gelatin<00:00:18.439> now<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.500> jetting

you one piece of gelatin now the jetting
is<00:00:20.130> used<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.820> create<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.359> jelly-like<00:00:21.660> mo

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
is used to create the jelly-like mo

laughing best as a chicken so yeah
there's<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.289> gelatine<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.939> you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.090> place

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
there's the gelatine and you can place

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.300 
there's the gelatine and you can place
it<00:00:27.480> anywhere<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:28.260> any<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> squares<00:00:29.099> as

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
it anywhere in any of the squares as

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.769 
it anywhere in any of the squares as
long<00:00:29.609> as<00:00:29.730> there's<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.000> bucket<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.330> water<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.599> Jan

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
long as there's a bucket of water on Jan

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.120 
long as there's a bucket of water on Jan
if<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.199> make<00:00:31.349> gelatine<00:00:31.949> solution<00:00:34.130> now

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
if you can make gelatine solution now

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.330 
if you can make gelatine solution now
you<00:00:36.030> let<00:00:36.390> me<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> rest<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
judging solutions oh well there we go

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:52.069 
judging solutions oh well there we go
one<00:00:43.559> more<00:00:47.329> alright<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> then<00:00:50.300> after<00:00:51.300> you've

one more alright so then after you've
made<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> judging<00:00:52.800> solutions<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.550> then

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
made all the judging solutions you then

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.760 
made all the judging solutions you then
create<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.390> flavors<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.350> let's<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.649> throw

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
create the flavors so let's just throw

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.139 
create the flavors so let's just throw
those<00:00:56.100> buckets<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.590> we<00:00:58.590> need<00:00:58.739> four<00:00:59.129> bowls<00:00:59.399> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
those buckets and we need four bowls to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.569 
those buckets and we need four bowls to
place<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> jelly<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.949> starting<00:01:02.309> off<00:01:02.399> we

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
place the jelly in so starting off we

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.250 
place the jelly in so starting off we
have<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> slime<00:01:03.059> ball<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.600> place<00:01:03.809> sat<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
have the slime ball you place sat in the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.390 
have the slime ball you place sat in the
furnace<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.920> gives<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.250> slime<00:01:05.580> juice

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
furnace and that gives you slime juice

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.940 
furnace and that gives you slime juice
and<00:01:08.510> basically<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.930> use<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.350> ingredient

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and basically you use the ingredient

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.649 
and basically you use the ingredient
along<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> gelatine<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.210> bowl<00:01:12.390> in

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
along with the gelatine and the bowl in

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.020 
along with the gelatine and the bowl in
order<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> create<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> jelly<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.070> there's<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
order to create the jelly so there's the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.170 
order to create the jelly so there's the
image<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.619> slime<00:01:16.890> juice<00:01:17.130> now<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.820> sugar

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
image for the slime juice now with sugar

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.940 
image for the slime juice now with sugar
instead<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.630> getting<00:01:18.900> juice<00:01:19.409> from<00:01:19.619> sugar

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
instead of getting juice from sugar

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.100 
instead of getting juice from sugar
because<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.220> doesn't<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:20.549> make<00:01:20.700> sense

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
because that doesn't really make sense

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.880 
because that doesn't really make sense
you<00:01:22.110> guess<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.689> sugar<00:01:24.689> compound<00:01:25.409> let's

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you guess you get sugar compound let's

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.310 
you guess you get sugar compound let's
just<00:01:25.950> throw<00:01:26.460> those<00:01:26.759> away<00:01:27.090> because<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:28.140> won't

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
just throw those away because they won't

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
just throw those away because they won't
though<00:01:28.920> they<00:01:29.220> were<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> juices<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> roses

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
though they were the juices of the roses

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.530 
though they were the juices of the roses
and<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.659> flower<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.310> yeah<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.000> put<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> rose

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and the flower so yeah you put the rose

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.100 
and the flower so yeah you put the rose
in<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> furnace<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.659> give<00:01:36.689> you

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
in the furnace and that will give you

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.270 
in the furnace and that will give you
rose<00:01:37.560> juice<00:01:39.140> then<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.259> put<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.470> dandelion<00:01:41.040> in

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280

the<00:01:41.520> flat<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> furnace<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:45.320> sure<00:01:46.320> enough

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the flat in the furnace and sure enough

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.470 
the flat in the furnace and sure enough
that<00:01:46.979> will<00:01:47.159> give<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.549> dandelion<00:01:48.299> juice

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.990 

alright<00:01:52.440> so<00:01:53.190> this<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.400> how<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.550> craft<00:01:53.820> them

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
alright so this is how you craft them

you placed a bowl on the bottom you

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.070 
you placed a bowl on the bottom you
place<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.700> gelatine<00:01:57.060> solution<00:01:57.480> at<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.870> top

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
place the gelatine solution at the top

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.040 
place the gelatine solution at the top
and<00:01:58.260> you<00:01:58.500> post<00:01:58.740> post<00:01:59.520> your<00:01:59.880> flavoring<00:02:00.660> in<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
and you post post your flavoring in the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.560 
and you post post your flavoring in the
middle<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.370> there's<00:02:02.400> a<00:02:02.640> slime<00:02:02.910> jelly<00:02:03.150> there's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
middle so there's a slime jelly there's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.140 
middle so there's a slime jelly there's
the<00:02:03.720> sugar<00:02:03.930> jelly<00:02:04.280> there's<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.520> rose<00:02:05.790> jelly

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
the bottom judge in solution at the top

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.620 
the bottom judge in solution at the top
and<00:02:37.640> then<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.850> sugar<00:02:39.060> compound<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.570> the

middle now I already have one health bar

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.080 
middle now I already have one health bar
missing<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:43.890> it's<00:02:44.010> perfect<00:02:44.430> for<00:02:44.460> showing<00:02:44.970> off

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
missing so it's perfect for showing off

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.520 
missing so it's perfect for showing off
their<00:02:45.240> only<00:02:45.510> only<00:02:45.930> Hills<00:02:46.170> one<00:02:46.380> health<00:02:48.530> alright

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
and then you have speed for 20 seconds

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.200 
and then you have speed for 20 seconds
so<00:02:52.110> let<00:02:52.350> me<00:02:52.380> just<00:02:52.560> show<00:02:52.770> off<00:02:52.800> their<00:02:53.160> how<00:02:53.820> fast

so let me just show off their how fast

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.870 
so let me just show off their how fast
you<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.420> actually<00:02:54.780> run<00:02:54.960> with<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:56.459> this

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
you can actually run with this so this

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.630 
you can actually run with this so this
jelly<00:02:57.150> isn't<00:02:57.570> actually<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:58.320> useful<00:02:59.100> for<00:02:59.370> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
jelly isn't actually a useful for the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.660 
jelly isn't actually a useful for the
amount<00:02:59.760> net<00:02:59.970> heels<00:03:00.770> by<00:03:01.770> suitable<00:03:02.190> for<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.430> for

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
amount net heels by suitable for it for

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.640 
amount net heels by suitable for it for
its<00:03:02.820> effect<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.600> if<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:03.990> need<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.230> get<00:03:04.410> across

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
its effect so if you need to get across

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.979 
its effect so if you need to get across
some<00:03:04.890> biomes<00:03:05.280> quickly<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.240> sugar<00:03:06.540> jelly<00:03:06.750> is

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
some biomes quickly the sugar jelly is

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.310 
some biomes quickly the sugar jelly is
extremely<00:03:07.800> useful<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.660> I'm<00:03:09.810> planning<00:03:10.260> on

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
extremely useful so I'm planning on
