00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.210
 the great originality of bio lift when 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.430
 it was created in 2000 it was from 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.500
 look at private pools that 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.660
 could we offer ourselves as a treatment 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.460
 chlorine-free water for all 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.769
 private indoor or outdoor pools 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.210
 even the spas and at that moment the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.699
 uv technology were quite 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.039
 indicated in combination with oxygen 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.839
 active and how does it work actually it's 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.430
 very simple on a private pool or a 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.790
 spa we will install 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.350
 just after the filter a device that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.730
 can be this one that is stainless steel that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.920
 can this one be what's going to be 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.050
 say or tiny devices in 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.010
 flow function so we will install 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.140
 this device 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.510
 the water will go down after 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.730
 filtration come out by the water at this 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.430
 moment there it will be perfect rid 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.930
 bacteria from algae viruses etc 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.789
 but we will end up in the pool 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.079
 so is basin will have had bathers 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.690
 there would have been pollution 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.250
 outside and at that moment we're going 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.899
 simply add every day and from 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.200
 automatically a small dose 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.299
 of active oxygen through this account 2 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.369
 that will help make the water 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.290
 disinfectant after being 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.670
 ultraviolet disinfected 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.790
 then to perfect the automatisms 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.720
 absolute and absolute comfort we can 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.280
 join him there 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.970
 they have a toll regulation 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.970
 automatic 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.310
 Yes 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.180
 so the best way to measure the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.790
 benefits and benefits of a 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.250
 UV ultraviolet treatment is to c 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.090
 bathe in treated water this 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.070
 way there it is clear that today we 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.530
 will have an extremely comfortable water 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.390
 extremely sweet that will not be 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.549
 aggressive neither for the eyes nor for the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.869
 skin nor for mucous membranes children 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.240
 we can bathe hours and 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.039
 hours without any aggression and that's 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.659
 still they who are the main ones 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.289
 beneficiaries and especially the main ones 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.869
 users 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.690
 so we really have a water today 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.739
 which is going to be a very very crystalline 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.620
 clear in any season 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.880
 even with a thunderstorm so really at the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.540
 times in terms of maintenance of 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.040
 maintenance and beauty of comfort 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.140
 it's really a process that goes 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.390
 meet his expectations through through 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.519
 automation as well and at 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:37.060
 through again a treatment 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:38.739
 without chlorine so here we are in 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.739
 a superb place where the owners have 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.180
 made the choice almost ten years ago 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.820
 to install with drink so to have 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.350
 chlorine-free pools both on a 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.750
 indoor pool who is who 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.760
 absolutely superb and both on a 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.079
 very large outdoor pool which 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.359
 could also be likened a 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.430
 hotel pool so we actually 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.799
 devices of different size in 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.060
 flow rates on each of the 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.579
 pools it allows him to benefit 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.519
 with his family his grandchildren his 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.690
 back children obviously quite 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.690
 pleasant and in all seasons 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.140
 and 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.080
 Yes 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.080
 he 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.910
 in the 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.910
 as you can see watching 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.520
 the water there is no problem 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.400
 since I have this product more 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.570
 maintenance more problems and especially 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.160
 no more worries kids are 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.590
 satisfied and me too 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.130
 luckily before I was salt so 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.620
 chlorine problems so with a 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.010
 local closed it was causing big problem 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.140
 rust all that maintenance 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.510
 no problem at all this is not 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.550
 satisfied the evidence the little children 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.890
 come to the pool at my house 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.130
 life because the heat and she stings 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.730
 not the eyes 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.730
 everything is fine 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.060
 we
