00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.090
 visual personalization is also 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.350
 something very important the players that 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.930
 they want to play in a different way 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.730
 they also want to highlight one of the 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.300
 new features of battlefield 4 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.980
 consists of painting your weapons and vehicles 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.700
 so I can take my painting by 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.820
 defect my normal weapon 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.940
 I can unlock more views and ways of 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.830
 show the weapon you will also see that also 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.890
 there are camouflages from different countries of the 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.870
 world but if there is a daisy camouflage 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.460
 there is a camouflage of dais us 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.160
 we also want to stand out in the field of 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.470
 battle the good thing about this is that it's not 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.300
 only available in a single weapon one 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.910
 once unlocked you can also 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.570
 use it for example on a ship or in 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.210
 a fighter or in a helicopter so 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.890
 all these camouflages are ways of 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.780
 stand out through personalization 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.780
 visual on the battlefield 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.790
 there are basic camouflages that when applied 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.770
 they always look the same 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.690
 import where you go or the level in the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.430
 that you play one of the new 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.080
 characteristics and this is something that the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.300
 players have been asking for a long time 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.700
 is what we call adaptive camouflage 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.110
 the adaptive camouflage chooses a pattern 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.450
 that feeds on the colors of 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.220
 environment for example here in paras the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.369
 storm with water and the naval environment 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.720
 I have this blue camouflage on maps like 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.670
 well chus shanghai 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.840
 we will see darker or gray tones that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.550
 they adapt better to the urban terrain 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.560
 you can see that he is choosing the colors 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.600
 from different places each of them 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.430
 is unique so if I choose the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.950
 adaptive I will get to have an aspect 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.450
 unlike the rest of camouflages what 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.430
 will help me stand out in the field of 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.390
 battle and that's something that the players 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.390
 will appreciate jetta 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.130
 Keeping this in mind as you the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.800
 you have managed to create something 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.690
 realistic, yet always fun 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.820
 we start from reality as a source of 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.710
 inspiration we look at things like 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.110
 where they use weapons in real life 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.940
 the soldiers how this vehicle is used and 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.620
 we take all this to turn it into the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.780
 paper and scissors stone game that 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.100
 we have the battlefield and not everything can 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.080
 be perfect in all areas 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.760
 even if it is in real life what 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.010
 we want players to take 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.410
 decisions an example would be our 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.850
 new sniper rifles now 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.680
 you can change the distance to which 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.900
 you aim with what the long shots 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.840
 distance are more effective in ranges 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.550
 shorter ones can be harder thanks 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.500
 to this characteristic what you measure in the 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.000
 game is more like what you experience 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.280
 a sniper on the battlefield 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.530
 although we have simplified it so that 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.600
 be something simpler this way 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.420
 you can live that great experience that is 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.260
 battlefield 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.260
 ah 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.440
 for the storm there is a very powerful rifle 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.330
 it's the best battlefield rifle 4 I do not 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.610
 I'd say it 's the best weapon we do not look for 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.620
 have the ultimate weapon but the rifle 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.080
 of caliber 50 yes that is the most powerful 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.970
 is a rifle capable of killing with a single 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.490
 shot regardless of where 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.870
 Scope can also damage vehicles 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.330
 but lacks the mobility of others 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.100
 rifles you need to deploy the bipod 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.720
 to ensure accuracy and choose 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.400
 okay the shots because you have little 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.630
 ammunition 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.370
 I am now seven game modes 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.160
 battlefield 4 including two that already 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.020
 they existed 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.880
 I really like the obliteration mode and in 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.550
 that air of conquest based on the game 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.930
 to capture the flag that someone can 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.940
 go on your own attack boat and 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.070
 cross the map find that you 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.780
 chases a helicopter jumping into the water to 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.370
 get on attack boats look for a 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.500
 teammate to pick you up and 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.360
 finally destroy one of the objectives 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.950
 then you can repeat operation three 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.350
 or four more times before the round 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.120
 finish for me that is the essence of 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.250
 battlefield the vehicle mix the 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.959
 playability the land the sea the air 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.590
 all the elements are combined to the 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.160
 perfection 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.160
 release 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.890
 you smell here that program ends 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.420
 battlefield tv from dais we will return very 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.310
 soon to tell you many more things 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.110
 meanwhile do not hesitate to leave us 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.400

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.600
