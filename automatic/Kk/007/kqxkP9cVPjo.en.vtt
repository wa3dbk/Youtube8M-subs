that I've made so far I guess by like
yeah<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.540> first<00:00:39.780> videos<00:00:40.370> at<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:42.210> beach<00:00:43.079> so

pretty much what this Beach is this is a
cocoa<00:00:47.670> beach<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.120> think<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:49.520> Florida<00:00:50.690> and
