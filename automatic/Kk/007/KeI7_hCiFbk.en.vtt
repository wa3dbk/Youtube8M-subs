00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.400
 with them 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.020
 jimÃ©nez how they were welcome to a 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.670
 new video and good guys in this 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.140
 I bring you a tutorial like this 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.990
 Boy is a little tutorial of how 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.640
 put rails or torches in the air a 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.110
 trick like cap on the forum of fp and 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 universities wanted to share it with 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.470
 you who may well be that much 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.300
 people know him but maybe because 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.400
 a certain number of people because they do not 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.500
 know I told him why not share it 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.510
 and we are the newspaper here guys and what 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.340
 that we acquired by is for this trick 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.680
 reality that I really liked is an effect 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.850
 It is a very cool clips with flowers and 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.500
 it is not what we require it would be 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.810
 Rails here expect that it's park 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.489
 is barking for god also like them 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.980
 I said sorry for that because we require 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.630
 the rails the torch and very important 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.489
 the flower that measures two blocks of height 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.260
 that would be this way around here that is the 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.149
 lila that would be the rose and I think that 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.620
 it was also work then with this 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.420
 which is the sun drasdo block then 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.160
 because in this part we will get the rose 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.780
 and the first thing we will do then is to see 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.910
 put our circuit here 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.040
 example I will use this here wait 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.810
 that I got confused we put this and I'll use 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.240
 this to do then our path does not 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.190
 the most important thing that you have to 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.229
 see a block then down there is a 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.360
 block down or more blocks but that 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.700
 do not want on the floor then 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.410
 now it can be to make our way 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.970
 our circuit without people to be a 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.730
 little simple to show you here 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.260
 we take this dad dad and then he is 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.150
 time to put the rails here we put 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.070
 these guys that the truth is very 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.200
 well this eclipse in a certain part for 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.360
 the mac makers for if you want to do 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.729
 a great rollercoaster I say with this 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.380
 destination actually I like a lot and 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.870
 then what we will do is put this for 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.330
 here a little quickie for dad and then 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.380
 It is very important that you do this 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.840
 what we have to do now, it was 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.790
 put the flower under the blocks here 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.790
 you can see what we put it and then this 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.950
 so they eliminate the block not with the roses 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.530
 here we do this and I think that also 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.840
 because it would work with the east here with 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.700
 the fat tube let's see if well 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.259
 it works and works with him and the one 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.390
 is two blocks high here 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.940
 we have this and then what we have to 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.340
 do then it will be to remove the roses 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.410
 but very important that we have to 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.390
 remove them then in the part that is 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.670
 below that in this part I show you 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.070
 how is it here of this and now here 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.500
 we put these and told them that it is 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.000
 important to remove them from the part of 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.490
 down that is here 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.980
 to see what is left then the risk giving 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.870
 around here we remove all so fast 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.910
 dad very important that they remove them by 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.940
 down because if not then they fall and for 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.710
 what's up that do not do not know do not ask me 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.600
 why this happens is a mistake and so 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.060
 here I removed it from above and you saw that 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.640
 it fell but if you can here see that 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.709
 in fact it works and I do not know to me the truth 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.330
 is that I thought the buki was good because 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.870
 I wanted to share here the tree 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.000
 area again for dad and then what 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.580
 not here we put roses of the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.250
 height blocks and then we remove from 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.980
 down here very well here dad dad 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.540
 we remove this and remove this and here it 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.520
 the rails remain then it is already 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.200
 so that we put the car of 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.700
 mine over here and you can see that yes 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.980
 It works very well because I've already 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.600
 passed then certain maps with this 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.280
 style and the truth is that I love it for 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.380
 here you can see that everything works at 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.500
 perfection ok and this well also 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.300
 they work well with the torches ok this 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.340
 it's more than everything for a decoration 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.040
 I suppose here, for example, we are going to 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.140
 put is a bit above and we'll put 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.580
 the torches on the site that we 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.490
 we want for example 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.710
 we put these four and the truth is that 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.270
 it looks very weird but it looks good from 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.490
 the point of view for here we put this 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.400
 and then simple what we will do then it will be 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.980
 take the rose then remove one that is 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.330
 below and we put this here wait 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.720
 chrome is not that the rose can be 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.130
 make you sick more as long as you wait 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.480
 I had forgotten that roses should put 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.510
 they are only on land so here 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.430
 we put this and now we can put 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.080
 our little flower so that it 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.910
 superimpose on the block above 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.130
 and it makes the question that the 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.780
 let's remove it in the bottom part ok for 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.300
 that we later take off if they can see that 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.220
 it's floating then, I do not think anything 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.680
 that this would be everything I hope there 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.750
 liked you know that you can leave your 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.120
 like like among favorites and then this one 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.590
 He looked for the flowers because this one works with 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.140
 all blocks with all all all 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.030
 and well if even with facebook then 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.920
 it can can therefore break 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.959
 rock but only in creative mode 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.910
 then why can not you put it down 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.370
 in a good because it will be a matter of seeing 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.410
 if you can not do this then in mode 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.150
 survival but in creative you can 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.160
 break any block then it's all 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.639
 I hope you liked a kiss 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.490
 hug 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.910
 and see you in a next video bye bye 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.660
 the matches 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.660
 myers
