I<00:00:19.670> used<00:00:20.670> Barbosa<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.660> carry<00:00:21.900> bombs<00:00:22.109> down<00:00:22.439> there

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
I used Barbosa to carry bombs down there

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.910 
I used Barbosa to carry bombs down there
because<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:23.189> some<00:00:23.340> reason<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> bombs<00:00:23.850> don't

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
because for some reason the bombs don't

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.900 
because for some reason the bombs don't
extinguish<00:00:25.920> when<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.189> go<00:00:26.279> underwater<00:00:26.460> which

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
extinguish when you go underwater which

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.210
