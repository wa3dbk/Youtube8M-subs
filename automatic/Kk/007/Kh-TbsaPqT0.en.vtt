that's<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.300> basically<00:03:09.600> my<00:03:09.780> overview<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.320> the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
that's just basically my overview of the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.010 
that's just basically my overview of the
weather<00:03:10.650> applications<00:03:11.250> i<00:03:11.370> use<00:03:11.820> i<00:03:12.060> would

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
weather applications i use i would

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.870 
weather applications i use i would
probably<00:03:13.680> lean<00:03:13.890> toward<00:03:14.190> weatherbug<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:14.790> you

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
probably lean toward weatherbug if you

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.370 
probably lean toward weatherbug if you
only<00:03:15.000> want<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.240> buy<00:03:15.330> one<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.630> them<00:03:15.870> but<00:03:16.080> just

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
only want to buy one of them but just

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.080 
only want to buy one of them but just
because<00:03:16.530> they<00:03:17.340> seem<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.580> update<00:03:17.940> their

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
because they seem to update their

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.830 
because they seem to update their
information<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.630> little<00:03:18.870> more<00:03:19.020> often<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:20.840> you

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
information a little more often and you

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.480 
information a little more often and you
can't<00:03:22.080> really<00:03:22.170> go<00:03:22.380> wrong<00:03:22.410> with<00:03:22.800> either<00:03:22.920> but

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
can't really go wrong with either but

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.310 
can't really go wrong with either but
like<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.880> said<00:03:23.910> weatherbug<00:03:24.570> would<00:03:24.810> probably<00:03:25.140> my

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
like I said weatherbug would probably my

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.520 
like I said weatherbug would probably my
