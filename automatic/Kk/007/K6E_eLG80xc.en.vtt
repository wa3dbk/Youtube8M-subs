00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
and I really like the lever one in the

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.860 
and I really like the lever one in the
shop<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.280> with<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.549> tire<00:04:05.790> machine<00:04:06.030> the

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.409 
shop and with the tire machine the
four-way<00:04:07.290> tool<00:04:07.530> is<00:04:07.949> a<00:04:07.980> must<00:04:08.400> in<00:04:08.639> the<00:04:08.819> shop<00:04:09.090> and

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
four-way tool is a must in the shop and

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.569 
four-way tool is a must in the shop and
in<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.870> mobile<00:04:10.019> toolbox<00:04:10.620> because<00:04:11.099> it<00:04:11.220> can<00:04:11.340> do

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
in the mobile toolbox because it can do

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.300 
in the mobile toolbox because it can do
so<00:04:11.879> much<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.629> like<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.109> bounce<00:04:13.319> them<00:04:13.650> when<00:04:14.190> you

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
so much and like to bounce them when you

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.789 
so much and like to bounce them when you
need<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.699> you<00:04:14.970> need<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.209> it's<00:04:16.109> like<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.289> tap<00:04:16.620> and

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
need it you need it it's like a tap and

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.460 
need it you need it it's like a tap and
die<00:04:16.889> set<00:04:17.310> for<00:04:17.549> valve<00:04:17.760> stems<00:04:18.120> but<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.870> also<00:04:19.109> has

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
die set for valve stems but it also has

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.440 
die set for valve stems but it also has
a<00:04:19.500> core<00:04:19.859> remover<00:04:20.340> on<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:20.909> as<00:04:21.299> I<00:04:21.390> said

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
a core remover on it and as I said

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.080 
a core remover on it and as I said
before<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:22.560> can<00:04:22.740> pull<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.950> snap-in<00:04:23.550> valve<00:04:23.820> into

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
before you can pull a snap-in valve into

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.620 
before you can pull a snap-in valve into
place<00:04:24.330> with<00:04:24.599> it<00:04:24.810> when<00:04:25.500> pulling<00:04:25.919> a<00:04:26.070> snap<00:04:26.340> in

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
place with it when pulling a snap in

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.540 
place with it when pulling a snap in
now<00:04:26.780> it's<00:04:27.200> important<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.800> make<00:04:27.950> sure<00:04:27.980> that<00:04:28.400> the

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
now it's important to make sure that the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.430 
now it's important to make sure that the
hole<00:04:28.760> is<00:04:28.970> clean<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.960> use<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.140> little

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
hole is clean and to use a little

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.590 
hole is clean and to use a little
lubrication<00:04:30.920> even<00:04:31.610> if<00:04:31.700> that<00:04:31.850> means<00:04:32.030> spitting

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
lubrication even if that means spitting

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.020 
lubrication even if that means spitting
on<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.810> Lube<00:04:33.200> makes<00:04:33.560> it<00:04:33.740> go<00:04:33.920> together<00:04:34.100> a<00:04:34.580> little

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
on it Lube makes it go together a little

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.360 
on it Lube makes it go together a little
easier<00:04:35.510> but<00:04:36.020> it<00:04:36.140> also<00:04:36.290> protects<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.040> stem

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
easier but it also protects the stem

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.400 
easier but it also protects the stem
from<00:04:37.760> abrasion<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.690> can<00:04:38.840> result<00:04:39.110> in<00:04:39.290> the

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
from abrasion that can result in the

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.610 
from abrasion that can result in the
leak<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:40.310> remove<00:04:40.670> a<00:04:40.820> snap-in<00:04:41.180> valve<00:04:41.690> just<00:04:42.410> cut

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
leak to remove a snap-in valve just cut

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.340 
leak to remove a snap-in valve just cut
it<00:04:42.740> off<00:04:42.920> or<00:04:43.190> chisel<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.640> off<00:04:43.820> at<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.090> base

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
it off or chisel it off at the base

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:53.980 
it off or chisel it off at the base
thanks<00:04:45.350> for<00:04:45.500> watching
