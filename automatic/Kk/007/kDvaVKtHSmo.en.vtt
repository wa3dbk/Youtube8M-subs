00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello everyone is rented for new 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.550
 video so today this video so 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.509
 this is the fourth of the resolved to wade 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.500
 of solving the Chinese puzzle 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.630
 so I present you a case this is 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.160
 little noah who is very hard to solve 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.810
 is also who is very hard at making a 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.119
 video on since it's the fifth 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.410
 once I start again 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.109
 so this time I hope it's the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.439
 good otherwise I think I'm going 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.079
 quit my youtube channel 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.920
 so there you have a puzzle that is 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.290
 formed of official wood and metal 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.510
 so here this puzzle you have to you 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.300
 arm with patience and also compass 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.579
 since we are going to look for the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.219
 here in the hole here a sky girl 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.690
 we have to bring back surrounded finally it's going 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.660
 it will be complicated and so we all go 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.989
 explained in slow motion and also use the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.790
 fight then we will take the big 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.930
 loop so the big loop this is the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.750
 loop that goes from the base to nothing of the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.840
 everything and the little loop that's what they 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.610
 go from two little rings to nothing 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.439
 just as connected is actually the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.790
 big loop so the big loop 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.490
 logically is connected to the small 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.630
 also the big loop we will take it 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.020
 and we will surround the ball with 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.360
 name it after we'll take the little 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.250
 loop we'll put it right you 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.220
 you say that it's not important if 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.710
 it's very important because it's even 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.110
 essential this is the most important of the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.790
 resolution we will return from castles 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.619
 noke the little loop ends up at 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.270
 left while keeping left we're going 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.820
 take the big loop that is down 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.360
 and we're going to pass it then that's where 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.840
 the fight will become useful 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.250
 we will pass it in the margin of 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.650
 the ring here so between the bar here and 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.229
 there our 16 or a little 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:13.160
 just for you here on the space you 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.890
 see then there you will take your 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.420
 piece of string and so you go 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.420
 still the little girl heaven on the left 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.370
 and there she has to go through 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.560
 the ring so here I have a lot of 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.740
 luck not only did I win at poker 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:39.500
 this morning but in addition I had tears 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:44.930
 the string so the big strings without 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:48.230
 compass for after so we go we go 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.330
 to return the ball in fact like that and there 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:56.150
 magically we will shoot the ring 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.710
 and so here we go after for the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.940
 contrary so here we will hand over the no 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.290
 hope since that's the goal 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.510
 we're going to hold the little girl this is the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.790
 left we go rahan turn and the ball on 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.520
 will iron the string in fact we do 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:19.820
 just the opposite we will iron the 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:21.770
 string in the ring and this time I 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.590
 think low year 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:29.840
 so here I am going to use my super 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.160
 fight I pick up the little scene I 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.940
 may be playing a little bit because there 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.060
 we see almost nothing flat the string 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.660
 we'll shoot a little bit on it 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:46.100
 brain teaser 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:49.209
 the little string we put it on the left 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.209
 re surrounds the ball 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:04:03.450
 and we shoot at the ring and that's it and 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.100
 our puzzle and then again here 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.870
 you if you do not have very well 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.459
 understood I agree with you 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.340
 since it took me three four 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.620
 resolutions to really understand the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.569
 mechanism of this puzzle that is pretty 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.010
 complex since the solution was not 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.350
 found right away anyway for my 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.030
 part I needed the little girl 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.140
 at still the little girl I saw the 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.130
 decipher so that's it then I'm 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.830
 I have solved 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.220
 the puzzle in video since this is the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.070
 harder 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.070
 so a little trick if your tape 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.620
 get involved if there are plenty of 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.090
 if you make mistakes everywhere if 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.120
 you worry you say I have 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.880
 to throw it is what happened to me 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.300
 you take the ball wanted to shoot 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.380
 on it and then it gets off there all 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.160
 the elements are removed then you have 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.979
 this is the sae is everything 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:04.290
 elano that is was a little climbs 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:06.120
 in four parts there you go so a 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:11.240
 at sweater on 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.240
 here we are actually after you 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.580
 you will go back to the back up the 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.470
 thing is that we must go then this 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.410
 which is important to know what when 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.080
 you put them shooting at you and he 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.970
 get off the thing is that it takes 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.440
 a little bit of elastics then me this 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.390
 that I took a little bit of 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.030
 elastic tiny Gounon which the 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.729
 goals I took a tiny bit 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:41.729
 elastics that actually allows for 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:45.960
 wedge between the bar here and between 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:48.060
 the parish hop and the mill you 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.340
 introduce it is in the same hole 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.190
 time that you introduce so suddenly 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.440
 there he tends so hears that you 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:02.910
 introduce your 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:06.100
 bach and if you are precise hop there 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:10.240
 the elastic gets stuck and so the convent 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:15.280
 to leave I forgot so I'm going 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.870
 start crying here i forgot 2 ap 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:23.410
 the two small ends the ain look 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:29.970
 but then it starts to rain are 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:35.110
 so there we do not put it back in it 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:39.850
 that we put it back so I fell on 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:42.370
 pass a ring like this 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.310
 and that's where our little end 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.170
 elastic good practices 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.560
 we will introduce it at the same time 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.560
 if we get there 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:03.520
 and normally your caste is repaired 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.730
 So that's what I have an idea 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.340
 like that I thought why not 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.730
 do that then it worked I got 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.820
 luck 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.200
 so I wanted it because there in 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.360
 a few minutes you heard more 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.430
 nothing to the video and so you go 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.310
 check out my other videos on my 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:24.160
 chain luis and I already did 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.450
 normally 12-13 video suffers too much and 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.880
 here you can go to consult 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.860
 subscribe you put a comment if 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.750
 necessary and put a green thumb that 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.960
 is always a pleasure and I tell you 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.960
 soon
