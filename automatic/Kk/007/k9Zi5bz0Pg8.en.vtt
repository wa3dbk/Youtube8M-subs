over there but we don't know what that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.920 
over there but we don't know what that
is<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.969> like<00:01:42.090> i<00:01:42.149> said<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.539> actually<00:01:42.719> see

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
is so like i said you can actually see

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.410 
is so like i said you can actually see
gameplay<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.530> him<00:01:43.859> being<00:01:44.369> able<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.939> select

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
gameplay of him being able to select

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.420 
gameplay of him being able to select
these<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.140> he<00:01:46.770> says<00:01:46.979> when<00:01:47.219> he<00:01:47.280> actually

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
these and he says when he actually

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.580 
these and he says when he actually
selects<00:01:47.969> the<00:01:48.149> dead<00:01:48.359> optionally<00:01:48.990> zombie<00:01:49.350> dlc

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
selects the dead optionally zombie dlc

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.440 
selects the dead optionally zombie dlc
option<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.609> actually<00:01:50.939> comes<00:01:51.149> up<00:01:51.329> with<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
option it actually comes up with a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.690 
option it actually comes up with a
message<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.990> scene<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.469> this<00:01:52.679> dlc<00:01:53.219> available

message of scene is this dlc available

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.209 
message of scene is this dlc available
or<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.969> actually<00:01:54.090> checks<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:55.049> see<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:55.289> this<00:01:55.679> dlc

or it actually checks to see if this dlc
is<00:01:56.340> actually<00:01:56.700> there<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.420> i<00:01:57.479> guess<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
is actually there and i guess this is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.779 
is actually there and i guess this is
actually<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> coding<00:01:58.829> up<00:01:59.039> on<00:01:59.280> screen<00:01:59.549> now

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
actually the coding up on screen now

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.459 
actually the coding up on screen now
when<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.000> actually<00:02:00.329> put<00:02:00.479> some<00:02:00.689> green<00:02:00.929> text<00:02:01.350> in

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
when is actually put some green text in

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.899 
when is actually put some green text in
there<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.740> tell<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.039> what<00:02:02.189> each<00:02:02.369> part<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
there to tell you what each part of the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.910 
there to tell you what each part of the
coding<00:02:03.299> actually<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.740> at<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
coding actually is so you can see at the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.319 
coding actually is so you can see at the
top<00:02:04.950> we've<00:02:05.189> got<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.429> travis<00:02:05.850> single-player

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
top we've got the travis single-player

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.300 
top we've got the travis single-player
dlc<00:02:06.869> like<00:02:07.049> i<00:02:07.079> said<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.740> don't<00:02:07.859> know<00:02:08.039> anything

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
dlc like i said we don't know anything

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.100 
dlc like i said we don't know anything
about<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.820> be<00:02:08.970> honest<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.960> see

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
about that to be honest but you can see

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.920 
about that to be honest but you can see
just<00:02:10.289> under<00:02:10.740> that<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.100> says<00:02:11.130> if<00:02:11.820> single<00:02:12.540> player

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
just under that it says if single player

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.339 
just under that it says if single player
zombie<00:02:13.500> dlc<00:02:13.740> or<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.340> says<00:02:14.580> SP<00:02:15.090> zombies<00:02:15.720> which<00:02:16.170> i

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
zombie dlc or it says SP zombies which i

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.259 
zombie dlc or it says SP zombies which i
guess<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.769> single<00:02:17.280> player<00:02:17.519> zombies<00:02:18.090> so

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
guess is single player zombies so

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.940 
guess is single player zombies so
possibly<00:02:19.140> looking

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
possibly looking

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.369 
possibly looking
some<00:02:20.220> single<00:02:20.640> player<00:02:20.849> zombie<00:02:21.450> dlc<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.110> like<00:02:22.349> i

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
some single player zombie dlc and like i

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.770 
some single player zombie dlc and like i
said<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.800> my<00:02:22.830> previous<00:02:23.190> video<00:02:23.550> or<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.209> just<00:02:24.690> a

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
said in my previous video or a just a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.259 
said in my previous video or a just a
few<00:02:24.930> days<00:02:25.080> ago<00:02:25.290> actually<00:02:25.610> zombies<00:02:26.610> dlc<00:02:26.790> is

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
few days ago actually zombies dlc is

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.449 
few days ago actually zombies dlc is
definitely<00:02:27.989> possible<00:02:28.260> like<00:02:28.769> i<00:02:28.800> said<00:02:29.129> we<00:02:29.280> had

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
definitely possible like i said we had

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.100 
definitely possible like i said we had
red<00:02:29.819> dead<00:02:30.000> redemption<00:02:30.180> undead<00:02:30.690> nightmare

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
red dead redemption undead nightmare

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.350 
red dead redemption undead nightmare
another<00:02:31.860> game<00:02:32.099> from<00:02:32.310> rockstar<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:33.150> had

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
another game from rockstar and we had

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.869 
another game from rockstar and we had
zombie<00:02:33.810> dlc<00:02:34.050> for<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.890> which<00:02:35.099> was<00:02:35.310> undead

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
zombie dlc for that which was undead

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.610 
zombie dlc for that which was undead
nightmare<00:02:36.090> actually<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.140> release<00:02:37.410> I

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
nightmare actually and that release I

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.009 
nightmare actually and that release I
think<00:02:37.920> about<00:02:38.040> year<00:02:38.459> after<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.940> official<00:02:39.599> game

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
think about year after the official game

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.720 
think about year after the official game
came<00:02:40.319> out<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.650> initial<00:02:41.040> game<00:02:41.220> actually<00:02:41.400> came

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
came out the initial game actually came

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.820 
came out the initial game actually came
out<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.000> think<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.300> dlc<00:02:42.750> actual<00:02:43.019> at<00:02:43.110> least<00:02:43.290> so

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
out to think the dlc actual at least so

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.350 
out to think the dlc actual at least so
I<00:02:43.860> think<00:02:44.130> now's<00:02:44.340> about<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.700> time<00:02:44.819> maybe<00:02:45.300> when

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
I think now's about the time maybe when

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360 
I think now's about the time maybe when
the<00:02:45.540> ps4<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.140> xbox<00:02:46.440> one<00:02:46.530> version<00:02:46.980> releases

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
the ps4 and xbox one version releases

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.339 
the ps4 and xbox one version releases
that<00:02:47.549> we<00:02:47.970> could<00:02:48.209> be<00:02:48.360> getting<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:48.810> zombie<00:02:49.170> dlc

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
that we could be getting this zombie dlc

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.800 
that we could be getting this zombie dlc
and<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.890> also<00:02:50.099> thought<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.489> alien<00:02:50.970> dlc<00:02:51.209> was

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
and I also thought that alien dlc was

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.509 
and I also thought that alien dlc was
also<00:02:52.170> on<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.380> table<00:02:52.709> as<00:02:52.799> well<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.980> think<00:02:53.160> that's

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
also on the table as well I think that's

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.039 
also on the table as well I think that's
possible<00:02:53.730> because<00:02:54.330> we've<00:02:54.599> got<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:54.870> many

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
possible because we've got so many

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.900 
possible because we've got so many
zombie<00:02:55.470> Easter<00:02:55.799> eggs<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.099> alien<00:02:56.489> Easter<00:02:56.790> eggs

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
zombie Easter eggs and alien Easter eggs

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.059 
zombie Easter eggs and alien Easter eggs
in<00:02:57.030> GTA<00:02:57.480> 5<00:02:57.720> any<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> two<00:02:58.739> are<00:02:58.890> really

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
in GTA 5 any of the two are really

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.009 
in GTA 5 any of the two are really
possible<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.849> since<00:03:00.150> we've<00:03:00.329> got<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.569> coding

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
possible to since we've got this coding

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.110 
possible to since we've got this coding
and<00:03:01.200> then<00:03:01.709> we<00:03:01.860> got<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.160> load<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.579> proof<00:03:02.880> of

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and then we got a load of proof of

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.839 
and then we got a load of proof of
zombie<00:03:03.630> dlc<00:03:03.780> for<00:03:04.170> GTA<00:03:04.230> 5<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:05.040> definitely<00:03:05.549> think
