00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 healthier vision does not like sacks 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.099
 I made a garlic soup and I did not remember 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.900
 tries very bad detail no idea but I think 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.120
 that today you will love the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.799
 garlic because a very rich area and that already 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.310
 I have suffering this car to good work 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.199
 of principle garlic by or of course 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.220
 our garlic and I'm going to claim caldito de 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.230
 chicken and I'm going to let him cook 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.500
 how many minutes a little bit but the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.810
 same and I want to tell you that I have here 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.090
 already ready almost my back is reviewing the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.860
 temperature was about 135 was scored 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.410
 they are and it is important to bathe him again 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.160
 with the quince sauce we wanted and for 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.740
 course with this white wine and with no 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.030
 they know that the truth costs me delicious 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:52.239
 It's worth it that I love you because I 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.460
 like you wanted me this is a decision 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.580
 it always looks poor, it's 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.120
 When you eat eat with such is eat when 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.250
 there is to eat when it is quiet you get healthy 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.660
 how do you get so many things to know here that 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.740
 I explained I have a pan already 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.050
 previously heated and I'll start to 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.670
 fry what are you going to foresee in this 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.130
 obviously freiler have remembered little cups 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.450
 now you are going to fry cooked potatoes cubes 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 and ham 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.700
 and all this number of years 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.249
 do not manage to keep your world I'm going to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.710
 start chopping but for me this is not 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:30.659
 some ingredients that I like has 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.880
 a slight onion flavor I'm going to 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.950
 split in half the part that more 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.869
 we use should be this part because 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.000
 where the flavor is more concentrated 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.640
 green part that the white part that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.640
 you did the last serious the finest 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:54.379
 how much harassment is fine is not a soup 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.379
 of garlic has to see all the fish 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
 sorry 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.790
 I really like the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.220
 calculation because it 's very easy and it's what 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.320
 only the hand will help me and the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.530
 little fingers are going to tell you exactly 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.530
 how wide I want it if manny muñoz 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.110
 how are you doing well ayman and when I do not 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.569
 it matters a lot the size what happens is 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.180
 You will liquefy do not care much 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.769
 size then I need to have the part 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.900
 of green as I was saying is the part 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.150
 where is the really flavor of the forum 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.420
 I like this part much more when I already 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.010
 nothing more water with forum I like this 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.640
 part and white left it for the part 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.640
 mental 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.660
 I do not like it even though it has many 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.440
 properties is very good for many 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.180
 things and because nobody likes me 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.189
 place 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.129
 who does not like it if he does not like it 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:57.590
 everyone likes to hear pandemonium 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:04.010
 and as you go very, very well, I already 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:07.040
 is liking the music you think 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.930
 wonderful now let's liquefy not me 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.379
 it's too far from I want you to see anything 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.079
 plus 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.939
 see the difference as the forum decreased 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.920
 like a tiny place it was very bad 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.930
 so that's why enough is enough 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.790
 quite mom so she puts now 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.430
 let's liquefy all this to be a 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.920
 cream is going to be a cream that you do not 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:32.020
 you're going to imagine how rich I am 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.090
 I'm going to do with a paper and that makes it 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.490
 a potato cream and page Bogado 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.040
 exact pomabamba paper hear them 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.110
 I want to tell you that you are this soup and I 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.940
 I tried it once in a saying that 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.410
 going to the tavern Lion is this 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.560
 well-known chef who calls mónica 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.720
 patiño is similar is not the same but the 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.920
 flavor is very rich moved it very elegant 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.210
 sophisticated so that the truth 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.710
 I put a little bit, nothing more so that 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.010
 finish to conserve power is ready 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:03.480
 to cool and what interests me a lot 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.480
 to be mixed in the cream 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.460
 what 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.320
 being rich and how will it be 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.310
 I 'm not going to put a nap 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.060
 more for safety 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.060
 and it's going to come out 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.519
 I like it to taste 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.670
 look how pretty it became 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.350
 completely blank 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.400
 and what I want the garlic soup that 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.400
 is what is 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.169
 and when a little bit more I want it to be 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.840
 totally true in 39 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.969
