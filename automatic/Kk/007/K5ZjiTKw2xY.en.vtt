00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.460
 and what I do is with the hair like that 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.610
 dirty and such dry I apply it in all the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.550
 full hair complete spray all 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.490
 full hair - the scalp 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.260
 that I ducked my head down and 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.930
 I start to apply once I'm 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.420
 completely wet hair what 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.480
 Make a big comb comb red 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.880
 that is of big teeth better said and 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.700
 I start combing the shower and 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.160
 while I shower, I let them act on 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.120
 vinegar that makes the vinegar in the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.860
 hair 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.250
 the vinegar as it is a product has been 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.160
 to be is to open the follicles of your hair 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.170
 is going to be that I breathe all the dirt the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.570
 fat you have in itself in hair 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.300
 then it will open the pores worth 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.280
 then while you shower and such 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.129
 the time you wash your hair because 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.930
 before your hair is going to be prepared 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.629
 that will be open what are the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.220
 hair follicles then once 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.070
 that you shower everything you are going to grab 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.020
 and your hair you're going to rinse it from 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.690
 vinegar that you put before showering 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.840
 and there you will proceed to use your shampoo 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.700
 cream rinse your hair and if you usually 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.890
 use if you usually use some treatment 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.290
 for the hair you use to the last one this 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.840
 it's going to be like a base as a test 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.600
 I know about my hair because I'm not going to prepare 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.920
 that the hair is clean that opens 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.810
 what are the follicles and when do you 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.170
 wash with her I can make the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.720
 shampoo properties among more 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.130
 intensely in the hair then that 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.080
 automatically what is going to be is 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.040
 When I finish washing, I give him a 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.810
 natural shine to your hair so that 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.450
 is what I usually do and sincerely 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.610
 it turns out and as I tell you, there is no evil 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.410
 vinegar smell without the hair if 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.000
 you do much before I hope you have 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.340
 liked but have not been confused 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.380
 As I say, remember dry hair 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.780
 once a week two oily hair 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.420
 you will say to me once a week 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.580
 then as they see it as it feels they will see 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.040
 that is going to be a lot more silky I do not know if 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.780
 you see much more manageable I recommend 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.520
 who use shampoo without sulfates without 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.980
 silicone and without parabens 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.280
 will help a lot very much also 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.350
 so that her hair gets more nourished 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.290
 and that everything is not very artificial 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.060
 we put in the hair and well that's 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.250
 everything that I do sincerely is something 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.760
 very simple very easy to do very 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.350
 you have it at home and only what 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.000
 Best of all, it does not smell bad 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.880

 I love it , I told my sister 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.240
 but it keeps the hair greasy and if there 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.210
 something that has a lot of oily hair is 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.120
 that the next day and she tells me oh 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.950

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.890
