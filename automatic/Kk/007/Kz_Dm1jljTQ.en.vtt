00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello all blacksmiths alone one my channel 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.160
 digit photos in past lessons we ourselves 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.190
 virtual memory shooting this aperture 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.679
 and excerpt we remember that 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.389
 aperture shutter speed can apart 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.740
 artistic effects regulate 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.760
 the amount of light hits the matrix 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:28.109
 so we figuratively compared with water 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.670
 today we will continue this analogy with you 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.710
 we will analyze the last parameter 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.880
 exhibiting it 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.989
 matrix sensitivity 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:41.420
 take this when cutting and see 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.629
 how will the water behave with these goals 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.539
 take the usual A4 sheet 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.750
 cardboard and napkin and pro experimenting 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.520
 With our familiar already tubule 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.789
 a certain diameter aperture and on 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.809
 each of the paper drip here let's see how 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.809
 water will be absorbed 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.710
 we also do this on a napkin that 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.340
 we see that the absorption of water 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.630
 everywhere different best water soaked 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.909
 on a napkin it is clear mean so to speak 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.009
 imbibed water on plain a4 and worse 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.220
 all the water is absorbed on the cardboard 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.900
 about the same thing happens see 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.000
 that is, if the camera matrix is very 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.189
 sensitive to light then light 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.840
 quickly absorbed into this matrix as well 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.970
 it roughly happened to water on 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.680
 a napkin if the sensitivity of the matrix 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.189
 will be standard then water will be 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.710
 imbibe badly just like us 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.560
 see now going on the cardboard for 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.500
 what is it used in is that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.229
 adjusting the amount of light by shutter speed and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.690
 the diaphragm you can't infinitely 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.550
 the value will come such 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.310
 when the light can still be 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.230
 not enough and you don't have some 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.450
 external flash source or else 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.950
 anything so you can just start 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.670
 increases sensitivity 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.640
 the matrix itself but besides the amount of light 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.570
 which absorb this matrix arise 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.900
 certain 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:16.400
 noise and certain difficulties now we 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.170
 see it on the test photo here 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.390
 The first test shot was taken on 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.880
 standard sensitivity and zash and for 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.110
 100 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.670
 typical sensitivity itself 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.480
 the minimum of which is mirrored 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.090
 cameras 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.330
 if we bring this picture closer then we 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.690
 you will see that all the details in the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.420
 The pictures are drawn well, everything is clear and 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.220
 all quality now we consider 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.670
 next shot that was taken 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.730
 at night from the window we see that the lighting 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.020
 hard first night outdoors 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.810
 accordingly, there is not enough light 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.260
 artificial source of street ideal 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.360
 lamps and when approaching we will see 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.180
 such a terrible quality happened 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.260
 photographs i.e. object details 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.610
 when approaching we begin to be 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.680
 bad hail further we'll see 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.680
 test picture which is clearly for us 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.510
 shows how sensitivity 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.290
 changes in sensitivity affect 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.930
 the quality of the images obtained by such 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.790
 way you need to understand that changing 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.970
 camera sensitivity you 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.010
 worsen accordingly the quality of the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.380
 droop so sensitivity 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.750
 I recommend you always use and 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.870
 for a hundred and only in extreme cases 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.580
 start it higher 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.950
 because you have, respectively, 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.489
 the pictures you saw for example will 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.100
 quality of the snapshot itself 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.800
 all that concerns sensitivity all 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.109
 what you should know about her next 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.280
 lesson we finally 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.239
 let's reduce all three concepts this 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.420
 sensitivity 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.420
 aperture and shutter speed in concept 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.389
 exposures all subscribe to my 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.299
 channel welcome reposts of this video 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.780
 comments like everyone all bye till 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.780
