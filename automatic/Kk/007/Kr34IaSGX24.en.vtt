00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.730
 I can not wait 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.610

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.260

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.740
 Breath-hold beneath 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.740

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.100
 I'm not going to pull it out 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.230
 I don't have the above skill, I guess I have it 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.090
