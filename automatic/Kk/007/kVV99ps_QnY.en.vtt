00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
much as you would think I think the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.819 
much as you would think I think the
average<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.510> anywhere<00:00:57.780> from<00:00:57.840> sixty<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.469> eighty

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
average is anywhere from sixty to eighty

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.420 
average is anywhere from sixty to eighty
percent<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> given<00:01:00.300> day<00:01:00.500> alright<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.890> sixty

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
percent on a given day alright so sixty

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.670 
percent on a given day alright so sixty
percent<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.969> means<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.780> hit<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
percent that means you have hit the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.450 
percent that means you have hit the
Greens<00:01:05.010> 10<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.420> 18<00:01:07.290> times<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:08.220> for
