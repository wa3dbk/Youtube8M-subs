00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.730
 the television more environment 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.019
 to these samples thank you very much 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.269
 thank you very much to the people who are looking for me and 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.620
 I wonder why if you have effectively 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.570
 there was a change in the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.310
 ingredients that's precisely why I 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.590
 I think apples are not coming out 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.020
 very good but we will have here 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.430
 different tips so they can this 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.500
 solve the problem 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.720
 that's what's good when a 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.179
 company starts to go well because 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.769
 she and she are in demand 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.079
 they think that by lowering the quality of their 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.850
 ingredients goes nothing I do not know what the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.950
 week to measure I'm better I do not understand 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.210
 then they make us do more 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.890
 people who buy it not what 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 we will buy all cut by 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.120
 all such reason as to start 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.280
 fail your business then leave the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.899
 true of equal does not happen absolutely if 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.740
 earn a penny more or two we are less 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.110
 the truth 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.550
 we who really consume 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.780
 we ask them of favor to all their people 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.280
 they are manufacturers that's the big problem 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.170
 that we have remember they had 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.650
 said of the syrup to make water san 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.110
 Pedro and now it's like very sugary 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.660
 then that allows the mixture to remain 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.090
 very sugary as it is very heavy and for 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:17.010
 that runs off the apples then 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.740
 let's start are 450 milliliters of 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.229
 syrup with a kilo of miguelito you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.360
 can do half or even a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.490
 fourth quarter a room to start 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.380
 as to practice with the mass that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.740
 it's a lot of people have suffered a bit with 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.220
 this then what I want is a 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.100
 firm dough then with the ingredients 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.200
 what am I giving you with the measures 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.200
 start little by little do not throw everything out 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.450
 chop for because maybe many times 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.150
 water has a lot of water the syrup and 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.860
 then the measurements are no longer the same and 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.080
 it does us a little bit because we have to do it 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.090
 little by little he is very patient if 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.730
 it does not come out at first 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.250
 try to make it 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.890
 for that day be your apples do it 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.840
 please one day before one night before or 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.290
 even two to a week because they last 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.090
 long time health then sorry 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.030
 I finish there is no problem crisis 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.000
 well with the agro doctor new education 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.060
 very good to everyone then then see 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.870
 How is the mixture going to be very, very 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.570
 Sandy sticks to me, no, it does not 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.700
 break if you try to do with this 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.470
 an apple novak old will not be left 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.450
 will be unlike this mass 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.550
 that is yesterday 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.440
 which is a much more consistent mass 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.570
 what happened there is that the sugar better 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.550
 already broke the crystals to the best 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.440
 is a little stickier than not 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.240
 we need exact that is already as 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.870
 plasticine must have a lot 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.910
 patience ok then if they do not fit 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.910
 for something and they already have the ingredients 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.490
 there do not spend more what they can do is 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.970
 add a tablespoon of cornstarch 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.360
 corn starch or failing buy 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.370
 there are some burritos that are already used 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.120
 to line the apples and that has 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.580
 pectin 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.420
 the pectin what it does is a binder 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.150
 and allows our dough to be firm or 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.980
 what like this 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.019
 apart from the bitter taste cited I like 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.180
 let's put our dough in two 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.129
 plastics 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.519
 either with a lump mass or with a 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:27.040
 roller can put a plate on it and 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.930
 crush you can use what they 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.640
 give the imagination and what they have in 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.349
 house so that they no longer spend now 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.390
 we have exact very well saga is what 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.909
 good that you tell them because finally the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.770
 making apples with chamoy is one of the 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:44.980
 ingredients are cheap then 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.390
 it's very easy to do it at home 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.010
 especially now that children 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.280
 they are on vacation that they are almost 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.280
 I stopped 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.330
 Monday, uh, they do not see our hair anymore 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.100
 puff on the weekend 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.870
 accurate and they may also carry us 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.450
 will make better called to tell me if it is 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.950
 a lot of sugar and a lot of salt but remember 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.170
 that I am of the opinion that on Fridays 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.120
 We tell the kids to eat what they 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.270
 they want us to grow up between 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.470
 little biscuits and cough cookies and there are 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.180
 better we do not have the problems that you have 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.010
 had the children now I hope all of 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.870
 Monday to Thursday make your blogs very 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.980
 nutritious and on Friday lady the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.980
 dykes Friday you 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:29.990
 thank you very much and the joke as they could 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.939
 see it took off the mass of my plastics and 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.150
 I took off the plastic and it comes to me 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:37.550
 everything en masse there you have to start 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.759
 add a bit of cornstarch or grab 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.229
 wait a bit more for a tip when they are 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.620
 making its mass like the one we have 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:48.199
 there they can put it in I do not know 20 10 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.969
 seconds to microwave for that heat 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.639
 It also helps us crystallize the 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:54.919
 sugar because the mold with the plastic 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.810
 I helped to raise the mass that is 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.360
 doing is the most important thing we are already 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.610
 in step by step and so we do not 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.610
 we mess up and it's easier for us 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:11.000
 chamon as we have done in other 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.069
 sometimes also if they run off 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.650
 the dough is too because maybe 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.659
 they are putting a lot of them beyond 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.430
 gravity does its job exactly 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:22.710
 in their nations it is very true 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.900
 little by little add little and 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.450
 let's go mixing is like the pastry 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.520
 Easy molds that come out very slowly 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.530
 but we 're going to do it at the first and 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.780
 that is perfect because it is not going to 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.460
 power now since I have it here with my 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.760
 fingers I'm going up and I'm going 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:43.320
 accommodating it hits me if it hits me but 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.420
 it does not look good the kneading will be higher 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.700
 directly then can leave 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.070
 rest also have to take a lot 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.590
 consider the temperature of where 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.080
 we are not very wet places the 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.480
 van is very humid that area is not 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.760
 exact is very intense and can also 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.550
 vary the recipe a bit, not what and 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.689
 so let's cover and go 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.229
 finishing our apple 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:11.360
 they can leave it like this is going to go 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.610
 making shiny because the humidity then 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.129
 is doing as more shine appointment or 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.749
 caramelized the mixture exactly and what 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.759
 can do with this tender if 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:22.639
 they have an event if they asked for many 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:25.189
 apples and the mere day they deliver them 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.349
 or the day of the event already then 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:29.659
 gunpowder with the miguelito so that 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.279
 remain like that because if they do and 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.469
 after spraying they are going to see 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:35.029
 crystallized ok we have to go now 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.309
 but mine I wanted to go doing this 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.719
 I'm going to help you do this and 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:40.939
 let's go to a cut like me without before 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:42.769
 thank jovanka who has taken his 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.769
 time to come with us to these 

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:47.269
 delicious apples that by the way you 

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:49.669
 can do business as far as we can 

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:51.529
 do each one after 25 but and five but 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.029
 they get the apple cheaper because more 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:54.529
 exactly or the size of the 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:56.360
 apple can be related since already 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.219
 who shouted was and we go bank a cut 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.889
 without first telling you many more thanks 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:03.050
 the recipe was left if you want more I invite you 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:04.879
 to subscribe to the youtube channel and so 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.860
 you can have our recipe book with you 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:08.860
 virtual when you need it
