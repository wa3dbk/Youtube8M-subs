00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and they're doing great here I think we

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.189 
and they're doing great here I think we
must<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:26.099> think<00:00:26.670> 40<00:00:27.060> or<00:00:27.180> 45<00:00:27.750> airplanes

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
must have I think 40 or 45 airplanes

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.140 
must have I think 40 or 45 airplanes
there<00:00:28.380> from<00:00:28.529> different<00:00:28.650> manufacturers<00:00:29.640> yeah

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
there from different manufacturers yeah

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.999 
there from different manufacturers yeah
I<00:00:30.179> think<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.869> know<00:00:30.990> there's<00:00:31.289> always<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.800> few

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
I think you know there's always a few

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.620 
I think you know there's always a few
doing<00:00:32.309> demo<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.910> course<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
doing demo which of course is one of the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.060 
doing demo which of course is one of the
goals<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:34.020> these<00:00:34.170> things<00:00:34.410> but<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.739> counted

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
goals of these things but if you counted

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.290 
goals of these things but if you counted
them<00:00:35.160> all<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.430> it'd<00:00:35.579> probably<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:36.059> pretty

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
them all up it'd probably be pretty

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
them all up it'd probably be pretty
close<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.600> 50<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> very<00:00:37.800> credible

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
close to 50 so it's a very credible

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
close to 50 so it's a very credible
turnout<00:00:38.850> lots<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> nice<00:00:39.780> equipment<00:00:40.230> here<00:00:40.320> for

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
turnout lots of nice equipment here for

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.690 
turnout lots of nice equipment here for
people<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> see<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.190> quite<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.370> few<00:00:41.550> people

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
people to see it's quite a few people

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:58.639 
people to see it's quite a few people
that<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.000> come<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:57.350> it's<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.469> big

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that have come in to see it it's a big

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.439 
that have come in to see it it's a big
boy<00:00:58.859> airplane<00:00:59.370> isn't<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.789> look<00:00:59.910> at<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.149> look

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
boy airplane isn't it look at this look

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.020 
boy airplane isn't it look at this look
at<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.600> tires<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.379> thing<00:01:01.649> big<00:01:02.309> fat<00:01:02.760> tires

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
at the tires on this thing big fat tires

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.479 
at the tires on this thing big fat tires
you<00:01:03.300> could<00:01:03.449> probably<00:01:03.989> land<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.530> boulders

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you could probably land this on boulders

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.670 
you could probably land this on boulders
and<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.909> would<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.210> okay<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.689> certainly<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and it would be okay but certainly on a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.740 
and it would be okay but certainly on a
gravely<00:01:08.280> Creek<00:01:08.549> banner<00:01:08.850> pretty<00:01:09.330> much<00:01:09.510> any

many years ago and they've evolved the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.449 
many years ago and they've evolved the

frame<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.220> pin<00:02:14.489> that<00:02:14.670> comes<00:02:14.910> out

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
frame you can see a pin that comes out

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.490 
frame you can see a pin that comes out
when<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.480> do<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.840> way<00:02:15.959> he<00:02:16.110> was<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.319> going<00:02:16.470> to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
when you do the way he was just going to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.559 
when you do the way he was just going to
swing<00:02:16.770> back<00:02:17.010> both<00:02:17.640> sides<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.090> course<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.510> you

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
swing back both sides of course and you

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.330 
swing back both sides of course and you
can<00:02:18.599> park<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.379> a<00:02:19.440> hangar<00:02:19.739> with<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> lot<00:02:20.129> less

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
can park it in a hangar with a lot less

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.430 
can park it in a hangar with a lot less
space<00:02:20.489> taken<00:02:21.030> up<00:02:21.150> or<00:02:21.510> perhaps<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
space taken up or perhaps you the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.080 
space taken up or perhaps you the
trailer<00:02:22.800> if<00:02:22.890> that's<00:02:23.040> what<00:02:23.220> works<00:02:23.370> for<00:02:23.550> you

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.160 

well<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.239> sure<00:02:30.420> got<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.750> think<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.050> especially

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
well you sure got to think so especially

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.410 
well you sure got to think so especially
with<00:02:31.800> these<00:02:31.980> tires<00:02:32.340> on<00:02:32.610> all<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:33.000> these<00:02:33.150> things

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
with these tires on all of these things

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.119 
with these tires on all of these things
they<00:02:33.930> do<00:02:34.050> take<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.319> little<00:02:34.500> bit<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.800> technique

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
they do take a little bit of technique

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.380 
they do take a little bit of technique
because<00:02:35.370> they've<00:02:35.489> got<00:02:35.640> quite<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:35.910> bit<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.239> air

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
because they've got quite a bit of air

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.900 
because they've got quite a bit of air
movement<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:37.110> them<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.769> will<00:02:38.099> absorb<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.730> lot

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
movement to them that will absorb a lot

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.509 
movement to them that will absorb a lot
of<00:02:38.940> bounce<00:02:39.300> as<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.530> case<00:02:40.709> maybe<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.370> they

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
of bounce as is the case maybe but they

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.770 
of bounce as is the case maybe but they
do<00:02:41.580> take<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.879> little<00:02:42.090> bit<00:02:42.269> of<00:02:42.360> practice<00:02:42.510> to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
do take a little bit of practice to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.540 
do take a little bit of practice to
learn<00:02:42.989> how<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.200> use<00:02:43.410> them<00:02:43.560> they<00:02:43.830> are<00:02:43.980> available

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
learn how to use them they are available

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.520 
learn how to use them they are available
with<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.730> market

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
with a market

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.470 
with a market
looking<00:02:45.890> tire<00:02:46.100> as<00:02:46.280> well<00:02:46.459> but<00:02:46.700> if<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.120> want<00:02:47.209> to

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
looking tire as well but if you want to

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.540 
looking tire as well but if you want to
land<00:02:47.630> out<00:02:47.870> some<00:02:48.170> rough<00:02:48.410> conditions<00:02:49.010> this

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
land out some rough conditions this

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.920 
land out some rough conditions this
airplane<00:02:49.910> is<00:02:49.970> gonna<00:02:50.030> make<00:02:50.240> it<00:02:55.480> well<00:02:56.480> yeah<00:02:56.750> this

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
airplane is gonna make it well yeah this

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.410 
airplane is gonna make it well yeah this
this<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.410> an<00:02:57.830> airplane<00:02:58.220> for<00:02:58.459> an<00:02:58.670> outdoorsman

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
this is an airplane for an outdoorsman

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.150 
this is an airplane for an outdoorsman
kind<00:02:59.660> of<00:02:59.750> thing<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.080> can<00:03:00.230> take<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:00.920> anywhere

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
kind of thing you can take it anywhere

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.340 
kind of thing you can take it anywhere
but<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.850> can<00:03:02.000> also<00:03:02.150> when<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.540> get<00:03:02.720> there<00:03:02.959> you

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
but you can also when you get there you

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.290 
but you can also when you get there you
can<00:03:03.410> remove<00:03:03.770> these<00:03:04.040> seats<00:03:04.340> they<00:03:04.489> tell<00:03:04.700> us<00:03:04.850> and

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
can remove these seats they tell us and

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.059 
can remove these seats they tell us and
then<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.660> gives<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.080> large<00:03:06.709> amount<00:03:07.010> of

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
then that gives you a large amount of

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.830 
then that gives you a large amount of

down make sure it stays put while you're
flying<00:03:23.080> much<00:03:24.080> see<00:03:24.320> everywhere<00:03:24.709> in<00:03:24.830> this

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
flying much see everywhere in this

flying much see everywhere in this
airplane<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:26.269> skylight<00:03:26.780> overhead<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:27.470> you

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
airplane the skylight overhead and you

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.560 
airplane the skylight overhead and you
know<00:03:27.620> this<00:03:27.769> it's<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:27.980> big<00:03:28.250> broad<00:03:28.670> cockpit<00:03:29.360> too

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
know this it's a big broad cockpit too

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.330 
guys in fitness they're playing very
well<00:03:43.660> yeah<00:03:44.660> they<00:03:44.900> tell<00:03:45.080> us<00:03:45.230> at<00:03:45.380> any<00:03:45.650> speed<00:03:46.069> you

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
well yeah they tell us at any speed you

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.370 
well yeah they tell us at any speed you
can<00:03:46.519> pop<00:03:46.760> these<00:03:47.000> doors<00:03:47.269> often<00:03:47.660> which<00:03:47.840> for<00:03:48.290> an

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
can pop these doors often which for an

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.410 
can pop these doors often which for an
old<00:03:48.500> altra<00:03:48.830> life<00:03:48.980> pilot<00:03:49.340> like<00:03:49.459> myself<00:03:49.700> sounds

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
old altra life pilot like myself sounds

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.600 
old altra life pilot like myself sounds
like<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.570> lot<00:03:50.750> of<00:03:50.780> fun<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.079> me<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:51.500> also<00:03:52.340> you

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
like a lot of fun to me and also you

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.220 
like a lot of fun to me and also you
could<00:03:52.910> put<00:03:52.970> these<00:03:53.209> circling<00:03:53.570> on<00:03:53.750> floats<00:03:53.989> too

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
could put these circling on floats too

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.840 
could put these circling on floats too
of<00:03:54.320> course<00:03:54.560> if<00:03:54.739> you<00:03:54.860> choose<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.220> do<00:03:55.340> that<00:03:55.370> and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
of course if you choose to do that and

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.340 
of course if you choose to do that and
if<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.060> did<00:03:56.269> now<00:03:56.420> you've<00:03:56.600> got<00:03:56.720> access<00:03:56.959> out

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
if you did now you've got access out

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.110 
if you did now you've got access out
both<00:03:57.560> sides<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:58.250> can<00:03:58.370> add<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.610> door<00:03:58.760> open

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
both sides and you can add the door open

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.910 
both sides and you can add the door open
when<00:03:59.239> you<00:03:59.329> come<00:03:59.480> in<00:03:59.600> and<00:03:59.720> land<00:03:59.870> be<00:04:00.440> ready<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.799> do

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
when you come in and land be ready to do

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.319 
when you come in and land be ready to do
what<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.160> need<00:04:01.310> to<00:04:01.340> do<00:04:03.940> well<00:04:04.940> this<00:04:05.030> one's<00:04:05.239> a

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
what you need to do well this one's a

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.819 
what you need to do well this one's a
little<00:04:05.480> different<00:04:05.930> than<00:04:06.110> some<00:04:06.500> of<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.709> other

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
little different than some of the other

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.590 
little different than some of the other
ones<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.190> looks<00:04:07.400> sort<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:07.910> like<00:04:07.970> this<00:04:08.090> design

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
ones it looks sort of like this design

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.140 
ones it looks sort of like this design
it's<00:04:08.840> got<00:04:09.019> joysticks<00:04:09.980> on<00:04:10.130> both<00:04:10.310> sides<00:04:10.579> and<00:04:10.820> if

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
it's got joysticks on both sides and if

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.610 
it's got joysticks on both sides and if
you<00:04:11.209> can<00:04:11.329> see<00:04:11.510> over<00:04:11.720> my<00:04:11.780> shoulder<00:04:11.900> here<00:04:12.380> it's

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
you can see over my shoulder here it's

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.780 
you can see over my shoulder here it's
moving<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.070> mehran's<00:04:13.459> but<00:04:13.670> they're

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
moving the a mehran's but they're

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.610 
moving the a mehran's but they're
discrete<00:04:14.150> aileron<00:04:14.660> so<00:04:14.810> you've<00:04:14.959> got<00:04:15.109> separate

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
discrete aileron so you've got separate

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.560 
discrete aileron so you've got separate
flaps<00:04:15.950> which<00:04:16.549> is<00:04:16.729> a<00:04:16.760> handle<00:04:17.150> right<00:04:17.299> here<00:04:17.479> in

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
flaps which is a handle right here in

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.029 
flaps which is a handle right here in
the<00:04:17.630> stand<00:04:17.840> of<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:17.959> aircraft<00:04:18.410> with<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.650> detent

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
the stand of the aircraft with a detent

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.759 
the stand of the aircraft with a detent
button<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.579> then<00:04:20.359> just<00:04:20.989> move<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.320> flaps<00:04:21.560> up

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
button and then just move the flaps up

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.590 
button and then just move the flaps up
to<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.160> position<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:22.729> want<00:04:22.850> them<00:04:23.030> they<00:04:23.210> click

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
to the position you want them they click

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.360 
to the position you want them they click
firmly<00:04:24.140> into<00:04:24.530> place<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:24.950> you<00:04:25.010> can<00:04:25.160> probably

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
firmly into place and you can probably

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.280 
firmly into place and you can probably
hear

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.719 

well<00:04:30.290> they<00:04:30.470> tell<00:04:30.650> us<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:30.949> this<00:04:31.520> particular

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
well they tell us that this particular

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.570 
well they tell us that this particular
one<00:04:32.449> will<00:04:32.630> stall<00:04:32.930> in<00:04:33.110> about<00:04:33.320> 24<00:04:33.830> miles<00:04:34.340> an<00:04:34.460> hour

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
one will stall in about 24 miles an hour

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.090 
one will stall in about 24 miles an hour
but<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:36.080> number<00:04:36.350> they<00:04:36.470> normally<00:04:36.800> put<00:04:36.979> out

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
but the the number they normally put out

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.570 
but the the number they normally put out
is<00:04:37.220> 27<00:04:37.850> either<00:04:38.210> number<00:04:38.600> is<00:04:38.900> mighty<00:04:39.289> low<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:40.070> you

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
is 27 either number is mighty low so you

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.070 
is 27 either number is mighty low so you
could<00:04:40.729> get<00:04:40.850> this<00:04:40.970> airplane<00:04:41.210> in<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:41.780> out<00:04:41.870> of<00:04:42.020> a

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
could get this airplane in and out of a

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.360 
could get this airplane in and out of a
200-foot<00:04:42.500> strip<00:04:42.919> they<00:04:43.070> say<00:04:44.860> this<00:04:45.860> one<00:04:46.070> uses

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
200-foot strip they say this one uses

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.670 
200-foot strip they say this one uses
the<00:04:46.460> Rotax<00:04:46.820> 912<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.690> hundred<00:04:48.320> horsepower

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
the Rotax 912 a hundred horsepower

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.370 
the Rotax 912 a hundred horsepower
engine<00:04:49.009> in<00:04:49.160> it<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.720> combined<00:04:50.720> with<00:04:51.050> a<00:04:51.080> high

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
engine in it and combined with a high

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.529 
engine in it and combined with a high
lift<00:04:51.620> airfoil<00:04:52.160> you<00:04:52.370> can<00:04:52.520> see<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.940> curvature

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
lift airfoil you can see the curvature

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.450 
lift airfoil you can see the curvature
to<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:53.990> lower<00:04:54.320> side<00:04:54.770> of<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.919> surface<00:04:55.160> here

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
to the lower side of the surface here

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.189 
to the lower side of the surface here
it's<00:04:55.580> got<00:04:55.699> what's<00:04:56.060> called<00:04:56.210> under<00:04:56.660> camber

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
it's got what's called under camber

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.480 
it's got what's called under camber
meaning<00:04:57.860> that<00:04:57.979> it's<00:04:58.100> going<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.340> work<00:04:58.460> really

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
meaning that it's going to work really

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.400 
meaning that it's going to work really
well<00:04:59.090> at<00:04:59.240> low<00:04:59.419> speeds<00:04:59.780> and<00:04:59.990> that's<00:05:00.110> what<00:05:00.229> gives

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
well at low speeds and that's what gives

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.980 
well at low speeds and that's what gives
that<00:05:00.500> low-speed<00:05:01.220> stall<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.419> it<00:05:02.510> but<00:05:02.660> it's<00:05:02.810> also

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
that low-speed stall to it but it's also

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.920 
that low-speed stall to it but it's also
what<00:05:03.380> allows<00:05:03.650> it<00:05:03.680> to<00:05:03.889> fly<00:05:04.160> off<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:04.610> very

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
what allows it to fly off of a very

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.240 
what allows it to fly off of a very
unimproved<00:05:05.930> strip<00:05:06.320> with<00:05:06.500> these<00:05:06.650> giant<00:05:07.039> tires

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
unimproved strip with these giant tires

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.279 
unimproved strip with these giant tires
but<00:05:07.550> also<00:05:07.729> a<00:05:07.850> very<00:05:08.060> short<00:05:08.419> one<00:05:08.570> even<00:05:09.139> with

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
but also a very short one even with

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.719 
but also a very short one even with
conventional<00:05:09.770> tires<00:05:12.310> well<00:05:13.310> this<00:05:13.460> is<00:05:13.610> not

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
conventional tires well this is not

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:14.950 
conventional tires well this is not
going<00:05:13.880> to<00:05:13.940> be<00:05:14.060> one<00:05:14.180> of<00:05:14.300> your<00:05:14.419> faster<00:05:14.810> airplanes

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
going to be one of your faster airplanes

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.600 
going to be one of your faster airplanes
but<00:05:15.289> it'll<00:05:15.500> cruise<00:05:15.710> all<00:05:15.889> day<00:05:15.919> long<00:05:16.250> at<00:05:16.400> about<00:05:16.580> a

but it'll cruise all day long at about a

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.450 
but it'll cruise all day long at about a
hundred<00:05:16.729> miles<00:05:17.030> an<00:05:17.180> hour<00:05:20.620> just<00:05:21.620> really<00:05:22.250> shoots

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
hundred miles an hour just really shoots

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.890

bit again the shape of that wing the
construction<00:05:26.360> of<00:05:26.479> it<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:26.840> what<00:05:27.740> this

construction of it and what this

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.620 
construction of it and what this
airplane<00:05:28.340> was<00:05:28.520> designed<00:05:28.550> for<00:05:29.150> in<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.419> first

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
airplane was designed for in the first

place<00:05:29.840> would<00:05:29.990> be<00:05:30.080> that<00:05:30.349> kind<00:05:30.590> of<00:05:30.740> get<00:05:31.280> up<00:05:31.400> and

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
place would be that kind of get up and

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.310 
place would be that kind of get up and
out<00:05:31.699> of<00:05:31.849> a<00:05:31.910> short<00:05:32.150> strip<00:05:32.510> maybe<00:05:32.930> when<00:05:33.169> you're

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
out of a short strip maybe when you're

there's an interesting thing I don't
know<00:05:43.580> if<00:05:43.669> your<00:05:43.789> camera<00:05:44.000> will<00:05:44.449> show<00:05:44.720> it<00:05:44.870> to<00:05:45.080> well

but if you look over my hint here into

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.360 
but if you look over my hint here into
the<00:05:47.840> wing<00:05:48.110> root<00:05:48.440> there's<00:05:48.889> a<00:05:49.010> piece<00:05:49.190> of

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
the wing root there's a piece of

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.640 
the wing root there's a piece of
fiberglass<00:05:49.849> up<00:05:50.360> here<00:05:50.659> that<00:05:51.020> is<00:05:51.139> somewhat

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
fiberglass up here that is somewhat

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.649 
fiberglass up here that is somewhat
clear<00:05:52.220> and<00:05:52.490> they<00:05:52.940> said<00:05:53.180> you<00:05:53.300> know<00:05:53.389> if<00:05:53.449> you<00:05:53.539> kind

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
clear and they said you know if you kind

clear and they said you know if you kind
of<00:05:53.780> shake<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.199> wings<00:05:54.409> I<00:05:54.560> don't<00:05:54.710> know<00:05:54.800> if

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
of shake the wings I don't know if

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.439 
of shake the wings I don't know if
that's<00:05:55.039> showing<00:05:55.400> or<00:05:55.490> not<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.789> may<00:05:55.909> not<00:05:56.180> because

features on that side I can see very

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.270 
features on that side I can see very
easily<00:06:02.630> how<00:06:02.960> much<00:06:03.199> fuel<00:06:03.800> there<00:06:04.010> is<00:06:04.099> in<00:06:04.190> that

a South African brand it has one of the

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.870 
a South African brand it has one of the
nicer<00:06:13.320> displays<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:14.100> I've<00:06:14.220> seen<00:06:14.460> but<00:06:14.700> one<00:06:14.850> of

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
nicer displays that I've seen but one of

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.520 
nicer displays that I've seen but one of
the<00:06:15.030> things<00:06:15.180> I<00:06:15.270> particularly<00:06:15.690> like<00:06:16.080> about<00:06:16.380> it

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
the things I particularly like about it

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.080 
the things I particularly like about it
is<00:06:16.710> instead<00:06:17.250> of<00:06:17.310> having<00:06:17.400> a<00:06:17.700> whole<00:06:17.820> row<00:06:18.030> of

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
is instead of having a whole row of

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.310 
is instead of having a whole row of
black<00:06:18.360> buttons<00:06:18.780> that<00:06:18.870> you<00:06:18.960> don't<00:06:19.110> know<00:06:19.200> what

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
black buttons that you don't know what

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.690 
black buttons that you don't know what
they're<00:06:19.470> for<00:06:19.500> these<00:06:20.190> are<00:06:20.310> all<00:06:20.400> nicely

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
they're for these are all nicely

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.820 
they're for these are all nicely
identified<00:06:21.480> and<00:06:21.750> it's<00:06:21.870> black<00:06:22.140> on<00:06:22.380> white<00:06:22.590> so

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
identified and it's black on white so

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.530 
identified and it's black on white so
you<00:06:22.890> can<00:06:23.100> see<00:06:23.370> it<00:06:23.490> in<00:06:23.610> a<00:06:23.700> low-light<00:06:24.060> condition

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
you can see it in a low-light condition

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.610 
you can see it in a low-light condition
of<00:06:25.140> course<00:06:25.320> they<00:06:25.500> use<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:25.770> GPS<00:06:26.540> 295<00:06:27.540> in<00:06:28.470> this

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
of course they use the GPS 295 in this

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.960 
of course they use the GPS 295 in this
particular<00:06:28.920> airplane<00:06:29.370> and<00:06:29.670> they<00:06:29.730> probably

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
particular airplane and they probably

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.610 
particular airplane and they probably
have<00:06:30.240> a<00:06:30.270> number<00:06:30.720> of<00:06:30.870> other<00:06:31.020> choices<00:06:31.470> they<00:06:31.590> can

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
with a friction lock on it so pretty

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.420 
with a friction lock on it so pretty
easy<00:06:35.790> for<00:06:36.060> both<00:06:36.180> occupants<00:06:36.690> to<00:06:37.310> control<00:06:38.310> the

in it but a lot of times they have a
little<00:06:44.160> thinner<00:06:44.400> cushion<00:06:44.910> and<00:06:45.270> then<00:06:45.420> what

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
little thinner cushion and then what

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.270 
little thinner cushion and then what
they<00:06:45.720> do<00:06:45.780> is<00:06:45.990> they<00:06:46.080> just<00:06:46.230> take<00:06:46.410> this<00:06:46.620> this<00:06:47.040> push

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
they do is they just take this this push

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.370 
they do is they just take this this push
it<00:06:47.400> out<00:06:47.550> and<00:06:47.820> you<00:06:48.120> can<00:06:48.270> lay<00:06:48.510> this<00:06:48.720> down<00:06:48.780> and<00:06:48.990> if

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
it out and you can lay this down and if

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.690 
it out and you can lay this down and if
this<00:06:49.470> is<00:06:49.650> a<00:06:49.680> thinner<00:06:50.010> cushion<00:06:50.370> it<00:06:50.520> wouldn't

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
this is a thinner cushion it wouldn't

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.880 
this is a thinner cushion it wouldn't
make<00:06:50.760> an<00:06:50.910> almost<00:06:51.240> flat<00:06:51.450> surface<00:06:51.900> back<00:06:52.080> here<00:06:52.410> so

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
make an almost flat surface back here so

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.110 
make an almost flat surface back here so
a<00:06:52.950> little<00:06:53.190> bit<00:06:53.280> of<00:06:53.370> foam<00:06:53.550> in<00:06:53.760> there<00:06:53.940> and<00:06:54.060> you

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
a little bit of foam in there and you

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.220 
a little bit of foam in there and you
can<00:06:54.270> spend<00:06:54.510> the<00:06:54.540> night<00:06:54.690> in<00:06:54.810> this<00:06:54.930> airplane

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
can spend the night in this airplane

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.260 
can spend the night in this airplane
pretty<00:06:55.500> easily<00:06:55.710> but<00:06:56.460> when<00:06:56.580> you're<00:06:56.730> back<00:06:56.910> in<00:06:56.940> it

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
pretty easily but when you're back in it

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.430 
pretty easily but when you're back in it
you're<00:06:57.420> getting<00:06:57.630> ready<00:06:57.750> to<00:06:57.840> go<00:06:57.960> flying

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
you're getting ready to go flying

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.560 
you're getting ready to go flying
this<00:06:58.980> seems<00:06:59.280> adjust<00:06:59.730> pretty<00:06:59.940> easily<00:07:00.180> so<00:07:00.360> you

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
this seems adjust pretty easily so you

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.120 
this seems adjust pretty easily so you
could<00:07:00.750> do<00:07:00.840> it<00:07:00.870> in<00:07:01.050> flight<00:07:01.230> a<00:07:01.470> little<00:07:01.890> pin<00:07:02.100> here

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
could do it in flight a little pin here

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.680 
could do it in flight a little pin here
in<00:07:02.370> front<00:07:02.550> again<00:07:02.610> and<00:07:03.120> look<00:07:03.330> at<00:07:03.450> all<00:07:03.540> that

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
in front again and look at all that

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.150 
in front again and look at all that
range<00:07:03.990> here<00:07:04.230> I<00:07:04.350> mean<00:07:04.500> you<00:07:04.590> could<00:07:04.740> be<00:07:04.860> a<00:07:04.890> pretty

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
range here I mean you could be a pretty

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.390 
range here I mean you could be a pretty
long<00:07:05.460> fella<00:07:05.850> and<00:07:06.060> still<00:07:06.300> fit<00:07:06.510> in<00:07:06.630> here<00:07:06.840> or

lot<00:07:13.050> of<00:07:13.080> plenty<00:07:13.440> of<00:07:13.470> clearance<00:07:13.770> in<00:07:13.980> here<00:07:14.190> I'm

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370
