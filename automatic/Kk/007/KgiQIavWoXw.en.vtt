going<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.280> learn<00:00:08.490> how<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.760> create<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.389> from<00:00:10.170> v3

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
going to learn how to create a from v3

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.490 
going to learn how to create a from v3
guide<00:00:11.450> in<00:00:12.450> 3d<00:00:12.719> studio<00:00:12.870> max<00:00:14.690> start<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.870> we're

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
guide in 3d studio max start it we're

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.939 
guide in 3d studio max start it we're
going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.830> use<00:00:17.570> mol<00:00:18.570> system<00:00:19.050> which<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.830> be

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
going to use mol system which can be

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.580 
going to use mol system which can be
found<00:00:20.220> under<00:00:20.520> systems<00:00:22.699> from<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> create<00:00:24.090> menu

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
found under systems from the create menu

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.099 
found under systems from the create menu
so<00:00:25.590> let's<00:00:26.039> start<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.900> this<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
so let's start with this is the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.580 
so let's start with this is the
character<00:00:28.439> we're<00:00:28.650> going<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> use<00:00:30.439> to<00:00:31.439> create

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
character we're going to use to create

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.549 
character we're going to use to create
that<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.239> played<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> ring<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:36.750> first<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.440> all

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that you played the ring so first of all

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.510 
that you played the ring so first of all
we<00:00:37.680> are<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.160> create<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:40.530> spine<00:00:41.100> bone<00:00:41.370> of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
we are going to create the spine bone of

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.790 
we are going to create the spine bone of
the<00:00:41.640> characters<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.940> go<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> create<00:00:46.020> systems

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the characters so go to create systems

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.939 
the characters so go to create systems
and<00:00:47.329> select<00:00:48.329> bone<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:51.469> first<00:00:52.469> we're<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
and select bone so first we're going to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.130 
and select bone so first we're going to
create<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:55.620> pelvis<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.570> create<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> long<00:00:57.840> bone

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
create the pelvis and create a long bone

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:07.789 
create the pelvis and create a long bone
till<00:00:58.800> head<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:04.400> make<00:01:05.400> sure<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:06.229> this<00:01:07.229> single

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
till head so make sure that this single

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.190 
till head so make sure that this single
joint<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:09.210> any<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.750> garbage

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
joint is not have any kind of garbage

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.760 
joint is not have any kind of garbage
rotation<00:01:10.890> values<00:01:11.869> if<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.350> any<00:01:13.470> kind<00:01:13.680> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
rotation values if there is any kind of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
rotation values if there is any kind of
garbage<00:01:14.130> values<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.150> make<00:01:15.750> sure

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
garbage values you have to make sure

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.640 
garbage values you have to make sure
that<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.500> Ranger<00:01:16.860> zeroed<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.600> like<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:19.470> should

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
that is Ranger zeroed out like it should

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
that is Ranger zeroed out like it should
be<00:01:19.770> either<00:01:19.920> 90<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.700> 180<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.659> 0<00:01:22.200> no<00:01:23.130> 0.5<00:01:23.909> 0.3

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
just make it 0 so to be completely

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.560 
just make it 0 so to be completely
straight<00:01:36.049> this<00:01:37.049> thing<00:01:37.439> means<00:01:37.860> 90<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.970> that's

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
straight this thing means 90 and that's

and right here I want a neck joint over
here<00:02:41.350> fine<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.370> just<00:02:43.090> now<00:02:43.750> move<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:44.800> the

here fine and just now move on to the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.300 
here fine and just now move on to the
side<00:02:45.970> view<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.510> for<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.230> jawbone<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:47.860> want<00:02:48.190> to

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
side view and for the jawbone I want to

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.750 
side view and for the jawbone I want to
create<00:02:48.520> this<00:02:49.390> will<00:02:49.570> be<00:02:49.690> double<00:02:50.170> or<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:51.580> over

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
create this will be double or it over

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.440 
create this will be double or it over
here<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:53.110> that's<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.250> this<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:57.450> spine

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
here so that's it so this is a spine

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.000 
here so that's it so this is a spine
joint<00:02:58.830> first<00:02:59.830> we'll<00:02:59.980> have<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.190> create<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:02.010> do

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
joint first we'll have to create so do

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.840 
joint first we'll have to create so do
we<00:03:03.220> find<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.700> position<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.420> joints<00:03:04.840> just

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
we find the position of the joints just

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.910 
we find the position of the joints just
you<00:03:06.850> have<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.300> switch<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.959> bone<00:03:08.320> edit<00:03:08.500> mode

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
you have to switch on the bone edit mode

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.980 
you have to switch on the bone edit mode
and<00:03:09.480> then<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:11.220> can<00:03:12.220> move<00:03:12.490> have<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.600> switch<00:03:13.780> on

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
and then you can move have to switch on

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.570 
and then you can move have to switch on
this<00:03:14.230> bone<00:03:14.470> edit<00:03:14.709> one<00:03:14.890> otherwise<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.370> not

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
so now switch off that bone edit one

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.410 
so now switch off that bone edit one
that's<00:03:35.200> very<00:03:35.500> important<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.280> that's<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:37.180> your
