00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.730 
views and opinions doing a quick video
on<00:00:09.840> my<00:00:10.260> latest<00:00:10.530> acquisition<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
on my latest acquisition and that is the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
on my latest acquisition and that is the
Sigma<00:00:14.280> 24<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.329> 70<00:00:15.780> e<00:00:16.220> XD<00:00:17.220> g<00:00:17.789> f<00:00:18.090> 2.8<00:00:19.080> lens<00:00:19.490> this<00:00:20.490> is

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
Sigma 24 to 70 e XD g f 2.8 lens this is

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.910 
Sigma 24 to 70 e XD g f 2.8 lens this is
the<00:00:21.090> slightly<00:00:21.630> older<00:00:21.810> version<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.500> think<00:00:22.529> it's

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the slightly older version I think it's

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.300 
the slightly older version I think it's
been<00:00:23.160> superseded<00:00:24.150> probably<00:00:24.509> once<00:00:24.689> or<00:00:24.900> twice

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
been superseded probably once or twice

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.499 
been superseded probably once or twice
so<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.939> has<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:28.099> autofocus<00:00:29.099> Drive<00:00:29.669> as<00:00:30.119> opposed

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
so it has the autofocus Drive as opposed

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.020 
so it has the autofocus Drive as opposed
to<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.960> built-in<00:00:31.740> motor<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.700> will<00:00:32.910> only

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
to the built-in motor so this will only

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.080 
to the built-in motor so this will only
auto<00:00:33.300> focus<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.200> things<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:35.600> d7000<00:00:36.770> the

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
auto focus on things like the d7000 the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.439 
auto focus on things like the d7000 the
d700<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:40.079> d<00:00:40.289> 300<00:00:40.789> things<00:00:41.789> like<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.300> won't

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
d700 the d 300 things like that it won't

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.750 
d700 the d 300 things like that it won't
auto<00:00:42.719> focus<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.620> anything<00:00:44.219> without<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.520> drive

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
auto focus on anything without a drive

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.849 
auto focus on anything without a drive
motor<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> D<00:00:45.600> 5100<00:00:46.379> d5000<00:00:47.870> 3100<00:00:48.870> 3000

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
motor like the D 5100 d5000 3100 3000

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.729 
motor like the D 5100 d5000 3100 3000
etc<00:00:50.840> okay<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:51.899> now<00:00:52.079> got<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.379> out<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.620> way

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
etc okay so now got that out of the way

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.150 
etc okay so now got that out of the way
will<00:00:53.730> quickly<00:00:54.059> go<00:00:54.300> over<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.660> lens<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
will quickly go over the lens it's a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.910 
will quickly go over the lens it's a
strange<00:00:56.789> lens<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.840> couple<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.350> reasons<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
strange lens for a couple of reasons and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.250 
strange lens for a couple of reasons and
I<00:00:58.980> don't<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.280> if<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.579> were<00:00:59.640> trying<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.260> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
I don't know if they were trying to be a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.860 
I don't know if they were trying to be a
little<00:01:01.859> bit<00:01:02.039> clever<00:01:02.280> or<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.120> different<00:01:03.570> or

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
little bit clever or just different or

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.500 
little bit clever or just different or
what<00:01:04.650> when<00:01:04.800> they<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.190> making<00:01:05.940> this<00:01:06.060> lens<00:01:06.300> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
what when they was making this lens the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.740 
what when they was making this lens the
first<00:01:06.720> thing<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.050> know<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.750> manual

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
first thing to know is the the manual

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.020 
first thing to know is the the manual
focus<00:01:10.170> ring<00:01:10.259> when<00:01:11.040> you're<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.610> manual

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
focus ring when you're not in manual

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.370 
focus ring when you're not in manual
focus<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.900> spins<00:01:13.229> freely<00:01:14.420> now<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.049> idea

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
focus just spins freely now the idea

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.510 
focus just spins freely now the idea
behind<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.130> when<00:01:17.280> you've<00:01:17.400> got

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
behind that is so that when you've got

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.609 
behind that is so that when you've got
your<00:01:17.640> camera<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.540> hold<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
your camera on and you can hold the the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.090 
your camera on and you can hold the the
lens<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.280> then<00:01:20.850> turn<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> camera<00:01:21.689> from<00:01:22.350> light

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
lens and then turn the camera from light

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.249 
lens and then turn the camera from light
into<00:01:23.369> portrait<00:01:23.790> mode<00:01:23.820> nice<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.720> easy

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
into portrait mode nice and easy

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.960 
into portrait mode nice and easy
which<00:01:25.860> yeah<00:01:26.189> sounds<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.670> good<00:01:26.850> idea

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
which yeah sounds like a good idea

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.490 
which yeah sounds like a good idea
that's<00:01:27.299> fine<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:27.869> then<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.229> look<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
that's fine but then if you look that

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.910 
that's fine but then if you look that
the<00:01:28.619> zoom<00:01:28.890> ring<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.729> behind<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> when

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the zoom ring is just behind it so when

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.260 
the zoom ring is just behind it so when
you're<00:01:32.009> picking<00:01:32.189> up<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> lens<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.970> fitting

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you're picking up the lens and fitting

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
you're picking up the lens and fitting
it<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.570> camera<00:01:33.930> body<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.290> things<00:01:34.829> are

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it to the camera body and things are

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
it to the camera body and things are
there<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.610> only<00:01:35.759> bit<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.060> doesn't<00:01:36.659> really

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
there the only bit that doesn't really

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.499 
there the only bit that doesn't really
rotate<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.829> center<00:01:38.340> little<00:01:39.060> portion

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
rotate is the center little portion

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.880 
rotate is the center little portion
there<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:39.899> you've<00:01:40.020> got<00:01:40.170> pretty<00:01:40.409> much<00:01:40.530> picking

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
there so you've got pretty much picking

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.499 
there so you've got pretty much picking
out<00:01:40.950> by<00:01:41.159> there<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:42.090> snap<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.110> onto<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.470> camera

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
out by there to snap it onto the camera

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.399 
out by there to snap it onto the camera
because<00:01:45.509> if<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> try<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.290> that

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
because if you try and do it with that

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.660 
because if you try and do it with that
bit<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.860> doesn't<00:01:47.310> doesn't<00:01:47.969> work<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.200> that's<00:01:49.670> in

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
bit it doesn't doesn't work so that's in

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760 
bit it doesn't doesn't work so that's in
a<00:01:50.759> way<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> good<00:01:51.270> thing<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.719> way<00:01:51.750> I'm<00:01:52.200> not

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
a way it's a good thing in a way I'm not

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.020 
a way it's a good thing in a way I'm not
so<00:01:52.890> keen<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.280> could<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.579> done<00:01:53.670> without<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
so keen I could have done without that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.230 
so keen I could have done without that
personally<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:56.369> second<00:01:56.790> weird<00:01:57.000> thing<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
personally the second weird thing to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.240 
personally the second weird thing to
know<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.560> want<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> use<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.070> in

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
know is if you want to use this in

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.420 
know is if you want to use this in
manual<00:01:59.610> focus<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.960> need<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.770> lot<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> more

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
manual focus you need a lot of more

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.730 
manual focus you need a lot of more
d7000<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.479> need<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.750> clip<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.229> into<00:02:04.380> manual

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
d7000 you need to clip it into manual

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.010 
d7000 you need to clip it into manual
focus<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.610> camera<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.840> need<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
focus on the camera and then you need to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.950 
focus on the camera and then you need to
slide<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.920> ring<00:02:08.250> back<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:09.240> that<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.750> then

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
slide this ring back like that and then

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.420 
slide this ring back like that and then
you<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> little<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.530> there<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:11.130> manual

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
you get a little in there for manual

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.580 
you get a little in there for manual
focus<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.000> as<00:02:12.210> you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.480> see<00:02:12.540> there<00:02:12.960> that's

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
focus and as you can see there that's

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.350 
focus and as you can see there that's
now<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.040> manual<00:02:14.400> focus

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.070 

the<00:02:18.710> third<00:02:19.710> weird<00:02:20.370> thing<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.850> this<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:21.870> a

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
the third weird thing and this is on a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.440 
the third weird thing and this is on a
few<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> Sigma<00:02:23.490> lenses<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:24.030> not<00:02:24.180> just

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
few of the Sigma lenses it's not just

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.080 
few of the Sigma lenses it's not just
this<00:02:24.600> one<00:02:24.870> if<00:02:25.470> you'll<00:02:25.770> notice<00:02:26.310> when<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.710> zoom

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
this one if you'll notice when you zoom

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.870 
this one if you'll notice when you zoom
the<00:02:30.090> rear<00:02:30.390> lens<00:02:31.080> element<00:02:31.620> see<00:02:32.190> I'm<00:02:32.340> struggling

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
the rear lens element see I'm struggling

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.210 
the rear lens element see I'm struggling
to<00:02:33.120> get<00:02:33.390> into<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.170> rear<00:02:34.410> lens<00:02:34.800> element

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
to get into the rear lens element

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.410 
to get into the rear lens element
actually<00:02:35.370> moves<00:02:36.290> in<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.590> out<00:02:38.270> and<00:02:39.270> that

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
actually moves in and out and that

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.630 
actually moves in and out and that
causes<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:40.020> couple<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.680> issues<00:02:40.800> one<00:02:41.190> one<00:02:41.520> is

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
causes a couple of issues one one is

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.660 
causes a couple of issues one one is
suction<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.540> sort<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.100> gives<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.370> funny

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
suction and it sort of gives it a funny

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.030 
suction and it sort of gives it a funny
fear<00:02:45.030> up<00:02:45.210> now<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.510> again<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.020> there<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
fear up now and again and there is a

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.810 
fear up now and again and there is a
possibility<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.300> sucking<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:49.670> dirt

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
possibility of it sucking in dirt

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.450 
possibility of it sucking in dirt
I<00:02:50.940> suppose<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:52.320> that's<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.620> weird<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:53.130> weird

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
I suppose so that's a weird a weird

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.700 
I suppose so that's a weird a weird
thing<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:53.970> not<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.270> 70<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.750> 200<00:02:54.900> but<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.560> on

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
thing it's not on 70 to 200 but it is on

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.380 
thing it's not on 70 to 200 but it is on
the<00:02:55.800> 18<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.220> 50<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.700> goes<00:02:56.910> where<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> was<00:02:57.270> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
the 18 to 50 that goes where I was the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.950 
the 18 to 50 that goes where I was the
sign<00:02:57.890> because<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.520> older<00:02:59.940> type<00:03:00.720> lens

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
sign because this is the older type lens

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.570 
sign because this is the older type lens
you've<00:03:01.230> got<00:03:01.440> your<00:03:01.590> aperture<00:03:01.950> control<00:03:02.370> there

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
you've got your aperture control there

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.430 
you've got your aperture control there
which<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.940> locked<00:03:03.150> down<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.750> when<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.110> put<00:03:04.350> it

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
which is locked down and when you put it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.020 
which is locked down and when you put it
on<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.650> camera<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:04.980> all<00:03:05.220> sorts<00:03:05.520> itself<00:03:05.670> out

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
on the camera that all sorts itself out

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.530 
on the camera that all sorts itself out
so<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:06.330> don't<00:03:06.420> have<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.630> worry<00:03:06.780> about<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:08.540> as

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
so you don't have to worry about that as

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.170 
so you don't have to worry about that as
I<00:03:09.630> said<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.470> zoom<00:03:10.770> when<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.880> start

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
I said that the zoom when you start

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.740 
I said that the zoom when you start
enough<00:03:12.420> zoom<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:13.050> so<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.890> say<00:03:14.430> you're<00:03:14.580> in<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.970> 24

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
enough zoom in so you say you're in a 24

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.800 
enough zoom in so you say you're in a 24
mil<00:03:15.960> it's<00:03:16.530> at<00:03:16.830> its<00:03:17.070> longest<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:18.000> then<00:03:18.660> when

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
mil it's at its longest and then when

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.930 
mil it's at its longest and then when
you<00:03:18.960> zoom<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.470> actually<00:03:19.830> pulls<00:03:20.280> itself<00:03:20.700> in

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
you zoom it actually pulls itself in

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.940 
you zoom it actually pulls itself in
which<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.420> opposite<00:03:21.720> way<00:03:21.870> around<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.830> the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
which is the opposite way around to the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.890 
which is the opposite way around to the
majority<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.460> lenses<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:23.940> I've<00:03:24.240> ever<00:03:24.750> used

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
majority of lenses that I've ever used

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.500 
majority of lenses that I've ever used
anyway<00:03:25.410> again<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.850> only<00:03:27.000> thing<00:03:27.210> I<00:03:27.270> can<00:03:27.480> think

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
anyway again the only thing I can think

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.510 
anyway again the only thing I can think
is<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:27.960> they're<00:03:28.260> trying<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.680> they're<00:03:29.010> doing

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
is that they're trying to they're doing

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.280 
is that they're trying to they're doing
something<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:30.030> reduce<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.660> size<00:03:30.870> because<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
something to reduce the size because the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.210 
something to reduce the size because the
Sigma<00:03:31.740> lenses<00:03:32.610> generally<00:03:33.120> tend<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.660> be

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
Sigma lenses generally tend to be

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.240 
Sigma lenses generally tend to be
shorter<00:03:35.220> than<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:36.240> equivalent<00:03:37.200> Nikon<00:03:37.830> lenses

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
shorter than the equivalent Nikon lenses

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.370 
shorter than the equivalent Nikon lenses
I<00:03:38.460> mean<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:39.000> 24<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.570> 70<00:03:39.900> Nichol<00:03:40.200> name

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
I mean that the 24 to 70 Nichol name

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.410 
I mean that the 24 to 70 Nichol name
stands<00:03:40.800> about<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.160> high<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:43.460> I<00:03:44.460> don't<00:03:44.880> I

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
stands about this high and I don't I

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.720 
stands about this high and I don't I
don't<00:03:45.570> really<00:03:46.020> understand<00:03:46.500> why<00:03:47.459> they're

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
don't really understand why they're

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.080 
don't really understand why they're
doing<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:48.270> but<00:03:48.570> it's<00:03:49.580> it's<00:03:50.580> quite<00:03:50.730> inert

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
doing that but it's it's quite inert

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
doing that but it's it's quite inert
even<00:03:51.690> innovative<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.680> suppose<00:03:53.100> but<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:55.050> know

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
even innovative I suppose but I you know

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.770 
even innovative I suppose but I you know
if<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.410> doesn't<00:03:55.910> if<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.060> doesn't<00:03:57.270> need<00:03:57.390> fixing

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
if it doesn't if it doesn't need fixing

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.600 
if it doesn't if it doesn't need fixing
them<00:03:58.020> why<00:03:58.470> mess<00:03:58.680> about<00:03:58.830> with<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.340> drove

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
them why mess about with it I drove

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.540 
them why mess about with it I drove
really<00:03:59.820> don't<00:04:00.060> understand<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:01.350> filter<00:04:02.340> size

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
really don't understand the filter size

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.410 
really don't understand the filter size
on<00:04:02.850> this<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:03.209> huge<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:04.200> 82<00:04:04.890> mil<00:04:05.190> but<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.180> lens

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
on this is huge is 82 mil but the lens

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.130 
on this is huge is 82 mil but the lens
itself<00:04:07.020> is<00:04:07.470> not<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.459> massive<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.810> can<00:04:09.959> see

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
itself is not that massive you can see

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.080 
itself is not that massive you can see
there<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.590> there's<00:04:11.340> quite<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.670> lot<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:11.880> dead

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
there and there's quite a lot of dead

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.790 
there and there's quite a lot of dead
space<00:04:12.330> here<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:12.780> don't<00:04:12.990> know<00:04:13.140> if<00:04:13.290> it's<00:04:13.560> the

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
space here so I don't know if it's the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.580 
space here so I don't know if it's the
the<00:04:14.250> lenses<00:04:14.700> behind<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.209> front<00:04:15.450> lens<00:04:15.660> that

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
the lenses behind the front lens that

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.460 
the lenses behind the front lens that
are<00:04:17.000> requiring<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.510> have<00:04:18.630> an<00:04:18.720> 82<00:04:19.200> mil

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
are requiring this to have an 82 mil

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.730 
are requiring this to have an 82 mil
filter<00:04:20.340> but<00:04:20.850> again<00:04:21.390> I<00:04:21.630> would<00:04:22.350> have<00:04:22.440> thought

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
filter but again I would have thought

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.980 
filter but again I would have thought
they<00:04:23.100> could<00:04:23.340> have<00:04:23.460> got<00:04:23.670> something<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.690> little

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
they could have got something a little

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.930 
they could have got something a little
bit<00:04:25.110> smaller<00:04:25.350> on<00:04:25.440> there<00:04:25.710> but<00:04:25.890> anyway<00:04:26.250> that's<00:04:26.520> a

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
bit smaller on there but anyway that's a

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.460 
bit smaller on there but anyway that's a
night<00:04:27.210> eating<00:04:27.479> meal<00:04:27.660> you<00:04:28.050> get<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.290> nihms

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
night eating meal you get the nihms

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.800 
night eating meal you get the nihms
heard<00:04:28.650> which<00:04:28.890> is<00:04:28.919> absolutely<00:04:29.580> fine

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
heard which is absolutely fine

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.830 
heard which is absolutely fine
works<00:04:31.500> no<00:04:32.220> problem<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:32.730> always<00:04:33.000> keep<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.690> lens

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840

and<00:05:54.750> other<00:05:55.530> other<00:05:55.980> mics<00:05:56.280> out<00:05:56.490> there<00:05:56.760> I<00:05:57.030> just

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
and other other mics out there I just

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.760 
and other other mics out there I just
tend<00:05:57.510> to<00:05:57.600> stick<00:05:57.840> two<00:05:57.990> Sigma's<00:05:58.380> because<00:05:58.620> it's

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
tend to stick two Sigma's because it's

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.100 
tend to stick two Sigma's because it's
what<00:05:58.919> I<00:05:58.950> know<00:05:59.210> with<00:06:00.210> all<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.480> lenses<00:06:00.840> you<00:06:00.870> get

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
what I know with all the lenses you get

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.780 
what I know with all the lenses you get
a<00:06:01.140> lovely<00:06:01.380> case<00:06:01.770> which<00:06:02.130> are<00:06:02.280> never<00:06:02.430> used<00:06:02.700> that

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
a lovely case which are never used that

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.110 
a lovely case which are never used that
just<00:06:03.060> goes<00:06:03.210> upstairs<00:06:03.510> with<00:06:03.840> the<00:06:03.930> box<00:06:04.140> and<00:06:05.120> I

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
just goes upstairs with the box and I

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.690 
just goes upstairs with the box and I
suppose<00:06:07.020> you<00:06:07.169> could<00:06:07.380> use<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:07.770> cases<00:06:08.190> but<00:06:08.430> if

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
suppose you could use the cases but if

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.490 
suppose you could use the cases but if
you've<00:06:08.970> got<00:06:09.180> big<00:06:09.330> enough<00:06:09.450> bag<00:06:09.780> but<00:06:10.020> they<00:06:10.140> go<00:06:10.320> in

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
you've got big enough bag but they go in

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.290 
you've got big enough bag but they go in
but<00:06:10.860> I<00:06:10.890> don't<00:06:11.220> use<00:06:11.370> any<00:06:11.520> of<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:11.669> cases<00:06:12.120> they

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
but I don't use any of the cases they

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.510 
but I don't use any of the cases they
just<00:06:12.510> go<00:06:12.690> nicely<00:06:13.050> in<00:06:13.320> the<00:06:13.410> bag<00:06:13.590> anyway<00:06:14.340> that's

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
just go nicely in the bag anyway that's

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.490 
just go nicely in the bag anyway that's
the<00:06:14.669> Sigma<00:06:15.030> 24<00:06:15.810> to<00:06:15.990> 70<00:06:16.380> x<00:06:16.770> DG<00:06:17.450> 2.8<00:06:18.450> lens<00:06:18.630> and<00:06:19.169> how

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
the Sigma 24 to 70 x DG 2.8 lens and how

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:28.890 
the Sigma 24 to 70 x DG 2.8 lens and how
this<00:06:19.620> helps<00:06:19.800> Cheers<00:06:20.310> Bible
