00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.569 

I<00:01:07.049> definitely<00:01:07.770> think<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.130> college<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
I definitely think that college is a

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.609 
I definitely think that college is a
great<00:01:08.670> experience<00:01:09.329> no<00:01:09.689> matter<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.259> lot<00:01:10.590> of

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
great experience no matter what a lot of

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.020 
great experience no matter what a lot of
people<00:01:10.740> think<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.189> College<00:01:11.399> might<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.880> be

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
people think that College might not be

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.359 
people think that College might not be
for<00:01:12.240> them<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> think<00:01:13.200> at<00:01:13.320> plu<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.159> find

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
for them but I think at plu you can find

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.550 
for them but I think at plu you can find
a<00:01:14.460> way<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.610> make<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.909> fit<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.439> there's<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.500> lot

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
a way to make it fit you there's a lot

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.170 
a way to make it fit you there's a lot
of<00:01:16.710> programs<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> there's<00:01:17.490> something<00:01:17.939> for

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
of programs and there's something for

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.420 
of programs and there's something for
everyone<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> mean<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.619> really<00:01:20.220> didn't

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
everyone to do I mean I really didn't

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.679 
everyone to do I mean I really didn't
think<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.729> was<00:01:20.850> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> plan<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.420> getting

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
think I was going to plan on getting

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.149 
think I was going to plan on getting
involved<00:01:21.899> in<00:01:22.170> much<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.619> wanted<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> get<00:01:23.009> my
