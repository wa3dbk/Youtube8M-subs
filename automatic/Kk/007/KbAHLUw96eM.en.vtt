00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.400 
is going to come with a kv rating as you
can<00:00:15.210> see<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:15.750> right<00:00:15.900> here<00:00:16.139> you've

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
can see on this one right here you've

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.359 
can see on this one right here you've
got<00:00:16.590> 4000<00:00:17.340> rpm<00:00:18.029> per<00:00:18.660> volt<00:00:19.140> what<00:00:20.010> that's<00:00:20.189> going

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
got 4000 rpm per volt what that's going

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.420 
got 4000 rpm per volt what that's going
to<00:00:20.430> equate<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> if<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.359> pair<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.810> up<00:00:21.869> with

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
to equate to if we pair this up with

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.740 
to equate to if we pair this up with
this<00:00:23.430> 3<00:00:24.119> s<00:00:24.300> 800<00:00:25.170> milli<00:00:25.380> amp<00:00:25.590> Gent<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.070> battery

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.759 
this 3 s 800 milli amp Gent a battery
basically<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.990> got<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> take

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
basically what you got to do is you take

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.400 
basically what you got to do is you take
4000<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.640> multiply<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.210> by<00:00:30.359> 11<00:00:30.990> point<00:00:31.199> one

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
4000 and multiply it by 11 point one

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.979 
4000 and multiply it by 11 point one
which<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> pack<00:00:32.309> voltage<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.719> really

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
which is the pack voltage it's a really

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.400 
which is the pack voltage it's a really
simple<00:00:34.290> equation<00:00:35.840> if<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.989> remember<00:00:37.230> back<00:00:37.350> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
simple equation if you remember back to

you<00:00:42.600> will<00:00:42.719> take<00:00:42.960> your<00:00:43.500> main<00:00:44.129> gear<00:00:44.489> divide<00:00:45.390> it

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
you will take your main gear divide it

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.830 
you will take your main gear divide it
by<00:00:45.780> your<00:00:45.809> pinion<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.030> then<00:00:48.030> you'll<00:00:48.180> take<00:00:48.360> your

by your pinion and then you'll take your

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.700 
by your pinion and then you'll take your
motor<00:00:49.710> kV<00:00:50.219> which<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.610> 4000<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.420> case

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
motor kV which is 4000 in this case

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.310 
motor kV which is 4000 in this case
multiply<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.770> by<00:00:53.010> 11<00:00:53.129> point<00:00:53.640> 1<00:00:54.110> divided<00:00:55.110> those

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
multiply it by 11 point 1 divided those

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.209 
multiply it by 11 point 1 divided those
two<00:00:55.590> numbers<00:00:55.800> divide<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:57.180> kV<00:00:58.170> number<00:00:58.590> with

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
two numbers divide your kV number with

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.689 
two numbers divide your kV number with
your<00:00:59.780> gear<00:01:00.780> ratio<00:01:01.170> number<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.800> then<00:01:02.520> you'll

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
your gear ratio number and then you'll

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.670 
your gear ratio number and then you'll
multiply<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.449> by<00:01:03.780> 0.8<00:01:04.260> which<00:01:04.500> we're

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
multiply all that by 0.8 which we're

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.550 
multiply all that by 0.8 which we're

own different little heads to me they

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.640 
own different little heads to me they
want<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> run<00:01:22.920> at<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:24.259> 23-17<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.619> your

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
want to run at if 23-17 is right in your

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.350 
want to run at if 23-17 is right in your
ballpark<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.610> got<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.210> need<00:01:27.330> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
ballpark then you got it if you need to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
ballpark then you got it if you need to
go<00:01:27.540> higher<00:01:27.810> then<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> need<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> go<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.920> one

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
go higher then you need to go up one

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.280 
go higher then you need to go up one
tooth<00:01:29.549> or<00:01:29.790> your<00:01:29.939> pinion<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.020> need<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> go

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
tooth or your pinion if you need to go

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
tooth or your pinion if you need to go
lower<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> need<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> go<00:01:32.280> down<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.820> tooth

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
lower then you need to go down one tooth

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.039 
lower then you need to go down one tooth
on<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:33.329> opinion<00:01:34.909> so<00:01:35.909> guys<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.329> hope<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.780> kind

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
on your opinion so guys I hope that kind

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
on your opinion so guys I hope that kind
of<00:01:37.110> helps<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.439> understand<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.670> really

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
of helps you understand it it's really

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.510 
of helps you understand it it's really
really<00:01:39.180> simple<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.750> lot<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.020> people<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:41.040> they

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
really simple a lot of people just they

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.260 
really simple a lot of people just they
don't<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> concept<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:43.680> take

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
don't know the concept of it just take

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.260 
don't know the concept of it just take
4,000<00:01:45.270> times<00:01:46.100> 11.1<00:01:47.130> which<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:47.939> battery

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
4,000 times 11.1 which is your battery

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.359 
4,000 times 11.1 which is your battery
if<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.540> run<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.079> two<00:01:49.140> cell<00:01:49.530> you'll<00:01:49.770> supply<00:01:50.250> it

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
if you run a two cell you'll supply it

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.200 
if you run a two cell you'll supply it
by<00:01:50.750> 7.2<00:01:51.750> or<00:01:52.530> 7.4<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:55.700> then<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:56.969> figure

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
by 7.2 or 7.4 and then you just figure

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.399 
by 7.2 or 7.4 and then you just figure
out<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.420> head<00:01:57.570> speed<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> simple

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
out your head speed with a simple

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.830 
out your head speed with a simple
equation<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:59.189> is<00:02:00.180> also<00:02:00.479> down<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
equation that is also down in the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.350 
equation that is also down in the
description<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.469> video<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.700> guys<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.149> hope

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
description of this video so guys I hope

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.209 
description of this video so guys I hope
that<00:02:03.540> helps<00:02:03.750> kind<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.960> explain<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.469> nice

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that helps kind of explain it nice

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.819 
that helps kind of explain it nice
little<00:02:05.490> short<00:02:05.670> video<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.200> will<00:02:07.409> see<00:02:07.680> you

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
little short video and we will see you

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.039 
little short video and we will see you
guys<00:02:07.979> later
