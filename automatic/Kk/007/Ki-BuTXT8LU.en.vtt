I'm so offers some great level

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.550 
I'm so offers some great level
protection<00:00:16.030> as<00:00:16.150> well<00:00:16.360> as<00:00:16.420> excellent<00:00:17.080> fit<00:00:17.410> and

mobility to it

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.700 
mobility to it
warriors<00:00:19.390> actually<00:00:19.779> used<00:00:20.110> a<00:00:20.260> new<00:00:20.470> type<00:00:20.680> of

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
warriors actually used a new type of

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.560 
warriors actually used a new type of
foam<00:00:21.010> on<00:00:21.160> this<00:00:21.340> guy<00:00:21.520> it's<00:00:22.000> called<00:00:22.240> the<00:00:22.330> zut

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
foam on this guy it's called the zut

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.320 
foam on this guy it's called the zut
foam<00:00:22.870> this<00:00:23.590> foam<00:00:23.800> offers<00:00:24.250> a<00:00:24.280> great<00:00:24.820> impact

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
foam this foam offers a great impact

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.260 
foam this foam offers a great impact
impact<00:00:26.080> absorption<00:00:26.650> as<00:00:27.010> well<00:00:27.670> as<00:00:27.970> being

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
impact absorption as well as being

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.630 
impact absorption as well as being
lightweight<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.110> flexible<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:30.400> is<00:00:30.460> a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
lightweight and flexible this is a

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.690 
lightweight and flexible this is a
tightly<00:00:31.300> blown<00:00:31.840> foam<00:00:32.200> as<00:00:32.410> well<00:00:32.469> is<00:00:33.309> it's<00:00:33.579> not

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
tightly blown foam as well is it's not

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.939 
tightly blown foam as well is it's not
fully<00:00:34.030> a<00:00:34.120> closed<00:00:34.510> cell<00:00:34.809> so<00:00:35.500> it's<00:00:35.649> kind<00:00:35.829> of<00:00:35.860> in

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
fully a closed cell so it's kind of in

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:36.810 
fully a closed cell so it's kind of in
between<00:00:35.980> so<00:00:36.339> you're<00:00:36.429> gonna<00:00:36.519> get<00:00:36.699> the

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
between so you're gonna get the

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.910 
between so you're gonna get the
protection<00:00:37.300> of<00:00:37.539> a<00:00:37.629> high<00:00:37.809> density<00:00:38.019> foam<00:00:38.440> but

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
protection of a high density foam but

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.349 
protection of a high density foam but
then<00:00:39.010> you're<00:00:39.129> gonna<00:00:39.190> have<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.699> flexible<00:00:40.239> and

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
then you're gonna have the flexible and

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.329 
then you're gonna have the flexible and
move<00:00:40.510> ability<00:00:40.989> of<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.440> softer<00:00:41.890> foam<00:00:42.069> so<00:00:42.219> that's

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
move ability of a softer foam so that's

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:43.799 
move ability of a softer foam so that's
really<00:00:42.550> a<00:00:42.579> great<00:00:42.819> thing<00:00:42.940> to<00:00:43.239> see<00:00:43.390> on<00:00:43.480> this<00:00:43.569> pad

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
really a great thing to see on this pad

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.540 
really a great thing to see on this pad
they've<00:00:44.559> done<00:00:44.769> a<00:00:44.800> couple<00:00:45.069> different<00:00:45.519> things

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
they've done a couple different things

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.669 
they've done a couple different things
as<00:00:45.909> far<00:00:45.940> as<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.210> sternum<00:00:46.600> protection<00:00:47.109> one

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
as far as the sternum protection one

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.290 
as far as the sternum protection one
thing<00:00:47.829> that<00:00:47.949> I<00:00:48.010> like<00:00:48.249> is<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.519> it's<00:00:48.819> not<00:00:48.969> have

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
thing that I like is that it's not have

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.079 
thing that I like is that it's not have
a<00:00:49.329> super<00:00:49.690> wide<00:00:50.440> fit<00:00:50.890> on<00:00:51.010> that<00:00:51.219> so<00:00:51.789> it<00:00:51.850> gives<00:00:51.909> you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
a super wide fit on that so it gives you

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.669 
a super wide fit on that so it gives you
some<00:00:52.120> good<00:00:52.420> mobility<00:00:52.690> doesn't<00:00:53.289> kind<00:00:53.469> of<00:00:53.530> wrap

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
some good mobility doesn't kind of wrap

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.439 
some good mobility doesn't kind of wrap
all<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:53.979> way<00:00:54.010> across<00:00:54.249> which<00:00:54.940> I<00:00:55.059> particularly

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
all the way across which I particularly

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.329 
all the way across which I particularly
like<00:00:55.749> in<00:00:55.899> a<00:00:55.960> shoulder<00:00:56.229> pad<00:00:56.409> you<00:00:57.069> can<00:00:57.159> really

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
like in a shoulder pad you can really

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.129 
like in a shoulder pad you can really
feel<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:57.639> foams<00:00:57.909> and<00:00:58.179> the<00:00:58.269> side<00:00:58.449> portions<00:00:58.929> as

00:00:59.129 --> 00:00:59.139 
feel the foams and the side portions as

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:01.229 
feel the foams and the side portions as
well<00:00:59.379> as<00:00:59.469> some<00:00:59.679> real<00:00:59.859> dense<00:01:00.159> foams<00:01:00.519> in<00:01:00.789> it<00:01:00.909> it

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
well as some real dense foams in it it

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.969 
well as some real dense foams in it it
does<00:01:01.449> have<00:01:01.479> that<00:01:01.839> bone<00:01:02.079> system<00:01:02.620> on<00:01:02.769> it<00:01:02.859> that

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
does have that bone system on it that

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.799 
does have that bone system on it that
you<00:01:03.069> possibly<00:01:03.909> have<00:01:03.999> seen<00:01:04.150> on<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:04.390> eraser

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
you possibly have seen on the eraser

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.570 
you possibly have seen on the eraser
glove<00:01:05.049> I'm<00:01:05.290> so<00:01:05.650> that's<00:01:05.770> going<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:05.950> offer<00:01:06.010> as<00:01:06.430> I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
glove I'm so that's going to offer as I

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.730 
glove I'm so that's going to offer as I
said<00:01:06.760> great<00:01:07.000> mobility<00:01:07.930> as<00:01:08.320> well<00:01:08.620> as

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
said great mobility as well as

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.650 
said great mobility as well as
protection<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.850> can<00:01:09.910> see<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.330> Center

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
protection you can see that Center

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.060 
protection you can see that Center
sternum<00:01:10.960> piece<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.260> attached<00:01:11.620> by<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.830> light

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
sternum piece is attached by a light

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.890 
sternum piece is attached by a light
elastic<00:01:12.850> which<00:01:13.030> is<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.180> nice<00:01:13.390> feature<00:01:13.630> so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
elastic which is a nice feature so

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.840 
elastic which is a nice feature so
that's<00:01:14.380> gonna<00:01:14.590> increase<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.190> mobility<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.640> it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
that's gonna increase the mobility of it

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.000 
that's gonna increase the mobility of it
as<00:01:15.970> well<00:01:16.480> as<00:01:16.570> you<00:01:16.600> have<00:01:16.810> elastic<00:01:17.470> pieces<00:01:17.830> on

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
as well as you have elastic pieces on

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.100 
as well as you have elastic pieces on
the<00:01:18.130> top<00:01:18.400> portions<00:01:19.060> too<00:01:19.300> so<00:01:19.750> that's<00:01:19.900> going<00:01:20.050> to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
the top portions too so that's going to

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.380 
the top portions too so that's going to
allow<00:01:20.260> that<00:01:20.290> mobility<00:01:21.000> going<00:01:22.000> on<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.300> the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
allow that mobility going on to the

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.750 
allow that mobility going on to the
sides<00:01:22.690> of<00:01:22.930> these<00:01:23.020> guys<00:01:23.230> you<00:01:24.010> do<00:01:24.220> see<00:01:24.430> it<00:01:24.520> does

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
sides of these guys you do see it does

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.020 
sides of these guys you do see it does
have<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:25.390> dual<00:01:26.050> piece<00:01:26.440> bicep<00:01:26.950> portion<00:01:27.430> so

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
have the dual piece bicep portion so

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.940 
have the dual piece bicep portion so
that's<00:01:28.180> a<00:01:28.240> nice<00:01:28.360> feature<00:01:28.390> as<00:01:28.840> well<00:01:29.080> you<00:01:29.740> do

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
that's a nice feature as well you do

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.590 
that's a nice feature as well you do
have<00:01:29.980> some<00:01:30.460> plastic<00:01:30.820> inserts<00:01:31.180> as<00:01:31.330> whereas

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
have some plastic inserts as whereas

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.090 
have some plastic inserts as whereas
those<00:01:31.750> some<00:01:31.960> nice<00:01:32.140> foams<00:01:32.470> on<00:01:32.710> it<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:32.980> it's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
those some nice foams on it so it's

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.620 
those some nice foams on it so it's
going<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.250> offer<00:01:33.310> some<00:01:33.640> great<00:01:33.820> protection<00:01:34.510> as

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
going to offer some great protection as

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.510 
going to offer some great protection as
well<00:01:35.170> as<00:01:35.230> being<00:01:35.590> attached<00:01:36.010> with<00:01:36.370> that

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
well as being attached with that

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.100 
well as being attached with that
free-floating<00:01:37.000> design<00:01:37.390> it's<00:01:37.810> really<00:01:37.870> going

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
free-floating design it's really going

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.690 
free-floating design it's really going
to<00:01:38.170> allow<00:01:38.290> it<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.590> move<00:01:38.860> into<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.310> arms<00:01:39.580> so

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
to allow it to move into the arms so

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.980 
to allow it to move into the arms so
it's<00:01:39.820> going<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.000> have<00:01:40.180> that<00:01:40.330> protection<00:01:40.540> as

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
it's going to have that protection as

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.410 
it's going to have that protection as
well<00:01:41.110> as<00:01:41.170> mobility<00:01:41.760> going<00:01:42.760> onto<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.090> shoulder

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
well as mobility going onto the shoulder

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.450 
well as mobility going onto the shoulder
cap<00:01:43.630> on<00:01:43.780> this<00:01:43.900> guy<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.260> they've<00:01:44.680> done<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.190> nice

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
cap on this guy and they've done a nice

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.860 
cap on this guy and they've done a nice
job<00:01:45.520> on<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:46.030> they<00:01:46.150> have<00:01:46.180> some<00:01:46.420> nice<00:01:46.510> thick

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
job on it they have some nice thick

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.050 
job on it they have some nice thick
foams<00:01:47.230> on<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.680> as<00:01:47.800> well<00:01:48.340> as<00:01:48.490> offering<00:01:48.850> some

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
foams on it as well as offering some

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.900 
foams on it as well as offering some
great<00:01:49.330> protection<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.230> it<00:01:50.980> does<00:01:51.310> have<00:01:51.340> some

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
great protection to it it does have some

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.670 
great protection to it it does have some
thicker<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.390> can<00:01:52.570> kind<00:01:52.750> of<00:01:52.810> see<00:01:53.020> -<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:53.350> has

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
thicker and you can kind of see - it has

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.740 
thicker and you can kind of see - it has
the<00:01:54.070> liner<00:01:54.280> running<00:01:54.580> across<00:01:54.730> here<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.630> has

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
the liner running across here and it has

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.780 
the liner running across here and it has
some<00:01:55.960> distance<00:01:56.470> between<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:57.100> pad<00:01:57.310> or<00:01:57.760> the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
some distance between the pad or the

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.610 
some distance between the pad or the
actual<00:01:58.120> cap<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:59.290> that's<00:01:59.380> going<00:01:59.560> to

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
actual cap of it so that's going to

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.380 
actual cap of it so that's going to
allow<00:01:59.770> some<00:01:59.800> more<00:02:00.250> energy<00:02:00.670> absorption<00:02:01.030> give

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
allow some more energy absorption give

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.390 
allow some more energy absorption give
me<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.510> little<00:02:01.750> further<00:02:01.960> protection<00:02:02.590> across

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
me a little further protection across

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.760 
me a little further protection across
the<00:02:03.700> top<00:02:03.880> portion<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:04.690> have<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:04.930> same<00:02:05.260> zip

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
the top portion you have that same zip

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.260 
the top portion you have that same zip
foam<00:02:06.010> as<00:02:06.190> I<00:02:06.280> mentioned<00:02:06.670> before<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.120> that's

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
foam as I mentioned before so that's

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.940 
foam as I mentioned before so that's
gonna<00:02:07.420> offer<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.690> great<00:02:07.960> protection<00:02:08.800> and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
gonna offer the great protection and

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.229 
gonna offer the great protection and
still<00:02:09.129> it's<00:02:09.220> gonna<00:02:09.369> have<00:02:09.459> some<00:02:09.550> good<00:02:09.759> mobility

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
still it's gonna have some good mobility

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.880 
still it's gonna have some good mobility
because<00:02:10.569> once<00:02:10.869> again<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.319> flexible

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
because once again it is a flexible

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.740 
because once again it is a flexible
material<00:02:12.010> I'm<00:02:12.610> going<00:02:13.000> on<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.569> back

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
material I'm going on to the back

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.450 
material I'm going on to the back
portion<00:02:14.050> as<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> similar<00:02:14.650> design<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.220> front

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
portion as a similar design to the front

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.520 
portion as a similar design to the front
but<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> little<00:02:15.850> different<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.390> do<00:02:17.050> see<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.350> has

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
but a little different you do see it has

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.899 
but a little different you do see it has
that

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
that

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.179 
that
almost<00:02:19.569> style<00:02:19.810> as<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.989> sternum<00:02:20.409> bar<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:21.040> it's

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
almost style as a sternum bar but it's

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.860 
almost style as a sternum bar but it's
for<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.459> spine<00:02:21.700> protection<00:02:22.299> so<00:02:22.450> that's<00:02:22.599> nice

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
for the spine protection so that's nice

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.360 
for the spine protection so that's nice
to<00:02:23.079> see<00:02:23.230> as<00:02:23.349> well<00:02:23.560> as<00:02:23.650> some<00:02:23.769> thicker<00:02:24.040> foams

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
to see as well as some thicker foams

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.130 
to see as well as some thicker foams
here<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:24.939> then<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.329> nice<00:02:25.480> cutout<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.019> it's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
here and then a nice cutout so it's

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.839 
here and then a nice cutout so it's
gonna<00:02:26.230> offer<00:02:26.439> some<00:02:26.530> great<00:02:26.799> mobility<00:02:27.189> well

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
gonna offer some great mobility well

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.849 
gonna offer some great mobility well
then<00:02:27.969> you<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.209> have<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.480> nice-sized<00:02:29.140> rib<00:02:29.620> wrap

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
then you do have a nice-sized rib wrap

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.589 
then you do have a nice-sized rib wrap
that's<00:02:30.099> gonna<00:02:30.219> go<00:02:30.430> right<00:02:30.609> across<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.150> ribs

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
that's gonna go right across the ribs

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.119 
that's gonna go right across the ribs
you<00:02:31.900> know<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.049> little<00:02:32.260> protection<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:32.920> side

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
you know a little protection on the side

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.039 
you know a little protection on the side
kind<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.519> underneath<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.180> arm<00:02:34.299> so<00:02:34.930> that's

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
kind of underneath the arm so that's

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.990 
kind of underneath the arm so that's
always<00:02:35.200> nice<00:02:35.409> to<00:02:35.620> see<00:02:35.799> but<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.430> really<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:36.849> how

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
always nice to see but I really like how

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.789 
always nice to see but I really like how
it<00:02:37.120> has<00:02:37.299> that<00:02:37.510> cut<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:38.079> here<00:02:38.379> so<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:38.650> going<00:02:38.739> to

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
it has that cut in here so it's going to

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.610 
it has that cut in here so it's going to
give<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.189> mobility<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.180> want

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
give you that mobility that you want

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.449 
give you that mobility that you want
also<00:02:41.620> another<00:02:41.799> kind<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.099> neat<00:02:42.250> thing<00:02:42.430> about

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
also another kind of neat thing about

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.910 
also another kind of neat thing about
this<00:02:42.790> pad<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.239> as<00:02:43.810> we<00:02:43.959> go<00:02:44.079> ahead<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.349> open<00:02:44.650> it

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
this pad is as we go ahead and open it

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.339 
this pad is as we go ahead and open it
up<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.189> the<00:02:45.430> inside<00:02:45.609> it<00:02:46.150> has<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.750> ventilation

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
up on the inside it has the ventilation

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.580 
up on the inside it has the ventilation
liner<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.099> so<00:02:48.879> that's<00:02:49.060> gonna<00:02:49.209> be<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.689> nice

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
liner on it so that's gonna be a nice

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.110 
liner on it so that's gonna be a nice
feature<00:02:50.829> basically<00:02:51.220> what<00:02:51.489> they've<00:02:51.639> done<00:02:51.879> is

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
feature basically what they've done is

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.030 
feature basically what they've done is
they've<00:02:52.450> kind<00:02:52.989> of<00:02:53.019> secured<00:02:53.409> all<00:02:53.620> these<00:02:53.769> foams

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
they've kind of secured all these foams

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.970 
they've kind of secured all these foams
in<00:02:54.250> these<00:02:54.340> panels<00:02:54.609> on<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.329> mesh<00:02:55.720> jacket<00:02:56.379> you

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
in these panels on this mesh jacket you

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.800 
in these panels on this mesh jacket you
can<00:02:57.099> kind<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.430> see<00:02:57.609> here<00:02:57.879> in<00:02:58.090> between<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.659> two

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
can kind of see here in between the two

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
this guy and this has a really

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.469 
this guy and this has a really
lightweight<00:03:21.519> feel<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.209> it<00:03:22.299> what<00:03:22.449> I

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:22.479 
lightweight feel to it what I

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.659 
lightweight feel to it what I
particularly<00:03:23.409> like<00:03:23.739> in<00:03:23.889> a<00:03:23.949> shoulder<00:03:24.250> pad<00:03:24.400> I

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
particularly like in a shoulder pad I

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.759 
particularly like in a shoulder pad I
don't<00:03:25.239> really<00:03:25.389> like<00:03:25.569> having<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.930> bulky<00:03:26.319> feel<00:03:26.530> to

it<00:03:26.859> I<00:03:27.069> think<00:03:27.699> this<00:03:27.790> one<00:03:27.940> actually<00:03:28.090> probably

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
it I think this one actually probably

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.000 
it I think this one actually probably
has<00:03:28.629> the<00:03:28.780> lightest<00:03:29.229> feel<00:03:29.440> out<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.709> all<00:03:29.889> the

has the lightest feel out of all the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.219 
has the lightest feel out of all the

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:32.229 
filler pads in the wire line as well as

offering that advanced high level

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:34.289

protection
another<00:03:35.049> nice<00:03:35.260> thing<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.709> know<00:03:35.859> going<00:03:36.190> back<00:03:36.310> to

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
another nice thing to know going back to

that suit foam I talked about is by
doing<00:03:39.069> this<00:03:39.129> it<00:03:39.280> actually<00:03:39.459> allows<00:03:39.849> it<00:03:39.879> to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
doing this it actually allows it to

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.030 
doing this it actually allows it to
reduce<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.690> number<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.019> layers<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.650> material

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040
