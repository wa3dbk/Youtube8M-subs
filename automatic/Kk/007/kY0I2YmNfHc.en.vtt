00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.350 
animation so let me go ahead and
fast-forward<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.610> video<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.149> see

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that clearly now so I think that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.069 
that clearly now so I think that
animation<00:00:44.940> had<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> pretty<00:00:45.450> nice<00:00:45.629> look<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.930> it

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
animation had a pretty nice look to it

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.869 
animation had a pretty nice look to it
it<00:00:46.680> doesn't<00:00:46.920> last<00:00:47.010> long<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.399> course<00:00:47.430> but

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
it doesn't last long of course but

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.459 
it doesn't last long of course but
nonetheless<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.020> nice<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> see

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
nonetheless it's kind of nice to see

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.189 
nonetheless it's kind of nice to see
