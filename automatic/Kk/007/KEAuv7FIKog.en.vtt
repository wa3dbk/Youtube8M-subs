00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.630
 good family relationships have become 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.789
 a rarity 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.130
 many moms have neither the strength nor the desire 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.470
 generally invest more in their families 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.849
 because they are already on the verge and these 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.090
 here are the problems you see on this 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.960
 slide I took them not from the ceiling not from 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.910
 to suck fingers 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.480
 you asked me questions before the seminar 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.730
 and here are the problems that were raised 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.500
 by your questions yes which to me 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.199
 asked that is a real problem 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.750
 real women we do not have enough time 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.059
 on top of each other we can't just be 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.010
 together we run somewhere all the time 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.780
 we are trying to give our children more things 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.149
 more money making opportunities 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.690
 phenomenon, but we do not give our 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.940
 children themselves is a problem breakdown 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.619
 screams of hysterics have become the norm for 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.550
 of our communication with children and spouses 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.740
 many children about which you are 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.710
 ask your questions no 5 more 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.410
 baby years he has no relationship with 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.300
 mom and dad normal this problem 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.179
 this is not normal many parents 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.060
 teens say i'm sitting in my trench 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.920
 baby spits i will of course give it all 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.079
 jokes and teens up to 40 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.780
 difficult period but so should not be 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.710
 understand this is not an indicator of good 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.659
 relationships in general the bottom line is that to us 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.950
 need to work on our relationship in 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.110
 family is the center 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.200
 which will help us in general in general all 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.079
 change our lives and the question is why in 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.180
 our families have all these problems i'm not 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.549
 I think everyone will like my answer to 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.340
 this question but nevertheless it is true 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.430
 What goes around comes around 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.229
 and reap more than you sow, and here 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.079
 we have to ask ourselves the question and what am I 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.289
 sowed that here I got such a relationship 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.939
 my family who are now in trouble 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.950
 that we need to learn how to take 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.380
 responsibility for your life is all that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.470
 there is now our life is the consequences 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.329
 our actions our decisions our life 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.019
 it depends entirely on our actions 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.970
 and the fact that we decided to do understand 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.810
 if you feel bad now if you now 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.569
 problems this is your fault if you 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.510
 okay now then it's your merit 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.040
 this is true this is how life is arranged you 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.200
 should take responsibility for their 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.540
 life your hands and understand how it is 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.109
 This principle works that you sow that 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.939
 reap 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.999
 See if you invest in your 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:47.639
 family your time strength your action 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:51.150
 love you will reap a good relationship 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:53.870
 Intimacy now think put Aliya 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.909
 the proximity of husband and children last year 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.799
 what I did for this and did it at all 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:04.230
 anything for this and see if in 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.040
 your relationship has problems then what 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.189
 it says 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.549
 from the principle of the radiance of the harvest we do not sow in 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:13.469
 respect 1 moment maybe yes we sow 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.930
 but not what is needed therefore the fruits 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:18.000
 Respectively and not those grows well either 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.760
 as an option may be the soil on which 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.769
 we sow she doesn't take our seeds 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.469
 stony well this can also 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.689
 but we have to remember this globa and after all 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:31.739
 prince that you sow that you reap 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:33.359
 reap more than you sow and you know 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.519
 in fact this principle he first 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.159
 grieves yes when we understand that here 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.409
 we are bad and we are to blame for it but with 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.810
 the other side he brings relief 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.729
 because we understand that we can 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.949
 very much change yes because if 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:50.549
 we will sow good we will get 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:53.220
 good result, see also very 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:57.030
 important point very much depends on 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:00.599
 you know why because you can 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.299
 change yourself you don't change maybe 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.040
 your husband you don't change a child you don't 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.609
 change the circumstances in which you 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.189
 are you 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.829
 but you can change yourself departure 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:13.229
 key person from whom will go 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.540
 changes in your family believe it 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.130
 the most important thing is you must understand 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.840
 what I'm saying is not about you being very 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.380
 much depends and you have to pull on 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.449
 to myself 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.969
 you must become universal soldiers 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.849
 super women super mom here's the cheese itself 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:29.219
 pulling no not in this sense the sense of what 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.500
 you can change a lot for your 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:34.380
 family is that you can change yourself 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.770
 change yourself a lot will change and 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.979
 for your whole family therefore we are with you 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.560
 can start all this relationship we can 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.380
 find the right seeds like 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.480
 will find that will give the desired fruit on there 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.430
 maybe we can't soil somehow 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.040
 change to which we pour 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.250
 but we can take these 2 actions for sure 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:02.450
 do and they depend on us death 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:07.010
 my eternal conqueror of the law 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.010
 this is my love
