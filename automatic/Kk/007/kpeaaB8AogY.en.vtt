00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
thing which I've always wanted to try it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.800 
thing which I've always wanted to try it
never<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:38.549> round<00:01:38.729> 2<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.479> kind<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
never got round 2 because it's kind of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.210 
never got round 2 because it's kind of
expensive<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.500> full<00:01:40.680> sized<00:01:40.890> tube<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
expensive for a full sized tube I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.830 
expensive for a full sized tube I
believe<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.579> about<00:01:41.640> 7<00:01:42.030> 8<00:01:42.119> pounds<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.600> for

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
believe it's about 7 8 pounds and for

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.039 
believe it's about 7 8 pounds and for
toothpaste<00:01:43.049> online<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.659> always<00:01:45.869> nice

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
to be able to try a sample size and this

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.370 
to be able to try a sample size and this
is<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> bank's<00:01:49.850> watch<00:01:50.850> shock<00:01:51.210> formula<00:01:51.750> in

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
the teeth based on light activated

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.630 
the teeth based on light activated
technology<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.689> your<00:02:01.619> teeth<00:02:01.829> whilst<00:02:02.369> you're

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
technology so your teeth whilst you're

that you've got and turn them into a

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.080 
that you've got and turn them into a
scrub<00:04:15.370> so<00:04:15.640> I

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
scrub so I

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.490 
scrub so I
doing<00:04:16.419> that<00:04:16.540> because<00:04:16.900> these<00:04:17.049> are<00:04:17.199> actually

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500

bergamot<00:04:21.160> and<00:04:21.340> that's<00:04:21.669> pretty<00:04:21.940> much<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.389> so<00:04:22.540> I

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
bergamot and that's pretty much it so I

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.120 
bergamot and that's pretty much it so I
think<00:04:22.870> I<00:04:23.139> would<00:04:23.199> definitely<00:04:23.620> be<00:04:23.740> using<00:04:24.040> that

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
think I would definitely be using that

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.250 
think I would definitely be using that
as<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.280> scrub<00:04:24.699> so<00:04:24.970> that's<00:04:25.180> good<00:04:25.389> because<00:04:25.600> it<00:04:26.139> was

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
as a scrub so that's good because it was

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.600 
as a scrub so that's good because it was
something<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.620> was<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:26.919> said<00:04:27.190> was<00:04:27.310> in<00:04:27.400> all<00:04:27.550> the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
something that was I said was in all the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.980 
something that was I said was in all the
boxes<00:04:27.790> and<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.180> thought<00:04:28.419> what<00:04:28.630> am<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:28.780> going<00:04:28.900> to

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
boxes and I thought what am I going to

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.480 
boxes and I thought what am I going to
do<00:04:29.080> with<00:04:29.199> that<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:29.889> thought<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.100> just<00:04:30.340> throw

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
do with that so I thought I just throw

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.210 
do with that so I thought I just throw
it<00:04:30.639> in<00:04:30.699> a<00:04:30.729> drawer<00:04:30.910> you<00:04:31.210> can<00:04:31.990> use<00:04:32.199> them<00:04:32.380> so

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
it in a drawer you can use them so

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.560 
it in a drawer you can use them so
that's<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.460> very<00:04:33.669> good<00:04:33.760> idea<00:04:33.880> we'll<00:04:34.300> be<00:04:34.389> doing

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
that's a very good idea we'll be doing

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.050 
that's a very good idea we'll be doing
when<00:04:34.780> we<00:04:34.840> do<00:04:34.960> like<00:04:35.110> body<00:04:35.320> scrubs<00:04:36.060> another
