little<00:02:29.130> widget<00:02:29.430> here<00:02:29.790> let's<00:02:30.240> go<00:02:30.360> ahead<00:02:30.450> and

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
little widget here let's go ahead and

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.050 
little widget here let's go ahead and
jump<00:02:30.780> into<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.080> settings<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.800> I'll<00:02:32.670> show<00:02:33.030> you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
everything that it has to offer in there

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.220 
everything that it has to offer in there
so<00:02:35.610> obviously<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.240> can<00:02:36.450> set<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.900> with<00:02:37.110> an

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
so obviously you can set this with an

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.840 
so obviously you can set this with an
activator<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.190> going<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.460> be<00:02:38.550> just

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
activator and this is going to be just

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.580 
activator and this is going to be just
like<00:02:38.910> setting<00:02:39.330> anything<00:02:39.630> up<00:02:39.960> with<00:02:40.440> an

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
like setting anything up with an

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.050 
like setting anything up with an
activator<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.460> I'm<00:02:41.550> not<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.850> go<00:02:41.910> through

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
activator so I'm not going to go through

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.150 
activator so I'm not going to go through
that<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.480> video<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.560> also<00:02:43.710> have<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
that in this video but you also have the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.680 
that in this video but you also have the
default<00:02:44.400> app<00:02:44.790> launch<00:02:45.090> which<00:02:45.240> I<00:02:45.360> was<00:02:45.480> showing

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
default app launch which I was showing

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.840 
default app launch which I was showing
you<00:02:45.870> i<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.290> set<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.620> barrel<00:02:46.890> app<00:02:47.070> and

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
you i have it set to the barrel app and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.790 
you i have it set to the barrel app and
if<00:02:48.060> we<00:02:48.120> want<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.360> scroll<00:02:48.510> down<00:02:48.570> here<00:02:48.750> then<00:02:49.350> you

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
if we want to scroll down here then you

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.560 
if we want to scroll down here then you
can<00:02:50.040> set<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.640> calculating<00:02:51.300> set<00:02:51.480> it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
can set this to the calculating set it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.690 
can set this to the calculating set it
to<00:02:51.630> basically<00:02:51.900> anything<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:53.160> you'll<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.490> that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
to basically anything so you'll see that

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.880 
to basically anything so you'll see that
it<00:02:53.820> opens<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.270> calculator<00:02:54.720> now<00:02:54.930> but<00:02:55.620> if<00:02:55.830> we

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
it opens the calculator now but if we

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.860 
it opens the calculator now but if we
have<00:02:56.190> something<00:02:56.430> playing<00:02:56.850> like<00:02:57.510> if<00:02:57.630> we<00:02:57.750> have

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
have something playing like if we have
