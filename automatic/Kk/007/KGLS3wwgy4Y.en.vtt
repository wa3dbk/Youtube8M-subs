00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
inside retaining wall along this area

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.650 
inside retaining wall along this area
right<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:22.760> you<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.180> right<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.420> here

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
right here you can have it right in here

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.000 
right here you can have it right in here
so<00:00:25.080> make<00:00:25.199> sure<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.380> just<00:00:25.439> block<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> garage

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010

area<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.820> kind<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> dirt<00:00:27.539> track

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
area this is kind of like a dirt track

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.919 
area this is kind of like a dirt track
and<00:00:27.900> I'm<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:28.710> even<00:00:28.890> gonna<00:00:29.010> bother<00:00:29.189> doing<00:00:29.460> that

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
and I'm not even gonna bother doing that

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.870 
and I'm not even gonna bother doing that
but<00:00:30.929> that's<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:31.949> looks<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.309> with<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
but that's what it looks like with the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.500 
but that's what it looks like with the
final<00:00:34.250> outside<00:00:35.250> retaining<00:00:35.399> wall<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
final outside retaining wall there and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.360 
final outside retaining wall there and
you<00:00:36.630> will<00:00:36.780> notice<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.320> didn't<00:00:37.680> exactly<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.219> it

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you will notice I didn't exactly get it

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.119 
you will notice I didn't exactly get it
quite<00:00:38.579> even<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.870> right<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:40.379> there's<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.800> small

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
quite even so right here there's a small

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.760 
quite even so right here there's a small
piece<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:42.270> had<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.570> fill<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:42.989> area<00:00:43.440> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
piece they had to fill in that area and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.869 
piece they had to fill in that area and
you're<00:00:43.920> gonna<00:00:44.010> probably<00:00:44.219> end<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.520> having<00:00:44.789> it

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
you're gonna probably end up having it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.950 
you're gonna probably end up having it
you're<00:00:44.969> probably<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.390> gonna<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.750> come

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you're probably not gonna have it come

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.770 
you're probably not gonna have it come
completely<00:00:46.640> equal<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> strip's<00:00:48.719> you

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
completely equal with the strip's you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.880 
completely equal with the strip's you
cut<00:00:48.989> you're<00:00:49.140> gonna<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> tell<00:00:49.590> probably<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
cut you're gonna have to tell probably a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.189 
cut you're gonna have to tell probably a
little<00:00:50.129> strip<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.420> very<00:00:51.660> end<00:00:51.960> all

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
little strip that's the very end all

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.330 
little strip that's the very end all
right<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.710> look<00:00:52.949> at<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.280> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
right so now you look at that and you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.619 
right so now you look at that and you
think<00:00:53.489> well<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:53.910> else<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.420> well

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
think well what else can we do well

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.819 
think well what else can we do well
there's<00:00:54.899> actually<00:00:54.960> quite<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.320> bit<00:00:55.530> more<00:00:55.559> you

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
there's actually quite a bit more you

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.700 
there's actually quite a bit more you
can<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:57.270> track<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.230> first<00:00:58.410> thing

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
can do with this track the first thing

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.380 
can do with this track the first thing
that<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.809> could<00:01:00.809> suggest<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.390> don't

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
probably wondering well if I wanted to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.170 
probably wondering well if I wanted to
do<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.900> how<00:01:19.049> could<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.799> well<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:21.030> way

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
do that how could I do that well the way

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120 
do that how could I do that well the way
you<00:01:21.240> would<00:01:21.450> end<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.720> doing<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.590> very

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you would end up doing that is very

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.310 
you would end up doing that is very
simply<00:01:23.880> taking<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.509> cutting<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> piece<00:01:25.110> of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
simply taking and cutting the piece of

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.130 
simply taking and cutting the piece of
paper<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.580> exact<00:01:27.090> way<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.990> then

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
paper to the exact way of this and then

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.310 
paper to the exact way of this and then
use<00:01:28.290> some<00:01:28.500> double-sided<00:01:28.920> tape<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:30.320> mounting

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
use some double-sided tape or mounting

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.020 
use some double-sided tape or mounting
squares<00:01:31.710> whatever<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> got<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.579> put<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.909> up

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
squares whatever you got and put it up

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.450 
squares whatever you got and put it up
on<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.630> simple<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.259> then<00:01:35.100> probably

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
on that is that simple and then probably

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.280 
on that is that simple and then probably
feel<00:01:35.610> wonderful<00:01:36.000> sponsorships<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.869> you

feel wonderful sponsorships on it you

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.469 
feel wonderful sponsorships on it you
could<00:01:37.380> tape<00:01:37.590> them<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.479> personally

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
could tape them on there I personally

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.359 
could tape them on there I personally
don't<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.409> however<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.860> am<00:01:40.950> kind<00:01:41.280> of

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369

thinking<00:01:41.640> about<00:01:41.729> over<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.320> where<00:01:43.579> there<00:01:44.579> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
thinking about over here where there is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
thinking about over here where there is
orange<00:01:45.149> showing<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.200> think<00:01:46.560> about<00:01:46.680> may<00:01:46.799> be

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
orange showing I think about may be

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.800 
orange showing I think about may be
covering<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.369> over<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:47.790> I'm<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.509> gonna<00:01:48.630> do

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.459 
want to do I honestly don't have any
construction<00:01:59.490> paper<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.840> wanted<00:02:01.290> to

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
construction paper but if you wanted to

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.080 
construction paper but if you wanted to
you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.710> make<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.040> green<00:02:02.430> grass<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
outside you can make it brown the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.200 
outside you can make it brown the
construction<00:02:05.189> paper<00:02:05.369> really<00:02:05.640> comes<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.060> handy

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
construction paper really comes in handy

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.910 
construction paper really comes in handy
when<00:02:06.390> you're<00:02:06.509> doing<00:02:07.049> something<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.380> this

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
when you're doing something with this

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.949 
when you're doing something with this
I<00:02:07.950> had<00:02:08.729> construction<00:02:09.209> paper<00:02:09.569> for<00:02:09.750> that

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
I had construction paper for that

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.510 
I had construction paper for that
stop-motion<00:02:10.649> track<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.950> made<00:02:11.129> when<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> did<00:02:11.430> this

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
stop-motion track I made when I did this

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.630 
stop-motion track I made when I did this
one<00:02:11.700> Jim<00:02:11.819> Science<00:02:12.180> series

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
one Jim Science series

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.420 
one Jim Science series
and<00:02:13.290> think<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.440> used<00:02:14.680> up<00:02:14.860> my<00:02:14.980> whole<00:02:15.130> supply

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
and think that used up my whole supply

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.880 
and think that used up my whole supply
of<00:02:15.670> construction<00:02:16.150> paper<00:02:16.590> anyway

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
of construction paper anyway

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.480 
of construction paper anyway
now<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:19.240> get<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:20.320> few<00:02:20.650> other<00:02:20.950> things<00:02:21.280> that

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
now to get to a few other things that

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.240 
now to get to a few other things that
really<00:02:22.210> I<00:02:22.600> guess<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.860> could<00:02:24.040> say<00:02:24.220> a

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
really I guess you could say a

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.960 
really I guess you could say a
stop-motion<00:02:24.580> track<00:02:25.240> really<00:02:25.990> needs<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.400> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
stop-motion track really needs and the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.750 
stop-motion track really needs and the
first<00:02:28.210> thing<00:02:28.510> would<00:02:28.990> have<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.680> be<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.160> flag

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
first thing would have to be a flag

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.970 
first thing would have to be a flag
stands<00:02:31.240> now<00:02:31.510> flag<00:02:31.840> stand<00:02:32.230> it's<00:02:32.440> not<00:02:32.680> going<00:02:32.920> to

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
stands now flag stand it's not going to

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.340 
stands now flag stand it's not going to
be<00:02:33.070> very<00:02:33.520> easy<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:34.240> make<00:02:34.450> however<00:02:34.960> there<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.320> a

be very easy to make however there is a
simple<00:02:36.040> way<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.460> being<00:02:37.180> able<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.450> do<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:37.720> and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
simple way of being able to do it and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.390 
simple way of being able to do it and

next thing you're gonna do is you're
going<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.420> draw<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:02.550> little<00:03:03.550> bit<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.880> a

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
going to draw a little bit of a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.840 
going to draw a little bit of a
connector<00:03:05.160> it's<00:03:06.160> gonna<00:03:06.310> kind<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:06.670> look<00:03:06.790> like

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
connector it's gonna kind of look like

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.570 
connector it's gonna kind of look like
this<00:03:07.270> two<00:03:07.570> lines<00:03:07.840> they<00:03:08.560> go<00:03:08.709> down<00:03:08.890> one<00:03:09.310> just<00:03:09.489> a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
this two lines they go down one just a

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.870 
this two lines they go down one just a
little<00:03:09.850> bit<00:03:10.000> further<00:03:10.330> out<00:03:10.630> than<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.989> other

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
little bit further out than the other

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.949 
little bit further out than the other
then<00:03:13.620> down<00:03:14.620> here<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:16.209> can<00:03:16.390> draw<00:03:16.600> just<00:03:16.870> a

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
then down here you can draw just a

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.490 
then down here you can draw just a
little<00:03:17.410> bit<00:03:17.560> bigger<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.340> rectangle<00:03:19.410> did<00:03:20.410> I

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
little bit bigger of a rectangle did I

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.020 
little bit bigger of a rectangle did I
call<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:20.890> square<00:03:21.220> that's<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.459> rectangle

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
call that a square that's a rectangle

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.620 
call that a square that's a rectangle
man<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:22.360> gotta<00:03:22.540> learn<00:03:22.660> my<00:03:22.840> shapes<00:03:23.200> good<00:03:23.530> grief

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
man I gotta learn my shapes good grief

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.860 
man I gotta learn my shapes good grief
may<00:03:25.650> actually<00:03:26.650> see<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.160> if<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.239> look<00:03:28.269> at<00:03:28.660> it

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
may actually see that if you look at it

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.930 
may actually see that if you look at it
this<00:03:29.080> is<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.440> flag<00:03:29.650> stand<00:03:29.980> now<00:03:30.489> here's<00:03:30.760> what

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
this is the flag stand now here's what

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.520 
this is the flag stand now here's what
you're<00:03:31.090> gonna<00:03:31.150> do<00:03:31.420> you're<00:03:31.930> gonna<00:03:32.019> draw<00:03:32.290> this

you're gonna do you're gonna draw this

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.860 
you're gonna do you're gonna draw this
one<00:03:32.830> and<00:03:33.790> then<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.150> next<00:03:34.390> time<00:03:34.600> you're<00:03:34.780> going

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.590 

start/finish<00:06:20.670> line<00:06:21.350> put<00:06:22.350> it<00:06:22.470> right<00:06:22.590> there<00:06:22.650> and

there you go there's your own flag stand
look<00:06:28.290> just<00:06:28.770> like<00:06:28.920> a<00:06:28.980> flag<00:06:29.250> stand<00:06:29.610> too<00:06:29.820> and<00:06:30.270> it's

look just like a flag stand too and it's

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.080 
look just like a flag stand too and it's
perfect<00:06:31.040> so<00:06:32.040> that's<00:06:32.250> what<00:06:32.550> you<00:06:32.670> would<00:06:32.790> do<00:06:32.940> with

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
perfect so that's what you would do with

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.210 
perfect so that's what you would do with
that<00:06:34.910> and<00:06:35.910> pretty<00:06:36.660> much<00:06:36.840> that's<00:06:37.770> all<00:06:38.010> I<00:06:38.070> can

that and pretty much that's all I can
show<00:06:38.580> you<00:06:38.640> for<00:06:38.940> how<00:06:39.120> to<00:06:39.180> build<00:06:39.540> a<00:06:39.750> track<00:06:40.140> this

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
show you for how to build a track this

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.540 
show you for how to build a track this
way<00:06:41.930> there<00:06:42.930> are<00:06:43.320> some<00:06:43.590> other<00:06:43.770> things<00:06:43.860> but

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550

you how to make your very own flag stand

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.190 
you how to make your very own flag stand
next<00:06:58.650> on<00:06:59.070> how<00:06:59.850> to<00:07:00.000> make<00:07:00.210> a<00:07:00.240> stop-motion<00:07:00.570> track

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200 
next on how to make a stop-motion track

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.990 
next on how to make a stop-motion track
I'm<00:07:01.560> going<00:07:01.710> to<00:07:01.770> be<00:07:01.830> showing<00:07:02.070> you<00:07:02.280> the<00:07:02.460> simpler

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
materials some of you may not so you'll

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.870 
materials some of you may not so you'll
probably<00:07:07.110> if<00:07:07.530> you<00:07:07.650> don't<00:07:07.920> have<00:07:08.400> to<00:07:08.580> resort<00:07:08.820> to

probably if you don't have to resort to

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.460 
probably if you don't have to resort to

on<00:07:10.680> part<00:07:10.980> 3<00:07:11.310> of<00:07:11.520> how<00:07:11.610> to<00:07:12.330> make<00:07:12.600> a<00:07:12.840> stop-motion

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
on part 3 of how to make a stop-motion

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.570 
on part 3 of how to make a stop-motion
track<00:07:13.830> here<00:07:14.070> on<00:07:14.160> the<00:07:14.250> MSE<00:07:14.610> race<00:07:14.790> stop-motion
