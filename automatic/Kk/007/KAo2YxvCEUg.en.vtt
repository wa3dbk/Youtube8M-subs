 with a comprehensive conversion wants the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.509
 German railway will be future-proof 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.830
 the group is getting leaner faster 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.880
 more efficient and more customer-oriented 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.210
 at the press conference on 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.210
 half-year balance 2015 in berlin announced 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.210
 dr rÃ¼diger pit board chairman 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.460
 db ag has a six-point program 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.550
 We still want our company 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.400
 more in line with the demands of the markets 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.250
 and align our customers 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.190
 the supervisory board is this recommendation 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.100
 followed and has a far-reaching 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.020
 Reorganization of the group approved 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.020
 which includes six points program 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.180
 the following measures, first, the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 the group's management board is going from eight to six 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.559
 reduced members 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.090
 ronald pofalla is new 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.910
 the department for business law and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.410
 regulation and berthold huber der das 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.140
 resort transport and transport 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.020
 is responsible for the previous department 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.170
 Second, technology and the environment are different 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.909
 Board departments assigned with the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.530
 Third, the organization will be reorganized 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.159
 Business distribution in the board new 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.890
 controlled 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.049
 a central point here is that the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.270
 activities of the integrated German 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.979
 Railways are bundling more strongly than before 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.119
 become 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.729
 Fourth, the double-storey 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.830
 holding structure dissolved and the db 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.439
 mobility logistics ag with the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.170
 group holding db ag 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.930
 be less double structures and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.360
 less cuts mean less 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.630
 bureaucracy and , of course, too 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.030
 less cost and less bureaucracy 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.390
 Above all, to find means 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.090
 employees and of course more time 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.570
 still for our customers because we know 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.600
 all 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.939
 the customer is the key to one 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.060
 further economic success and 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.869
 of course, also for our profitable 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.600
 growth 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.590
 we want more profitable again 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.930
 achieve growth 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.570
 it is indeed a central basis for 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.020
 our implementation as part of the strategy 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.179
 db 2020 fifth, the service 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.330
 Function and internal services 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.810
 in the future, in a db global group 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.090
 service 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.099
 center is bundled and finally becomes 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.890
 sixth an option for one 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.959
 partial privatization of db arriva and db 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.239
 schenker logistics opens its doors to the 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.330
 Strengthen strategic development and 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.800
 to finance additional growth 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.569
 at the presentation of the balance sheet numbers like 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.450
 it dr mine point out that the 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.160
 Month long strike of gdl and several 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.349
 weather the result of the German railway 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.480
 significantly negatively affected 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.090
 the strikes have a lot to our customers 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.090
 patience requires our employees 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.360
 a lot of strength and cost 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.430
 company's important revenue 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.959
 economic damage of the strikes for 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.739
 the years 2014 and 2015 are up 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.510
 a total of around 500 million euros in 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.510
 in the first half of the year it was more than 250 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.430
 millions of euros in our result 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.140
 Sales are missing in the first half of the year 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.830
 could be compared to the previous year 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.410
 by 13 percent to 20 billion euros 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.859
 but was also increased by 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.950
 influences positive exchange rate effects 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:23.820
 the result before taxes and interest ebit 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.220
 adjusted 18 2 percent to 890 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.000
 million euros back if one of the 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.530
 Special burdens from storms and strikes 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 abstracted confirmed the previous one 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.400
 course of the year certainly our 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.980
 Expectations for the full year 2015 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.319
 however, we can do the unplanned 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.940
 special effects from strikes and storms 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.100
 do not fully compensate for that 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.900
 in particular, the earnings forecast 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.750
 towards our outlook from the end of march 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.889
 in the balance sheet press conference slightly 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.420
 had to reduce 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.010
 the executive Board is showing 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.380
 confident that with one of 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.109
 Strikes unencumbered second half of the year 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.600
 and the initiated measures still 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.970
 operating result before interest and tax 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.359
 taxes of 2 billion euros achieved 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.359
 can be
