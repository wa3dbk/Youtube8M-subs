when I was stamping out the star fruit

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.799 
when I was stamping out the star fruit
so<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.789> went<00:00:53.940> over<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.390> the

so I just went over that with the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
so I just went over that with the
gumball<00:00:55.559> green<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.129> didn't<00:00:56.399> even<00:00:56.430> notice

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
gumball green and you didn't even notice

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.540 
gumball green and you didn't even notice
it<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.660> I'm<00:00:57.719> stamping<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:59.100> across<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
it so I'm stamping out going across the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.920

different<00:01:01.020> directions<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.829> looks<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
different directions so it looks like a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.920 
different directions so it looks like a
little<00:01:02.550> bit<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.270> know<00:01:03.300> party<00:01:03.719> streamers
