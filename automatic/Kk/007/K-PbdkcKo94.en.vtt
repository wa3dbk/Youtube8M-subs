00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.480
 interesting sagas and other mystic and 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.839
 that by the depths of the sea is

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.630
 it is an environment that is not of the human being 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.060
 as the human being one lives within the 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.350
 sea ​​because apart from being the scuba diver 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.440
 there are also many professionals 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.620
 then there had to be escapes 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.530
 together with my deceased captain weaker 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.640

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.900
 that is not afraid but that is overcome with 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.350
 the preparation the safety of man

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.010
 objective that only those who live 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.890
 inside these ships we know what is 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.600

 of men in white 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.320
 good submarines are great 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.270
 importance first the submarine 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.780
 I have to describe cloth as a weapon 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.480
 that silences a weapon that is mysterious 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.599
 a weapon that is treacherous a weapon that 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.690
 can be used or used in 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.990
 different activities what does it mean 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.320
 this 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.660
 in any conflict the submarine does not 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.000
 necessarily have to be 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.620
 circumscribed to an area of ​​operation but 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.890
 which can be used by a 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.620
 commander in different theaters since 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.270
 he has several roles will lead groups of 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.940
 commands these command groups are 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.490
 specialized large-capacity groups 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.310
 operational that they can put in 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.820
 bombs can destroy refineries can 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.980
 make damage this of great significance to 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.760
 a nation then the submarine between 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.690
 your tasks has that function that is 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.250
 bring these large capacity groups 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.540
 operational then this is one of the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.890
 roles 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.739
 today we have different 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.810
 tasks among them we are commissioned 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.730
 to do intelligence work those 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.609
 intelligence work does not have to 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.220
 be unrestricted to the military area 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.980
 but also in an active participation 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.590
 in the development that we do 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.230
 we preserve the environment we have 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.420
 that monitor our marine areas that 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.879
 they are quite extensive in the sense of 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.579
 that there is no illegal fishing that is 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.799
 keep all the animals all 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.420
 flowers that are there and all the 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.700
 living and non-living resources that 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.120
 found in our areas since as 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.610
 it is known in the future 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.000
 problems and conflicts are going to 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.700
 come given by the water for the food and 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.540
 then there are some sources 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.360
 essential for development 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.010
