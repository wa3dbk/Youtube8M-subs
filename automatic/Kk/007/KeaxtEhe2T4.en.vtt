the<00:01:16.650> world<00:01:16.860> cup<00:01:17.100> matches<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.060> course<00:01:18.299> I

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the world cup matches and of course I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.520 
the world cup matches and of course I
want<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> watch<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:22.320> have

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
want to watch them and so I don't have

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.100 
want to watch them and so I don't have
that<00:01:22.590> much<00:01:23.070> time<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.520> produce<00:01:23.729> any<00:01:24.150> videos<00:01:24.630> but

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that much time to produce any videos but

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.340 
that much time to produce any videos but
I<00:01:25.170> thought<00:01:25.500> let's<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.549> match<00:01:26.850> per<00:01:27.210> day<00:01:27.420> for

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
I thought let's do one match per day for

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.030 
I thought let's do one match per day for
you<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.829> then<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.640> will<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.619> multiple<00:01:31.619> uploads

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you and then I will do multiple uploads

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.280 
you and then I will do multiple uploads
in<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.460> week<00:01:32.640> not<00:01:33.210> only<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> weekends

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
in a week not only on the weekends

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.620 
in a week not only on the weekends
because<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.159> upload<00:01:35.640> day<00:01:35.939> by<00:01:36.150> day<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
because then I can upload day by day and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.039 
because then I can upload day by day and
I<00:01:37.079> think<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.799> very<00:01:38.280> good<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:39.270> me<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.689> for

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
I think this is very good for me and for

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.639 
I think this is very good for me and for
you<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.700> yes<00:01:41.909> searching<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.079> opponent<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you and yes searching for opponent it

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.359 
you and yes searching for opponent it
takes<00:01:43.920> ages<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.680> won't<00:01:47.040> find

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
takes ages so I think we won't find

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.149 
takes ages so I think we won't find
anyone<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:48.180> because<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.320> service<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.009> don't

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
anyone here because the service I don't

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.819 
anyone here because the service I don't
know<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> will<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.509> back<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.990> fun<00:01:52.259> opponent

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.730 
know so I will be back on a fun opponent
and<00:01:53.009> then<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.700> start<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.380> ok<00:01:55.380> our<00:01:55.649> next
