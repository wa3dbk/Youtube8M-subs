00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.279
 and good to all the boys and girls the 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.900
 great sword I bring you a weapon today 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.539
 powerful and powerful 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.289
 in good hands your charges do a lot 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.699
 hurt 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.840
 a weapon that you can cover 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:21.060
 also and speed let's say it's 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.270
 average speed if you know how to handle it is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.509
 faster than it seems it is very 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.769
 effective very simple to handle 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.560
 you just have to master the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.960
 charges that are the heavy blows of the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.079
 weapon 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.670
 and you have to look at the classrooms of 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.880
 the classrooms that he creates when you load the gun 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.030
 there are three different classrooms 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.510
 and of course the third aura which is the 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.359
 last 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.059
 is the one that does more damage there are two hits 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.430
 very powerful of the gs that one is the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.980
 normal load phase 3 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.930
 it is worth to arrive you will see that the aura that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.390
 it turns blue just at that moment it makes like 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:06.610
 a small explosion release the button 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.250
 of vertical blow and you will listen to a team 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.240
 as good that will mean that you have 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.899
 made the load 3 successfully 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.090
 there is also the hammer blow which is what 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.720
 same is a load with gs but take a 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.770
 position as of run with the gs and 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.329
 clear when it touches the ground you can 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.729
 load that phase 3 I also forget 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.970
 say and when it touches the ground 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.490
 clear and nailed the sword remains one 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.590
 and you can not do combos with 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.370
 that after that hammer blow of the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.090
 gs 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.490
 that would be the most powerful take away 12% 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.990
 I calculate what else what 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:58.220
 the other blow loaded with phase 3 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.860
 I always talk about putting people 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.140
 charges in phase 3 because good 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.140
 I am very perfectionist in that 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.720
 and of course this weapon is to do 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.760
 Loaded loads Loaded loads 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.720
 cover charge blows back and good 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.060
 it's a very simple button game 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.010
 you just have to know it and with 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.070
 you can do a lot of damage in the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.170
 battlefield and hunting our 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.610
 favorite monsters good I hope that you 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.530
 have liked to see you in the next 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.160

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.160
