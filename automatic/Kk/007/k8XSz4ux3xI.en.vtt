next<00:00:01.260> let's<00:00:01.500> look<00:00:01.650> at<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.890> two<00:00:02.070> main<00:00:02.220> arteries

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
next let's look at the two main arteries

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.990 
next let's look at the two main arteries
of<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.879> hand<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.419> radial<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.500> ulnar<00:00:05.000> in

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
of the hand the radial and the ulnar in

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.059 
of the hand the radial and the ulnar in
the<00:00:06.270> dissection<00:00:06.750> we'll<00:00:06.899> see<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.589> arteries

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
the dissection we'll see the arteries

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.100 
the dissection we'll see the arteries
have<00:00:08.220> been<00:00:08.400> injected<00:00:08.880> with<00:00:08.880> red<00:00:09.269> latex<00:00:09.570> to

now let's go back up to the elbow and

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.420 
now let's go back up to the elbow and
look<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> ulnar<00:01:18.750> artery<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.950> has<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> much

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
look at the ulnar artery it has a much

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.950 
look at the ulnar artery it has a much
deeper<00:01:20.640> course<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:23.280> ulnar<00:01:23.640> artery<00:01:24.060> houses

deeper course the ulnar artery houses

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.149 
deeper course the ulnar artery houses
beneath<00:01:25.610> pronator<00:01:26.610> teres<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:28.920> where<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
beneath pronator teres to see where it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.289 
beneath pronator teres to see where it
goes<00:01:29.369> we'll<00:01:29.790> remove<00:01:30.150> pronator<00:01:30.689> teres<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
goes we'll remove pronator teres and

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.609 
goes we'll remove pronator teres and
flexor<00:01:33.299> carpi<00:01:33.659> radialis<00:01:36.229> after<00:01:37.229> passing
