00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.670
 hi to all friends of to be cares 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.470
 I know I haven't done video either 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.019
 only server we no longer want me 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:18.180
 sorry but we don't have many ideas 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:20.520
 so i don't know if i'll just be connected 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.029
 the joystick of the playstation 3 with the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.359
 my mac os windows i don't know if the inter is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.170
 they are history but I don't know if I will 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.540
 I'll have time we made more videos 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.570
 because of school than just 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.320
 started however we pass to the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.590
 tutorial then today let see how 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.050
 install nevola outside tibia i already had 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.450
 made a tutorial on how to pay 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.260
 buckled wall just that the device 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.840
 it was then unlocked with cydia 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.090
 this time the device is 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.469
 completely normal ie you don't have to 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.469
 make no changes 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.380
 but what you need to do is open safari 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.950
 and go to this website 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.540
 I see you link indiscretion of course 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.310
 it's called morphology and there are many 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.750
 applications that you can download that 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.810
 more or less they are all the same though 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.170
 however in a few words you must 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.080
 download the first one that this can like 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.750
 you can see click on install via 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.570
 pré two thousand pages then do install and 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.210
 will install it or falsely without you 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.829
 you have to do any proceedings 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.920
 once you have downloaded nemola 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.960
 outside, however, I do not know its os 7 type 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.880
 never screen records are not supported 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.880
 or if you try not to register 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.270
 recorded one record only 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.399
 the application still have to resolve 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.229
 this bug 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:10.020
 so once downloaded, here it is 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.810
 open is already all set obviously 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.120
 you will not find any game 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:23.209
 how do you look top right e 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:24.709
 click here on gb harold here I am 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.900
 team something before doing this 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.510
 method 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.459
 you must set your date then 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.099
 later you can repay it 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:39.110
 just for the download you can quote the 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:45.700
 move date to 2012 teams down with 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.700

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:54.170

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.770
 December of that sweet bass that it 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.740
 leave so much it doesn't matter 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.650
 reboot on safari now you can 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.380
 we can't download the rom first 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.500
 I do n't know why I don't care 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.190
 so then we can put it back to normal 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.870
 date 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.700

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.900

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.900

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:40.200
 working on a device no 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:44.390
 therefore we have these two modes then 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.390
 by going to the main menu 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.260
 we have these options 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.020
 we have with writing and original gb a 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.940
 cube then we can control it with 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.070
 nintendo wii controller 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:05.880
 later the tricks will be integrated 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:09.510
 but for now we don't have the possibility 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:13.040
 autosave check for updates will do everything 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:16.680
