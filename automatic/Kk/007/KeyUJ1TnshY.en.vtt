00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:04.700
 béatrice and raphaël lakpé other people like the staging of 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.730
 visitors to whistler it increases without stopping it increases steadily and we have 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.089
 always wings reservations for three months advanced 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.709
 we thought that it seems to fade when it starts to calm down after 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.079
 a year of blood 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.989
 and it's on the contrary time still 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.199
 in euros makes reservations and 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.810
 but it's complicated and today it would be necessary that the coaches 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.019
 we did it in control it would be well 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.539
 I'm upside down and no more of the amp that build passive like 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.899
 it 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:30.890
 as usual 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.720
 let's say that it's a pity that he does not make so much 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.500
 so good in a house like these have so 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.809
 that's a shame for them 1 raphael 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.950
 and we do not always understand 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.460
 why do not do it and so it's interesting the joys 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.510
 what we already said a little about the cultural du 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.570
 we have to get to 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.270
 to maybe get rid of some ideas 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.739
 those who are preconceived ideas like for example we count 10 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.539
 we live in a house without heating the click in the head of the interlocutor 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:59.410
 that is to say 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.520
 so what are these people cold 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.339
 this case 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.479
 good summer and then we must go up the slope and get stung that in fact we 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.660
 you have to get away from the idea that the longer you burn, the more comfortable it is 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.990
 what 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.110
 at some point we can break it and maybe less 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.730
 flags 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.840
 be it comfortable 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.270
 m it is true that at home you will have a lot it is not comfortable for 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.679
 as much as I do not know more comfortable in winter we still accepted 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.969
 to convert at night but I'm in awe of 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.790
 this house still hurts to talk to me about a contest 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.540
 he tries himself totally isolated affair 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.080
 with his political opponents and this entity for 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.490
 to know change 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.550
 but this his parents pulled out the window directly except years 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.950
 in the normal spring in the coming hours otherwise we do not legislate 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.770
 sincere and honest and carmaux it can scare but also the world of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.460
 the aerial no bad smells in the company or not 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.830
 now that all fillon patients are elsewhere 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.190
 ventilation is controlled and the role whether it is ventilation 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.600
 wild is happening pretty much everywhere from where in a stadium 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.499
 small leaks left to right 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:03.960
 this breakdown that has been mastered which allows precisely 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.560
 to evacuate the stale air but without complaining about the heat that's the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.829
 purpose of the game good and when you have been away for a long time 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:11.700
 how do we do 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.650
 called you 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.609
 face to the ogc nice to marseille it will work will not work when we are a 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.949
 very good day we do not necessarily have with the 35 hours it is 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:23.399
 the region 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.399
 we look at it is sometimes surprised at an electric heater 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.999
 however me it depends if it is in winter it is very cold 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.960
 but all doors for comfort and which stabilize and which remain 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.960
 m but that raises the machine goes so 7 it's still important because 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.349
 we have been seen passing so for a long time we believed for a moment all 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.699
 people adhere to the stop in the report hours later we saw a 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.379
 reportage a whole lot of things that feeds that heated 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.659
 so yes I do not want to imagine that in the presentation of day to 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.370
 do sales activities in the non-life sector 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.829
 quite normally 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.270
 belaiz will have the good and we will go back to pass 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.070
 but otherwise how to fight is a backup heater 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.760
 so it must be cropped also it's nice it's a small radiator 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.439
 electric milwaukee 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.119
 and it's really to give 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.349
 the one on the back when it would be lacking 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.269
 m for the foot recipe 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.800
 an unhappy 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.450
 vincent riou on the antenna pierrât of oussama that it works very well you 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.019
 had sisyphe be good if for a month 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.269
 we did like this winter if the facts described because finally it's not 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.129
 so cold is rather the grisaille 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.059
 the problem is not having a sun that makes the house peaceful 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.639
 who for a long time yet we will give a little bit what this little 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.939
 electric radiator of a fabien forgive 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.939
 and that's enough we see where we scream lasagna what 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.139
 not in the first example just now in Friborg is a bulimic 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.279
 which is enough like the marshals federer but the pregnancy is still enough 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:45.449
 different from the rest an apartment when we see what this is a situation 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.189
 pretty pretty ideal since it's an apartment one side 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.389
 the losses its all of 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.730
 already reduced to the beginning 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.789
 you had said that and three candles 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.809
 but he's holding on, but there will be a fire 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:58.099
 it's a big candle 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.519
 this is an apartment in the cult following because his 4th goal 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.569
 in the afternoon we saw better the sun just in front of the terrace but it's 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.000
 true when one makes the grouped housing of brownies of the facade of 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.059
 right and the front left you do not need idiots but it does not take them 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:14.249
 solid heat 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.180
 it's the neighbors who occupy them this week everyone 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.959
 of clustered housing echoes the afp not quite inclined to do in in 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.650
 belgium we are less used to that
