00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
is quite some racket really and then

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.199 
is quite some racket really and then
really<00:02:17.500> inspiring<00:02:17.860> particularly<00:02:18.760> show<00:02:18.910> up<00:02:19.060> at

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
really inspiring particularly show up at

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.210 
really inspiring particularly show up at
the<00:02:19.270> moment<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.620> players<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.100> have

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
the moment the the players that have

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.730 
the moment the the players that have
been<00:02:21.280> selected<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:22.000> personally<00:02:22.600> think<00:02:22.810> have

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
been selected I personally think have

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.410 
been selected I personally think have
done<00:02:23.770> very<00:02:24.250> well<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.760> think<00:02:24.820> it's<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.209> learning

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
done very well I think it's a learning

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.590 
done very well I think it's a learning
curve<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:27.370> coming<00:02:27.700> off<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.000> back<00:02:28.150> of<00:02:28.180> an<00:02:28.420> ashy

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
curve but coming off the back of an ashy

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.690 
curve but coming off the back of an ashy
series<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.320> don't<00:02:29.590> really<00:02:29.800> think<00:02:29.890> waar<00:02:30.280> bowlers

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
series I don't really think waar bowlers

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.860 
series I don't really think waar bowlers
have<00:02:30.850> been<00:02:31.000> at<00:02:31.150> 100%<00:02:32.310> hundred-percent<00:02:33.310> up<00:02:33.489> on

have been at 100% hundred-percent up on
firepower<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:36.489> been<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.700> learning<00:02:36.910> tour

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
firepower but it's been a learning tour

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.420 
firepower but it's been a learning tour
and<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:37.750> been<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.959> very<00:02:38.170> enjoyable<00:02:38.290> one<00:02:38.769> so<00:02:39.160> if

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
been brilliant I think the atmosphere

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.189 
been brilliant I think the atmosphere
over<00:04:26.470> here<00:04:26.979> particularly<00:04:27.910> today<00:04:28.060> as<00:04:28.570> shown

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
over here particularly today as shown

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.529 
over here particularly today as shown
exactly<00:04:29.740> if<00:04:30.130> a<00:04:30.220> crowd<00:04:30.490> gets<00:04:30.789> behind<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.330> team

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
exactly if a crowd gets behind a team

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.330 
exactly if a crowd gets behind a team
what<00:04:31.720> can<00:04:31.870> happen<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.350> although<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.070> England

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
what can happen and although the England

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.029 
what can happen and although the England
team<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:34.750> know<00:04:34.840> played<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.110> few<00:04:35.380> poor<00:04:35.740> shots

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
team you know played a few poor shots

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.680 
team you know played a few poor shots
today<00:04:36.340> I<00:04:36.370> think<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.820> crowd<00:04:37.090> really<00:04:37.270> got

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
today I think the crowd really got

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.080 
today I think the crowd really got
behind<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:38.200> Pakistan<00:04:38.889> bowlers<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.340> made<00:04:39.970> the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
behind the Pakistan bowlers and made the

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.830 
behind the Pakistan bowlers and made the
big<00:04:40.270> difference

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
big difference

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.690 
big difference
I<00:04:40.870> think<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.500> Pakistani<00:04:42.039> crowds<00:04:42.370> here

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
I think the Pakistani crowds here

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.200 
I think the Pakistani crowds here
cricket<00:04:43.180> wise<00:04:43.389> have<00:04:44.490> been<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.610> best<00:04:45.849> crowds

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
cricket wise have been the best crowds

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.360 
cricket wise have been the best crowds

I've ever seen cricketing Mars with

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.010 
I've ever seen cricketing Mars with
their<00:04:48.520> noise<00:04:48.760> and<00:04:49.090> their<00:04:49.210> passion<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.840> big

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
their noise and their passion the big

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.960 
their noise and their passion the big
there's<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.590> massive<00:04:51.070> amount<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.430> passion<00:04:51.610> here

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
there's a massive amount of passion here

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.720
