00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
you're trying to do is just getting

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
you're trying to do is just getting
trying<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.170> get<00:03:23.329> just<00:03:24.329> pick<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.660> little<00:03:24.989> bit<00:03:25.290> of

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
trying to get just pick a little bit of

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.289 
trying to get just pick a little bit of
the<00:03:25.650> vinyl<00:03:26.040> off<00:03:26.220> on<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.730> edges<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:29.299> you're

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
the vinyl off on the edges and you're

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:37.220 
the vinyl off on the edges and you're
just<00:03:30.450> gonna<00:03:30.660> peel<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.079> away<00:03:35.959> okay

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
just gonna peel it away okay

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.110 
just gonna peel it away okay
this<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.680> last<00:03:37.920> step<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.579> it's<00:03:38.940> to

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
this is the last step and it's to

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.660 
this is the last step and it's to
distress<00:03:39.660> your<00:03:39.840> board<00:03:40.200> now<00:03:40.829> it's<00:03:41.069> optional

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
distress your board now it's optional

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.880 
distress your board now it's optional
but<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.940> always<00:03:42.390> like<00:03:42.599> to<00:03:42.630> do<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.110> because<00:03:43.650> it

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
but I always like to do it because it

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.530 
but I always like to do it because it
adds<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.160> little<00:03:44.340> bit<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.579> character<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.450> you

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
adds a little bit of character so you

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.990 
adds a little bit of character so you
just<00:03:45.690> take<00:03:45.930> some<00:03:46.230> basic<00:03:46.410> sandpaper<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.819> you

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
just take some basic sandpaper and you

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.420 
just take some basic sandpaper and you
just<00:03:48.239> sand<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:48.780> edges<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.769> can<00:03:49.980> go<00:03:50.130> through

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
just sand the edges you can go through

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.319 
just sand the edges you can go through
both<00:03:50.959> layers<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.470> spray<00:03:52.950> paint<00:03:52.980> or<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:54.150> can

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
both layers of spray paint or you can

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.069 
both layers of spray paint or you can
just<00:03:54.600> stand<00:03:54.870> directly<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.829> wood
