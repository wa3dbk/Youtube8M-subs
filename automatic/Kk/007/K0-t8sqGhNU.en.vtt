first two songs and now we're just like
well<00:03:27.310> we<00:03:27.459> got<00:03:27.580> to<00:03:27.640> come<00:03:27.760> up<00:03:27.790> with<00:03:27.879> something

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
well we got to come up with something

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.360 
well we got to come up with something
pretty<00:03:28.209> badass<00:03:28.569> for<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:28.989> third<00:03:29.140> one<00:03:29.319> so<00:03:29.560> so

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
pretty badass for the third one so so

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.220 
pretty badass for the third one so so
it's<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.760> little<00:03:30.910> more<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.299> epic<00:03:31.569> side<00:03:31.810> but

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
it's a little more on the epic side but

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.559 
it's a little more on the epic side but
I<00:03:32.500> think<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:33.159> flows<00:03:33.640> nicely<00:03:33.670> in<00:03:34.269> our<00:03:34.329> little

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
I think it flows nicely in our little

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.050 
I think it flows nicely in our little
trilogy<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.019> zombie<00:03:35.470> songs<00:03:35.709> we<00:03:36.640> got<00:03:36.790> kind<00:03:37.000> of

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
trilogy of zombie songs we got kind of

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.330 
trilogy of zombie songs we got kind of
ripped<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.390> pieces<00:03:37.500> with<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.590> second<00:03:38.980> one<00:03:39.099> so

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
ripped to pieces with the second one so

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.220 
ripped to pieces with the second one so
hopefully<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.910> fans<00:03:39.940> will<00:03:40.329> like<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:41.049> one<00:03:41.200> a
