skills<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:16.380> way<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.190> with<00:01:17.550> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
skills and the way we do that is with a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.520 
skills and the way we do that is with a
scaffolding<00:01:18.330> technique<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.900> these

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
scaffolding technique and these

scaffolding technique and these
scaffolding<00:01:20.190> techniques<00:01:20.610> are<00:01:20.760> what<00:01:20.880> I'm

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
scaffolding techniques are what I'm

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.490 
scaffolding techniques are what I'm
going<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.300> demonstrating<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.410> the
