like<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.569> 20-second<00:03:07.410> black<00:03:07.680> ops<00:03:07.890> 1<00:03:08.040> clip<00:03:08.519> in

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
like a 20-second black ops 1 clip in

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.900 
like a 20-second black ops 1 clip in
like<00:03:08.910> horrendous<00:03:09.510> quality<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.910> despite

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
like horrendous quality and despite

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.009 
like horrendous quality and despite
people<00:03:12.180> wondering<00:03:12.480> whether<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.750> was<00:03:12.870> me<00:03:12.900> or

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
people wondering whether it was me or

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.569 
people wondering whether it was me or
not<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.350> was<00:03:13.470> actually<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:14.069> of<00:03:14.100> my<00:03:14.190> clips

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
not it was actually one of my clips

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.309 
not it was actually one of my clips
because<00:03:14.790> if<00:03:15.180> my<00:03:15.480> memory<00:03:15.690> serves<00:03:15.870> me<00:03:16.230> right

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
because if my memory serves me right

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.620 
because if my memory serves me right
that<00:03:16.680> was<00:03:17.040> one<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.519> first<00:03:17.819> clips<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.389> ever

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.670 
off I'm guessing most of you guys
realize<00:03:45.540> there<00:03:45.780> wasn't<00:03:46.079> me<00:03:46.139> because<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.590> know

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
quality it was black ops 1 I mean that

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.210 
quality it was black ops 1 I mean that
should<00:03:51.150> have<00:03:51.329> been<00:03:51.359> enough

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220

happened<00:04:13.460> with<00:04:13.550> that<00:04:13.580> video<00:04:13.820> i<00:04:14.120> can<00:04:14.510> only

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
happened with that video i can only

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.110 
happened with that video i can only
guess<00:04:15.010> common<00:04:16.010> sense<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.489> logic<00:04:16.579> you<00:04:17.030> know

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
guess common sense and logic you know

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.759 
guess common sense and logic you know
kind<00:04:17.390> of<00:04:17.480> leading<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.109> believe<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:18.440> probably

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
kind of leading to believe I probably

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.920 
kind of leading to believe I probably
wasn't<00:04:19.070> hacked<00:04:19.430> because<00:04:19.700> if<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.180> were<00:04:20.359> hacked<00:04:20.660> a

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
wasn't hacked because if I were hacked a

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.230 
wasn't hacked because if I were hacked a
the<00:04:21.859> hacker<00:04:22.070> wouldn't<00:04:22.490> actually<00:04:22.640> have<00:04:22.850> access

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
the hacker wouldn't actually have access

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.700 
the hacker wouldn't actually have access
to<00:04:23.390> my<00:04:23.540> password<00:04:24.020> like<00:04:24.170> they<00:04:24.320> may<00:04:24.500> actually

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
to my password like they may actually

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.200 
to my password like they may actually
have<00:04:24.980> access<00:04:25.220> to<00:04:25.280> my<00:04:25.400> channel<00:04:25.700> but<00:04:25.850> they<00:04:26.000> would

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
have access to my channel but they would

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.700 
have access to my channel but they would
really<00:04:26.480> never<00:04:26.690> have<00:04:26.930> access<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.410> my<00:04:27.530> actual

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
password unless they somehow figured it

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.100 
password unless they somehow figured it
out<00:04:29.420> which<00:04:29.960> they<00:04:30.260> wouldn't<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:31.960> because<00:04:32.960> when

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
out which they wouldn't and because when

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.810 
out which they wouldn't and because when
I<00:04:33.140> tried<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.500> log<00:04:33.620> in<00:04:33.830> my<00:04:34.040> password<00:04:34.280> was<00:04:34.640> still

I tried to log in my password was still

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.190 
I tried to log in my password was still
the<00:04:34.940> same<00:04:35.120> there's<00:04:35.390> no<00:04:35.540> way<00:04:35.690> a<00:04:35.720> hacker<00:04:35.960> could

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
the same there's no way a hacker could

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.300 
the same there's no way a hacker could
have<00:04:36.320> you<00:04:36.380> know<00:04:36.470> hacked<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:36.860> my<00:04:36.980> channel

uploading the video and then swamp the

uploading the video and then swamp the
password<00:04:39.440> back<00:04:39.590> like<00:04:39.800> that<00:04:39.920> makes<00:04:40.160> no<00:04:40.340> sense

password back like that makes no sense

you<00:04:43.340> know<00:04:43.810> hacking<00:04:44.810> would<00:04:45.020> actually<00:04:45.350> do<00:04:45.530> so<00:04:46.130> I

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
you know hacking would actually do so I

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.600 
you know hacking would actually do so I
don't<00:04:47.390> think<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.720> was<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:47.840> hacker<00:04:48.080> in<00:04:48.260> any<00:04:48.380> way

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
don't think it was a hacker in any way

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.850 
don't think it was a hacker in any way
the<00:04:49.610> possible<00:04:50.150> things<00:04:50.450> in<00:04:50.750> my<00:04:51.110> mind<00:04:51.380> that<00:04:51.500> you

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
the possible things in my mind that you

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.740 
the possible things in my mind that you
know<00:04:52.040> it<00:04:52.190> could<00:04:52.340> have<00:04:52.490> been<00:04:52.610> one<00:04:53.300> of<00:04:53.330> them<00:04:53.540> of

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
know it could have been one of them of

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.690 
know it could have been one of them of
course<00:04:53.930> is<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:54.650> could<00:04:54.950> have<00:04:55.070> somehow<00:04:55.280> been

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
course is it could have somehow been

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.430 
course is it could have somehow been

couple months after the game came out so

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.190 
couple months after the game came out so
it's<00:05:04.220> been<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.370> few<00:05:04.669> years<00:05:04.730> since<00:05:05.030> it's<00:05:05.750> even

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
it's been a few years since it's even

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.860 
it's been a few years since it's even

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
touched the game in ages it probably has

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.780 
touched the game in ages it probably has
like<00:05:11.150> four<00:05:11.840> inches<00:05:11.960> of<00:05:12.169> dust<00:05:12.320> on<00:05:12.500> top<00:05:12.560> early<00:05:12.790> be

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
like four inches of dust on top early be

like four inches of dust on top early be
I<00:05:13.820> wasn't<00:05:14.390> anywhere<00:05:14.840> close<00:05:14.900> to<00:05:15.140> my<00:05:15.380> you<00:05:15.440> know

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
I wasn't anywhere close to my you know

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.980 
I wasn't anywhere close to my you know
youtube<00:05:15.919> channel<00:05:16.250> or<00:05:16.430> ps3<00:05:16.880> at<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.630> time<00:05:17.810> the

youtube channel or ps3 at the time the

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.270 
youtube channel or ps3 at the time the
video<00:05:18.110> was<00:05:18.229> uploaded<00:05:18.440> so<00:05:18.830> it's<00:05:18.950> not<00:05:19.010> like<00:05:19.160> I

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
video was uploaded so it's not like I

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.620 
video was uploaded so it's not like I
accidentally<00:05:19.790> clicked<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.240> button<00:05:20.270> somewhere

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
accidentally clicked a button somewhere

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.360 
accidentally clicked a button somewhere
or<00:05:21.260> something<00:05:21.470> and<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:21.919> video<00:05:22.160> you<00:05:22.280> know

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
or something and the video you know

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.640 
or something and the video you know
automatically<00:05:23.150> got<00:05:23.330> uploaded<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:24.560> other

automatically got uploaded the other

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.440 
automatically got uploaded the other
weird<00:05:24.950> one<00:05:25.160> is<00:05:25.310> it<00:05:25.520> could<00:05:25.729> potentially<00:05:25.880> be<00:05:26.330> my

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
weird one is it could potentially be my

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.360 
weird one is it could potentially be my
network<00:05:26.960> because<00:05:27.260> oftentimes<00:05:27.890> you<00:05:28.250> know

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
network because oftentimes you know

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.850 
network because oftentimes you know
every<00:05:28.910> time<00:05:29.060> you<00:05:29.150> partner<00:05:29.570> your<00:05:29.840> or<00:05:30.169> with<00:05:30.620> most

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
every time you partner your or with most

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.680 
every time you partner your or with most
networks<00:05:31.310> if<00:05:31.460> you<00:05:31.550> park<00:05:31.760> near<00:05:31.910> channel<00:05:32.270> they

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
networks if you park near channel they

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.450 
networks if you park near channel they
usually<00:05:32.990> have<00:05:33.169> some<00:05:33.440> level<00:05:33.860> of<00:05:33.919> access<00:05:34.160> to

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
usually have some level of access to

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.430 
usually have some level of access to
your<00:05:34.550> channel<00:05:34.790> so<00:05:35.120> they<00:05:35.300> you<00:05:35.510> know<00:05:35.540> Tim<00:05:35.840> for

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
your channel so they you know Tim for

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.050 
your channel so they you know Tim for
example<00:05:36.830> like<00:05:37.040> videos<00:05:37.490> and<00:05:37.520> so<00:05:37.760> on<00:05:37.910> like

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
example like videos and so on like

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.850 
example like videos and so on like
machinima<00:05:38.450> did<00:05:38.660> that<00:05:38.810> back<00:05:38.990> and<00:05:39.350> they<00:05:39.590> along

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
machinima did that back and they along

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.710 
machinima did that back and they along
so<00:05:40.400> could<00:05:40.700> potentially<00:05:41.120> have<00:05:41.210> been<00:05:41.330> my<00:05:41.479> net

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
so could potentially have been my net

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.710 
so could potentially have been my net
forget<00:05:42.080> uploaded<00:05:42.530> it<00:05:42.650> but<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:42.919> don't<00:05:43.430> know<00:05:44.390> like

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
I have no idea how it actually got up

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.360 
I have no idea how it actually got up
there<00:05:47.300> so<00:05:47.510> I<00:05:47.540> will<00:05:47.750> the<00:05:47.840> shock<00:05:48.110> this<00:05:48.320> everybody

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
there so I will the shock this everybody

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.390 
there so I will the shock this everybody
here<00:05:49.520> and<00:05:49.850> it<00:05:50.810> was<00:05:51.199> like<00:05:51.440> it<00:05:52.070> was<00:05:52.190> a<00:05:52.220> little

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
here and it was like it was a little

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.010 
here and it was like it was a little
scary<00:05:52.610> first<00:05:53.030> I<00:05:53.150> mean<00:05:53.300> you<00:05:53.479> know<00:05:53.570> I<00:05:53.630> always

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.270 
scary first I mean you know I always
instantly<00:05:54.410> changed<00:05:54.800> my<00:05:54.889> pass<00:05:55.100> from

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
instantly changed my pass from

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.439 
instantly changed my pass from
everything<00:05:55.639> like<00:05:55.820> that<00:05:55.850> just<00:05:56.150> to<00:05:56.270> make<00:05:56.419> sure

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
but I still have no idea how that

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.960 
but I still have no idea how that
actually<00:05:59.660> managed<00:06:00.169> to<00:06:00.229> get<00:06:00.440> up<00:06:00.590> so<00:06:01.250> I<00:06:01.550> hope

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970
