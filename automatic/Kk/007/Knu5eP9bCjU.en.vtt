00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.570
 pa 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.570
 Hmm 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.820
 tai

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.550
 ana 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.970
 Hmm 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.530
 Yes eh 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.770
 the sound of the boss ce 5 chorus ensemble has decided 6 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.710
 a 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:07.750
 It was c 1 of the first generation of the Oni met, but it was named Chorus Ensemble 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:11.080
 I Kedomo is in place does Mase c 2 c 3 after that I went with ch 1 in the chorus 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:16.250
 It was named something like super chorus or something 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:21.350
 That's why c 5 finally cola 33 minutes that original name 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:27.140
 With respect to Well of chorus after even the very the chorus was a hit its supposed to wear 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:31.790
 From also model change without 91 years but is excluding the twin pedal series up to now 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.840
 High it only of that perfection has been active as the current model 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.240
 I think Fu that the culmination of kana not had a chorus 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.840
 Yes 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:46.670
 As a feature, that Corless is three-dimensional and deep like to freeze the boss very much after all 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.920
 It is characterized by a thick chorus 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:55.800
 It is equipped with a filter that is distinctive in terms of function Hi-Lo 2-band filter 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.860
 Very that because we are 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.950
 That's where fine sound making became more possible 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:08.450
 How are the impressions? 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.690
 Somehow this and crispy even Unlike analog chorus 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.810
 The rise of the sound is high 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:20.880
 I think that it is a characteristic that does not feel crispy Yes 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.069
 This filter mode mode a bit and you won't be a bit 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:29.580
 See you 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:32.330
 Now maybe Which is also quite won cut and the way this is to so I think has become flat 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.940
 Let's go for a while 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:41.700
 Since the right-hand side of most has become a controller of biaxial 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:47.190
 I'm asking you both until around 11 o'clock 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.110
 Yes ahead is cracked brilliantly and for the time being A'tsu is I guess is better to cut forecast from Yes 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.850
 Well then 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.850
 It went up about the same 11 pm 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.680

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:11.379
 me 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:13.299
 I become full that super-casino very mild that yes but the effect of that chorus Tosu 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.560
 That time when chorus was applied 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:21.890
 What a good thing that a little school 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.890
 Because I can suppress something like a bad thing so much 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.739
 It's a very useful non-farmer with this filter that's very useful , especially when used with backing 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.310
 I think so 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.930
 Yes 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:38.620
 This softening 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.440
 The sound is sharp as there is only putting . 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.650
 Oh this is very 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.519
 that 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:51.060
 Space gate processing and say either I mean easy-to-use Well 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:56.380
 Sound that would fill anti-round fu Wow and country 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.600
 Now for such a Yes I'm there is or rather tend to with it is a nice place 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.940
 Women can do it 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.930
 It seems easy to handle 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.550
 Then 8 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:11.590
 Let's pull it a little more with the sound of such a feces 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.590

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.580
