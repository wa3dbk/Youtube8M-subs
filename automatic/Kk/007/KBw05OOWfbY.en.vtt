little bit I've got to see most

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.390 
little bit I've got to see most
everything<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.240> mythic<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.100> I<00:00:23.100> didn't<00:00:23.369> really

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
everything in mythic and I didn't really

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.130 
everything in mythic and I didn't really
play<00:00:23.880> hardcore<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.570> could<00:00:24.750> get<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.960> see<00:00:25.109> all

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
play hardcore but I could get to see all

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.410 
play hardcore but I could get to see all
the<00:00:25.320> content<00:00:25.740> which<00:00:26.090> for<00:00:27.090> me<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.300> was<00:00:27.359> really

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the content which for me it was really

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.910 
the content which for me it was really
really<00:00:27.750> good<00:00:27.840> i<00:00:27.960> thought<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> content<00:00:28.740> was

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.919 
really good i thought the content was
awesome<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:30.029> was<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> majority<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.229 
was very good i did take a lot of work
from<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.860> range<00:00:35.070> perspective<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.760> ultimately

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
from a range perspective but ultimately

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.650 
from a range perspective but ultimately
i<00:00:36.590> wanted<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> give<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.920> my<00:00:37.950> thoughts<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.660> the

legion so obviously everybody's going to
roll<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.120> your<00:00:42.360> honor<00:00:42.510> let's<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.140> honest

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
everybody's going to pop in the game pay

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.729

for<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> month<00:00:45.510> play<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> demon<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.410> her<00:00:46.530> right

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
for a month play a demon on her right

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.670 
for a month play a demon on her right
but<00:00:47.899> realistically<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.110> does<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.379> mean

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
but realistically what does this mean

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.810 
but realistically what does this mean
the<00:00:50.430> fact<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.270> only<00:00:51.300> had<00:00:52.039> really<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.309> raid

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the fact that we only had really to raid

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
the fact that we only had really to raid
tears<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.539> entire<00:00:54.809> expansion<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.620> now

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
tears in this entire expansion and now

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.360 
tears in this entire expansion and now
that<00:00:56.489> they're<00:00:56.640> already<00:00:56.879> rolling<00:00:57.149> out<00:00:57.360> another

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
that they're already rolling out another

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.779 
that they're already rolling out another
expansion<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.820> top<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:01.079> um<00:01:01.789> which

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
expansion on top of this one um which

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.210 
expansion on top of this one um which
means<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.930> August<00:01:04.739> now<00:01:04.920> it'll

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
means what if it's August now it'll

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.910 
means what if it's August now it'll
probably<00:01:05.460> come<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.200> August<00:01:07.200> next<00:01:07.470> year<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
probably come out August next year I

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.950 
probably come out August next year I
mean<00:01:08.670> that's<00:01:08.790> their<00:01:09.000> track<00:01:09.270> record<00:01:09.420> right<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
mean that's their track record right so

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.920 
mean that's their track record right so
you're<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.320> playing<00:01:11.750> current<00:01:12.750> WOD

you're going to be playing current WOD
for<00:01:13.140> another<00:01:13.290> year<00:01:13.799> which<00:01:14.100> again<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.369> about

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
for another year which again is about

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.429 
for another year which again is about
what<00:01:15.119> time<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.509> would<00:01:15.630> normally<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.049> but

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
what time they would normally do but

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.200 
what time they would normally do but

in<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.310> itself<00:02:46.459> done<00:02:46.849> it's<00:02:47.329> probably

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
in and of itself done it's probably

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.390 
in and of itself done it's probably
actually<00:02:47.780> being<00:02:48.019> fed<00:02:48.290> now<00:02:48.530> by<00:02:49.099> their<00:02:49.250> other

breaking in the FPS market but i

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.069 
breaking in the FPS market but i
honestly<00:02:52.849> think<00:02:53.209> what<00:02:53.360> blizzard<00:02:53.660> did<00:02:53.870> was

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
honestly think what blizzard did was

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.809 
honestly think what blizzard did was
they<00:02:54.290> scrapped<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.739> MMO<00:02:55.069> because<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.730> new

the market completely changed it in the

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.200 
the market completely changed it in the
next<00:05:29.960> five<00:05:30.140> years<00:05:30.350> and<00:05:30.620> again<00:05:31.610> I<00:05:31.820> don't<00:05:31.880> see<00:05:32.060> it

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.940 
next five years and again I don't see it
i<00:05:32.419> think<00:05:32.479> what<00:05:33.110> blizzard<00:05:33.410> is<00:05:33.530> done<00:05:33.710> is<00:05:33.860> an

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
i think what blizzard is done is an

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.890 
i think what blizzard is done is an
absolutely<00:05:34.460> incredible<00:05:34.640> track<00:05:35.390> record<00:05:35.780> and

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
absolutely incredible track record and

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.770 
absolutely incredible track record and
what<00:05:36.560> they<00:05:36.650> continue<00:05:37.010> to<00:05:37.130> do<00:05:37.250> is<00:05:37.479> unreal<00:05:38.479> in

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
what they continue to do is unreal in

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.290 
what they continue to do is unreal in
how<00:05:39.200> good<00:05:39.560> they<00:05:39.770> are<00:05:39.979> at<00:05:40.130> what<00:05:40.280> they<00:05:40.430> do<00:05:40.490> and<00:05:40.850> I

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
how good they are at what they do and I

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.909 
how good they are at what they do and I
think<00:05:41.330> honestly<00:05:42.169> they<00:05:42.440> would<00:05:42.590> have<00:05:42.680> had<00:05:42.800> to

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
think honestly they would have had to

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.860 
think honestly they would have had to
announce<00:05:43.100> it<00:05:43.340> by<00:05:43.460> now<00:05:43.669> by<00:05:44.270> now<00:05:44.479> there's<00:05:44.750> no

announce it by now by now there's no
reason<00:05:45.229> not<00:05:45.350> to<00:05:45.410> so<00:05:46.040> I<00:05:46.070> don't<00:05:46.430> think<00:05:46.610> against

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940
