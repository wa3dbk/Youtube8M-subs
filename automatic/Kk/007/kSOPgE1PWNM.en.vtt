00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.800
 The American Woodmark Corporation is one of the largest manufacturers of kitchen and bathroom tiles in the United States. 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.900
 We have nine different production locations. 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.400
 We serve both Lowes and the Home Depot as some of the best manufacturers in the country. 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.500
 My team is working on PC support for the company. 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.200
 We work in multiple production facilities in the United States. 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.800
 It is great that Logic Supply helps us with the environment in our production halls. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.300
 As you can imagine, as a manufacturer of kitchen cabinets, we have a dusty work floor, especially in the production hall. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.700
 Normal desktop solutions in production environments sometimes cause problems 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.200
 technicians then have to stop the machines. 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.100
 Downtime is a major problem in our industry. 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.000
 Then the technicians have to clean the motherboards from all the dust that has accumulated ... 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.000
 Since we started working with Logic Supply and found these fanless units, we don't have to do that anymore. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.300
 When I first went looking for a company that could provide us with a fanless solution for production halls, 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.300
 Logic Supply was one of the first hits to appear in my search results. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.200
 After visiting the website after using the chat function, 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.400
 I immediately received help navigating through the site 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200
 to find the solution that I really needed. 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.600
 American Woodmark's Josh has approached us through our online chat system 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.000
 and contacted me. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.300
 He asked about our closed, fanless systems. 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.200
 The first conversation with Amy on the phone was fantastic. 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.600
 She was really in tune with what we needed. 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.000
 She guided us through the process and helped us step by step 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.900
 in finding the right solution. 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.200
 She helped me a lot and I enjoy working with Amy. 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.160
 We were able to discuss this quickly in the chat 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.200
 and then switched to the phone to understand 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.000
 what was needed for his project. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.200
 We decided that the ML250 was the best choice. 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.000
 This has a small size, is completely closed and has the required I / O. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 He was a good replacement for the equipment that was already being used. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.500
 I was very surprised with the system. 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.500
 They are small systems, and yet they have the power that we needed. 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.200
 All systems have now been in use for about a year and we had a failure rate of less than 1%. 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.200
 From day 1 I didn't have to worry about the product. 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.200
 I also didn't have to worry about the relationship between American Woodmark and Logic Supply. 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.800
 The entire process that started with online chatting, 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.600
 the conversation with Amy on the phone, 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.600
 receiving the product from Logic Supply; 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.600
 everything was excellent 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.200
 and I'm glad I went to Logic Supply for our fanless PCs. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.500
