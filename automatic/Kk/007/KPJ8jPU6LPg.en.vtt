00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.800
 Lemper told me this forum 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.570
 I think family 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.570
 I recommend the brown boy channel 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.229
 the theme this week is violence in videogames 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.969
 nothing I'm an expert in video games in much less in human behavior 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.839
 and this they are going to say and this is not a very current issue 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.100
 but affordable that I do not expect you until today that children have stopped 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.390
 play with toys 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.110
 and everywhere canada your portable consoles and for nothing finished and that 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.330
 they have which bakken I can not name 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.500
 and for nothing I think it's bad that 3-year-old children was overnight 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.740
 the bad thing is when those funds are not controlled and these days but when 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.000
 you do not explicitly see blood death abuse 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.810
 and a lot of violence but that unfortunately is the same as we can 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.110
 see in any news was at the time of tamayo food that makes 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.100
 weeks could the first television at three in the afternoon as name was 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.979
 attacked with machetes and of course without any censure because if it is not enough 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.500
 of beijing but good thing the theme this week are video games in the great 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.729
 number of studies that lies or denies 10 and violent video games 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.080
 can cause violence in the players and as in everything I like to share 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.550
 my opinion 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.210
 something that is very true is that people 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.060
 besides all 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.080
 they commit violent acts and many studies say that the cause of 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.590
 young people commit these crimes 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.640
 the violence that exists in videogames and the influence that it has on 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.370
 people that can us 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.729
 personally I do not think there have been games that are 100% responsible 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.210
 that parents commit these crimes 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.680
 since it would mean that all the people who go to that agreement 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.460
 Sooner or later to commit murder are extremely people 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.840
 violent 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.619
 but of course I hope to do you with extreme violence and if the end of being 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.780
 human this means that every time we occupy more violence to have 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.280
 some reaction when the motion 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.270
 panahi surprise that they always wanted to learn to play video games 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.200
 because honestly how nice I've played is Maria Moqueta 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.229
 p 10 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.219
 once god father 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:30.139
 I think it's everything and like every afternoon in the year the genre that he likes the most 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.840
 the serve in which there is blood and I confess 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.599
 I never thought about pulling desired to attack anyone 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.529
 abi good good except some secretaries out there in times of infections 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:45.409
 that's why we hope you should not blame video games like the complete 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.199
 reason for the violent acts that young people have today 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:53.099
 but what do you think is good we do not have a lot of parquet in Madrid and 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.819
 it is referred to the end
