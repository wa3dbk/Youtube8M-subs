00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
very little and realizing like how I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.540 
very little and realizing like how I
think<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.140> mac<00:02:07.320> vs<00:02:07.590> mac<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.099> with

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
think this is mac vs mac and then with

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.800 
think this is mac vs mac and then with
the<00:02:08.640> way<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.030> played<00:02:09.360> out<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.720> was

a little bit ahead i think i can get
away<00:02:11.520> with<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.819> third<00:02:12.000> base<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.360> now<00:02:12.420> that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
away with that third base right now that

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.900

we're<00:03:54.920> positioning<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:55.550> by<00:03:55.730> a<00:03:55.760> major<00:03:56.330> and

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
we're positioning that by a major and

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.660 
we're positioning that by a major and
also<00:03:56.870> just<00:03:57.020> pulling<00:03:57.410> back<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.070> little<00:03:58.459> bit

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
also just pulling back a little bit

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.550 
also just pulling back a little bit
letting<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.120> 3rd<00:03:59.360> marine<00:03:59.690> joining<00:04:00.050> this<00:04:00.170> army

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
letting the 3rd marine joining this army

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.260 
letting the 3rd marine joining this army
if<00:04:00.709> it's<00:04:01.130> just<00:04:01.280> two<00:04:01.459> Marines<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:02.000> would<00:04:02.180> have

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
if it's just two Marines that would have

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
if it's just two Marines that would have
gone<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.420> complete<00:04:02.780> all<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:02.959> way<00:04:03.170> around

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
gone to complete all the way around

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.900 
gone to complete all the way around
there's<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:03.830> good<00:04:03.980> chance<00:04:04.190> that<00:04:04.370> major<00:04:04.580> losses

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
there's a good chance that major losses

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.090 
there's a good chance that major losses
both<00:04:05.209> Marines<00:04:05.600> before<00:04:06.140> killing<00:04:06.530> either<00:04:06.860> dead

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
of course tasia is expanding and this is

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.530 
of course tasia is expanding and this is
not<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.770> end<00:04:12.950> of<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.160> world<00:04:13.400> just<00:04:13.700> yet<00:04:13.820> but

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
not the end of the world just yet but

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.970 
not the end of the world just yet but
you<00:04:14.690> don't<00:04:14.930> want<00:04:15.140> to<00:04:15.230> lose<00:04:15.380> your<00:04:15.530> rip<00:04:15.709> like

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
that and major you would almost say that

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.780 
that and major you would almost say that
it's<00:04:18.260> inevitable<00:04:19.070> that<00:04:19.130> he's<00:04:19.370> going<00:04:19.580> to<00:04:19.669> do

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
it's inevitable that he's going to do

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.159 
it's inevitable that he's going to do
quite<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.060> bit<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.239> damage<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.810> either<00:04:20.930> these

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
Marines all these aliens or maybe both

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.150 
Marines all these aliens or maybe both
at<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.539> same<00:04:23.750> time<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.229> where<00:04:24.650> a<00:04:24.680> stage<00:04:24.979> are

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
at the same time and where a stage are

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.379 
at the same time and where a stage are
going<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.520> position<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:26.150> very<00:04:26.450> few<00:04:26.810> units

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389
