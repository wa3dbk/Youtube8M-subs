I have to say Slayer helps a bunch with
this<00:05:11.979> like<00:05:12.190> decision<00:05:12.669> making<00:05:13.000> for<00:05:13.150> monsters

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
this like decision making for monsters

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.659 
this like decision making for monsters
if<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.500> have<00:05:14.590> a<00:05:14.650> special<00:05:14.860> monster<00:05:15.130> they<00:05:15.370> like

if you have a special monster they like
go<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:16.090> it<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.570> then<00:05:16.720> bosses<00:05:17.169> are<00:05:17.289> really<00:05:17.500> good

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
go to it and then bosses are really good

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.650 
go to it and then bosses are really good
if<00:05:18.430> you<00:05:18.699> have<00:05:18.909> the<00:05:19.180> time<00:05:19.389> to<00:05:19.780> stay<00:05:19.960> there

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.210 

okay<00:05:25.660> so<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.200> last<00:05:26.380> thing<00:05:26.560> that<00:05:26.680> I<00:05:26.890> wanted<00:05:27.130> to

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
okay so the last thing that I wanted to

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.450 
okay so the last thing that I wanted to
say<00:05:27.430> is<00:05:27.700> that<00:05:28.590> you<00:05:29.590> pretty<00:05:29.620> much<00:05:29.890> have<00:05:30.130> to<00:05:30.190> find

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
say is that you pretty much have to find

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.600 
say is that you pretty much have to find
your<00:05:30.580> own<00:05:30.640> method<00:05:31.030> you<00:05:31.210> guys<00:05:31.360> I<00:05:31.950> found<00:05:32.950> this

method<00:05:34.000> that<00:05:34.120> I<00:05:34.180> like<00:05:34.450> because<00:05:34.810> what<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:35.860> did

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
method that I like because what I did

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.100

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
was go on to the grand exchange for the

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.570 
was go on to the grand exchange for the
main<00:05:38.410> page<00:05:38.620> and<00:05:38.830> then<00:05:39.700> look<00:05:39.910> at<00:05:40.030> items<00:05:40.510> that

main page and then look at items that

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.580 
main page and then look at items that
weren't<00:05:42.580> very<00:05:42.940> common<00:05:43.540> like<00:05:43.930> they<00:05:44.320> didn't

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
weren't very common like they didn't

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.980 
weren't very common like they didn't
come<00:05:45.040> out<00:05:45.070> as<00:05:45.430> often<00:05:45.640> but<00:05:45.940> they<00:05:46.090> were<00:05:46.150> a<00:05:46.390> decent

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
come out as often but they were a decent

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.550 
come out as often but they were a decent
price<00:05:47.440> like<00:05:48.340> in<00:05:48.460> mining<00:05:48.930> something<00:05:49.930> that's<00:05:50.080> 1k

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
price like in mining something that's 1k

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.950 
price like in mining something that's 1k
like<00:05:50.830> an<00:05:50.920> award<00:05:51.160> is<00:05:51.370> like<00:05:51.610> adamant<00:05:52.060> war<00:05:52.240> which

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
like an award is like adamant war which

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.250 
like an award is like adamant war which
is<00:05:53.110> 70<00:05:53.590> but<00:05:54.400> on<00:05:54.670> the<00:05:55.030> other<00:05:55.120> hand<00:05:55.240> granite<00:05:56.080> is

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
is 70 but on the other hand granite is

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.940 
is 70 but on the other hand granite is
up<00:05:56.680> to<00:05:56.860> 1.5<00:05:57.520> k<00:05:57.790> so<00:05:58.720> since<00:05:59.110> I<00:05:59.200> have<00:05:59.230> a<00:05:59.350> yak<00:05:59.650> I

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
up to 1.5 k so since I have a yak I

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.000 
up to 1.5 k so since I have a yak I
bought<00:06:00.610> yak<00:06:01.090> scrolls<00:06:01.510> and<00:06:01.840> I<00:06:02.260> went<00:06:02.530> out<00:06:02.680> to<00:06:02.710> the

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
bought yak scrolls and I went out to the

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.340 
bought yak scrolls and I went out to the
mining<00:06:03.310> area<00:06:03.760> and<00:06:03.970> it<00:06:04.570> turns<00:06:04.780> out<00:06:04.930> that<00:06:04.990> this

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
mining area and it turns out that this

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.050 
mining area and it turns out that this
is<00:06:05.590> extremely<00:06:06.040> efficient<00:06:06.520> and<00:06:06.700> I<00:06:06.760> think<00:06:06.940> it

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
is extremely efficient and I think it

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.150 
is extremely efficient and I think it
actually<00:06:07.150> raises<00:06:07.630> your<00:06:07.930> money<00:06:08.380> speed<00:06:09.040> per

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
actually raises your money speed per

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.940 
actually raises your money speed per
hour<00:06:09.310> when<00:06:09.550> you're<00:06:09.730> at<00:06:09.850> the<00:06:10.060> granite<00:06:10.930> mine<00:06:11.110> not

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
hour when you're at the granite mine not

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.440 
hour when you're at the granite mine not
to<00:06:12.070> mention<00:06:12.220> I<00:06:12.490> think<00:06:12.820> you<00:06:12.940> can<00:06:13.060> make<00:06:13.180> up<00:06:13.300> to

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
to mention I think you can make up to

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.780 
to mention I think you can make up to
400<00:06:14.020> k<00:06:14.170> an<00:06:14.230> hour<00:06:14.380> year<00:06:14.770> that's<00:06:15.190> what<00:06:15.610> I<00:06:15.640> was

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
400 k an hour year that's what I was

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.710 
400 k an hour year that's what I was
ever<00:06:15.940> doing<00:06:16.150> out<00:06:16.300> to<00:06:16.480> I<00:06:16.780> started<00:06:17.260> doing<00:06:17.350> it<00:06:18.720> so

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
ever doing out to I started doing it so

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.420 
ever doing out to I started doing it so

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
probably noticed that this isn't the

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.210 
probably noticed that this isn't the
typical<00:06:53.200> type<00:06:53.680> of<00:06:53.860> money<00:06:54.100> making<00:06:54.430> guide<00:06:54.460> um<00:06:55.300> I

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
typical type of money making guide um I

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.290 
typical type of money making guide um I

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
didn't really want to show you as much

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.760 
didn't really want to show you as much
methods<00:06:58.810> that<00:06:58.960> I<00:06:59.020> knew<00:06:59.230> we're<00:06:59.410> going<00:06:59.560> to<00:06:59.620> be

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
methods that I knew we're going to be

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.780 
methods that I knew we're going to be
terrible<00:07:00.460> to<00:07:00.520> use<00:07:00.790> in<00:07:01.120> a<00:07:01.870> month<00:07:01.900> or<00:07:02.260> so<00:07:02.530> and<00:07:02.830> by

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:03.790 
terrible to use in a month or so and by

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.460 
terrible to use in a month or so and by
the<00:07:03.850> way<00:07:04.000> the<00:07:04.210> sand<00:07:04.450> method<00:07:04.780> is<00:07:04.990> probably

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
the way the sand method is probably

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.800 
the way the sand method is probably
going<00:07:05.590> to<00:07:05.680> be<00:07:05.740> very<00:07:06.070> useful<00:07:06.190> in<00:07:06.820> two<00:07:07.300> years<00:07:07.540> or

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
going to be very useful in two years or

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.900 
going to be very useful in two years or
so<00:07:07.990> we'll<00:07:08.380> probably<00:07:08.710> never<00:07:08.950> die<00:07:09.480> anyways<00:07:10.480> I

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:11.910 
so we'll probably never die anyways I

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.510 
so we'll probably never die anyways I
wanted<00:07:12.910> to<00:07:13.060> say<00:07:13.300> good<00:07:13.990> luck<00:07:14.020> to<00:07:14.350> you<00:07:14.500> guys<00:07:14.650> the
