00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.889
 Hello today I will explain how to make a 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.650
 Filled with gel as you can see the nail has 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.939
 grown up a bit and in this case he does not want 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.160
 that the long one touches him or that he 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.939
 do again then you would not have 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.130
 to file the tip of the nail simply 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.950
 with a soft file 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.950
 I will cut the area 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.810
 of the cuticle to reduce and equalize 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.810
 with the natural nail that has grown 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.490
 we deal with the whole nail to leave it 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.800
 mate 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.630
 with a softer file so as not to lower 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.840
 nor remove the target because in this case 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.110
 what we want is simply to fill 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.720
 in the nail area that he has grown 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.720
 and we also push the cuticle 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.020
 and is ready for the next step 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.960
 now that the nail is already polished and 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.119
 ready we apply the first product 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.180
 of preparation before the gel which is the 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.490
 1st 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.620
 we put it simply in the part of the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.640
 natural nail because about doing these 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:25.320
 Products do not act below 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.320
 applied the vonder that is the product 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.370
 specific for the gel 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.200
 also in the area that does not have gel and 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.630
 is ready for the next step 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.450
 once the product of 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.450
 preparation for the gel nail we put 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 first a transparent layer of gel 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.320
 this is the one that will dry up and the one that 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.770
 really sticks on the nail 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.630
 everything else takes layer on layer if 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.940
 you want to stretch is to the end and if 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.800
 not just the important thing is to fill 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.800
 that new part on the natural nail 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.790
 once dried layer being 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.710
 transparent I'm going to apply pink gel that 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.990
 is the one that had spread in the other 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.240
 occasion for the whole nail so that it does not 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.520
 notice the difference between what he has 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.840
 grown of nail and what I already had of nail 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.450
 of gel 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.110
 then he placed it mostly on the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.110
 new part 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.879
 I approach the cuticle without touching it 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.530
 and it is enough what I try is not 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.019
 cover the target the only thing that I intend 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.000
 at this moment it is to fill in the part of 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.340
 the nail that has grown and now of 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.340
 new three minutes in the lamp 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.500
 once the gel has dried, what 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.190
 we do is pass a Kleenex with a 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.650
 degreasing product because the layer 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.390
 superficial always stays sticky and 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.840
 Now what I'm going to do is the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.209
 irregularities polish them with a lot 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.770
 careful not to eliminate the target of 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.200
 tip 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.890
 yes 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.290
 he went over it and what I do is 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.519
 match the area that you added with the area 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.519
 of sherry that already had the nail 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.600
 with a lime a little thicker what 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.000
 I do is reduce if there is a month 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.710
 had in the cuticle part of that 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.750
 way when it grows up simply 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.410
 putting on a shine you can not see it for 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.410
 that he has grown 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:52.440
 I clean the nail again 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:56.300
 and I apply it immediately the brightness 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.300
 completely covering the nail 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.160
 approaching cuticle but if in 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.810
 without climbing on the skin but apart from 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.790
 that aesthetically does not look pretty 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.150
 there you would start to take off and 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.519
 new three minutes in lamp 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.139
 once after three minutes 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.199
 brightness has already dried and it has 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.710
 solidified remains as always a little 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.910
 sticky we passed again a paper 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.710
 soaked in a suitable product and 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.940
 we apply a little oil in the 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:38.240
 cuticle to hydrate it and we already have 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.190
 again the nail as new if you give 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.500
 account we have simply filled in that 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.090
 zone 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.090
 and you see how new
