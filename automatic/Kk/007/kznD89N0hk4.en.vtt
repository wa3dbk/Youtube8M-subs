developers have been nice enough to put

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.490 
developers have been nice enough to put
me<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.659> build<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.049> could<00:01:28.200> show<00:01:28.229> this

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
me on this build so I could show this

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.109 
me on this build so I could show this
for<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.799> guys<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.280> should<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.729> soon<00:01:29.759> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
for you guys but it should be up soon I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.429 
for you guys but it should be up soon I
can't<00:01:30.329> imagine<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.900> know<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.140> would<00:01:31.259> put

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
can't imagine you know they would put

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.810 
can't imagine you know they would put
out<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> update<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.220> then<00:01:32.340> wait<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
out the update and then wait like a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.460 
out the update and then wait like a
month<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.329> put<00:01:33.570> out<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> daily<00:01:34.020> quests<00:01:34.409> I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
month to put out the daily quests I

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.990 
month to put out the daily quests I
definitely<00:01:34.740> could<00:01:35.070> see<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.490> they<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:35.700> going

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
definitely could see that they are going

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.270 
definitely could see that they are going
to<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.270> putting<00:01:36.509> them<00:01:36.720> out<00:01:36.840> soon<00:01:37.560> or<00:01:37.770> hopefully

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
to be putting them out soon or hopefully

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.429 
to be putting them out soon or hopefully
I<00:01:38.310> hope<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.180> only<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.689> not<00:01:40.140> only<00:01:40.170> so

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
eager as eager as I am to play and I'm

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.380 
eager as eager as I am to play and I'm
not<00:01:46.500> even<00:01:46.770> my<00:01:47.130> attack<00:01:47.399> strategies<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.149> these

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
not even my attack strategies on these

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.550 
not even my attack strategies on these
bases<00:01:48.810> are<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.049> absolutely<00:01:49.200> hilarious

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
bases are just absolutely hilarious

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.800 
bases are just absolutely hilarious
because<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.250> guess<00:01:51.180> I'm<00:01:51.360> getting<00:01:51.450> kind<00:01:51.750> of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
because I guess I'm getting kind of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.179 
because I guess I'm getting kind of
cocky<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.500> yeah<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.860> I'm<00:01:53.070> gonna

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
cocky it's like yeah I know I'm gonna

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.740 
cocky it's like yeah I know I'm gonna
beat<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.820> place<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.329> troops<00:01:54.570> down

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
beat it so just place all my troops down

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.480 
beat it so just place all my troops down
and<00:01:55.200> whatever<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.470> there<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.799> go<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.189> get

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
and whatever but there we go now we get

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.100 
and whatever but there we go now we get
the<00:01:56.640> ice<00:01:56.820> chest<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.479> could<00:01:57.630> open<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.960> up

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the ice chest and we could open it up

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.550 
the ice chest and we could open it up
and<00:01:58.310> potentially<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.790> siku<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.750> ice<00:02:00.960> ancient

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and potentially get siku the ice ancient

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.620 
and potentially get siku the ice ancient
so<00:02:02.070> these<00:02:02.219> are<00:02:02.430> all<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> rewards<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.509> could

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
so these are all of the rewards we could

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.300 
so these are all of the rewards we could
possibly<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.229> from<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.530> we<00:02:04.710> actually<00:02:05.070> to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
possibly get from this we actually to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.950 
possibly get from this we actually to
