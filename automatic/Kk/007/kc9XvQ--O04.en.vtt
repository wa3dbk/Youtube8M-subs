00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
same as HTC EVO 3d so they're kind of

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.870 
same as HTC EVO 3d so they're kind of
the<00:00:34.350> same<00:00:34.559> phones<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.070> there<00:00:35.219> are<00:00:35.280> two<00:00:35.550> very

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the same phones but there are two very

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.270 
the same phones but there are two very
big<00:00:36.180> things<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.350> make<00:00:37.860> these<00:00:38.070> phone

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
big things that make these phone

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.010 
big things that make these phone
difference<00:00:38.700> two<00:00:39.030> different<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.719> each<00:00:39.809> other

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
difference two different to each other

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.080 
difference two different to each other
first<00:00:40.559> off<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.250> would<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
first off that you would really have a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.540 
first off that you would really have a
look<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.570> 3d<00:00:43.110> screen<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.489> you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
look at 3d screen it's like that so you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.529 
look at 3d screen it's like that so you
can<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.030> 3d<00:00:45.600> apps<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.079> then<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.190> rear

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
can have 3d apps and then on the rear

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.490 
can have 3d apps and then on the rear
you<00:00:48.539> have<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.140> 5<00:00:49.500> megapixel<00:00:49.710> camera<00:00:50.700> and

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
you have a 5 megapixel camera and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.410 
you have a 5 megapixel camera and
obviously<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.890> record<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.250> 3d<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
obviously you can record in 3d and that

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.180 
obviously you can record in 3d and that
is<00:00:54.570> something<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.079> can't<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.860> HTC

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
is something you can't on this HTC

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.189 
is something you can't on this HTC
Sensation<00:00:56.850> 4G<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:59.190> also<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.390> resolution<00:01:00.930> on

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
Sensation 4G so also the resolution on

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.830 
Sensation 4G so also the resolution on
the<00:01:01.590> front<00:01:01.859> camera<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.730> 8<00:01:03.149> megapixel<00:01:03.629> instead

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the front camera is 8 megapixel instead

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
the front camera is 8 megapixel instead
of<00:01:03.930> five<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.650> that's<00:01:05.250> very<00:01:05.369> big<00:01:05.880> difference

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
of five so that's very big difference

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.800 
of five so that's very big difference
there<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.500> shoot<00:01:07.770> 30<00:01:08.490> FPS<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
there that you can shoot 30 FPS at the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.980 
there that you can shoot 30 FPS at the
max<00:01:10.020> 1080p<00:01:10.740> resolution<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.119> let's<00:01:12.689> go<00:01:12.810> over

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
max 1080p resolution so let's go over

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.190 
max 1080p resolution so let's go over
