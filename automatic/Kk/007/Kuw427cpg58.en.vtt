00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
for this we're going to create a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.240 
for this we're going to create a
baseline<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.810> simple<00:01:19.350> baseline<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:20.040> going<00:01:20.189> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
baseline a simple baseline I'm going to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:31.850 
baseline a simple baseline I'm going to
loop<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:29.450> I'm<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.720> open<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:31.170> addictive

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
to match the loop that I've just

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.289 
to match the loop that I've just
