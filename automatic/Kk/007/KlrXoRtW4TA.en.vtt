00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
sociably it's a great sport I think if

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.750 
sociably it's a great sport I think if
there<00:01:38.140> are<00:01:38.230> golf<00:01:38.410> clubs<00:01:38.680> out<00:01:38.860> there<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.670> are

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
there are golf clubs out there that are

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.060 
there are golf clubs out there that are

kind of unsure on foot golf and the

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.250 
kind of unsure on foot golf and the
whole<00:01:42.220> project<00:01:42.730> does<00:01:42.850> it<00:01:42.970> work<00:01:43.120> I<00:01:43.360> think

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
whole project does it work I think

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.390 
whole project does it work I think
really<00:01:44.409> they<00:01:44.560> need<00:01:44.680> to<00:01:44.830> look<00:01:45.010> at<00:01:45.220> whether

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
really they need to look at whether

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.830 
really they need to look at whether
they're<00:01:45.610> caught<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:45.940> underutilized<00:01:46.270> whether

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
they're caught is underutilized whether

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.750 
they're caught is underutilized whether
the<00:01:46.960> facility<00:01:47.110> can<00:01:47.620> code<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:48.340> know<00:01:48.460> if<00:01:48.640> you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
the facility can code you know if you

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.370 
the facility can code you know if you
tick<00:01:48.970> both<00:01:49.180> of<00:01:49.360> those<00:01:49.420> boxes<00:01:49.900> then<00:01:50.110> give<00:01:50.260> it<00:01:50.350> a

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
tick both of those boxes then give it a

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.020 
tick both of those boxes then give it a
chance<00:01:50.590> there's<00:01:51.159> a<00:01:51.220> huge<00:01:51.580> benefit<00:01:51.970> in
