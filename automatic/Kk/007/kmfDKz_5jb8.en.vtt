but before you make your spirit you have
to<00:00:05.490> use<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.850> fermenter<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.629> get<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:08.280> wash

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
to use the fermenter and get that wash

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.180 
to use the fermenter and get that wash
the<00:00:09.179> wash<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.780> what<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.260> put<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.889> litter

eating<00:00:15.719> at<00:00:15.809> all<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.980> need<00:00:17.250> yeast<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.210> this

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
eating at all we need yeast and this

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.679 
eating at all we need yeast and this
turbo<00:00:18.900> yeast<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.410> excellent<00:00:20.070> but<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.390> course

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
turbo yeast is excellent but of course

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.920 
turbo yeast is excellent but of course
it<00:00:21.900> has<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.400> ferment<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.609> sugar<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.210> just

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
it has to ferment the sugar and you just

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.529 
it has to ferment the sugar and you just
buy<00:00:25.109> from<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.560> supermarket<00:00:25.710> eight<00:00:26.699> kilograms

right I'm giving it a stir with a spoon
to<00:01:09.659> get<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> cold<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.409> hot<00:01:10.530> water<00:01:10.710> go<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
to get the cold and hot water go and the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.030 
to get the cold and hot water go and the
thermometer<00:01:12.390> goes<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:15.200> not<00:01:16.200> bad<00:01:16.439> 39<00:01:17.189> 40<00:01:19.040> 40

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
thermometer goes in and not bad 39 40 40

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.340 
thermometer goes in and not bad 39 40 40
degrees<00:01:20.909> 40<00:01:21.600> degrees<00:01:22.549> constant<00:01:23.549> 40<00:01:23.909> degrees

degrees 40 degrees constant 40 degrees

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.830 
degrees 40 degrees constant 40 degrees
take<00:01:25.350> these<00:01:25.650> out<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:28.610> eight<00:01:29.610> kilograms<00:01:30.329> of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
take these out and eight kilograms of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:43.560 
take these out and eight kilograms of
white<00:01:31.409> sugar

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.200 

six<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:47.840> think<00:01:48.229> two<00:01:48.770> four<00:01:49.100> six<00:01:49.340> eight<00:01:49.580> comes

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
six and I think two four six eight comes

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.930 
six and I think two four six eight comes
next<00:01:50.950> eight<00:01:51.950> kilograms<00:01:52.460> of<00:01:53.030> white<00:01:53.900> sugar<00:01:54.940> I'll

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
next eight kilograms of white sugar I'll

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.190 
next eight kilograms of white sugar I'll
give<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.420> stir

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
give that a stir

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.180 
give that a stir
I<00:01:58.060> don't<00:01:59.060> want<00:01:59.210> give<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.479> good<00:01:59.799> going-over

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
I don't want give it a good going-over

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.690 
I don't want give it a good going-over
because<00:02:01.700> next<00:02:01.909> will<00:02:02.210> come<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:03.799> turbo<00:02:04.340> yeast

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
because next will come the turbo yeast

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.450 
because next will come the turbo yeast
and<00:02:05.390> this<00:02:05.509> is<00:02:05.659> what<00:02:05.810> makes<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.560> metal<00:02:07.220> work

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
and this is what makes the metal work

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.820 
and this is what makes the metal work
and<00:02:07.820> they<00:02:08.090> help<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.509> whole<00:02:08.720> other<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.649> white

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
and they help a whole other the white

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.430 
and they help a whole other the white
sugar<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:11.600> should<00:02:11.870> be<00:02:11.989> enough<00:02:12.170> at<00:02:12.319> this

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
sugar that should be enough at this

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.080 
sugar that should be enough at this
stage<00:02:12.739> I'll<00:02:12.950> be<00:02:13.069> stirring<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.550> up<00:02:13.640> later

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.590 

in<00:02:17.090> she<00:02:17.330> goes<00:02:18.640> another<00:02:19.640> stir<00:02:20.030> nothing

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
in she goes another stir nothing

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.780 
in she goes another stir nothing
difficult<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.290> far<00:02:21.319> is<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.130> we've<00:02:22.280> got<00:02:22.430> 21

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
difficult so far is it so we've got 21

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.580 
difficult so far is it so we've got 21
litres<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.269> water<00:02:23.830> at<00:02:24.910> 40<00:02:25.910> degrees<00:02:26.300> we<00:02:26.989> have<00:02:27.230> 8

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
litres of water at 40 degrees we have 8

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.199 
litres of water at 40 degrees we have 8
kilograms<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.310> sugar<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:29.540> packet<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:29.959> yeast

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
kilograms of sugar and a packet of yeast

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:40.210 
kilograms of sugar and a packet of yeast
stir<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.360> up<00:02:32.450> well<00:02:36.850> then<00:02:38.860> when<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.100> have

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
stir it up well then when you have

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.949 
stir it up well then when you have
stirred<00:02:40.549> enough<00:02:40.940> give<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.600> little<00:02:41.750> bit

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
stirred enough give it a little bit

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.130 
stirred enough give it a little bit
longer<00:02:42.140> than<00:02:42.319> I<00:02:42.470> did<00:02:43.180> we<00:02:44.180> put<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.480> heater<00:02:44.870> in

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
longer than I did we put the heater in

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.400 
longer than I did we put the heater in
and<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:47.660> heater<00:02:47.870> will<00:02:48.110> go<00:02:48.350> in<00:02:48.500> here<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:50.410> it

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
and the heater will go in here and it

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.979 
and the heater will go in here and it
will<00:02:51.680> then<00:02:51.890> steady<00:02:52.489> itself<00:02:52.940> at<00:02:53.060> about<00:02:53.299> 25

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
will then steady itself at about 25

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.120 
will then steady itself at about 25
degrees<00:02:54.670> plug<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:57.109> wait<00:02:57.320> seven<00:02:58.010> to

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
degrees plug it in and you wait seven to

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.330 
degrees plug it in and you wait seven to
ten<00:02:58.370> days<00:02:59.350> while<00:03:00.350> you're<00:03:00.530> doing<00:03:00.829> that<00:03:01.010> you're

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340
