00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello everyone I 'm welcome from 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.759
 one more day today between a new video 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.799
 about how we can wear dresses or 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.120
 T-shirts with the low back with the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.800
 today I wanted to tell you about different 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.900
 options that we have to get this 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.000
 type of garment without us having to see 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.859
 the bra line just in the middle of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 back I 'll talk about four 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.270
 options the first are fasteners 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.580
 they already sell pre-made in stores 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.710
 that have the adjustable straps and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
 multi position to leave the back 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.820
 cleared the problem of this kind of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.980
 bra is that normally most 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.050
 The braces are tied around the neck 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 towards the neck and do not go to the back 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.460
 like a normal bra then just 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.840
 we can use it with those dresses or 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.550
 shirts that we have to tie to 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.710
 neck and leave your back a little 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.600
 discovered we could not use it with 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.070
 those who have their backs open 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.719
 from the neck and another program that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.579
 has this kind of fasteners is that the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.320
 crossing and what they do behind is not 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.969
 much lower than the normal tape 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.070
 where would the bra go then not what 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.020
 We can use with very low backs 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.550
 but with something moderately moderate that 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.940
 only ior the neckline to the middle of the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.829
 back 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.180
 the other option that we have are articles 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.010
 of lingerie that are also aimed 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 to this guy 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.940
 but they are adhesive and it is the most 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.650
 comfortable when we want to wear clothes 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.990
 that in the back completely to the air 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.790
 we do not want any tape any tirant 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.120
 milestone by now the option more 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.700
 known is the typical adhesive fastener 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.770
 As you can see, there is no back part 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.170
 neither has braces are adhesives because 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.750
 this part here on a silicone 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.820
 Sticky has it many brands 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.830
 depend today are with secret in 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.120
 intimissimi almost all brands 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.310
 in would launch to have some kind of 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.810
 bra this style this 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.490
 specifically of primark and I like 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.560
 a lot because it has this way very much in 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.320
 cloud what allows us to be able to use 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.600
 garments with some pronounced cleavage 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.740
 in front it is very complicated to put them but 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.150
 yes he has discovered a way that to me 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.310
 I like it a lot, most of 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.500
 they have a closure here in the center so 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.190
 that I separated it in two first but one 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.440
 from outside to inside to center the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.740
 chest and then I do the same with the other 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.180
 and fastened them in the center this is a 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.550
 of the options that I like but 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.619
 has its disadvantages the first is that 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.420
 They give me a lot of heat to this being 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.430
 as silicones or 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.170
 I get very hot the second time the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.300
 stickers are usually very out already 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.580
 me this do not hit me hit me a 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.950
 momentary but as soon as I move what 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.140
 I will surely fall, I recommend it 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.700
 more for tight clothes like 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.590
 dress that is saying in picture 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.840
 they exert a little pressure for the part 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.430
 in front and will ensure that the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.010
 base bra that is going to stay there 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.090
 stuck and is not going to move and input 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.880
 seeing these products that are 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.519
 self-adhesive there are these little circles 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.430
 silicones and pink that are to cover 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.290
 just the nipple area and its main 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.239
 indication is to hide that part 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.890
 so they do not get noticed since they have a 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.200
 little bit of volume and it's a surface 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.330
 very smooth to get something very 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.190
 uniform and that it does not seem like we're going 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.319
 bra that for me is the most 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.989
 comfortable because they are very tiny just 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.090
 uncomfortable I do not notice them posts and also the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.220
 adhesive works very well is a 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.390
 material different from these and they stick 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.760
 pretty pretty good 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.709
 this is my favorite option when I take 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.000
 garments that are a little looser the 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.890
 negative part is that it is not of any 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.810
 type of restraint since all those that 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.970
 you have more chest you like it simply 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.550
 go a little bit more secure 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.340
 you will not like it but for people like 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.750
 me that we have a little chest and I do not 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.730
 it matters the feeling of going naked 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.260
 they are the best option because besides 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.330
 they were very natural you do not notice at all 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.760
 that we were going no patch put and not 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.680
 let's have any problem is 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.780
 my favorite choice about this no doubt 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.880
 because I think there is a lot more 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.130
 natural and much more beautiful and are much 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.740
 more comfortable and the third option is to use 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.240
 glasses like these that sell them in 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.100
 you can buy several stores in 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.750
 Haberdashery and even in stores 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.090
 lingerie and learn glasses like that 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.860
 separate and sew them to what would be 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.780
 our dress if we know it is a 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.490
 dress that we are going to put a lot to 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.140
 daily whatever these glasses are that 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.270
 better we can cost five euros each 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.790
 one bad thing is that they are not going to offer 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.800
 a lot of support since they are glasses are not going to 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.930
 have a halo no elastic or anything 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.140
 under them there are many ways already 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.780
 be triangle or round like this to be able 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.880
 carry with a word of honor and even 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.739
 the up there with push up or without him 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.239
 I like to have a couple at home 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.310
 every style because in more than some 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.170
 have saved me from some trouble and 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.480
 you always find a way to 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.670
 to use them and the fourth option that you 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.920
 I'm going to talk about is using bras or tops 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.600
 have a special back that does not 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.210
 we care that you see your back but 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.460
 that in addition those back bring something 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.750
 different to the pledge as it is for 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.370
 example this top that is actually the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.530
 top of a bikini that 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.840
 backs as well as with an embroidery with 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.000
 puntillita and perfectly that it is seen 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.240
 this back in a low-cut shirt 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.370
 can add a plus can give a 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.470
 more special touch than in carrying 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.730
 completely naked back and also 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.160
 as they have become fashionable 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.990
 backs discovered more brands have gone 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.000
 pulling out this kind of fasteners that 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.160
 have some lace detail or some 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.750
 special detail on the back and you can 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.810
 use from swimwear as it would be 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.030
 this part of a bikini to lingerie itself 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.100
 also very nice the sides that 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.510
 they are lycra elastics that have 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.690
 some detail in the back already 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.680
 be strips or lace or things like that 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.140
 This is probably the best option 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.520
 comfortable for all ages 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.160
 especially for those who 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.590
 is more chest and you do not want to give up the 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.919
 support and do not want to give up on that 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.780
 feeling of being subject and up to here 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.370
 has been the video today I hope that you 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.720
 I liked it a lot and we see each other very 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.720
 soon in the next video
