00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.889 
terrain which is a small but awesome mod
that<00:00:32.759> improves<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> distant<00:00:33.630> terrain

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.580 
texture the vanilla distant trying
texture<00:00:36.270> looks<00:00:36.510> rather<00:00:36.719> low<00:00:36.989> resolution<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
texture looks rather low resolution and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.100 
texture looks rather low resolution and
ugly<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.820> enhanced<00:00:39.270> distant<00:00:39.690> terrain

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
ugly but with enhanced distant terrain

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
ugly but with enhanced distant terrain
you'll<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> much<00:00:40.800> higher<00:00:40.860> definition<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
you'll get a much higher definition and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.970 
you'll get a much higher definition and
more<00:00:41.910> detailed<00:00:42.270> texture<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.410> mod<00:00:43.590> makes<00:00:43.800> the

more detailed texture the mod makes the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.380 
more detailed texture the mod makes the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
distant terrain texture look a lot

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.119 
distant terrain texture look a lot
better<00:00:45.539> by<00:00:45.840> reducing<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> blotchy<00:00:46.680> looking

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.920 
better by reducing the blotchy looking
patches<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> ground<00:00:47.850> by<00:00:48.329> adding<00:00:48.600> more<00:00:48.750> noise

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
patches the ground by adding more noise

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.779 
patches the ground by adding more noise
and<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.590> generally<00:00:49.800> makes<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.219> distant<00:00:50.670> train

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and it generally makes the distant train

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.520 
and it generally makes the distant train
texture<00:00:51.210> look<00:00:51.390> sharper<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.989> looks<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
texture look sharper and looks like the

texture look sharper and looks like the
actual<00:00:52.800> ground<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.090> very<00:00:54.270> noticeable

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
actual ground it's a very noticeable

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.330 
actual ground it's a very noticeable
change<00:00:55.079> especially<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.829> you're<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
change especially if you're in the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.939 
change especially if you're in the
tundra<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:56.820> any<00:00:57.090> other<00:00:57.329> open<00:00:58.050> area<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.469> Skyrim

and<00:00:59.129> enhance<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.480> terrain<00:01:00.809> effects<00:01:01.440> only

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and enhance this in terrain effects only

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.860 
and enhance this in terrain effects only
the<00:01:01.890> distance<00:01:02.160> no<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.850> ground<00:01:03.149> textures<00:01:03.600> and

the distance no and ground textures and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.320 
the distance no and ground textures and
there<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.140> no<00:01:04.320> performance<00:01:04.559> loss<00:01:05.119> next<00:01:06.119> get

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
there is no performance loss next get

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
there is no performance loss next get
high<00:01:06.510> quality<00:01:06.570> LOD<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> great<00:01:08.250> mod

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
high quality LOD so this is a great mod

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.820 
high quality LOD so this is a great mod
that<00:01:08.729> does<00:01:08.939> exactly<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.840> says<00:01:09.869> makes<00:01:10.710> the
