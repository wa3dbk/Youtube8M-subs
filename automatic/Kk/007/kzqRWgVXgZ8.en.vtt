00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:17.789
 somewhat closed did this 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:19.859
 experiment planted greenhouses and it turns out 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.199
 brackets planted tomatoes they were still 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.080
 small it was cold and not greenhouses 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:32.149
 opened the body planted the wet ground all 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:36.809
 and close tightly planted and gets 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:40.610
 morning night cold fire same heat somehow 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.610
 we got some me with whom 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.780
 then interestingly repeat it is so cold she 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.879
 little green in the morning afternoon when during 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.370
 the day is worth it no fat 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.500
 there is nothing on top of the leaf I don't know with 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.770
 what is the reason you want try it yourself 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.350
 then here's the things you can do here it is 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.629
 because interestingly enough then I 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.489
 hoisted already more adult annoyance so 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.380
 these tomatoes are already under 1 person 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.070
 normal then on once again she 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.220
 hoisted 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.869
 and during the day it's all burned 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.490
 Exactly here those tomato that is turns out 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.430
 where did you open 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.860
 I opened everything already laid siege and they are there for me 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.860
 ended on that they and there naturally 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:32.250
 some things didn't end then 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.619
 roots went on the road root ax 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.110
 it was burned to the top 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.150
 and these still have tomato which was interesting 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.000
 use the mayor but what was 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.950
 then remember here is a toe gold and here and there 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.990
 there I cellophane bent 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:57.700
 and it turns out they 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:02:00.390
 on the edges of the face do not water like anything 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:46.110
 don't do 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:46.110
 and when grew up 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.319
 nothing went there 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.319
 I burned the mouse
