 half new canal house this house 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.290
 It is made by a subscriber called 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.089
 eyes tech nerd GATT pussy etc 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.620
 that is from venezuela and well he has 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.240
 made a very cool medieval house of 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.430
 stone with wood that the truth has 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.170
 surprised a lot is 14 years old because no 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.699
 I said that truth can not release 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.260
 I have lost I'm going short term like 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.609
 thor and as he says he has done a cut of 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.289
 the crops are in this part of 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.279
 down but good look what cool 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.960
 they're really pretty 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.730
 also to climb up here for a 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.290
 He rose and down the stairs or me 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.969
 I like it a lot because it has given a lot of use to 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.340
 the stone that is something that I do not 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.750
 do with her look how nice she is 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.600
 all those chests that I want to open 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.039
 because he has not opened them yet I'm going to 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.270
 open it I imagine that it does not matter what 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.370
 speaks not my fixed the band of 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.930
 venezuela here made and puts here credit 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.610
 a greeting for you and another for all 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.320
 Venezuelans who are watching us during 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.850
 today is not going to rise and as you see 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.920
 It's pretty cool, what have you done? 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.149
 as climbs with good the trunks of 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.010
 the trees together with stone slabs 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.750
 that the truth is very good as well as 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.489
 You see here with stairs and good the house 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.170
 and if it's good you'll see that it's not very 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.850
 great but that does fascinate me 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.710
 example this bridge set that goes from 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.360
 fixed bridges how beautiful is the truth is 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.980
 what is incredible 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.770
 here we have a bridge that takes us 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.210
 towards the house the house is this from here the 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.710
 which as you see is made 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.390
 mostly wood and stone 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.130
 do not have anything else to notice 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.070
 pillars has by this part is 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.150
 sincerely and good 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.160
 truth is that it's amazing is in 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.720
 missing that but I was going to say something of 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.400
 lighting maybe but good is what 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.290
 has done or is I for example just 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.870
 illuminate the surroundings but what has 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.000
 it is to illuminate their houses or their houses 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.460
 its say sites that surround a house 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.960
 therefore I also think that it is 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.729
 well and good as you see here we have a 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.229
 entrance with carpets we enter here 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.090
 we have the living room here we have a living room 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.800
 that as is we have a very central table 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.930
 pretty with pressure plates that simulate 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.479
 then the placemats here 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.160
 we have set torches with pictures and 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.690
 with anvil is that they give the feeling how 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.430
 they are holding on and that is very cool 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.920
 here we have a television here we have 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.899
 a sofa another table a coffee table in 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.520
 this case and here as you see windows that 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.920
 they give us how nice it is also like 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.420
 It is in a very high part 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.710
 we can see the distance fixes in addition 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.600
 what beautiful views we have for these 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.000
 good parts huila kauder very brown 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.050
 but I stay busy and we'll nuclear 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.580
 go up now we'll go out there 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.230
 I want to tell you what they say to be worth 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.880
 something not only for slaves of this house 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.760
 description if you want here 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.560
 we have as you see one of the bedrooms 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.270
 I forgive a territory and here we have a 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.270
 common map where we can see fixes all 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.010
 the area that is not part of the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.600
 around the castle here we have a 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.610
 large chest and here this side we have 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.950
 another arrived that is pretty nice 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.040
 here we have a terrace that also 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.540
 So, as you can see one of the parts of 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.620
 the house carries the truth that it is 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.530
 fairly good 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.690
 there is something that you hope has a moment 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.910
 because it's worth not that I got involved 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.510
 because I had the feeling before 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.450
 what were we seeing 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.489
 a site with enchantment ships but 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.170
 there's no vale vale that I was 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.879
 scratching a lot because before when 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.680
 we are taking a turn more similar to the 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.689
 I thought I had the feeling that 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.010
 good enchantments then by 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.480
 that was now so a little flat 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.310
 or because they are checking that I do not 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.049
 I was leaving nothing no no no no no 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.670
 there is nothing and good about this part of here 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.680
 what we have a barn I said 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.049
 what this stable has done to have the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.790
 protected horses and do not run 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.470
 no fear and he has put them here look 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.700
 what hair has truth that is 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.230
 pretty cool I think this is a house 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.239
 very functional I think it's a house 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.489
 Sincerely, I think it has been 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.870
 left ready for people to do so 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.120
 all because if you look you are done the 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.980
 structure there are no supports for potions 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.799
 of sakana mientos there is a structure of 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.819
 a normal house a house with materials 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.400
 basic so to speak it does not have 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.230
 diamonds which I like because it leaves 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.000
 the person that if for example you 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.019
 you say hear but I want to play 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.879
 minecraft but I never know how to make a 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.349
 house then you get off for example is a 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.659
 so that the registration comes to play 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.459
 from this from this from this point 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.870
 what would happen to have all crops and opd 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.290
 At the same time, I would remove them so you can play 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.090
 from the same 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.409
 good facility but having the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.609
 structures made that can be a 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.890
 last for many who do not leave 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.780
 build very well and well then nothing 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.299
 this house as I say in the description 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.530
 I will also repeat once again that 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.879
 we have to leave the link to 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.140
 download the description if I can not 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.000
 analyze your faces because I can not 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.349
 leave the downloads and also add 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.609
 photographs that we say given that a lot 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.280
 people who see more a very description 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.989
 cool but I can not even photograph myself 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.840
 per link so you can not upload your 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.979
