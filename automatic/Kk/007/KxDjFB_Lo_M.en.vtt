00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
is this concrete that he's using now I

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.980 
is this concrete that he's using now I
like<00:04:34.020> this<00:04:34.200> piece<00:04:38.090> this<00:04:39.090> it's<00:04:39.240> called<00:04:39.450> hunky

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
like this piece this it's called hunky

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:48.860 
like this piece this it's called hunky
dory<00:04:40.230> and<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:45.240> I've<00:04:45.300> got<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:47.300> couple<00:04:48.300> of<00:04:48.480> big

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
dory and so I've got a couple of big

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:56.860 
dory and so I've got a couple of big
hunks<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.500> plate<00:04:50.040> glass<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:51.530> then<00:04:52.530> these

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.130 

forms<00:04:57.870> that<00:04:58.080> are<00:04:59.180> foam<00:05:00.180> rubber<00:05:00.450> but<00:05:00.750> i<00:05:00.780> think

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
forms that are foam rubber but i think

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.140 
forms that are foam rubber but i think
these<00:05:01.320> have<00:05:01.560> been<00:05:02.840> soaked<00:05:03.840> in<00:05:03.840> or<00:05:04.200> coated<00:05:04.770> with

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
these have been soaked in or coated with

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.490 
these have been soaked in or coated with
cement<00:05:06.150> so<00:05:06.420> they're<00:05:06.600> actually<00:05:06.930> solid<00:05:07.400> but<00:05:09.500> one
