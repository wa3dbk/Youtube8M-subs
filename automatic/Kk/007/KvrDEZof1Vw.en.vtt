 Housewife's eyes not using special tools not in the recess 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.550
 Students are popular from all over the prefecture because of the popularity of the classroom 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.559
 In other words 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:41.390
 What can you tell me about Midori-san's home this time ? 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.720

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:51.020
 The material is 300 g of strong powder 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:54.760
 Sato Osaki City East 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon salt 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.760
 Water is 170 g 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:08.240
 I put in 150 grams at a time 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:13.000
 Yeah Yeah You put a piece and a far sugar in here big ball 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:17.260
 I put the main in the smaller ball 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.600
 Then let's put water and start baking 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:30.040
 Well Use and if you have and please put all rubber spatula Let's mix 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.040
 Mix strong flour with water until it becomes sticky 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.180
 I always put 3g in East Bar, but 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:42.610
 Let's reduce it to grams in summer 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:48.290
 Because while I am making it , I can get in with 1st and 6th at the time of shaping 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 It is in the finish of myoma when I reduce 1 g of instruments 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:59.509
 If the stickiness comes out , put in the material of the small ball, it will be used again 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.509
 Let's mix to carve in Sukeppa When you wear is no longer up to a rubber spatula 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:13.640
 Two ways of connection today 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:16.450
 Because one hand following tone will continue to post sound until the end and then at the amount Gosnay Houtt is the first to do is 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.410
 Hold the front side with your left hand 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.830

 Try to come back without fail every time gas 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:33.849
 I guess it's time to adapt the powder only now when you adapt 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.470
 When it comes to the ridge in the form of this time when it is time to press the amount even now 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.560

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.710
 Hand Gosnay is Ah you roll back and forth today 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:53.490
 I will put it in because the article that came out Hami will dry out 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:03:01.090
 I even changed the direction sometimes 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:07.349
 The arms do not get hurt if the Lord does the back and forth movement of the legs while moving both hands 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.349
 It cuts so that the dough is made in one 80g Once you have moist
