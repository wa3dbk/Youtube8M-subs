need to know about there are no second

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.759 
need to know about there are no second
chances<00:00:28.550> there's<00:00:29.550> only<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.060> moment<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.769> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
chances there's only this moment and the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.610 
chances there's only this moment and the
next<00:00:31.800> one

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
next one

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.130 
next one
every<00:00:34.430> one<00:00:34.640> of<00:00:34.940> those<00:00:35.149> moments<00:00:35.539> is<00:00:36.110> a<00:00:36.379> test

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
every one of those moments is a test

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.860 
every one of those moments is a test
then<00:00:39.140> you<00:00:39.290> get<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.469> take<00:00:39.739> one<00:00:39.770> time<00:00:40.510> and<00:00:41.510> only

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
then you get to take one time and only

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
then you get to take one time and only
one<00:00:42.469> time
