once again powering up on turn up we can

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.050 
once again powering up on turn up we can
see<00:06:04.370> the<00:06:04.840> navigation<00:06:05.840> around<00:06:05.930> us<00:06:06.350> is<00:06:07.060> pretty

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
see the navigation around us is pretty

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.409 
see the navigation around us is pretty

there's a very slight delay but really

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.030 
there's a very slight delay but really
that's

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
that's
