00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840

myself<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:20.840> get<00:00:21.840> command<00:00:22.199> block<00:00:22.939> and<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:25.439> if<00:00:25.800> I

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
myself and get command block and so if I

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.679 
myself and get command block and so if I
basically<00:00:26.279> put<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.760> step<00:00:28.039> and<00:00:29.420> set<00:00:30.420> block

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
basically put that in step and set block

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.000

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.670 
redstone block 0 3 oops that was maximal
3<00:01:05.250> place<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.409> is

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
3 place and then all you have to do is

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.660 
3 place and then all you have to do is
basically<00:01:08.130> place<00:01:08.970> redstone<00:01:09.270> block<00:01:10.460> now<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
basically place redstone block now it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
basically place redstone block now it
depends<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.510> location<00:01:13.260> what<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> see

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
depends on what location what you see

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.770 
depends on what location what you see
but<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> get<00:01:14.189> redstone<00:01:14.700> coming<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.659> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
but if you get redstone coming out of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.740 
but if you get redstone coming out of
here<00:01:16.189> this<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.430> actually<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.720> a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
here this is actually going this is a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.530 
here this is actually going this is a
loop<00:01:19.159> now<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.700> actually<00:01:20.790> place<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.240> I'm

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
loop now if I actually place it I'm

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.399 
loop now if I actually place it I'm
taking<00:01:21.840> my<00:01:21.900> block<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.290> say<00:01:22.680> hi<00:01:24.080> ok<00:01:25.080> that's<00:01:25.290> not

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
taking my block and say hi ok that's not

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.350 
taking my block and say hi ok that's not
exactly<00:01:25.710> working<00:01:27.229> it<00:01:28.229> says<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.560> once<00:01:29.270> let<00:01:30.270> me

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
exactly working it says it once let me

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.760 
exactly working it says it once let me
see<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.780> I'll<00:01:33.930> working<00:01:34.259> inside<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> wooden

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
see and so I'll working inside a wooden

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.859 
see and so I'll working inside a wooden
block<00:01:34.829> up<00:01:35.130> sure<00:01:36.060> oh<00:01:36.450> yeah

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
block up sure oh yeah

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.710 
block up sure oh yeah
Addis<00:01:37.200> mr<00:01:37.680> sorry<00:01:38.070> about<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.430> no<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.570> once

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
Addis mr sorry about that no for once

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
Addis mr sorry about that no for once
again<00:01:39.869> place<00:01:40.200> my<00:01:40.590> block<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.220> spams<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
again place my block here it's spams it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.170 
again place my block here it's spams it
goes<00:01:42.509> up<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> 20<00:01:43.340> commands<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.579> second<00:01:45.090> you

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
goes up to 20 commands a second you

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.030 
goes up to 20 commands a second you
cannot<00:01:45.479> stop<00:01:45.750> loop<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> want<00:01:46.829> stop

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
cannot stop loop and if you want stop

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.179 
cannot stop loop and if you want stop
loop<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.790> need<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.840> something<00:01:49.189> like

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
loop you need to like do something like

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.170 
loop you need to like do something like
a<00:01:50.220> command<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:50.909> that's<00:01:51.240> being<00:01:51.899> run<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.860> like

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
a command here that's being run so like

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.030 
a command here that's being run so like
gets<00:01:54.180> coordinates<00:01:54.659> here<00:01:54.840> that's<00:01:55.049> negative<00:01:55.890> x

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
gets coordinates here that's negative x

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.580 
gets coordinates here that's negative x
so<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.350> set<00:01:58.350> block<00:01:59.180> and<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:01.530> block

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so just a set block and that block

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.109 
so just a set block and that block
relative<00:02:02.600> minus<00:02:03.600> 1<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:04.020> relative<00:02:04.560> air<00:02:05.119> 0

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
relative minus 1 as relative air 0

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.229 
relative minus 1 as relative air 0
replace<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.340> don't<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.060> doesn't

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
replace I don't know that that doesn't

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.330 
replace I don't know that that doesn't
even<00:02:09.360> stop<00:02:09.750> loop<00:02:10.020> yeah

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
even stop loop yeah

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.940 
even stop loop yeah
it's<00:02:11.489> too<00:02:11.700> impossible<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.540> stop<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:13.019> what's<00:02:13.800> up

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it's too impossible to stop it what's up

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.220 
it's too impossible to stop it what's up
he<00:02:14.129> is<00:02:14.250> break<00:02:15.000> what<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.390> command<00:02:15.599> blocks<00:02:15.900> yet

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
he is break what this command blocks yet

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.320 
he is break what this command blocks yet
but<00:02:17.190> let<00:02:17.310> me<00:02:17.459> guys<00:02:17.640> that's<00:02:17.879> about<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.150> for<00:02:18.239> this

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
but let me guys that's about it for this
