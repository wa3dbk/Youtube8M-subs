 they know what to wear they want to see 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.990
 gorgeous women do not want to be exaggerated 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.030
 but not very simple either 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.349

 cool and cool to use during the day 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.730
 during the afternoon it is a long skirt 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.680
 also reaches the waist so it 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.809
 favors most bodies not 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.910
 they will vote no on the contrary they will 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.339
 to cover everything very very well could be a 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.930
 smooth skirt a printed skirt I'm

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.680
 let's see openings of all kinds the 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.750
 shoes I wanted to wear shoes with heels 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.430
 to see me more stylized and higher 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.560

 Glamorous pretty is this kind of 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.940
 shoes are also very modern without 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.350
 a bit strange heel but they look very 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.390
 very parents and also help you walk 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.399
 very comfortable all day a 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.350
 blouse I always opted for visits 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.240
 very simple I always try to make them 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.580
 Smooth blouses is sometimes a little more 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.470
 ideal formal to use it with this 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.680
 look and finally a bag a bag 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.509
 very very casual a classic bag a 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.850
 bag that also gives you a lot 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.369
 naturalness to look accessories 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.450
 I'm just wearing a necklace a 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.369
 very llama necklace 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.049
 take advantage of their striking necklaces 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.090
 because they will be able to use us with looks 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.090
 to transform them into something incredible 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.930
 and who says you can not use your 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.909
 Favorite jeans for this romantic date 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.649
 Of course, yes, you just have to look 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.660
 something nice to combine it for example 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.360
 this blouse I wanted it to be something very 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.370
 simple in a sober tone the black 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.920
 favors all the people besides us 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.220
 helps hide I do not know the tummy or something 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.260
 we did not want it to be very noticeable 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.569
 Jeans are types and they favor me 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.590
 people with thin legs or more or 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.910
 less thin 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.590
 If you do not have thin legs, you can 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.390
 opt for a straight cut and you're going to 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.280
 see perfect shoes are shoes 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.290
 very striking highlights says that the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.380
 shoes call a lot of attention already 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.709
 I'm using a lot about then here 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.080
 perfectly another color has glitter 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.630
 It has many colors, I like it a lot 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.730
 These types of shoes are ideal for 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.269
 use overnight and finally a 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.340
 Hand bag and bag is important 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.510
 that is small when we go at night not 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.579
 we have to take those bags that 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.069
 They look like diapers during the night 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.560
 because they do not look good at all I'm using 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.420
 necklaces are going to dominate the necklaces 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.400
 when we want a simple look but 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.080
 with touches it's very cool I'm using two 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.490
 together you know that I love 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.920
 peculiar and I hope you like it 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.720
 also this electro and if they want something 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.200
 even more feminine if they want to see 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.090
 super stylish very very gay list can 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.550
 opting for a state skirt is very very 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.860
 flirty I'm not teaching much I want 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.900
 to see me elegant arrives more or less up 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.630
 of the knee and also has here a 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.280
 very eye-catching design could use the 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.020
 color that suits me I love 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.030
 the red red makes me think 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.310
 well, both good and dark ones is a 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.110
 also very elegant and calling color 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.610
 much attention and here it is used with a 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.410
 black sachet you could also 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.780
 use this same look during the afternoon 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.310
 but with a white bag I think that 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.350
 this option is very good to use 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.730
 during the night that's why I'm using a 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.490
 dark tone on top 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.310
 also the shoes the shoes I wanted 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.200
 they were very very discreet this time what 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.120
 most striking is the skirt then to the 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.550
 we are not going to put any more print 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.640
 neither color nor anything very very sober 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.250
 finally the bag the bag is 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.620
 already much more fun has this but 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.470
 they still like being over upper 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.750
 some little touch there and you know that a 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.820
 I'm fascinated by necklaces so 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.320
 I decided to choose this with shades of 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.320
 silver and a little black 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.729
 and this is the last option with a dress 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:31.460
 it will always get you out of any trouble 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.960
 is of cerbère beautiful chooses the one that 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.840

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.840
 dress that best suits each type 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.039
 of body this I'm using has 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.719
 favors people who do not have 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.909
 much hip because it has volume in the 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:48.860
 bottom part then you have to have 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.870
 a more or less straight body to look 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.939
 very well this type of dress has 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.250

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.949
 cheerful colors to not leave all 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.960
