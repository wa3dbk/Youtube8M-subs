00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
the dragon's teeth DLC and I've been

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.280 
the dragon's teeth DLC and I've been
going<00:00:54.820> stealth<00:00:55.270> mode<00:00:55.510> with<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:55.900> this<00:00:56.050> thing

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
going stealth mode with it this thing

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.400 
going stealth mode with it this thing
comes<00:00:56.559> with<00:00:56.949> a<00:00:57.280> suppressor<00:00:58.059> already<00:00:58.480> on<00:00:58.660> it

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
comes with a suppressor already on it

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.890 
comes with a suppressor already on it
which<00:00:59.830> kind<00:01:00.129> of<00:01:00.220> leaves<00:01:00.400> you<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:01.059> little<00:01:01.690> bit<00:01:01.780> of

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
which kind of leaves you a little bit of

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.840 
which kind of leaves you a little bit of
hidden<00:01:02.110> did<00:01:02.230> I'd<00:01:02.350> probably<00:01:02.379> say<00:01:03.010> but<00:01:03.309> it<00:01:03.580> gives

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
hidden did I'd probably say but it gives

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.330 
hidden did I'd probably say but it gives
you<00:01:04.059> very<00:01:04.629> much<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:04.960> challenge<00:01:05.320> in<00:01:05.770> trying<00:01:06.190> to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
you very much a challenge in trying to

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.580 
you very much a challenge in trying to
be<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.490> sniper<00:01:06.850> with<00:01:07.300> a<00:01:07.630> suppressor<00:01:08.350> on<00:01:08.380> it<00:01:08.500> you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
be a sniper with a suppressor on it you

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.930 
be a sniper with a suppressor on it you
do<00:01:08.710> have<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:08.890> option<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.220> remove<00:01:09.640> the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
do have the option to remove the

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.600 
do have the option to remove the
suppressor<00:01:10.210> if<00:01:10.540> you<00:01:10.660> want<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.200> but<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:12.190> thought

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
suppressor if you want to but I thought

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.370 
suppressor if you want to but I thought
I'd<00:01:12.759> give<00:01:12.910> it<00:01:12.940> a<00:01:13.060> go<00:01:13.210> with<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.750> I<00:01:13.930> have

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
I'd give it a go with it and I have

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.560 
I'd give it a go with it and I have
found<00:01:14.649> it<00:01:14.830> extremely<00:01:15.399> difficult<00:01:15.759> to<00:01:16.119> use<00:01:16.390> this

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
found it extremely difficult to use this

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.020 
found it extremely difficult to use this
sniper<00:01:16.780> rifle<00:01:17.350> with<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.160> suppressor<00:01:18.759> on<00:01:18.789> it<00:01:18.940> you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
sniper rifle with a suppressor on it you

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.430 
sniper rifle with a suppressor on it you
don't<00:01:19.210> realize<00:01:19.330> just<00:01:19.660> how<00:01:19.780> difficult<00:01:20.110> it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
don't realize just how difficult it

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.440 
don't realize just how difficult it
actually<00:01:20.920> is<00:01:21.100> until<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.580> give<00:01:21.759> it<00:01:21.789> a<00:01:21.940> go

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
actually is until you give it a go

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.210 
actually is until you give it a go
it's<00:01:22.960> not<00:01:23.170> like<00:01:23.350> other<00:01:23.560> snipers<00:01:24.039> either

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
it's not like other snipers either

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.310 
it's not like other snipers either
because<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.729> cs5<00:01:25.180> is<00:01:25.390> relatively<00:01:25.990> close

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
because the cs5 is relatively close

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.100 
because the cs5 is relatively close
quarters<00:01:26.830> orientated<00:01:27.610> something<00:01:28.509> like<00:01:28.720> the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
quarters orientated something like the

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.460 
quarters orientated something like the
the<00:01:29.890> SRR<00:01:30.250> 61<00:01:31.060> for<00:01:31.270> example<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.840> intervention

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
the SRR 61 for example the intervention

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.230 
the SRR 61 for example the intervention
will<00:01:32.890> be<00:01:33.009> much<00:01:33.190> better<00:01:33.460> with<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.700> suppressor<00:01:34.210> on

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
will be much better with a suppressor on

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.279 
will be much better with a suppressor on
it<00:01:34.360> because<00:01:34.509> it's<00:01:34.630> got<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.750> higher<00:01:34.960> bullet

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
it because it's got a higher bullet

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.560 
it because it's got a higher bullet
velocity<00:01:35.350> anyway<00:01:36.039> but<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.910> weapon<00:01:37.270> really

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
velocity anyway but this weapon really

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.109 
velocity anyway but this weapon really
doesn't<00:01:38.110> have<00:01:38.320> that<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.640> whilst<00:01:39.850> I've<00:01:40.000> been

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
doesn't have that so whilst I've been

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.249 
doesn't have that so whilst I've been
moving<00:01:40.300> around<00:01:40.539> all<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.840> different<00:01:41.140> maps

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
moving around all the different maps

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.749 
moving around all the different maps
I've<00:01:41.410> been<00:01:41.530> trying<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:41.890> keep<00:01:42.130> this<00:01:42.280> thing<00:01:42.550> as

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
I've been trying to keep this thing as

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.270 
I've been trying to keep this thing as
close<00:01:43.060> quarters<00:01:43.479> as<00:01:43.600> possible<00:01:44.110> but<00:01:44.289> you<00:01:44.500> might

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
close quarters as possible but you might

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.160 
close quarters as possible but you might
think<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.939> dragon's<00:01:46.360> teeth<00:01:46.570> maps<00:01:46.900> are

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
think that the dragon's teeth maps are

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.690 
think that the dragon's teeth maps are
quite<00:01:47.409> close<00:01:47.619> together<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.159> there<00:01:48.310> are<00:01:48.460> some

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
quite close together and there are some

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.580 
quite close together and there are some
really<00:01:48.909> good<00:01:49.180> infantry<00:01:49.689> battlegrounds<00:01:50.380> but

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
really good infantry battlegrounds but

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.200 
really good infantry battlegrounds but
where<00:01:51.159> we're<00:01:51.250> playing<00:01:51.460> right<00:01:51.670> now<00:01:51.850> on<00:01:52.060> them

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
where we're playing right now on them

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.420 
where we're playing right now on them
Feeny<00:01:52.420> garden<00:01:52.930> it's<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.320> little<00:01:53.710> bit<00:01:53.830> more<00:01:54.040> open

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
Feeny garden it's a little bit more open

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.249 
Feeny garden it's a little bit more open
I'd<00:01:54.520> probably<00:01:54.670> say<00:01:54.939> it's<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.330> most<00:01:55.450> open<00:01:56.020> of

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
I'd probably say it's the most open of

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.350 
I'd probably say it's the most open of
the<00:01:56.290> four<00:01:56.710> maps<00:01:56.979> in<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.189> DLC<00:01:57.549> maybe<00:01:57.820> with<00:01:58.270> the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
the four maps in the DLC maybe with the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.999 
the four maps in the DLC maybe with the
exception<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.930> sunken<00:01:59.350> dragon<00:01:59.770> with<00:01:59.920> the

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
exception of sunken dragon with the

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.950 
exception of sunken dragon with the
water<00:02:00.220> in<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.579> middle<00:02:00.850> but<00:02:01.000> apart<00:02:01.720> from<00:02:01.810> that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
water in the middle but apart from that

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.620 
water in the middle but apart from that
you're<00:02:02.590> not<00:02:02.770> gonna<00:02:02.950> get<00:02:03.250> much<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:03.939> wide<00:02:04.180> open

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
you're not gonna get much of a wide open

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.109 
you're not gonna get much of a wide open
space<00:02:04.659> in<00:02:05.290> dragon's<00:02:05.680> teeth<00:02:05.860> that<00:02:06.220> map<00:02:06.520> was<00:02:06.939> it

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
space in dragon's teeth that map was it

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.910 
space in dragon's teeth that map was it
now<00:02:07.840> switching<00:02:08.110> back<00:02:08.290> over<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.560> pearl<00:02:08.739> market

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
now switching back over to pearl market

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.250 
now switching back over to pearl market
is<00:02:09.190> completely<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.179> opposite<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:10.899> weapon

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
is completely the opposite this weapon

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.190 
is completely the opposite this weapon
becomes<00:02:11.430> extremely<00:02:12.430> hard<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.940> use<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.870> don't

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
becomes extremely hard to use I don't

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.830 
becomes extremely hard to use I don't
think<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.799> really<00:02:15.100> got<00:02:15.310> very<00:02:15.910> many<00:02:16.180> good<00:02:16.269> clips

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
think I really got very many good clips

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.770 
think I really got very many good clips
on<00:02:17.110> pearl<00:02:17.739> market<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:18.850> fact<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.239> know<00:02:19.570> that's

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
on pearl market in fact I know that's

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.449 
on pearl market in fact I know that's
completely<00:02:20.410> alike<00:02:20.680> as<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.100> rest<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.400> this

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
completely alike as the rest of this

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.190 
completely alike as the rest of this

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
video is home pearl market a current

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.289 
video is home pearl market a current
mode<00:02:23.290> which<00:02:23.410> one<00:02:23.560> oh<00:02:23.769> it<00:02:23.890> was<00:02:24.010> propaganda

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
mode which one oh it was propaganda

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.240 
mode which one oh it was propaganda
because<00:02:25.299> on<00:02:25.870> propaganda<00:02:26.350> there's<00:02:26.739> loads<00:02:27.160> of

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
because on propaganda there's loads of

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.890 
because on propaganda there's loads of
different<00:02:27.370> sites<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.299> can<00:02:28.480> see<00:02:28.690> down

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
different sites that you can see down

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.960 
different sites that you can see down
but<00:02:29.380> because<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.040> players<00:02:30.310> always<00:02:30.459> weaving

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
but because the players always weaving

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.250 
but because the players always weaving
in<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.180> out<00:02:31.299> it's<00:02:31.480> very<00:02:31.510> difficult<00:02:32.019> for<00:02:32.170> you

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
in and out it's very difficult for you

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.900 
in and out it's very difficult for you
to<00:02:32.410> get<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.650> shot<00:02:32.920> away<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.430> because<00:02:33.760> you've

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
to get that shot away and because you've

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.520 
to get that shot away and because you've
got<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> suppressor<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:35.290> bullet

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
got a suppressor on it the bullet

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.140 
got a suppressor on it the bullet
velocity<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.220> low<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.700> bullet<00:02:36.940> takes

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
velocity is so low that the bullet takes

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.390 
velocity is so low that the bullet takes
so<00:02:37.420> long<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.810> get<00:02:38.170> there<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.680> by<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.190> time

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
so long to get there that by the time

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.280 
so long to get there that by the time
you<00:02:39.519> fired<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.060> players<00:02:40.360> already<00:02:40.510> moved<00:02:40.930> and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
you fired the players already moved and

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.960 
you fired the players already moved and
your<00:02:41.500> bullets<00:02:41.799> just<00:02:41.860> missed<00:02:42.220> them<00:02:42.340> completely

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
your bullets just missed them completely

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.910 
your bullets just missed them completely
so<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.510> found<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.870> map<00:02:44.079> particularly

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
so I found that map particularly

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.060 
so I found that map particularly
difficult<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.640> use<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.030> cs5<00:02:46.540> on<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:47.019> third<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
difficult to use the cs5 on a third the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
difficult to use the cs5 on a third the
cs5<00:02:48.549> with<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.859> m1911<00:02:50.859> which<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.790> pistol

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
cs5 with the m1911 which is the pistol

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.910 
cs5 with the m1911 which is the pistol
I've<00:02:52.180> always<00:02:52.690> used<00:02:53.049> all<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.530> way<00:02:53.650> through

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
I've always used all the way through

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.740 
I've always used all the way through
about<00:02:54.130> 4<00:02:54.400> 4<00:02:54.610> really<00:02:54.910> ever<00:02:55.120> since<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:55.450> unlocked

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
about 4 4 really ever since I unlocked

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.170 
about 4 4 really ever since I unlocked
it<00:02:56.020> it<00:02:56.349> is<00:02:56.709> pretty<00:02:56.950> much<00:02:57.010> like<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.880> best

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
it it is pretty much like the best

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.089 
it it is pretty much like the best
pistol<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.110> could<00:02:59.290> use<00:02:59.500> except<00:02:59.980> the

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
pistol that you could use except the

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.309 
pistol that you could use except the
deagle<00:03:00.489> which<00:03:00.760> has<00:03:01.000> just<00:03:01.660> come<00:03:01.780> out<00:03:01.930> with<00:03:02.230> the

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
deagle which has just come out with the

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.900 
deagle which has just come out with the
dragon's<00:03:02.650> teeth<00:03:02.830> DLC<00:03:03.340> as<00:03:03.459> well<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.700> have

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
dragon's teeth DLC as well I have

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.280 
dragon's teeth DLC as well I have
another<00:03:04.060> chance<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.480> unlock<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:05.020> yet<00:03:05.230> in

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
another chance to unlock that yet in

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.630 
another chance to unlock that yet in
fact<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.530> haven't<00:03:05.739> even<00:03:05.800> unlocked<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.250> unica<00:03:06.610> 6

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
fact I haven't even unlocked the unica 6

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.160 
fact I haven't even unlocked the unica 6
but<00:03:07.300> just<00:03:07.450> been<00:03:07.540> having<00:03:07.780> too<00:03:07.930> much<00:03:08.110> fun

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
but just been having too much fun

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.780 
but just been having too much fun
playing<00:03:08.560> with<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.890> Bulldog<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.310> things<00:03:09.640> like

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
playing with the Bulldog and things like

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.229 
playing with the Bulldog and things like
that

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
that

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.540 
that
I<00:03:10.270> did<00:03:10.870> get<00:03:10.989> my<00:03:11.110> hands<00:03:11.440> on<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.709> MPX<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.430> other

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
I did get my hands on the MPX the other

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.400 
I did get my hands on the MPX the other
day<00:03:12.700> which<00:03:12.910> was<00:03:12.940> great<00:03:13.450> I've<00:03:13.870> used<00:03:14.110> all<00:03:14.290> of

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
day which was great I've used all of

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.050 
day which was great I've used all of
these<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.770> CTE<00:03:15.069> so<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.400> relatively<00:03:15.940> know

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
these in the CTE so I relatively know

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.640 
these in the CTE so I relatively know
how<00:03:16.360> they're<00:03:16.600> going<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.840> perform<00:03:17.110> but

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
how they're going to perform but

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.260 
how they're going to perform but
something<00:03:18.400> that's<00:03:18.550> quite<00:03:18.700> interesting<00:03:18.880> of

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
something that's quite interesting of

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.210 
something that's quite interesting of
note<00:03:19.450> actually<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.410> developers<00:03:20.980> are

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
note actually is that the developers are

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.580 
note actually is that the developers are
going<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.819> be<00:03:21.940> tweaking<00:03:22.239> all<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.200> dragon's

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
going to be tweaking all of the dragon's

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.080 
going to be tweaking all of the dragon's
teeth<00:03:23.769> weapons<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.400> gadgets<00:03:24.550> that<00:03:24.880> were

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
teeth weapons and gadgets that were

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.509 
teeth weapons and gadgets that were
introduced<00:03:25.690> in<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.500> later<00:03:26.739> patch<00:03:27.069> and<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.370> can

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
introduced in a later patch and I can

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.680 
introduced in a later patch and I can
only<00:03:27.640> think<00:03:27.850> that's<00:03:28.000> going<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.180> come<00:03:28.360> in<00:03:28.510> with

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
only think that's going to come in with

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.140 
only think that's going to come in with
some<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.110> CTE<00:03:29.440> changes<00:03:30.010> as<00:03:30.160> well<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:31.030> be

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
some of the CTE changes as well so be

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.130 
some of the CTE changes as well so be
quite<00:03:31.330> interesting<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.810> see<00:03:31.930> what<00:03:32.049> they

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
quite interesting to see what they

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.660 
quite interesting to see what they
actually<00:03:32.290> do<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.890> these<00:03:32.980> weapons<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:33.430> order<00:03:33.519> to

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
actually do to these weapons in order to

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.160 
actually do to these weapons in order to
make<00:03:33.819> them<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:33.970> little<00:03:34.150> bit<00:03:34.269> different<00:03:34.720> because

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
make them a little bit different because

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.170 
make them a little bit different because
I<00:03:35.290> think<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.830> Bulldog<00:03:36.220> is<00:03:36.400> probably<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.030> little

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
I think the Bulldog is probably a little

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.030 
I think the Bulldog is probably a little
bit<00:03:37.390> overpowered<00:03:38.110> especially<00:03:38.799> with<00:03:38.950> the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
bit overpowered especially with the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.610 
bit overpowered especially with the
setup<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.489> showed<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:39.850> recently<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:41.170> DMR

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
setup I showed you recently the DMR

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.199 
setup I showed you recently the DMR
Bulldog<00:03:42.100> video<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.430> did<00:03:42.670> that'll<00:03:42.850> be<00:03:42.940> linked<00:03:43.150> in

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
Bulldog video I did that'll be linked in

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.460 
Bulldog video I did that'll be linked in
the<00:03:43.299> description<00:03:43.390> it's<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.049> screen<00:03:44.290> right

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
the description it's on the screen right

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.590 
the description it's on the screen right
now<00:03:44.640> basically<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.670> turned<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.060> into<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.269> single

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
now basically I turned it into a single

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.930 
now basically I turned it into a single
fired<00:03:46.989> DMR<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.890> because<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.459> thing<00:03:48.519> does

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
fired DMR and because this thing does

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.210 
fired DMR and because this thing does
massive<00:03:49.390> damage<00:03:49.630> at<00:03:50.170> range<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:51.100> can

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
massive damage at range you can

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.650 
massive damage at range you can
basically<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.730> shot<00:03:51.970> somebody<00:03:52.209> in<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.510> head

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
basically to shot somebody in the head

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.820 
basically to shot somebody in the head
with<00:03:52.840> this<00:03:52.959> thing<00:03:53.170> so<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.440> essentially

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
with this thing so it essentially

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.280 
with this thing so it essentially
becomes<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:54.160> DMR<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:54.790> because<00:03:55.420> it's<00:03:55.569> 700

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
becomes a DMR and because it's 700

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.020 
becomes a DMR and because it's 700
rounds<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.680> minute<00:03:56.950> you<00:03:57.100> can<00:03:57.340> just<00:03:57.580> literally

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
rounds a minute you can just literally

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.390 
rounds a minute you can just literally
rattle<00:03:58.750> off<00:03:58.959> so<00:03:59.560> many<00:03:59.829> bullets<00:04:00.040> that<00:04:00.340> the

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
rattle off so many bullets that the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.190 
rattle off so many bullets that the
enemy<00:04:00.670> hasn't<00:04:00.940> even<00:04:01.030> got<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.269> chance<00:04:01.329> to<00:04:01.750> reply

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
enemy hasn't even got a chance to reply

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.949 
enemy hasn't even got a chance to reply
so<00:04:02.980> I<00:04:03.010> felt<00:04:03.670> like<00:04:03.850> a<00:04:03.880> bit<00:04:04.150> of<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.329> bastard<00:04:04.780> when<00:04:04.900> I

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
so I felt like a bit of a bastard when I

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.780 
so I felt like a bit of a bastard when I
was<00:04:05.140> doing<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:05.530> but<00:04:05.769> it<00:04:06.310> was<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.459> really<00:04:06.700> good

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
was doing it but it was a really good

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.009 
was doing it but it was a really good
loader<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.239> that's<00:04:07.420> why<00:04:07.570> I<00:04:07.630> think<00:04:07.780> that's

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
loader and that's why I think that's

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.440 
loader and that's why I think that's
probably<00:04:08.380> gonna<00:04:08.560> get<00:04:08.769> nerfed<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.910> MPX<00:04:10.299> I

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
probably gonna get nerfed the MPX I

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.390 
probably gonna get nerfed the MPX I
could<00:04:10.600> probably<00:04:10.840> see<00:04:11.170> a<00:04:11.200> slight<00:04:11.680> increase<00:04:12.250> in

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
could probably see a slight increase in

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.000 
could probably see a slight increase in
the<00:04:13.049> accuracy<00:04:14.049> when<00:04:14.290> you're<00:04:14.410> firing<00:04:14.799> from<00:04:14.950> the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
the accuracy when you're firing from the

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.340 
the accuracy when you're firing from the
hip<00:04:15.130> because<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.030> is<00:04:16.180> very<00:04:16.600> accurate<00:04:16.870> when

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
hip because it is very accurate when

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.140 
hip because it is very accurate when
doing<00:04:17.709> that<00:04:17.829> I've<00:04:18.190> also<00:04:18.400> found<00:04:18.669> that<00:04:18.940> even

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
doing that I've also found that even

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.060 
doing that I've also found that even
though<00:04:19.390> it's<00:04:19.539> not<00:04:19.600> great<00:04:19.959> at<00:04:20.140> range<00:04:20.440> I've<00:04:20.799> got

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
though it's not great at range I've got

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.440 
though it's not great at range I've got
some<00:04:21.280> clips<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:21.669> I'll<00:04:21.789> put<00:04:21.970> together<00:04:22.120> in

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
some clips that I'll put together in

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.659 
some clips that I'll put together in
another<00:04:22.750> video<00:04:23.080> where<00:04:23.410> I<00:04:23.620> was<00:04:24.039> taking<00:04:24.370> people

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
another video where I was taking people

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.820 
another video where I was taking people
out<00:04:24.820> as<00:04:25.030> sort<00:04:25.210> of<00:04:25.270> like<00:04:25.390> 40<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.960> 50<00:04:26.320> meters<00:04:26.680> away

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
out as sort of like 40 to 50 meters away

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.620 
out as sort of like 40 to 50 meters away
with<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.160> MPX<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.789> I<00:04:27.850> thought<00:04:28.000> well<00:04:28.479> that's

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
with the MPX and I thought well that's

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.240 
with the MPX and I thought well that's
really<00:04:28.990> not<00:04:29.260> how<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.530> weapon<00:04:29.919> should<00:04:30.070> perform

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
really not how the weapon should perform

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.880 
really not how the weapon should perform
so<00:04:30.789> I<00:04:31.000> gather<00:04:31.630> they're<00:04:31.870> gonna<00:04:32.020> change<00:04:32.410> that<00:04:32.680> in

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
so I gather they're gonna change that in

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.360 
so I gather they're gonna change that in
the<00:04:33.039> patch<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:34.229> moving<00:04:35.229> further<00:04:35.440> on<00:04:35.740> though<00:04:35.950> as

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
the patch to moving further on though as

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.730 
the patch to moving further on though as
I<00:04:36.550> said<00:04:36.760> I<00:04:36.789> haven't<00:04:37.090> unlocked<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.960> unica<00:04:38.320> 6<00:04:38.350> or

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
I said I haven't unlocked the unica 6 or

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.040 
I said I haven't unlocked the unica 6 or
the<00:04:38.950> deagle<00:04:39.280> yet<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.729> I<00:04:40.180> am<00:04:40.210> working<00:04:40.570> towards

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
the deagle yet and I am working towards

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.420 
the deagle yet and I am working towards
those<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.440> will<00:04:41.530> probably<00:04:41.860> end<00:04:41.950> up<00:04:42.130> you'll

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
those and will probably end up you'll

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.610 
those and will probably end up you'll
probably<00:04:42.580> see<00:04:42.880> that<00:04:43.090> later<00:04:43.570> on<00:04:43.780> in<00:04:44.140> some<00:04:44.350> of<00:04:44.500> my

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
probably see that later on in some of my

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.740 
probably see that later on in some of my
videos<00:04:44.789> just<00:04:45.789> to<00:04:45.880> touch<00:04:46.030> on<00:04:46.270> though<00:04:46.479> going

videos just to touch on though going

along with the cancellation should say

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.870 
along with the cancellation should say

final stand DLC for Battlefield 4 I know
we've<00:04:57.070> only<00:04:57.130> just<00:04:57.280> had<00:04:57.729> dragon's<00:04:58.150> teeth<00:04:58.300> but<00:04:58.479> I

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
we've only just had dragon's teeth but I

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.730 
we've only just had dragon's teeth but I
thought<00:04:58.660> this<00:04:58.780> was<00:04:58.930> kind<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.260> relevant

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740

thought this was kind of relevant

don't<00:05:03.159> have<00:05:03.340> any<00:05:03.669> solid<00:05:04.000> date<00:05:04.360> yet<00:05:04.659> but<00:05:04.690> we<00:05:05.409> can

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
don't have any solid date yet but we can

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.110 
don't have any solid date yet but we can
only<00:05:05.740> assume<00:05:06.159> that<00:05:06.220> it's<00:05:06.520> going<00:05:06.669> to<00:05:06.760> be<00:05:06.909> within

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
only assume that it's going to be within

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.679 
only assume that it's going to be within
the<00:05:07.330> first

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:07.689 
the first

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:10.320 
the first
four<00:05:07.869> months<00:05:08.139> of<00:05:08.439> the<00:05:08.799> year<00:05:09.129> and<00:05:09.369> that<00:05:10.089> means

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
four months of the year and that means

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.179 
four months of the year and that means
that<00:05:10.599> they're<00:05:10.839> moving<00:05:11.049> dragon's<00:05:11.799> teeth<00:05:11.979> and

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:12.189 
that they're moving dragon's teeth and

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:13.529 
that they're moving dragon's teeth and
they<00:05:12.249> haven't<00:05:12.489> really<00:05:12.729> no<00:05:13.089> sorry<00:05:13.360> not

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
they haven't really no sorry not

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.629 
they haven't really no sorry not
dragon's<00:05:13.929> teeth<00:05:14.049> final<00:05:14.499> stand<00:05:14.830> we're<00:05:15.519> not

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
dragon's teeth final stand we're not

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.929 
dragon's teeth final stand we're not
really<00:05:15.789> too<00:05:15.969> sure<00:05:15.999> why<00:05:16.619> but<00:05:17.619> I<00:05:17.699> probably<00:05:18.699> think

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:18.939 
really too sure why but I probably think

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:20.909 
really too sure why but I probably think
it's<00:05:19.119> to<00:05:19.269> fill<00:05:19.449> the<00:05:19.569> gap<00:05:19.749> between<00:05:20.049> battle<00:05:20.769> for

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
it's to fill the gap between battle for

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.789 
it's to fill the gap between battle for
for<00:05:21.159> dragon's<00:05:22.029> teeth<00:05:22.209> and<00:05:22.479> hard<00:05:23.169> line<00:05:23.409> because

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:23.799 
for dragon's teeth and hard line because

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:25.769 
for dragon's teeth and hard line because
there's<00:05:24.009> only<00:05:24.099> one<00:05:24.429> DLC<00:05:24.999> now<00:05:25.209> that's<00:05:25.479> gonna<00:05:25.629> be

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:25.779 
there's only one DLC now that's gonna be

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:28.169 
there's only one DLC now that's gonna be
there<00:05:26.019> in<00:05:26.199> the<00:05:26.289> middle<00:05:26.559> so<00:05:27.369> maybe<00:05:27.909> looking

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:28.179 
there in the middle so maybe looking

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:29.669 
there in the middle so maybe looking
forward<00:05:28.449> to<00:05:28.539> final<00:05:28.839> stand<00:05:29.049> perhaps<00:05:29.469> it<00:05:29.589> will

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:29.679 
forward to final stand perhaps it will

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:31.319 
forward to final stand perhaps it will
give<00:05:29.829> them<00:05:29.949> time<00:05:30.129> to<00:05:30.399> maybe<00:05:30.639> implement<00:05:31.179> some

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:31.329 
give them time to maybe implement some

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:33.869 
give them time to maybe implement some
CTE<00:05:31.659> changes<00:05:32.199> into<00:05:32.559> the<00:05:32.589> game<00:05:32.799> before<00:05:33.039> final

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:33.879 
CTE changes into the game before final

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
CTE changes into the game before final
stand<00:05:34.089> comes<00:05:34.299> out<00:05:34.449> because<00:05:34.539> that<00:05:34.689> would<00:05:34.809> be

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:34.899 
stand comes out because that would be

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:37.829 
stand comes out because that would be
really<00:05:35.169> cool<00:05:35.319> to<00:05:35.529> see<00:05:35.969> but<00:05:36.969> ultimately<00:05:37.419> at<00:05:37.689> the

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:37.839 
really cool to see but ultimately at the

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.439 
really cool to see but ultimately at the
moment<00:05:38.289> everything<00:05:39.249> sort<00:05:39.579> of<00:05:39.669> going<00:05:39.939> well<00:05:40.149> in

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
moment everything sort of going well in

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:41.879 
moment everything sort of going well in
the<00:05:40.569> battlefield<00:05:40.989> universe<00:05:41.379> lots<00:05:41.619> things

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
the battlefield universe lots things

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.439 
the battlefield universe lots things
going<00:05:42.189> on<00:05:42.369> lots<00:05:42.699> of<00:05:42.819> interesting<00:05:43.389> things

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
going on lots of interesting things

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.689 
going on lots of interesting things
coming<00:05:44.079> our<00:05:44.229> way<00:05:44.259> as<00:05:44.679> well<00:05:44.919> the<00:05:45.459> fact<00:05:45.639> that

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
coming our way as well the fact that

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.790 
coming our way as well the fact that
hardlines<00:05:46.119> been<00:05:46.300> delayed<00:05:46.629> gives<00:05:47.289> them<00:05:47.499> time

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
hardlines been delayed gives them time

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.219 
hardlines been delayed gives them time
to<00:05:47.829> create<00:05:48.489> a<00:05:48.789> game<00:05:49.059> that<00:05:49.089> we're<00:05:49.539> all<00:05:49.779> going<00:05:50.110> to
