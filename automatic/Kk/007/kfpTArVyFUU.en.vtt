00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
notice there are two loops of track

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.180 
notice there are two loops of track
coming<00:03:20.600> up<00:03:20.750> here<00:03:21.019> so<00:03:21.680> we're<00:03:21.830> going<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.040> need<00:03:22.130> to

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.550 
use
loops<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.640> track<00:03:24.060> because<00:03:24.750> this<00:03:24.930> demon<00:03:25.319> train

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
loops of track because this demon train

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.309 
loops of track because this demon train
is<00:03:25.830> going<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.310> catch<00:03:26.519> up<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.849> us<00:03:26.879> very<00:03:27.239> shortly
