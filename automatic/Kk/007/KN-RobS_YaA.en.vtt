00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.890
 youtube 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:31.259
 The 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.430
 When I saw youtube in the mobile version of the smartphone version, I checked a little more 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.739
 Even though I 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.800
 It seems that you can not edit the title in the smartphone version or something 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.440

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.480

 Since there is a way of opening in 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:10.700
 If you look at the pc screen for a while with a smartphone, it will be very small and ugly . 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:16.220
 But it will be in the form of working while expanding it 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:22.040
 It is the easiest to do with a personal computer, but as I said earlier with a smartphone 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:24.920
 It is a small screen but it is possible to do it will be explained 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.540

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.600
 In other words, all the up-to-date brains come out 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.720
 Yes 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.900
 And of this 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.550
 For example, this Indonesia current place 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.550
 Edit the facility 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.540

 Of course you can add and do it, but the tab is here 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.370
 For example, when you put in maybe 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.370
 Well 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.080
 A needle and something 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.080
 For example, when you want to put in the alphabet 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.500
 And tag good luck 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:00.100

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.190
 About 3 columns 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.069
 I think that it is enough to make 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.110

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.130
