00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.949 
all predates the chain the techniques of
genetic<00:01:49.670> modification<00:01:49.789> these<00:01:50.599> techniques

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
genetic modification these techniques

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.260 
genetic modification these techniques
were<00:01:51.170> crude<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.679> precise<00:01:52.130> unpredictable<00:01:52.970> far

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
were crude and precise unpredictable far

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.080 
were crude and precise unpredictable far
worse<00:01:53.989> than<00:01:54.319> modern<00:01:55.130> genetic<00:01:55.520> modification

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
worse than modern genetic modification

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.760 
worse than modern genetic modification
so<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:56.630> stuff<00:01:56.869> we're<00:01:57.140> sold<00:01:57.380> with<00:01:57.590> no

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
so this stuff we're sold with no

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.440 
so this stuff we're sold with no
questions<00:01:58.160> asked<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.970> product<00:01:59.239> of

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
questions asked is the product of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.999 
questions asked is the product of
research<00:01:59.869> that<00:01:59.899> occurred<00:02:00.410> before<00:02:00.649> the

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
research that occurred before the

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.279 
research that occurred before the
techniques<00:02:01.580> of<00:02:01.729> gene<00:02:01.970> splicing<00:02:02.690> so<00:02:03.140> this

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
techniques of gene splicing so this

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.010 
techniques of gene splicing so this
thing's<00:02:03.470> very<00:02:03.770> different<00:02:04.250> as<00:02:04.340> many<00:02:04.550> new

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
thing's very different as many new

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.540 
thing's very different as many new
unique<00:02:06.020> properties<00:02:06.470> on<00:02:06.619> humans<00:02:07.039> but<00:02:07.429> the

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
unique properties on humans but the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.309 
unique properties on humans but the
appetite<00:02:08.030> stimulation<00:02:08.509> effect<00:02:08.959> is<00:02:09.050> probably

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
appetite stimulation effect is probably

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.170 
appetite stimulation effect is probably
both<00:02:09.679> stand<00:02:10.190> out<00:02:10.340> effective<00:02:10.759> all<00:02:10.879> but<00:02:11.060> there

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
both stand out effective all but there

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.000 
both stand out effective all but there
are<00:02:11.239> others<00:02:11.450> would<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.020> be<00:02:12.200> possible<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.739> turn

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
are others would it be possible to turn

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.650 
are others would it be possible to turn
back<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> clock<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.700> go<00:02:14.120> back<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.629> old

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
back the clock and go back to the old

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.590 
back the clock and go back to the old
wheat<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.349> mean

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
wheat I mean

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.780 
wheat I mean
is<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.380> scientifically<00:02:17.010> possible<00:02:17.250> at<00:02:17.670> this

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
is that scientifically possible at this

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.820 
is that scientifically possible at this
point<00:02:17.880> in<00:02:18.150> time<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:18.750> very<00:02:19.110> possible<00:02:19.470> it's

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
point in time it's very possible it's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.920 
point in time it's very possible it's
economically<00:02:20.430> unfeasible<00:02:20.670> probably<00:02:21.660> because

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
economically unfeasible probably because

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.050 
economically unfeasible probably because
this<00:02:22.080> thing<00:02:22.320> yields<00:02:22.560> about<00:02:22.620> tenfold<00:02:23.010> more<00:02:23.340> per

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
this thing yields about tenfold more per

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.840 
this thing yields about tenfold more per
acre<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.200> we<00:02:25.500> have<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.860> ask<00:02:26.040> farmers<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.670> do

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
acre and so we have to ask farmers to do

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.330 
acre and so we have to ask farmers to do
to<00:02:27.090> take<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.300> loss<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:27.960> effect<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:28.440> had<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:29.220> ask

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
to take a loss in effect we had to ask

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.950 
to take a loss in effect we had to ask
agribusiness<00:02:30.060> they<00:02:30.210> revert<00:02:30.570> back<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.810> old

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
agribusiness they revert back to old

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.070 
agribusiness they revert back to old
seeds<00:02:31.440> they<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.340> do<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.760> they<00:02:32.910> probably<00:02:33.390> won't

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
seeds they can do it they probably won't

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.170 
seeds they can do it they probably won't
do<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.530> now<00:02:34.740> we<00:02:34.800> have<00:02:35.070> sparked<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.580> movement<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
do it now we have sparked a movement and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.400 
do it now we have sparked a movement and
we<00:02:36.300> are<00:02:36.450> having<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.840> lot<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.020> people<00:02:37.260> there

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
we are having a lot of people there

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.640 
we are having a lot of people there
having<00:02:37.800> record<00:02:38.340> drops<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.090> sales<00:02:39.530> because<00:02:40.530> of

having record drops and sales because of

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.200 
having record drops and sales because of
this<00:02:40.740> because<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.340> many<00:02:41.460> people<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.000> think

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
this because so many people I think

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.300 
this because so many people I think
what's<00:02:42.510> driving<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.320> tidal<00:02:43.890> wave<00:02:44.070> of

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
what's driving this is the tidal wave of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.280 
what's driving this is the tidal wave of
