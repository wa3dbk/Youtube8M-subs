00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.840 
really really exceptional features for a
child's<00:00:26.110> work<00:00:26.260> so<00:00:26.610> first<00:00:27.610> thing<00:00:27.730> you'll

notice your smooth skin panel here and

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.159 
notice your smooth skin panel here and
basically<00:00:30.520> that's<00:00:30.880> designed<00:00:31.300> that<00:00:31.600> no<00:00:31.779> winds

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
basically that's designed that no winds

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.470 
basically that's designed that no winds
can<00:00:32.320> get<00:00:32.500> into<00:00:32.739> that<00:00:32.890> and<00:00:33.070> so<00:00:34.059> on<00:00:34.149> those<00:00:34.300> cold

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
can get into that and so on those cold

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.059 
can get into that and so on those cold
windy<00:00:34.840> days<00:00:35.019> where<00:00:35.229> your<00:00:35.409> kids<00:00:35.559> playing<00:00:35.890> down

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:36.069 
windy days where your kids playing down

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.430 
windy days where your kids playing down
the<00:00:36.190> beach<00:00:36.370> and<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.999> running<00:00:37.210> along<00:00:37.569> it<00:00:38.229> won't

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
the beach and the running along it won't

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.709 
the beach and the running along it won't
let<00:00:38.559> me<00:00:38.620> win<00:00:38.859> through<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.219> wetsuit<00:00:39.579> but<00:00:40.420> more

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
let me win through the wetsuit but more

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.389 
let me win through the wetsuit but more
importantly<00:00:41.229> they've<00:00:41.530> actually<00:00:41.649> now<00:00:42.069> put

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
importantly they've actually now put

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.160 
importantly they've actually now put
this<00:00:42.629> integrated<00:00:43.629> into<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.870> back<00:00:44.019> of<00:00:44.109> the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
this integrated into the back of the

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.229 
this integrated into the back of the
wetsuit<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:45.280> it<00:00:45.550> can't<00:00:45.819> get<00:00:45.940> into<00:00:46.089> their

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
wetsuit so it can't get into their

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.910 
wetsuit so it can't get into their
kidneys<00:00:46.659> and<00:00:46.899> I'll<00:00:47.019> see<00:00:47.199> if<00:00:47.289> it<00:00:47.440> if<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.769> wind

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
kidneys and I'll see if it if the wind

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.860 
kidneys and I'll see if it if the wind
gets<00:00:48.010> into<00:00:48.339> their<00:00:48.460> kidneys<00:00:48.819> which<00:00:49.389> pumps<00:00:49.690> cold

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
gets into their kidneys which pumps cold

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.149 
gets into their kidneys which pumps cold
blood<00:00:50.170> around<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.499> body<00:00:50.559> that's<00:00:50.949> when<00:00:51.100> they

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
blood around the body that's when they

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.610 
blood around the body that's when they
start<00:00:51.370> to<00:00:51.429> get<00:00:51.579> cold<00:00:52.139> it's<00:00:53.139> a<00:00:53.229> flat<00:00:53.440> lock

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
start to get cold it's a flat lock

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.129 
start to get cold it's a flat lock
wetsuit<00:00:54.179> which<00:00:55.179> basically<00:00:55.510> means<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:55.989> two

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.139 
wetsuit which basically means the two

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.419 
wetsuit which basically means the two
pieces<00:00:56.319> of<00:00:56.499> material<00:00:56.620> have<00:00:57.010> been<00:00:57.039> joined

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
pieces of material have been joined

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.239 
pieces of material have been joined
together<00:00:57.549> and<00:00:58.120> then<00:00:58.420> stitch<00:00:58.719> forming<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.440> bond

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
together and then stitch forming a bond

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.569 
together and then stitch forming a bond
so<00:01:00.609> no<00:01:00.729> water<00:01:00.969> can<00:01:01.269> penetrate<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.809> wetsuit

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
so no water can penetrate the wetsuit

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.090 
so no water can penetrate the wetsuit
which<00:01:03.579> is<00:01:03.729> really<00:01:04.059> good<00:01:04.180> feature<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.920> some

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
which is really good feature and some

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.980 
which is really good feature and some
exceptional<00:01:06.760> features<00:01:06.940> for<00:01:07.300> a<00:01:07.330> kid's<00:01:07.540> wetsuit

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
exceptional features for a kid's wetsuit

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.080 
exceptional features for a kid's wetsuit
they've<00:01:08.500> actually<00:01:08.650> now<00:01:08.980> put<00:01:09.340> on<00:01:09.370> the<00:01:09.700> smooth

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
talks about the flatlock stitching here

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.200 
talks about the flatlock stitching here
which<00:01:42.040> as<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.310> can<00:01:42.340> see<00:01:42.610> from<00:01:42.730> theirs<00:01:42.970> is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
which as you can see from theirs is

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.140 
which as you can see from theirs is

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
so definitely one I'd be recommended if

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.700 
so definitely one I'd be recommended if
you<00:02:28.870> got<00:02:29.110> those<00:02:29.230> kitties<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.530> you're

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
you got those kitties and you're

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.600 
you got those kitties and you're
worrying<00:02:29.920> about<00:02:30.010> them<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.460> beach

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
worrying about them on the beach

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.980 
worrying about them on the beach
obviously<00:02:31.360> it's<00:02:31.450> also<00:02:31.570> going<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.750> give<00:02:31.870> them

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
obviously it's also going to give them

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.960 
obviously it's also going to give them
you<00:02:32.170> UV<00:02:32.620> protection<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.670> wearing<00:02:33.880> these

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
you UV protection and the wearing these

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.970 
you UV protection and the wearing these
as<00:02:34.150> well<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:34.840> also<00:02:34.959> allows<00:02:35.380> them<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.620> play<00:02:35.860> as

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
as well but also allows them to play as

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.280 
as well but also allows them to play as
long<00:02:36.010> as<00:02:36.250> possible<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.820> water<00:02:37.750> in<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.110> sea

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
long as possible in the water in the sea

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.740 
long as possible in the water in the sea
without<00:02:39.250> getting<00:02:39.670> cold<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.180> having<00:02:40.510> much<00:02:40.720> fun

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
without getting cold and having much fun

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.540 
without getting cold and having much fun
as<00:02:41.080> possible<00:02:41.110> which<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.130> what<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:42.430> all<00:02:42.520> about

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
as possible which is what it's all about

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.690 
as possible which is what it's all about
so<00:02:43.390> there<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.959> charge<00:02:44.200> reactor<00:02:44.740> for<00:02:45.190> this

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
so there is the charge reactor for this

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.930 
so there is the charge reactor for this
summer<00:02:46.090> 2010
