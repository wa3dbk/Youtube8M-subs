00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.010
 Hello everyone, well, today I bring you a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.860
 video of an idea that came to me and 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:03.620
 nothing like you see in the title is like 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:08.100
 make a sample of our enamels 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:12.360
 if we do not have the typical little wheels with 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.150
 the with the plastic nails to be able 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.270
 paint either girls who can not 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.240
 get it they do not want to spend the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.920
 money or anything more or 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.159
 unless I'm teaching what you need 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:33.750
 and you do not need clear why 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.100
 because we can use well 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.460
 or 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.009
 a permanent marker or labels 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.380
 to put the numbers or the names or 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.909
 what we want and what we are going to 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.909
 use will be 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.530
 and me 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:00.680
 the chips that come in the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.400
 Chinese girls of cds or dvds or something not 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.790
 then we will use the badges 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.399
 that usually come inside in the 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.060
 first to protect them from the dvds 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.340
 virgins and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.170
 well, we can find them 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.120
 come 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.280
 well so in plan a little more white 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.730
 rough finite plus fat or 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.790
 transparent then with the marker 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.030
 we will put the name or such and it is so 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.100
 simple how to catch our Maltese gene and 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.740
 go drawing 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.390
 and well, these are the ones I've made 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.970
 Right now I have not finished 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.440
 I'm still missing a lot more but 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.320
 well here for example I have the ones from kiko 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.540
 the ones that I have from kiko that you good 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.000
 so the parents put you by color or by 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.650
 brand as they want not 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.959
 I use 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.959
 focus very well but good I used 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.440
 the marker better because the labels 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.340
 they end up falling and such then for example 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.319
 here I have the color outside 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.409
 angol 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.180
 good everything I have from essence one 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.900
 of flower mark what is already on the second 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.630
 row of nick that makes it vienna there and 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.950
 good and made of mercadona 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.900
 bad then well then I put them like that and 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.900
 what I do is to put the 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.420
 numbers and here in the center then of 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.060
 inside out in 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.140
 names of the brand and here it's good 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.800
 are ten kings themselves and such 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.640
 depending then on the types and that then 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.930
 I have it here also with the name 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.959
 you can also 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.410
 apart from that you fit that fit two 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.230
 rows 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.420
 that fit many as you see there 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:17.350
 very much also for the back 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.920
 can be used can be put 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.040
 over 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.230
 that will be covered perfectly and well and 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.500
 because you have double the space since 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.940
 to be flat because nothing happens does not fall 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.770
 I do not know anything 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.320
 the truth is that it is great 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.730
 I am very happy and good 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.150
 this is how they have been for the moment 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:45.150
 still missing to add some more 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.840
 and nothing, I hope you liked it and 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.320
 see you in the next 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.320
 ah
