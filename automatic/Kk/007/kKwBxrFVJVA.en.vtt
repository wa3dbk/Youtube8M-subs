00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.990
 good friends of youtube and taringa in 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.050
 this tutorial I'm going to bring you what 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.110
 would be the installation of the somo patches 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:15.490
 links for fifa 13 pirate or fifa 13 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.210
 original without affecting or harming the 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.010
 functionality of online games 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.610
 true that the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.789
 we are going to direct to this link 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.009
 I will leave a description 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.759
 and we are going to enter this page that 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.340
 contains all the data for our 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.550
 fifa 13 of version 1.0 until the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.200
 version 7.6 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.739
 but what are we going to do to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.730
 save us install one by one by one 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.290
 ok let's go to 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.290
 direct us to that link 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:59.530
 that would be a fifa attention 13 modding 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.530
 wave mod 7.1 al in one 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.299
 is going to direct us to this page 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.509
 either we download it by torrent or by 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.000
 file front and they will say it because it's 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.830
 parking or otherwise good what it contains 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.720
 that patch as it says to the in one 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.720
 contains all previous versions 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:25.860
 until 7.1 and we have to talk the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.870
 install patch by patch and patches 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.230
 are we going to be the whole procedure in 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.760
 a single installer 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.760
 well I have not downloaded 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.080
 we went to the bookstore or to the place 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.450
 where we have saved the download 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.300
 in my case it would be here and first 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.340
 we would have those three files clear that 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.940
 we are going to extract them 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.720
 here 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.490
 and this list will not appear later 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.100
 records 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.270
 it's going to be super important we're going to 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.270
 give the option to copy 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.540
 and we are going to address our disk 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.420
 hard where we installed the fifa 13 the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.230
 fifa 13 main folder and sports 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.739
 fifa 13 and this will be where it will take 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.680
 After installing the patch 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:29.400
 exactly here not here in game here not 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.400
 not here 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.490
 will be carried out here here that what 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.530
 let's do let's hit 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.530
 in my case I do it because I already have a and 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.590
 fifa updated and it would not be convenient 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.170
 by doing this in your case you get copied and 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.140
 if he asks you 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.150
 s rename file about if you say 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.150
 what to pay back 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.180
 they give him yes 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.540
 in the end we would have those three 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.540
 records 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.129
 with its tombs 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.519
 and we're going to use what would be modding 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.840
 in crystal what would be the first step 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.840
 patch installation 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.900
 very important to execute it as 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.510
 administrator is one of the most important steps 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.210
 important if they do not do it they will not 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.310
 go well have to execute it as 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.380
 administrator and give install to this 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.600
 logo we do not read importance we only give it 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.570
 install will last about four minutes 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.740
 installing since you have to go version x 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.660
 version installing up to 7.1 once 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.860
 done this would already be our fifa 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.860
 completely updated 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.819
 and if you want to continue updating 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.819
 7.3 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.760
 You have to download the same 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.640
 archive 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.700
 that weighed about 50 megabytes two versions are 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.830
 totally light, this also weighs 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.760
 150 and up to maybe 15 megabytes maybe 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.280
 here we give you download 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.280
 a file would not come out the same 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.330
 we extract and we would leave what would be 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.459
 these same files too 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.470
 is to do the same steps only with 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.389
 different this versions we would give 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.289
 copy to this version 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:30.029
 we stick it on the one we had beige and 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:34.319
 the same if you ask is to restore files 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:36.749
 we give you that if we execute the modding 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:39.330
 wave install as administrator 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:43.490
 again every time we copy a 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:47.270
 new patch and we would give it install 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:51.199
 equally installing the 7.5 and 7.6 is the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.000
 same the same procedure and you have to 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.220
 remember that they have to start with the 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.419
 version 7.1 that which would be them 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.639
 leaving then the 7.37 point 5 and then 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.060
 7.6 in order for the patch to 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:08.289
 can work with 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.389
 with fullness this 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:14.129
 that would be all that would be the 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.129
 patch installation modding wave 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.790
 and here would be the moderator and selector that 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.950
 here I apply 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.960
 and the variables that they want to provide 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.759
 in the game 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.759
 here the entrance of the champions 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.510
 they apply I recommend the database 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.569
 4.0 that brings the new equipment and 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.240
 winter transfers 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.800
 new equipment like for example the one of 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.189
 the stars that bring cidadán 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.139
 maradona pelé beckenbauer excellent is 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:49.479
 Excellent 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:53.110
 then since they would be is the tree to the 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.449
 kits the boots here nothing bad was to apply 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.120
 database 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.689
 here we have 20 select your 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.029

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.000
 here to load the players and want 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.870
 change booty 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.170
 players 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:18.140
 we select the player we want and 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.920
 we're going to go to the cinema to assign the 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.920
 boot we want 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.370
 If I did not like how the boot looked 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:30.000
 we give the resort default 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.830
 very easy actually to use that patch 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.620
 and install also totally easy 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.000
 following the steps that I said good 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.240
 that would be all that would be the 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.590
 modding patch web.com 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.410
 for fifa 13 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:49.250
 original pirate does not vary starting from the 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:52.300
 version 7.1 to in one room 7 until the 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.220
 version 7.6 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.940
 Any doubt or question they ask me 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:00.210
 get to a taringa or to the channel 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:04.610
