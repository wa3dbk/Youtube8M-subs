00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 however, there were three performances 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.010
 however satisfactory considering the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.230
 our difficulties and therefore we expect 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.170
 that from here to the end 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.410
 as we have said besides what 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 we showed we can do 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.130
 something better 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.869
 but then Genoa was a match 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.210
 certainly not beautiful on our part 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.430
 we have granted little or nothing 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.179
 sampdoria because I think the sampdoria has 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.030
 pressed a little in the first 15 minutes 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.410
 came 20 minutes of the second half 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.410
 first time he never pulled on goal 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.000
 I agree with you that it can be done 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.960
 better and have been coming for three years 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.330
 first 45 places so it's a team 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:54.530
 very strong and no explanation as to why 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:59.240
 are so in a position but have 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.570
 demonstrated the past years that they are 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.510
 really very good so I'm not 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.970
 I still believe there are difficulties but 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.950
 we want to overcome these difficulties 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.040
 also as I said improving in 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.750
 game improving in the attack without the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.010
 ball with more players and improving 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.960
 in aggression in the midfield 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.869
 these are all aspects of the opponent 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:29.660
 they have to be improved, we have to feel ourselves 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:32.840
 however we are strong in the desire 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.180
 to immediately condition the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.610
 opponents we must not lose the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.800
 compactness because for us it is 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.990
 fundamental to be short anyway 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:48.790
 compact and give little space to 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.620
 our backs to the opponents then 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.500
 the error that should not be done and to 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.020
 attack opponents in a way 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.630
 reckless that's not good then 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.240
 in that case it is better to withdraw there 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.840
 own half of the field and then try 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.550
 take the ball there because later if you go 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.440
 in a reckless way in the meta field 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.060
 opposing 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.160
 you know well what can happen 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.360
 no in the game when he sees tomorrow 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.070
 meeting to make a team game 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.810
 so it really matters to make a match from 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:29.630
 team and when I say team game 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:31.940
 It counts the seriousness counts the sacrifice 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.680
 from the first 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.830
 from the first second to the last second 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.060
 so these three count skills 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:46.709
 aspects are fundamental for me and us 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:51.330
 we have these in our DNA 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:56.069
 pray seriousness generosity humility 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:03:00.630
 of wanting to always be there and also 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:04.550
 ability to show it's one 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.550
 able us to others too
