maps always seemed good when they first

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.229 
maps always seemed good when they first
come<00:00:54.489> out<00:00:54.610> because<00:00:54.790> they're<00:00:54.910> new<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.149> you

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
come out because they're new and you

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.880

it<00:03:27.140> really<00:03:27.650> becomes<00:03:28.010> an<00:03:28.160> issue<00:03:28.280> now<00:03:28.580> as<00:03:29.270> you

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
it really becomes an issue now as you

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.210 
it really becomes an issue now as you

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
can see me training over here the big

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.640 
can see me training over here the big
difference<00:03:31.520> that<00:03:32.180> are<00:03:32.630> yeah<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.500> big

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
difference that are yeah the big

table or look at just explode them and
it<00:03:40.250> causes<00:03:40.490> everyone<00:03:40.790> go<00:03:41.000> faster<00:03:41.300> it's<00:03:42.110> not

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
it causes everyone go faster it's not

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.110 
it causes everyone go faster it's not

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
like counting as a texture like I don't

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
bump into it or the table like I can get

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.850 
bump into it or the table like I can get

could<00:03:51.590> do<00:03:51.740> this<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:52.160> can<00:03:52.340> do<00:03:52.459> this<00:03:52.490> we<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.150> feel

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
could do this I can do this we I feel

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.790 
could do this I can do this we I feel
like<00:03:53.810> we're<00:03:53.930> gonna<00:03:53.990> get<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:54.320> plenty<00:03:54.620> of<00:03:54.650> high

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
like we're gonna get to plenty of high

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.710 
like we're gonna get to plenty of high
rounds<00:03:55.280> this<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.550> probably<00:03:55.850> an<00:03:56.030> easy<00:03:56.270> one<00:03:56.570> to

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
rounds this is probably an easy one to

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.660 
rounds this is probably an easy one to
do<00:03:56.870> I'm<00:03:57.140> sure<00:03:57.560> there's<00:03:57.800> plenty<00:03:58.070> more<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.490> map

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
do I'm sure there's plenty more the map

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.360 
do I'm sure there's plenty more the map
is<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.120> big<00:03:59.360> it<00:03:59.570> is<00:03:59.630> a<00:03:59.750> big<00:04:00.170> map<00:04:00.410> but<00:04:00.830> it's<00:04:01.220> like

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
is so big it is a big map but it's like

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.510 
is so big it is a big map but it's like
a<00:04:01.400> gigantic<00:04:01.940> Upton<00:04:02.840> shangri-la<00:04:03.560> aspect<00:04:04.310> and

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
a gigantic Upton shangri-la aspect and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.550 
a gigantic Upton shangri-la aspect and
it<00:04:04.970> plays<00:04:05.270> well<00:04:05.720> because<00:04:06.200> there's<00:04:06.350> still

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
it plays well because there's still

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.530 
it plays well because there's still
places<00:04:06.740> a<00:04:06.980> train<00:04:07.310> there's<00:04:07.520> still<00:04:07.670> places<00:04:07.850> for

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
places a train there's still places for

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.590 
places a train there's still places for
you<00:04:08.690> to<00:04:08.720> not<00:04:09.170> have<00:04:09.950> yourself<00:04:10.310> murdered<00:04:10.850> but<00:04:11.540> uh

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
a good bounce back from what treyarch

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.460 
a good bounce back from what treyarch

do for the zombies storyline it explains
stuff<00:05:53.460> without<00:05:53.700> explaining<00:05:54.270> something<00:05:54.630> that
