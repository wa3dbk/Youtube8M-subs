00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
have been a time long past when Celestia

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.310 
have been a time long past when Celestia

had attempted to show mercy to discord
and<00:02:46.530> discord<00:02:47.250> continued<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.030> spread<00:02:48.239> his

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
and discord continued to spread his

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.350 
and discord continued to spread his
chaos<00:02:48.930> across<00:02:49.170> Equestria<00:02:49.650> anyways<00:02:50.520> we've

chaos across Equestria anyways we've

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.750 
chaos across Equestria anyways we've
always<00:02:51.600> known<00:02:51.989> Celestia<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.860> be<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> wise<00:02:53.340> and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
always known Celestia to be a wise and

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.770

gentle soul

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.540

but<00:02:54.900> with<00:02:55.050> discord<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.860> can<00:02:56.040> imagine<00:02:56.280> that

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
but with discord I can imagine that

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.580 
but with discord I can imagine that
there<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:56.910> more<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.390> reason<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:57.870> Celestia

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
there is more of a reason for Celestia

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.310 
there is more of a reason for Celestia
to<00:02:58.739> be<00:02:58.830> upset<00:02:59.220> with<00:02:59.250> him<00:02:59.660> before<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.690> time<00:03:01.080> of

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
to be upset with him before the time of

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
imprisonment I can see a situation where

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.850 
imprisonment I can see a situation where
Celestia<00:03:06.239> tried<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.870> reason<00:03:07.110> with<00:03:07.320> discord

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860
