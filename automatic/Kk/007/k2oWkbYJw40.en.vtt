well<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.730> can<00:00:02.850> definitely<00:00:03.000> tell<00:00:03.389> it's<00:00:03.570> been<00:00:03.720> a

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
well you can definitely tell it's been a

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.090 
well you can definitely tell it's been a
little<00:00:03.990> while<00:00:04.140> since<00:00:04.170> I've<00:00:04.560> cleaned<00:00:04.799> this<00:00:04.920> out

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
little while since I've cleaned this out

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.410 
little while since I've cleaned this out
really<00:00:05.400> good<00:00:05.609> as<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.790> can<00:00:05.940> see<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.299> was

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
really good as you can see that was

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.240 
really good as you can see that was
actually<00:00:06.750> stuck<00:00:07.020> up<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.470> shroud<00:00:07.950> there

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
actually stuck up in the shroud there

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.720 
actually stuck up in the shroud there
and<00:00:09.019> while<00:00:10.019> they're<00:00:10.170> not<00:00:10.490> extremely<00:00:11.490> dirty

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
and while they're not extremely dirty

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.910 
and while they're not extremely dirty
the<00:00:12.509> dirty<00:00:12.540> enough<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.259> cause<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> little<00:00:13.740> bit

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
the dirty enough to cause a little bit

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.790 
the dirty enough to cause a little bit
of<00:00:14.210> decrease<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.389> temperature<00:00:15.870> or<00:00:16.109> increase

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
of decrease in temperature or increase

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.950 
of decrease in temperature or increase
in<00:00:16.980> temperature<00:00:17.430> decrease<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.150> performance

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
in temperature decrease in performance

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.080 
in temperature decrease in performance
no<00:00:19.920> not<00:00:20.160> really<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> decrease<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:20.939> performance

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
no not really a decrease in performance

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.660 
no not really a decrease in performance
but<00:00:21.779> an<00:00:22.320> increase<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.890> temperature<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.460> sure

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
but an increase in temperature for sure

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.279 
but an increase in temperature for sure
so<00:00:24.529> basically<00:00:26.330> my<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.660> clean<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.109> guy

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
so basically my to do is clean this guy

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.060 
so basically my to do is clean this guy
out<00:00:28.439> real<00:00:28.650> good<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:30.019> swap<00:00:31.019> these<00:00:31.170> fans<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:31.740> so

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
out real good and swap these fans out so

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.240 
out real good and swap these fans out so
let's<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.270> right<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.470 

okay<00:00:38.250> well<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.960> fan<00:00:39.960> swap<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.590> complete

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
okay well the fan swap is complete

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.920 
okay well the fan swap is complete
here's<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> old<00:00:42.719> set<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.420> decided<00:00:45.750> not

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
here's the old set up and I decided not

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.740 
here's the old set up and I decided not
to<00:00:45.989> run<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> shroud<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:47.539> least<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
to run the shroud on these least for the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
to run the shroud on these least for the
time<00:00:48.780> being<00:00:48.989> gives<00:00:49.530> me<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> lot<00:00:49.920> lower<00:00:50.100> profile

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
time being gives me a lot lower profile

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.729 
time being gives me a lot lower profile
which<00:00:51.300> really<00:00:51.870> doesn't<00:00:52.140> matter<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:52.500> running

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
which really doesn't matter I'm running

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.279 
which really doesn't matter I'm running
in<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> tech<00:00:53.070> bench<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.910> I'm<00:00:54.420> still<00:00:55.140> using

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
in the tech bench and I'm still using

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.170 
in the tech bench and I'm still using
rubber<00:00:55.800> bands<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.309> hold<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.000> time

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
rubber bands to hold it on for the time

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.569 
rubber bands to hold it on for the time
being<00:00:57.620> because<00:00:58.620> I'm<00:00:58.800> gonna<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.100> pulling<00:00:59.489> this

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
being because I'm gonna be pulling this

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.889 
being because I'm gonna be pulling this
off<00:00:59.789> again<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.359> don't<00:01:00.510> want<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> permanent

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
off again and I don't want a permanent

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.650 
off again and I don't want a permanent
solution<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> moment<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:02.460> gonna

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
solution at the moment because I'm gonna

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.119 
solution at the moment because I'm gonna
put<00:01:03.660> another<00:01:03.750> cooler<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.650> eventually

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
put another cooler on here eventually

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.190 
put another cooler on here eventually
I'm<00:01:05.220> sure<00:01:05.250> my<00:01:06.000> thermal<00:01:06.479> rights<00:01:06.630> shaman<00:01:07.080> does

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
I'm sure my thermal rights shaman does

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.260 
I'm sure my thermal rights shaman does
not<00:01:07.380> fit<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.570> stack<00:01:09.570> DVI<00:01:09.960> ports<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.700> I

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
not fit because of stack DVI ports and I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.240 
not fit because of stack DVI ports and I
like<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.750> said<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.930> replace<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> rubber<00:01:13.680> bands<00:01:13.950> I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
like I said I replace the rubber bands I

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.450 
like I said I replace the rubber bands I
use<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.549> heavy-duty<00:01:15.030> black<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
use this heavy-duty black one here and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.100 
use this heavy-duty black one here and
used<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.759> actually<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.360> top<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.750> each<00:01:18.869> other

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
used to actually on top of each other

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.740 
used to actually on top of each other
right<00:01:19.320> here<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.040> case<00:01:20.540> because<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
right here just in case because the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.570 
right here just in case because the
other<00:01:21.869> ones<00:01:22.080> were<00:01:22.259> starting<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.460> little

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
other ones were starting to get a little

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.730 
other ones were starting to get a little
cracked<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.750> didn't<00:01:25.320> want<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> them

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
cracked up and I didn't want one of them

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.490 
cracked up and I didn't want one of them
to<00:01:25.830> break<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.369> fans<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.820> fall<00:01:27.030> off<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:28.020> I

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to break and my fans to fall off and I

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.530 
to break and my fans to fall off and I
could<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:28.829> find<00:01:29.220> my<00:01:29.430> zip<00:01:29.640> ties<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.390> no

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
could not find my zip ties I have no

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.730 
could not find my zip ties I have no
idea<00:01:30.840> where<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.320> went

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
idea where they went

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.280 
idea where they went
so<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.280> used<00:01:32.460> these<00:01:32.610> heavy-duty<00:01:33.290> twist

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
so I just used these heavy-duty twist

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.060 
so I just used these heavy-duty twist
ties<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:36.240> I'll<00:01:36.329> put<00:01:36.659> some<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:37.560> each<00:01:37.740> corner

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
ties and I'll put some at each corner

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.560 
ties and I'll put some at each corner
just<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.520> give<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:39.079> level<00:01:40.079> base<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.570> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
just to give it a level base and that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.240 
just to give it a level base and that
should<00:01:42.750> prevent<00:01:43.020> any<00:01:43.170> little<00:01:43.649> bit<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
should prevent any little bit of

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.910 
should prevent any little bit of
vibration<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.119> might<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.920> hopefully

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
vibration that there might be hopefully

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.060 
vibration that there might be hopefully
as<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.420> ran<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> cabling

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
as you can see I ran all the cabling

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.760 
as you can see I ran all the cabling
here<00:01:50.600> now<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.200> three<00:01:52.500> pins

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
here now I just have to three pins

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.950 
here now I just have to three pins
instead<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> two<00:01:53.700> three<00:01:54.060> pins<00:01:54.329> Plus<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
instead of the two three pins Plus this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.420 
instead of the two three pins Plus this
extra<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.920> plug<00:01:56.070> into<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
extra one that I have to plug into the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.130
