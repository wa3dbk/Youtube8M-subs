you can do a solid axle swap or Sasson
the<00:00:49.100> 4runner<00:00:49.489> guys<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.090> it's<00:00:50.719> going<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:50.989> be

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
the 4runner guys and it's going to be

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.010 
the 4runner guys and it's going to be
sweet<00:00:51.579> I<00:00:52.579> don't<00:00:53.000> know<00:00:53.090> how<00:00:53.270> many<00:00:53.329> parts<00:00:53.840> this

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
sweet I don't know how many parts this

part one and it's just going to go

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.209 
part one and it's just going to go
through<00:00:57.680> as<00:00:58.129> I<00:00:58.250> kind<00:00:58.399> of<00:00:58.489> work<00:00:58.640> on<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:58.969> and<00:01:00.219> you

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.380 
know it's not going to be an exact
step-by-step<00:01:02.690> how<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.530> do<00:01:03.860> this<00:01:04.489> it's<00:01:04.820> more<00:01:05.300> or

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
step-by-step how to do this it's more or

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.520 
step-by-step how to do this it's more or
less<00:01:05.449> because<00:01:05.690> it's<00:01:05.869> going<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.050> be<00:01:06.170> like<00:01:06.320> kind

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
less because it's going to be like kind

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.670 
less because it's going to be like kind
of<00:01:06.619> my<00:01:06.830> little<00:01:07.570> just<00:01:08.570> here's<00:01:09.140> what<00:01:09.350> I'm<00:01:09.440> doing

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
curious to see how this differential oil

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.570 
curious to see how this differential oil
is<00:01:23.720> going<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.869> look<00:01:24.050> but<00:01:24.830> it's<00:01:25.340> kind<00:01:25.520> of

well<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.659> first<00:01:56.899> thing<00:01:57.049> that<00:01:57.079> come<00:01:57.320> out<00:01:57.439> was

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
well the first thing that come out was

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.830 
well the first thing that come out was
oil<00:01:57.829> when<00:01:58.070> oil<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.460> lighter<00:01:58.610> than<00:01:58.820> water<00:01:58.880> which
