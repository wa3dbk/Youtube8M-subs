00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.839 
some branch cards that I'm going to be
sets<00:04:55.289> but<00:04:55.530> hopefully<00:04:55.949> in<00:04:56.129> the<00:04:56.189> future<00:04:56.669> these

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
sets but hopefully in the future these

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.899 
sets but hopefully in the future these
cards<00:04:57.210> do<00:04:57.419> now<00:04:57.990> in<00:04:58.199> pro<00:04:58.469> packs<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:59.039> do<00:04:59.129> believe

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
cards do now in pro packs I do believe

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.790 
cards do now in pro packs I do believe
that<00:05:00.569> they<00:05:00.750> added<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.379> Football<00:05:01.770> Outsiders

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
that they added the Football Outsiders

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.709 
that they added the Football Outsiders
back<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.699> packs<00:05:02.909> and<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.210> did<00:05:03.330> boost<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:03.690> odds

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
back to packs and it did boost the odds

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:07.360 
back to packs and it did boost the odds
i<00:05:04.050> would<00:05:04.199> say<00:05:04.440> probably<00:05:04.650> from<00:05:05.190> point<00:05:05.750> 000000

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
i would say probably from point 000000

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.580 
i would say probably from point 000000
12.000<00:05:08.370> one<00:05:08.879> so<00:05:09.150> you<00:05:09.210> probably<00:05:09.990> have<00:05:10.319> more<00:05:10.500> of

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
12.000 one so you probably have more of

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.350 
12.000 one so you probably have more of
a<00:05:10.620> chance<00:05:10.650> for<00:05:11.009> the<00:05:11.190> free<00:05:11.370> safety<00:05:11.520> or<00:05:11.940> left<00:05:12.240> go

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
a chance for the free safety or left go

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.629 
a chance for the free safety or left go
out<00:05:12.539> of<00:05:12.659> propex<00:05:13.080> but<00:05:13.710> right<00:05:13.889> now<00:05:14.039> i'm<00:05:14.340> not
