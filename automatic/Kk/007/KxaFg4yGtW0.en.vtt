00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
cons so don't worry about that the cons

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.139 
cons so don't worry about that the cons
would<00:02:01.069> just<00:02:01.280> be<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.520> fact<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:01.819> they<00:02:02.000> have

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149
