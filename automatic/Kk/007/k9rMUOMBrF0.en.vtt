that<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.210> want<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.410> could<00:00:25.769> tell<00:00:26.010> this

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
that you want so I could tell this

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.060 
that you want so I could tell this
machine<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.359> want<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.750> many<00:00:28.260> liters<00:00:28.830> of

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
machine that I want so many liters of

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.910 
machine that I want so many liters of
water<00:00:29.279> at<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> particular<00:00:30.570> temperature<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.410> can

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
water at a particular temperature I can

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.080 
water at a particular temperature I can
use<00:00:32.099> leaders<00:00:32.820> or<00:00:33.059> gallons<00:00:33.660> or<00:00:33.870> i<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.500> use

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
use leaders or gallons or i can use

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.370 
use leaders or gallons or i can use
centigrade<00:00:36.090> or<00:00:36.300> Fahrenheit<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.200> my

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
centigrade or Fahrenheit as my

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.389 
centigrade or Fahrenheit as my
measurement<00:00:37.890> units<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.760> interchangeable

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
measurement units it's interchangeable

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.340 
measurement units it's interchangeable
so<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> told<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.120> machine<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.809> need<00:00:42.989> four

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
so I told the machine that I need four

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.250 
so I told the machine that I need four
pounds<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.100> water<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.719> want<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.140> be

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
pounds of water and I want it to be

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.510 
pounds of water and I want it to be
about<00:00:46.469> 60<00:00:47.370> degree<00:00:47.700> temperature<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.520> I'll

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
about 60 degree temperature and I'll

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.340 
about 60 degree temperature and I'll
take<00:00:50.789> my<00:00:50.969> unit<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:52.610> I<00:00:53.610> put<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:53.910> hook<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
take my unit and I put my hook on it and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.220 
take my unit and I put my hook on it and
I<00:00:56.010> press<00:00:56.340> Start<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:57.660> give<00:00:57.840> me<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> water<00:01:00.230> so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
I press Start or give me the water so

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.509 
I press Start or give me the water so
I've<00:01:01.350> got<00:01:01.620> enough<00:01:02.039> amount<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.460> water<00:01:04.309> now<00:01:05.309> in

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
I've got enough amount of water now in

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.490 
I've got enough amount of water now in
in<00:01:05.670> all<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.540> formulas<00:01:07.170> water<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.250> variable<00:01:09.500> so

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
in all the formulas water is variable so

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.260 
in all the formulas water is variable so
water<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.820> always<00:01:12.180> exact<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.220> approximate

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
water is not always exact is approximate

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
water is not always exact is approximate
you<00:01:15.270> always<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> tinker<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you always have to tinker with it a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.530 
you always have to tinker with it a
little<00:01:17.009> bit<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.900> said<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> time<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.240> I<00:01:21.240> had<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
little bit I said the time and I had the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.630 
little bit I said the time and I had the
proper<00:01:21.810> rotation<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.490> 10<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:23.970> machine

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.040 

it's<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.510> you<00:01:27.960> notice<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.590> moving<00:01:29.040> very<00:01:29.100> slow

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
it's as you notice it's moving very slow

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.930 
it's as you notice it's moving very slow
at<00:01:31.050> first<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> move<00:01:32.070> snow<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.700> mix

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
at first is going to move snow to mix

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.710 
at first is going to move snow to mix
all<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.330> ingredients<00:01:34.729> once<00:01:35.729> ingredients<00:01:36.450> mix

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
all the ingredients once ingredients mix

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.520 
all the ingredients once ingredients mix
I've<00:01:36.960> told<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.590> after<00:01:38.220> 10<00:01:38.520> minutes<00:01:39.530> hit

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
I've told it that after 10 minutes hit

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.820 
I've told it that after 10 minutes hit
the<00:01:40.800> higher<00:01:41.040> speed<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.760> another<00:01:41.970> 15<00:01:42.450> minutes

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
the higher speed for another 15 minutes

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.640 
the higher speed for another 15 minutes
so<00:01:43.830> it<00:01:43.920> does<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.310> automatically<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.470> you<00:01:46.470> can

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
so it does that automatically as you can

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.040 
so it does that automatically as you can
see<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.040> gotta<00:01:47.250> hook<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.790> stationary<00:01:48.479> mixing

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
see we gotta hook that stationary mixing

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.980 
see we gotta hook that stationary mixing
then<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.800> got<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> rotating<00:01:50.670> ball<00:01:50.940> this<00:01:51.690> is<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
then we got a rotating ball this is the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.830 
then we got a rotating ball this is the
best<00:01:52.320> way<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> mix<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.369> dough<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:54.300> don't<00:01:54.479> tear

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
best way to mix the dough you don't tear

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.530 
best way to mix the dough you don't tear
it<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.619> don't<00:01:55.800> heat<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.130> up<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.940> don't<00:01:57.150> alter

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it you don't heat it up you don't alter

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.290 
it you don't heat it up you don't alter
the<00:01:57.659> temperature<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.759> perfect<00:02:00.619> it's<00:02:01.619> perfect

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
the temperature is perfect it's perfect

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.240 
the temperature is perfect it's perfect
so<00:02:03.300> we<00:02:03.479> give<00:02:03.660> it<00:02:03.750> some<00:02:03.960> time<00:02:04.170> we're<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.190> to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
so we give it some time we're going to

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.650 
so we give it some time we're going to
go<00:02:05.430> back<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.789> cookies<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.390> minute

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
go back to the cookies in a minute

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.240 
go back to the cookies in a minute
you're<00:02:07.440> going<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.619> give<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.830> some<00:02:08.039> time<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
you're going to give you some time to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.150 
you're going to give you some time to
mix<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> ingredients<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:10.440> about<00:02:10.560> six

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
mix the ingredients and in about six

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.770 
mix the ingredients and in about six
more<00:02:11.430> minutes<00:02:11.610> seven<00:02:12.090> more<00:02:12.269> minutes<00:02:12.450> gonna

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
more minutes seven more minutes gonna

more minutes seven more minutes gonna
hit<00:02:12.930> into<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.320> fastest<00:02:14.130> feet<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:15.170> need<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.290> add

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
hit into this fastest feet I need to add

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.610 
hit into this fastest feet I need to add
a<00:02:16.470> little<00:02:16.650> more<00:02:16.830> water<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.550> though<00:02:18.620> feels

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
a little more water to it though feels

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.020 
a little more water to it though feels
kind<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.950> dry
