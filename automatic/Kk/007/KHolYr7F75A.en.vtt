00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello everyone guys you are in company 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.480
 of from the udc 3 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.620
 today as from the title of the video vi 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.680
 I will explain how to open your mac 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.070
 open milk serves to have one 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.109
 a little better connection to black ops 2 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.269
 the game multiplied 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.349
 before starting you will see that 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.630
 your born will be type 2 type 2 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.899
 because it is an act and moderate is not there 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.480
 will allow you to play with your friends 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.309
 then to open it they had to go up 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.040
 we should go to the settings of the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.989
 your custom wireless mission then 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.070
 scan our wireless network 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.760
 if alice is protected put the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.190
 your password if you do not admit eva 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.260
 while as the video shows 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.320
 how old when i put my password 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.719
 I tell you that it is always an open act 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.020
 especially to play with yours 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.890
 friends because in some cases moderate 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.520
 does not allow users to play 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.170
 that you have as about friendships then one 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.619
 once the password is set 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.409
 here's so joined you have to go on 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.460
 ip address settings and put 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.600
 the pious is very important because in the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.300
 username you will have to put adsl alice 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.729
 alice adsl then I will write it in the comment 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.020
 if you do n't understand 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:42.240
 then the password of the same adsl alice 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.289
 in this step it will be crucial to 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.289
 have our natta open then one 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.840
 once inserted we will always go on 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:55.380
 forward these things do not interest us 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.530
 up to the verification of the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.210
 commission then while here checking 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.020
 I can tell you that 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.710
 indeed I would like to invite you to pass by the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.920
 channel of a friend of ours indeed for the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.150
 channel of our two friends channel it 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.810
 calls from the tax are two players of 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.200
 pc make very funny videos and if 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.750
 you have some time passed are not 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.380
 not bad they have good programs 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.630
 to make videos and make good spend the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.610
 your time then in descriptions vi 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.400
 i will put their channel i hope that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.890
 pass here now you can see that the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.410
 born type has become type 1 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.150
 so we go to call of duty black 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.750
 ops 2 or any other game 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.090
 multiplayer while loading 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.410
 meanwhile, the seeds of the dog that barks is the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.530
 beast 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.330
 okay while charging the game will want 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.940
 continue to talk about the channel of 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.770
 these two friends of mine 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.540
 they do mostly gameplay of 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.290
 pc games 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.370
 so far they have done combat minecraft arts 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.299
 now they are organizing for 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.190
 make new videos on harry potter 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.159
 really a nice channel pass us there 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.510
 have a laugh, spend yours well 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.640
 time 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.760
 then here at the game still not 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.790
 charge while we wait 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.330
 I would like to say that this born and open 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.209
 also serves for 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.280
 must make lost because if you want to do 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.220
 the private game without open milk 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.790
 it's very complicated because you can't 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.340
 have more than four friends in the game 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.980
 then once you enter the game 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.950
 let's go to the online game we'll see in 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.780
 low that our born of moderate 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.409
 will have become a high open 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.379
 I hope the video is liked and 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:05.590
 comment put a nice necks and laces 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:08.400
