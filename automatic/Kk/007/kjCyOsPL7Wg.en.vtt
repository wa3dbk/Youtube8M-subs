00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.340
 same 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.860
 a sponge is just a sponge from which we 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.259
 we will rub it all desirable 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:08.630
 use gloves so that our hands to 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:15.100
 as vinegar though he and 9 percent but 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:20.929
 so that our hand cover is not spoiled 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.399
 To begin, we take you the one I Vinegar 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.889

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.939
 me and 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:41.499
 means evenly pour our vinegar on 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.499
 mean on the surface hisses and 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.620
 then we will help to distribute it all 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.680
 our sponge to the whole surface was 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.380
 not quite to swim here but what 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.980
 someone more or less everything was evenly in 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.040
 vinegar 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.370
 sponge help and so distribute by 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.370
 whole surface 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.810
 especially on places where there is 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:17.810
 large pollution there necessarily 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.810
 as if all promakivaem nexus 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:42.950
 so still skill 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:47.560
 on McNally if that someone needs 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:52.640
 you can still add vinegar and so on until all 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:03:04.460
 now now we take our baking soda 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:10.240
 with a spoon and it means pouring especially those 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.240
 places where it requires careful 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:20.510
 thorough cleaning went reaction soda 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.349
 foaming with vinegar 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.239
 the reaction went 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:30.530
 all this security here we have such a stormy 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.530
 reaction occurs 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.630
 so well I continue past somewhere 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.940
 I have about 5-7 minutes, that is 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.980
 the reaction practically she stopped you 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.740
 there is still a little bubbled in some 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.020
 places but practically the reaction 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.960
 ended and we mean take our 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.770
 the answer to the butterfly got a little dirty and 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.680
 start small movements not even 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.810
 It is worth especially to press us all very 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.880
 easy everything is very easy we have departs itself 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.200
 that is, we only slightly help it. 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.610
 all exfoliating here on using soda and 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:17.860
 Vinegar us it is all already very practical 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:20.890
 easy to clean 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.810
 no additional effort Ferb 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.770
 Of course, maybe some very 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.460
 contaminated places you will need this 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.460
 to make 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.030
 but if you feel like a bad thing 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.410
 rubbed in some places you can still 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:45.220
 just wait a little bit here and mine 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.090
 all very easily here these here bokovinki 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.220
 also wipe everything 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:57.040
 bye here's all a little push and 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:59.290
 just wipe after all and so here 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.260
 us especially you are here in pollution very 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:11.920
 big it is like him because she 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:19.690
 used by me very often now 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:22.570
 when i finish rubbing around this 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.210
 comforts I'll take off i to wipe yet 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:30.460
 under the hat because there usually 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:34.330
 also sometimes clogged with dirt and should be 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:37.180
 also there will definitely wipe here 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:41.940
 so completely free 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:45.760
 movements almost without pressing 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:48.880
 just consistent so here's all 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:53.710
 clear ok and now we take just 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:57.730
 rag or all excess soda 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:01.720
 the excess here is the gruel of vinegar 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:03.730
 we all collect it with you so rubbed 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:09.880
