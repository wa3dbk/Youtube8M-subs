to<00:00:18.539> be<00:00:18.690> out<00:00:18.810> fishing

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.850 

having<00:00:32.160> put<00:00:32.489> my<00:00:32.640> hand<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.660> water<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.559> was

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
having put my hand in the water it was

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.119 
having put my hand in the water it was
warmer<00:00:35.370> than<00:00:35.910> recent<00:00:36.480> days<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:37.559> must<00:00:37.949> have

been at least 8 degrees so I reckon

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
there was probably a good chance that we

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
in the fish's mouth and this made it

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:51.500 
in the fish's mouth and this made it
ideal<00:02:22.970> for<00:02:23.360> release
