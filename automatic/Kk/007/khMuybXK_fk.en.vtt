00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 Zdarova gangsters with you panda began 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.580
 All with the fact that the evil subscriber Nikita 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.990
 threw us a call said they were with 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.970
 friends played bargaining siri duma 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.559
 barathrum spectrum and bourde and asks 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.389
 how can you win at that peak and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.549
 does it even make really peak 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.680
 moronic let's discuss more so 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.859
 the only stand up team is barathrum 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.750
 here everything is clear so very controversial 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.170
 hero because if you put wards 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.000
 barantrum is not very useful running will be 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.279
 no one else in this team 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.740
 there is a broom but but let's say not 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.050
 critical and moreover it turns out that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.030
 this team really has no support well dark 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.460
 Sira can be put in hard we tried 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.829
 do it but gets sad enough 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.660
 why if the swindler put suspect paradise then 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.579
 the burda cannot help the spectrum then 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.350
 we have the same tactics all the sharpness 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.840
 that the spectrum should farm naturally 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.629
 but the spectrum is very hard to farm when and 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.030
 not help enough obvious spectrum 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.140
 powerful late and so with a swirl 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.870
 it turns out garbage 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.510
 we lost three games tried different 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.430
 strata put us dark sira 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.680
 I ended up bringing a bunch of midas 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.390
 nafarmil but nevertheless we merged the game 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.510
 burda he defended hard 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.159
 and actually barantrum tried to support 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.979
 spectrum in my opinion the only 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.640
 option with a good really support 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.110
 barathrum hell can go on mid eat 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.549
 This option but I think also not very 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.520
 convenient but surely he is more comfortable 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.990
 stand in the forest or maybe even somewhere 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.460
 somehow help the spectrum but given that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.920
 we don't have support until you have to do something 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.590
 to come up with a winning peak 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.240
 It turned out to be an option to go along with Bourdieu 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.119
 Hard for Ksir Burda 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.189
 we went to hard just because 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.590
 should someone stand there spectrum at 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.350
 we went to the mid farm and in the end though 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.840
 would be able to get something out then again 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.310
 the same difficult option but nevertheless 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.909
 not conducting load on the fourth time we have 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.909
 worked well and doom along with the actual 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.619
 barantrum flooded the easy line there 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.030
 tried to make something peak 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.500
 really heavy at first seems 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.990
 what kind of like normal heroes well on 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.210
 in fact , the thought needs to be derived 6 spectrum 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.399
 need to bring artifacts at least some 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.920
 barantrum is generally very controversial 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.130
 hero against normal boys he is not 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.170
 rolls dark sir a great character but 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.060
 here he is like a little bit 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.120
 team guy he would be nice to him somewhere 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.280
 there in hard sola stand burda kind of like 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.780
 and mider as option yes and variable 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.880
 hardliner perfect neither here nor here 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.610
 shorter play time is really difficult 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.970
 so the task the subscriber asked us 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.650
 hard we were able to win 4 times played 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.190
 against subscribers in which scored in 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.200
 public 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.700
 well now the most interesting you too 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.590
 you can challenge us too 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.610
 play with us 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.490
 we will periodically this time will be 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.670
 rather on the weekend to meet your challenges 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.100
 that playing with us is just public 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.720
 prune follow the news we write 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.330
 when there will be such games with us we will 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.010
 play stupid pikes that you give us 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.660
 offer but here we could convince so 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.370
 4 different however somehow 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.370
 it turned out 50 very difficult
