00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.480
 we have already returned and we are here now 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:13.549
 with some as we were that was a value 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.580
 of p are going to be perfect in the 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:21.500
 huacalito of his cart or pot are 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:25.520
 the flowers with the hairs is that everything is 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.090
 wants to put in the head has complex 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.090
 of flowerpot 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.400
 but we do them for what we have in the 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.040
 head and we have to do them undo 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.610
 which this is the simplest since 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.710
 we need a bottle of soda and the 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.410
 let's cut if you want to cut it 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.880
 short of here and today and here and even you 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.000
 the brand you have to cut it to everything 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.860
 around and if you want you can not go 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.190
 helping to catch some pieces of cloth 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.730
 we cut a few squares here there are more if 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.730
 we are going to use them 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.020
 not so big are remnants actually 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.830
 as they are two fingers wide more or 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.260
 less what is she is we need 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.490
 six to make six petals of 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.560
 preference that they be here totally 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:25.230
 square with this I do not know if it 's 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:28.280
 Now he's going to give us exact time now 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.890
 we have here the bottle with the muscles 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.020
 of analysis and you can do several 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.300
 things with me and they have here the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.960
 front of the bottle we are going to 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.960
 cut 6 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.210
 654 those that you leave to be let's say 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.260
 the petals exactly and we already have it 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.750
 mounted 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.990
 I recommend you use bottles that 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.430
 be thin and preferably white 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.330
 so you can use them with any 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.910
 phone 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.760
 click look we have one more smaller 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.680
 program because we're going to do a several 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.620
 murals in the doubles so that then 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.550
 I hurt you loves me you do not love me 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.070
 Exactly this is going to be like a 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.680
 daisy we have some love now 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.220
 and tickets to the mojito and now the 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.220
 Daisy flower 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.670
 and a brush the people who do 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.380
 Crafts generally have things 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.270
 that already wants to throw having a corner 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.190
 looking at us we have this officer who already 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.370
 it's a bit deteriorated so we're going to 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.000
 do we are going to hit the zinc with cold in 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.819
 the back plate we extend it 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.310
 this is where the fold comes 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.469
 let's use the flattest part and 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.010
 we stick from the edge out and 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.010
 we push 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.150
 we did this in tip we can also 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.519
 round it up I flip it too my 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.109
 Exactly this is square this is without 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.940
 round if you want you can round the 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:03.080
 here 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.080
 making piquitos 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.710
 once this is dry 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.710
 we cut 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.420
 we cut the excess fabric 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.330
 look at this is another type of bottle and 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.580
 has here it grooves and also of 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.890
 pretty good let's use wire 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.250
 of the 12th caliber because because it is 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.830
 totally malleable and what are we going to do 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.040
 look, this is super simple 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.930
 once we have finished the flower 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.020
 let's leave a little long here and let's go 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.790
 to use tweezers we already use those of 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.240
 cut we can use square 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.590
 round with tips without tips 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.590
 we are going to use you 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.200
 the ones that accommodate you the most 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.200
 and we are going to turn 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:04.019
 and here to see a better job 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.849
 finished that offers youtube extend it 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.510
 with your fingers so that it looks like this 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.980
 one is left without doing crafts 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.720
 and good at the table that I tell you is never 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.310
 Enough but families as weird 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.049
 I can do crafts and finish with 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.049
 the Libyan monkeys is not like when you're 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.489
 cooking yes yes yes yes I usually use 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.310
 an apron old clothes 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.090
 we all put plastic newspaper 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.060
 all that and musical also this turn of 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.580
 buttons 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.199
 it's nice it's not a thing that 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.699
 it seems if we are going to remember everything that 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:41.009
 we made today 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.009
 I'm going to need a reminder a lot 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:50.830
 less 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.830
 a beautiful cart 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.020
 for nothing more 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.630
 with the good yerba and the mojito no more 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:05.090

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:09.550
 and here are the mommies and ladybugs and 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:12.550
