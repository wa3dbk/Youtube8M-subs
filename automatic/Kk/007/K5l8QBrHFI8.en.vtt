beads and even a bit of hickory

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.050 
beads and even a bit of hickory
therefore<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.680> smoke<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.369> gives<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
been converted this takes a bit more

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.490 
been converted this takes a bit more
work<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.150> old<00:00:30.500> gas-fired

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
work but really the old gas-fired

kidding yourself if you think it's a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.020 
kidding yourself if you think it's a
real<00:00:38.280> barbecue<00:00:38.809> to<00:00:39.809> file<00:00:40.079> items<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.190> even

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
real barbecue to file items and the even

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.900 
real barbecue to file items and the even
matches<00:00:42.450> or<00:00:43.070> that<00:00:44.070> light<00:00:44.340> are<00:00:44.520> there<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.820> get

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
matches or that light are there to get

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.450 
matches or that light are there to get
it<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.180> started<00:00:45.739> it's<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> very<00:00:46.980> simple<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
it all started it's a very simple to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.090 
it all started it's a very simple to
operate

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
operate

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.709 
operate
obviously<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.280> lets<00:00:50.520> more<00:00:50.730> smoke<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.390> heat

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
obviously that lets more smoke and heat

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.459 
obviously that lets more smoke and heat
out<00:00:52.399> down<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.579> bottom<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.300> you've<00:00:55.170> got

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
out down the bottom there you've got

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.689 
out down the bottom there you've got
where<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> air<00:00:56.520> goes<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.430> let<00:00:59.430> more<00:00:59.670> air

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
where the air goes in and let more air

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.840 
where the air goes in and let more air
in<00:01:00.090> it'll<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.660> hotter<00:01:00.870> let<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> down<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:02.550> get

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
in it'll get hotter let it down or get

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.530 
in it'll get hotter let it down or get
colder<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.189> you<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.339> barbecue<00:01:05.610> stuff<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.450> as

eight<00:01:09.150> hours<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> want<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.680> low

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
eight hours if you want to really low

slow cooking smoke you know if you're

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.880 
slow cooking smoke you know if you're

doing a side of ribs of that I haven't

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.440 
doing a side of ribs of that I haven't
tried<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.189> yet<00:01:17.400> I'm<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.299> in

know<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.930> could<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.590> run<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.070> wood<00:01:32.310> if

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
know you could just run it on wood if

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.149 
know you could just run it on wood if
you<00:01:32.579> wanted<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:34.049> don't<00:01:34.290> necessarily<00:01:34.530> need

you wanted you don't necessarily need

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.800 
you wanted you don't necessarily need
the<00:01:35.310> heat<00:01:35.490> feeds<00:01:35.790> because<00:01:36.090> they're<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> little

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the heat feeds because they're a little

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.950 
the heat feeds because they're a little
bit<00:01:37.020> pricey<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:41.240> bowl<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.390> gas<00:01:42.630> costs

hickory wood treat that by putting it in
water<00:01:53.399> first<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.000> reason<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.869> let

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
water first the reason for that is let

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.039 
water first the reason for that is let
it<00:01:55.500> soak<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.100> water<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.719> when<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.810> chuck
