00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.660 
mobile woodshop today we'll take a few
minutes<00:00:07.350> look<00:00:07.470> at<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.680> progress<00:00:07.919> first<00:00:08.490> thing

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
minutes look at the progress first thing

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.209 
minutes look at the progress first thing
I<00:00:08.760> did<00:00:08.970> was<00:00:09.120> build<00:00:09.450> an<00:00:09.660> 8<00:00:09.840> foot<00:00:10.139> box<00:00:10.650> or<00:00:10.980> cabinet

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
I did was build an 8 foot box or cabinet

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.049 
I did was build an 8 foot box or cabinet
to<00:00:12.179> hold<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.840> workbench<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.160> my<00:00:14.639> understand

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
to hold the workbench and my understand

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.060 
to hold the workbench and my understand
so<00:00:15.299> they<00:00:15.420> can<00:00:15.599> easily<00:00:15.809> be<00:00:16.020> pulled<00:00:16.440> out<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.650> set

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
so they can easily be pulled out and set

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.450 
so they can easily be pulled out and set
up<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.430> job<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.570> box<00:00:18.840> then<00:00:19.140> was<00:00:19.350> set<00:00:19.619> 5

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
up on the job that box then was set 5

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.060 
up on the job that box then was set 5
inches<00:00:20.850> away<00:00:21.060> from<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.449> side<00:00:21.810> wall<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.380> create

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
inches away from the side wall to create

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.890 
inches away from the side wall to create
a<00:00:23.100> nice<00:00:23.820> deep<00:00:24.600> area<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> could<00:00:25.590> slide<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
a nice deep area so I could slide in the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.839 
a nice deep area so I could slide in the
supports<00:00:27.900> for<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.170> workbench<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.220> also<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
supports for the workbench and also the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
supports for the workbench and also the
bottom<00:00:30.060> shelf<00:00:30.480> again<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.349> easily<00:00:31.500> slide

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
bottom shelf again so I can easily slide

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.160 
bottom shelf again so I can easily slide
out<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.279> set<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.090> then<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> miter

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
out and set that up and then the miter

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.110 
out and set that up and then the miter
stand<00:00:34.530> right<00:00:34.829> next<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.280> additionally<00:00:36.090> I

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
stand right next to it additionally I

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
stand right next to it additionally I
created<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.600> little<00:00:36.780> space<00:00:36.989> for<00:00:37.230> my<00:00:37.320> levels<00:00:37.649> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
created a little space for my levels to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.020 
created a little space for my levels to
keep<00:00:37.950> them<00:00:38.160> organized<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.879> easily

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
keep them organized and easily

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.229

accessible from the rear the slots for
the<00:00:42.390> levels<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.930> all<00:00:43.110> uniform<00:00:43.770> they're<00:00:44.190> 8

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the levels are all uniform they're 8

the levels are all uniform they're 8
feet<00:00:44.579> deep<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.690> simply<00:00:46.050> measured<00:00:46.440> in

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
feet deep and I just simply measured in

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.010 
feet deep and I just simply measured in
and<00:00:46.770> placed<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.219> screw<00:00:47.579> through<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.210> stop<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and placed a screw through to stop the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.720 
and placed a screw through to stop the
shorter<00:00:49.410> levels<00:00:49.739> from<00:00:49.890> sliding<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.520> any

further<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.890> here<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> 4<00:00:53.489> foot<00:00:53.699> level<00:00:53.940> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
further so here with a 4 foot level it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.680 
further so here with a 4 foot level it
stops<00:00:54.719> at<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> same<00:00:56.039> position<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.570> 8

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
stops at the same position that the 8

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.880 
stops at the same position that the 8
foot<00:00:57.960> level<00:00:58.199> stops<00:00:59.899> once<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> box<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.680> house

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
foot level stops once the box to house

easy<00:05:02.030> I<00:05:02.180> think<00:05:02.330> just<00:05:02.750> there's<00:05:03.170> not<00:05:03.380> much

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
easy I think just there's not much

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.890 
easy I think just there's not much
friction<00:05:04.070> less<00:05:05.030> than<00:05:05.210> I<00:05:05.270> thought<00:05:05.480> there<00:05:05.720> would

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
friction less than I thought there would

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.640 
friction less than I thought there would
be<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:08.300> door<00:05:08.510> is<00:05:08.600> already<00:05:08.780> pretty<00:05:09.140> heavy<00:05:09.380> name

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
be the door is already pretty heavy name

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.650 
be the door is already pretty heavy name
able<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:10.130> do<00:05:10.280> it<00:05:10.400> one-handed<00:05:10.850> and<00:05:11.300> then<00:05:11.450> in<00:05:11.600> the

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
able to do it one-handed and then in the

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.890 
able to do it one-handed and then in the
back<00:05:11.840> I<00:05:12.080> created<00:05:12.140> a<00:05:12.710> six<00:05:13.040> inch<00:05:13.280> wide<00:05:13.490> space<00:05:14.000> the

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
back I created a six inch wide space the

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.630 
back I created a six inch wide space the
full<00:05:15.170> eight<00:05:15.380> foot<00:05:15.680> depth<00:05:15.980> and<00:05:16.220> this<00:05:16.340> allows<00:05:16.610> me

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
full eight foot depth and this allows me

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.140 
full eight foot depth and this allows me
to<00:05:16.910> carry<00:05:17.840> two<00:05:18.490> extension<00:05:19.490> planks<00:05:19.880> which<00:05:20.030> I

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
to carry two extension planks which I

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.810 
to carry two extension planks which I
use<00:05:20.300> quite<00:05:20.570> a<00:05:20.600> bit<00:05:20.690> for<00:05:21.470> interior<00:05:21.950> work<00:05:22.190> so

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
use quite a bit for interior work so

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.480 
use quite a bit for interior work so
with<00:05:23.060> those<00:05:23.600> on<00:05:23.990> board<00:05:24.290> and<00:05:24.620> then<00:05:25.250> my

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
with those on board and then my

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.910 
with those on board and then my
adjustable<00:05:26.450> ladders<00:05:26.870> in<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.080> back<00:05:27.320> I<00:05:27.650> have

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
adjustable ladders in the back I have

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.430 
adjustable ladders in the back I have
some<00:05:28.340> nice<00:05:28.820> light<00:05:29.150> duty<00:05:29.480> interior
