00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.710 
filter noise and add noise you want to
make<00:01:32.860> sure<00:01:32.979> we<00:01:33.100> have<00:01:33.190> Gaussian<00:01:33.760> on<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.630> we

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
make sure we have Gaussian on and we

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.270 
make sure we have Gaussian on and we
have<00:01:34.810> monochromatic<00:01:35.260> clicked<00:01:35.800> on<00:01:35.979> so<00:01:36.190> we

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
have monochromatic clicked on so we

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.620 
have monochromatic clicked on so we
don't<00:01:36.310> monochromatic<00:01:36.850> clicked<00:01:37.300> on<00:01:37.479> it's

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
don't monochromatic clicked on it's

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.570 
don't monochromatic clicked on it's
gonna<00:01:37.750> make<00:01:37.960> our<00:01:38.140> stars<00:01:38.470> all<00:01:39.009> different<00:01:39.430> types

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
gonna make our stars all different types

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.850 
gonna make our stars all different types
of<00:01:39.700> colors<00:01:39.970> we<00:01:40.750> don't<00:01:40.930> want<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.290> we<00:01:41.530> want<00:01:41.560> it

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.490 
nice and white and gray and I put 30%
which<00:01:45.940> is<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.119> decent<00:01:46.390> number<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:47.050> can<00:01:47.170> all<00:01:47.259> try

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
which is a decent number you can all try

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.840 
which is a decent number you can all try
it<00:01:47.560> more<00:01:47.710> if<00:01:47.830> you<00:01:47.920> want<00:01:48.160> there's<00:01:48.400> fully<00:01:48.610> up<00:01:48.729> to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
it more if you want there's fully up to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.820 
it more if you want there's fully up to
you<00:01:48.970> so<00:01:49.660> I'm<00:01:49.750> going<00:01:49.899> to<00:01:49.930> go<00:01:50.020> thirty<00:01:50.320> point<00:01:50.590> six

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
you so I'm going to go thirty point six

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.950 
you so I'm going to go thirty point six
eight<00:01:51.009> percent<00:01:51.340> for<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:51.640> one<00:01:51.820> then<00:01:52.660> once<00:01:52.840> we

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
eight percent for this one then once we

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.050 
eight percent for this one then once we
get<00:01:53.080> that<00:01:53.320> simply<00:01:53.740> just<00:01:53.770> go<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.070> image

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
get that simply just go to image

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.749 
get that simply just go to image
adjustments<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.259> levels<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:57.460> is<00:01:57.610> going

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
adjustments and levels and this is going

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.160 
adjustments and levels and this is going
to<00:01:57.820> single<00:01:58.149> out<00:01:58.240> our<00:01:58.390> stars<00:01:58.660> so<00:01:58.840> we<00:01:58.899> don't<00:01:59.080> have

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
to single out our stars so we don't have

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.560 
to single out our stars so we don't have
as<00:01:59.289> much<00:01:59.470> clutter<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.130> with<00:02:00.880> our<00:02:01.030> stars<00:02:01.300> here

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
as much clutter it with our stars here

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.770 
as much clutter it with our stars here
so<00:02:01.990> drag<00:02:02.200> up<00:02:02.380> anywhere<00:02:02.710> like<00:02:02.979> I<00:02:03.130> say<00:02:03.369> 180<00:02:04.740> 200

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.540 

you<00:02:09.350> don't<00:02:09.530> need<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.709> have<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:10.039> many<00:02:10.280> stars

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
you don't need to have that many stars

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.250 
you don't need to have that many stars
but<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.030> like<00:02:11.209> say<00:02:11.450> if<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.720> want<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:12.110> much

but it like say if you want that much

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.809 
but it like say if you want that much
stars<00:02:12.560> or<00:02:12.830> if<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.040> want<00:02:13.280> say<00:02:13.520> if<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:13.670> want

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
stars or if you want say if you want

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.160 
stars or if you want say if you want

gonna go with 187 here and what I'm
gonna<00:02:21.950> do<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.640> simply<00:02:22.940> make<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.360> selection

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
gonna do now is simply make a selection

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.070 
gonna do now is simply make a selection
in<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.319> middle<00:02:24.590> of<00:02:24.650> my<00:02:24.740> stars<00:02:24.980> layer<00:02:25.959> but<00:02:26.959> we

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
in the middle of my stars layer but we

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.000 
in the middle of my stars layer but we
want<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.350> make<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.590> just<00:02:27.739> a<00:02:27.800> little<00:02:27.830> bit

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
want to make it just a little bit

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.680 
want to make it just a little bit
smaller<00:02:28.940> than<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.870> stars<00:02:30.170> I'd<00:02:30.410> like<00:02:31.450> then<00:02:32.450> our

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
smaller than the stars I'd like then our

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.930 
smaller than the stars I'd like then our
document<00:02:33.470> size<00:02:33.650> here<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.069> once<00:02:34.520> we<00:02:34.610> make<00:02:34.640> our

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
document size here and once we make our

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.010 
document size here and once we make our
selection<00:02:35.330> there<00:02:35.450> with<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.630> rectangular

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
selection there with the rectangular

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.900 
selection there with the rectangular
marquee<00:02:36.200> tool<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.830> want<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.069> control<00:02:37.610> C<00:02:37.880> to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
marquee tool you want to control C to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.020 
marquee tool you want to control C to
copy<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.690> ctrl<00:02:39.470> V<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.650> paste<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.310> what

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
copy it and ctrl V to paste it what

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.699 
copy it and ctrl V to paste it what
we're<00:02:41.150> gonna<00:02:41.239> do<00:02:41.420> now<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:41.630> free<00:02:41.989> transform<00:02:42.590> it

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
we're gonna do now is free transform it

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.860 
we're gonna do now is free transform it
so<00:02:42.769> edit<00:02:43.160> free<00:02:43.400> transform<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.630> we're<00:02:44.750> gonna

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
so edit free transform and we're gonna

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.229 
so edit free transform and we're gonna
bring<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.560> back<00:02:45.620> up<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:46.160> normal<00:02:46.430> size<00:02:46.640> this

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
bring this back up to normal size this

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.270 
bring this back up to normal size this
what<00:02:47.720> this<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:47.930> doing<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.380> giving<00:02:48.680> us<00:02:48.800> larger

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
what this is doing is giving us larger

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.040 
what this is doing is giving us larger
stars<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.030> all<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.239> stars<00:02:50.510> aren't<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.840> same

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
stars so all the stars aren't the same

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.559 
stars so all the stars aren't the same
size<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.580> just<00:02:52.760> makes<00:02:53.000> things<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.330> look

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
size and it just makes things that look

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.720 
size and it just makes things that look
a<00:02:53.660> lot<00:02:53.780> better<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:54.350> what<00:02:54.680> we<00:02:54.800> do<00:02:54.920> now<00:02:55.100> is<00:02:55.400> simply

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
a lot better so what we do now is simply

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.059 
a lot better so what we do now is simply
go<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.870> set<00:02:57.080> this<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.440> screen<00:02:57.769> our

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
go to and set this to screen our

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.790 
go to and set this to screen our
blending<00:02:58.430> mode<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:59.080> see<00:03:00.080> we<00:03:00.200> have<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.470> larger

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
blending mode and see we have the larger

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.229 
blending mode and see we have the larger
stars<00:03:01.069> in<00:03:01.310> there<00:03:01.430> now<00:03:01.550> so<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:01.850> kind<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.060> looks

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
stars in there now so it kind of looks

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.300 
stars in there now so it kind of looks
more<00:03:02.300> more<00:03:02.870> realistic<00:03:03.410> than<00:03:03.650> just<00:03:04.100> having

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
more more realistic than just having

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.990 
more more realistic than just having
just<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.830> as<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.010> see<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.580> stars<00:03:07.819> are

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
just that so as you see the stars are

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.220 
just that so as you see the stars are
bigger

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
bigger

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.280 
bigger
and<00:03:09.650> adds<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.010> better<00:03:10.190> effect<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.900> basically

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
and adds a better effect so basically

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.220 
and adds a better effect so basically
now<00:03:12.560> what<00:03:12.800> we<00:03:12.950> want<00:03:13.129> to<00:03:13.250> do<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.810> make<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.840> cloud

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
now what we want to do is make a cloud

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.059 
now what we want to do is make a cloud
layer<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:16.730> we'll<00:03:16.910> call<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:18.110> well<00:03:18.920> actually

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
layer so we'll call this well actually

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.100 
layer so we'll call this well actually
no<00:03:19.310> we<00:03:19.489> merge<00:03:19.970> these<00:03:20.180> two<00:03:20.390> layers<00:03:20.420> together<00:03:20.750> so

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
no we merge these two layers together so

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.150 
no we merge these two layers together so
it's<00:03:21.230> since<00:03:21.440> we're<00:03:21.530> done<00:03:21.620> with<00:03:21.739> their<00:03:21.890> stars

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
it's since we're done with their stars

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.870 
it's since we're done with their stars
so<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.330> select<00:03:23.510> I'm<00:03:23.750> going<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.900> press<00:03:24.230> ctrl<00:03:24.620> E

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
so you select I'm going to press ctrl E

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.920 
so you select I'm going to press ctrl E

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
and the whole street name that starters

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.780 
and the whole street name that starters
again<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:28.220> we're<00:03:28.310> gonna<00:03:28.430> call<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:28.730> one

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
again and we're gonna call this one

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.900 
again and we're gonna call this one
clouds<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:30.590> hope<00:03:31.310> we're<00:03:31.430> gonna<00:03:31.519> do<00:03:31.700> here<00:03:31.880> is

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
clouds and hope we're gonna do here is

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.940 
clouds and hope we're gonna do here is
fill<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:32.269> in<00:03:32.450> with<00:03:32.480> black<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.319> then<00:03:33.800> go

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
fill this in with black and then go

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.259 
fill this in with black and then go
filter<00:03:35.080> render<00:03:36.080> clouds<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.880> what<00:03:38.030> we<00:03:38.120> do<00:03:38.239> here

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
filter render clouds and what we do here

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.970 
filter render clouds and what we do here
we<00:03:38.599> just<00:03:38.690> simply<00:03:38.989> just<00:03:39.110> go<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.290> overlay<00:03:39.650> as<00:03:39.799> a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
we just simply just go to overlay as a

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.070 
we just simply just go to overlay as a
blending<00:03:40.310> mode<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:41.450> doesn't<00:03:41.720> do<00:03:41.810> nothing

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
blending mode and it doesn't do nothing

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.750 
blending mode and it doesn't do nothing
at<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.319> moment<00:03:42.349> but<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:42.830> will<00:03:43.190> see<00:03:43.370> what<00:03:43.610> will

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
at the moment but you will see what will

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.059 
at the moment but you will see what will
happen<00:03:44.209> here<00:03:44.390> once<00:03:45.110> we<00:03:45.230> get<00:03:45.349> into<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.650> final

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
happen here once we get into the final

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.039 
happen here once we get into the final
effects<00:03:46.400> we'll<00:03:47.090> make<00:03:47.239> another<00:03:47.480> new<00:03:47.660> layer<00:03:47.840> now

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
effects we'll make another new layer now

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.699 
effects we'll make another new layer now
we're<00:03:48.260> gonna<00:03:48.349> call<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:48.769> gradient<00:03:50.079> and<00:03:51.079> what

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
we're gonna call this gradient and what

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.740 
we're gonna call this gradient and what
we're<00:03:51.829> gonna<00:03:51.890> do<00:03:52.130> with<00:03:52.340> this<00:03:52.519> is<00:03:52.790> simply<00:03:53.450> bust

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
we're gonna do with this is simply bust

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.089 
we're gonna do with this is simply bust
out<00:03:53.900> our<00:03:54.019> gradient<00:03:54.200> tool<00:03:54.410> which<00:03:54.739> is<00:03:54.890> right

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
out our gradient tool which is right

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.880 
out our gradient tool which is right
here<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.569> you<00:03:56.569> can<00:03:56.900> pick<00:03:57.019> any<00:03:57.200> different<00:03:57.620> like

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
here and you can pick any different like

any type of color you want to go with

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.309 
any type of color you want to go with
I'm<00:03:59.510> actually<00:03:59.690> gonna<00:03:59.930> go<00:04:00.110> with<00:04:00.140> maybe<00:04:02.319> an

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
I'm actually gonna go with maybe an

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.360 
I'm actually gonna go with maybe an
orange<00:04:04.599> darker<00:04:05.599> orange

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
orange darker orange

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
and what I'm gonna do is just make a

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.190 
and what I'm gonna do is just make a
gradient<00:04:14.340> in<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.460> middle<00:04:15.670> like<00:04:15.820> so<00:04:16.080> so<00:04:17.080> now

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
gradient in the middle like so so now

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.110 
gradient in the middle like so so now
that<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.410> got<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.890> done<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.400> want<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.850> set<00:04:19.000> the

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
that I got that done I want to set the

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.340 
that I got that done I want to set the
blending<00:04:19.330> mode<00:04:19.390> for<00:04:19.660> this<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.930> overlay<00:04:20.230> as

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
blending mode for this to overlay as

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.520 
blending mode for this to overlay as
well<00:04:20.760> see<00:04:21.760> it's<00:04:22.000> affecting<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.840> Stars<00:04:23.080> colors

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
well see it's affecting the Stars colors

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.230 
well see it's affecting the Stars colors
right<00:04:23.740> now<00:04:23.890> which<00:04:24.430> is<00:04:24.580> perfectly<00:04:24.970> fine

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
right now which is perfectly fine

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.760 
right now which is perfectly fine
because<00:04:25.450> what<00:04:25.660> we<00:04:25.810> do<00:04:25.960> on<00:04:26.140> this<00:04:26.260> next<00:04:26.620> layer

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
because what we do on this next layer

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.040 
because what we do on this next layer
here<00:04:27.040> we<00:04:27.670> make<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.910> new<00:04:28.150> layer<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.480> buff<00:04:28.690> stars

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
here we make a new layer of buff stars

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.420 
here we make a new layer of buff stars
I'm<00:04:29.410> going<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.770> name<00:04:29.890> this<00:04:29.920> brushstrokes<00:04:32.430> then

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
I'm going to name this brushstrokes then

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.040 
I'm going to name this brushstrokes then
once<00:04:33.610> we<00:04:33.730> get<00:04:33.850> that<00:04:33.910> set<00:04:34.330> up<00:04:34.360> we<00:04:34.480> can<00:04:34.750> finally

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
once we get that set up we can finally

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.930 
once we get that set up we can finally
start<00:04:35.230> brushing<00:04:35.470> around<00:04:35.890> with<00:04:36.040> our<00:04:36.160> brush

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
start brushing around with our brush

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.490 
start brushing around with our brush
tool<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.480> I'll<00:04:37.630> just<00:04:37.720> do<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.900> couple<00:04:38.260> clicks

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
tool and I'll just do a couple clicks

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.600 
tool and I'll just do a couple clicks
you<00:04:38.740> want<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:39.010> play<00:04:39.190> around<00:04:39.370> through<00:04:39.520> your

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
you want to play around through your

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.540 
you want to play around through your
pasty<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:40.330> I'm<00:04:41.020> gonna<00:04:41.170> start<00:04:41.410> off<00:04:41.590> with<00:04:41.890> five

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
pasty so I'm gonna start off with five

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.200 
pasty so I'm gonna start off with five
percent

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.550 
your brush is on white why does your
foreground<00:05:08.810> you<00:05:09.810> see<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.080> was<00:05:10.230> just<00:05:10.350> doing

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
foreground you see I was just doing

want to just make your strokes around

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.020 
want to just make your strokes around
I'm<00:05:19.710> gonna<00:05:19.860> make<00:05:20.040> a<00:05:20.070> strokes<00:05:20.400> on<00:05:20.610> those<00:05:20.790> soft

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
I'm gonna make a strokes on those soft

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.480 
I'm gonna make a strokes on those soft
sides<00:05:21.360> here<00:05:21.690> like<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:22.400> just<00:05:25.040> it'll<00:05:26.040> make<00:05:26.430> it

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
sides here like I just it'll make it

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.490 
sides here like I just it'll make it
look<00:05:26.550> like<00:05:26.700> the<00:05:26.820> nebulas<00:05:27.240> fading<00:05:27.720> out<00:05:27.840> so<00:05:28.380> it's

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
look like the nebulas fading out so it's

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.040 
look like the nebulas fading out so it's
not<00:05:28.620> so<00:05:28.920> bright<00:05:29.280> it<00:05:30.270> comes<00:05:30.540> out<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:30.990> this

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
not so bright it comes out to this

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.890 
not so bright it comes out to this
darker<00:05:31.440> sides<00:05:31.700> and<00:05:32.700> then<00:05:32.820> when<00:05:33.330> I<00:05:33.360> start<00:05:33.660> going

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
darker sides and then when I start going

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.030 
darker sides and then when I start going
in<00:05:34.020> towards<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.380> middle<00:05:34.590> I<00:05:34.710> started<00:05:34.980> making

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
in towards the middle I started making

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.830 
in towards the middle I started making
it<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.400> little<00:05:35.580> bit<00:05:35.700> brighter<00:05:35.910> I<00:05:36.300> just<00:05:36.600> see<00:05:36.720> it

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
it a little bit brighter I just see it

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.970 
it a little bit brighter I just see it
starting<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.140> come<00:05:37.290> together<00:05:37.410> really<00:05:37.710> nice

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
starting to come together really nice

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.820 
starting to come together really nice
now

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.170 

and<00:05:42.310> you<00:05:42.370> basically<00:05:42.520> just<00:05:42.970> click<00:05:43.419> around

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
and you basically just click around

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.059 
and you basically just click around
until<00:05:46.180> you<00:05:46.300> find<00:05:46.539> that<00:05:47.050> you<00:05:47.710> have<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:47.889> nice

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
until you find that you have a nice

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.629 
until you find that you have a nice
little<00:05:49.050> Spacey<00:05:50.050> nebula<00:05:50.800> that's<00:05:51.310> starting<00:05:51.610> to

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
little Spacey nebula that's starting to

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.839 
little Spacey nebula that's starting to
go<00:05:51.759> on<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.360> you<00:05:52.449> see<00:05:52.599> the<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:53.379> purple<00:05:53.849> I'm

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
go on and you see the the purple I'm

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.129 
go on and you see the the purple I'm
gonna<00:05:55.060> make<00:05:55.240> it<00:05:55.360> a<00:05:55.419> little<00:05:55.509> bit<00:05:55.690> brighter<00:05:55.960> if<00:05:56.110> I

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
gonna make it a little bit brighter if I

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.360 
gonna make it a little bit brighter if I
can<00:05:56.259> bring<00:05:56.379> down<00:05:56.440> my<00:05:56.680> brush<00:05:56.889> size<00:05:57.099> here

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
can bring down my brush size here

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.779 
can bring down my brush size here
bringing<00:05:57.819> maybe<00:05:58.030> like<00:05:58.180> 114<00:05:59.490> and<00:06:00.490> they're<00:06:00.669> just

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
bringing maybe like 114 and they're just

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:05.460 
bringing maybe like 114 and they're just
gonna<00:06:00.970> make<00:06:01.090> little<00:06:01.900> strokes<00:06:02.289> like<00:06:02.379> that<00:06:04.470> that

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
gonna make little strokes like that that

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.629 
gonna make little strokes like that that
well<00:06:05.860> that<00:06:05.949> actually<00:06:06.159> seems<00:06:06.340> a<00:06:06.400> little<00:06:06.460> bit

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
well that actually seems a little bit

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.189 
well that actually seems a little bit
too<00:06:06.669> bright<00:06:06.909> for<00:06:06.940> me<00:06:07.180> so<00:06:07.360> you<00:06:07.419> can<00:06:07.629> always<00:06:07.780> use

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
too bright for me so you can always use

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.260 
too bright for me so you can always use
your<00:06:08.229> history<00:06:08.740> window<00:06:09.069> here<00:06:09.310> and<00:06:09.849> remove<00:06:10.240> a

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
your history window here and remove a

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.430 
your history window here and remove a
couple<00:06:10.509> of<00:06:10.690> brush<00:06:10.930> strokes<00:06:12.870> bring<00:06:13.870> the<00:06:14.020> Pasi

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
couple of brush strokes bring the Pasi

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:24.159 
couple of brush strokes bring the Pasi
down<00:06:15.009> a<00:06:15.039> bit

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.170 

let's<00:06:24.830> see<00:06:24.949> it's<00:06:25.099> a<00:06:25.159> pretty<00:06:25.370> basic<00:06:25.789> easy

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
let's see it's a pretty basic easy

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.420 
let's see it's a pretty basic easy
effect<00:06:26.569> to<00:06:26.749> get<00:06:27.169> a<00:06:27.199> nice<00:06:27.560> depth<00:06:27.860> effect<00:06:28.039> here

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
effect to get a nice depth effect here

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.279 
effect to get a nice depth effect here
this<00:06:28.610> took<00:06:28.939> me<00:06:29.090> probably<00:06:29.419> not<00:06:29.749> even<00:06:29.990> four

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
this took me probably not even four

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.739 
this took me probably not even four
minutes<00:06:30.650> and<00:06:30.860> as<00:06:31.699> you<00:06:31.849> see<00:06:32.060> it's<00:06:32.240> a<00:06:32.389> great

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:32.749 
minutes and as you see it's a great

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:34.119 
minutes and as you see it's a great
effect<00:06:32.870> you<00:06:33.229> can<00:06:33.379> also<00:06:33.499> go<00:06:33.650> to<00:06:33.740> your<00:06:33.800> stars

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129 
effect you can also go to your stars

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:36.129 
effect you can also go to your stars
here<00:06:34.520> if<00:06:35.180> you<00:06:35.300> want<00:06:35.479> to<00:06:35.539> make<00:06:35.689> your<00:06:35.870> net<00:06:36.110> worth

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
here if you want to make your net worth

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.899 
here if you want to make your net worth
at<00:06:36.319> the<00:06:36.439> focal<00:06:36.830> point<00:06:37.069> you<00:06:37.340> can<00:06:37.490> use<00:06:37.520> eraser

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
at the focal point you can use eraser

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:42.309 
at the focal point you can use eraser
tool<00:06:38.270> and<00:06:38.300> erase<00:06:38.539> out<00:06:38.840> your<00:06:38.990> stars<00:06:41.259> now<00:06:42.259> you

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
tool and erase out your stars now you

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.920 
tool and erase out your stars now you
don't<00:06:42.529> want<00:06:42.740> it<00:06:42.919> just<00:06:43.479> simply<00:06:44.479> just<00:06:44.659> erase

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
don't want it just simply just erase

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.350 
don't want it just simply just erase
them<00:06:45.169> out

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
them out

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.379 
them out
I<00:06:47.479> have<00:06:48.110> my<00:06:48.229> flow<00:06:48.530> set<00:06:48.860> down<00:06:49.550> a<00:06:49.610> bit<00:06:49.909> here<00:06:50.120> so

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389 
I have my flow set down a bit here so

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.779 
I have my flow set down a bit here so
that<00:06:50.569> brushstroke<00:06:51.080> is<00:06:51.289> a<00:06:51.620> lot<00:06:52.099> more<00:06:52.280> smoother

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
that brushstroke is a lot more smoother

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.629 
that brushstroke is a lot more smoother
so<00:06:53.780> I<00:06:53.840> can<00:06:53.990> go<00:06:54.139> in<00:06:54.289> this<00:06:54.469> areas<00:06:55.009> like<00:06:55.159> this<00:06:55.400> and

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 
so I can go in this areas like this and

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:02.549 
so I can go in this areas like this and
fade<00:06:56.629> it<00:06:56.750> out<00:06:56.870> a<00:06:56.930> bit<00:06:57.050> better

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:02.559 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:04.229 

but<00:07:03.069> yeah<00:07:03.159> as<00:07:03.279> you<00:07:03.399> see<00:07:03.579> there's<00:07:03.789> my<00:07:03.999> negative

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:04.239 
but yeah as you see there's my negative

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:06.329 
but yeah as you see there's my negative
