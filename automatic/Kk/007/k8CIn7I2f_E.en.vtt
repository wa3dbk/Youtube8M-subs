 is a centuries old institution 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.230
 like a remnant of one 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.080
 past time between modern 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.600

 Teenagers are the ones on this market 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.250
 most frequent customers 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.380
 They buy horses like their peers in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.240
 Other countries bicycles than 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.130
 politically known adolescents live 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.200

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.710
 and ride bareback through the streets 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.710
 The Irish capital 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.290
 the reality, however, goes to this 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.909
 good idea mostly over in the dislike 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.860
 you find mainly old and sick 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.140
 horses and in the current crisis are 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.180
 the hoofed animals as cheap as never before 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.369
 everyone virtually passes by for 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.990
 Part only 50 euro afford a horse 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.240
 many, however, will be within days 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.570
 Released in england and hers 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.570
 around 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.710
 It is one of the poorest on-site off ins 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.270
 is the home of many landfill kids that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.250
 they often just keep horses next to them 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.440
 your house some with good 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.890
 ambitions, however, mostly without financial 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.560
 medium 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.570

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.070
 decreed that the keeping of horses 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.050
 without stall prohibited but around the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.580

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.740
 therefore there are always cases where 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.159
 completely neglected found horses 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.569

 and fences is good stronger than all 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.480
 regulate and maybe it will succeed 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.189
 adults who speak the language 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.599
