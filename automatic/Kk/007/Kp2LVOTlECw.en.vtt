 hello how welcome are you to my channel 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.320
 candy drawings I hope they are all 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.289
 well and on this occasion we will draw 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.289
 slugging of 'charlie brown' begin 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.610
 First 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:33.100
 we draw 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.100
 it would not be the head 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.640
 yes 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.640
 in the neck 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.190
 body parts 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.500
 an arm 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.140
 they look good but 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.710
 or rather the eye is not the seal 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.710
 once 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.390
 ear 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.670
 until 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.670
 now the other 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.039
 the fingers 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:36.969
 well as I always say it does not matter if 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.969
 wrong treated psoe to draw 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.270
 that do not have to be all perfect 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.810
 here the tail 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.630
 now I'm going to 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.630
 and now 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.960
 we will draw 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.890
 then friend 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:07.080
 and we make a kind of thirst 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.080
 here we make another 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.200
 here is this little girl now just 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.040
 tracings 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.040
 children 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.180
 irregular I have drawn both eyes 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.530
 to the neck 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.030
 here 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.130
 d 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.710
 tail birds 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.210
 Y 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:48.190
 it's almost here we'll draw 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.190
 part of the nucleus 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.450
 we will trace some small clouds 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.200
 they do not have to be perfect 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.200
 I told him it 's something fast 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.090
 now we are simply going to use 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.420
 our marker to further detail the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.420
 drawing 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.000
 currently we only follow the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.049
 strokes that males with pencil 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.920
 two 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.910
 marking or marking 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.910
 our worthy 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.920
 it's good to draw because 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.670
 it calms down to relax the mind 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.760
 if you come back 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.910
 giving without worries 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.150
 that transports 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.699
 when 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.699
 I looked at these little faces 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.319
 I like it 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.319
 see the characters of said vibes 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.970
 no 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.080
 yes 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.270
 now with 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:09.010
 the Japanese friend also has his 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.010
 followers 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.810
 and almost nothing else would be a matter of wetting 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.810
 the first strokes with the pencil 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.100
 Y 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.289
 hard 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.590
