00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
and goes to empower us and i predict the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.870 
and goes to empower us and i predict the
switch<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:14.810> go<00:01:14.840> in<00:01:15.170> for<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.500> keyway<00:01:15.980> which<00:01:16.670> was

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
switch to go in for the keyway which was

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.910 
switch to go in for the keyway which was
good<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.300> was<00:01:17.510> like<00:01:17.690> hope<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.320> won't<00:01:18.590> be<00:01:18.890> a

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
good but I was like hope it won't be a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.160 
good but I was like hope it won't be a
ground-type<00:01:19.610> but<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.270> wasn't<00:01:20.690> it<00:01:20.840> was<00:01:20.990> here

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
ground-type but it wasn't it was here

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.620 
ground-type but it wasn't it was here
some<00:01:21.350> powers<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:22.640> go<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.030> my<00:01:23.240> unknown

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
some powers and I go to my unknown

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.840 
some powers and I go to my unknown
predicted<00:01:24.230> yet<00:01:24.500> another<00:01:24.770> focus<00:01:25.190> blast<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.760> I

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
predicted yet another focus blast and I

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.480 
predicted yet another focus blast and I
did<00:01:26.060> predict<00:01:26.450> right<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:27.800> was<00:01:27.980> my<00:01:28.130> second

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
did predict right so this was my second

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.960 
did predict right so this was my second
prediction<00:01:28.730> and<00:01:29.180> I<00:01:29.960> did<00:01:30.260> predict<00:01:30.620> quite<00:01:31.070> a

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
prediction and I did predict quite a

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.420 
prediction and I did predict quite a
good<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.390> this<00:01:32.480> town<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.440> I<00:01:33.470> predict<00:01:34.010> again

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
good in this town so I predict again

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.730 
good in this town so I predict again
knowing<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.390> he<00:01:35.480> will<00:01:35.630> switch<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.260> go<00:01:36.470> for

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
knowing that he will switch and I go for

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.610 
knowing that he will switch and I go for
