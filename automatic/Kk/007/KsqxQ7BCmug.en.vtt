00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.290
 A table that I was watching 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.959
 I wonder if it was English but this new part 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:17.829
 Thank you 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:22.080
 When joining on the 19th 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.080
 Even that warm feeling 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.060
 10 minutes 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.060
 thank you very much 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.330
 s This vacant seat has been continued 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.700
 It was held here 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.130
 There were no two people 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.890
 Right after that 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.360
 Even though I am different 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.060
 We had one game play in 10 games this season 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.060
 For now 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 Up 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.960
 Then 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 I understood 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.490
 Thank you for coming 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.950
 While many people came today, thank you 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.549
 It was not 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.549
 that 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.259
 There is a person who 8 says but there was not much effect 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.259
 I can not play Valentine 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.250
 Ordinary army 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.960
 Focus on the director at a stretch 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.220
 It was fun time even if the fixed-term leased house ishkek disappeared 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.820
 Well how about Yutoku 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.910
 Prior to this, the deputy prime minister in the hospital 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.960
 The general manager has become another place 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.950
 End 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.259
 It seems like I decided to make a schedule with the prospect of being late 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.259
 Please look at it while getting a bit 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.300
 Mr. Okamura Michio and 7515 do you like 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:13.160
 Oh dear 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.830
 Average part 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.459
 Even in the industry is difficult. I thought it would be nice to draw 40 people 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.640
 Stood for a certain period 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.219
 I did it again 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.819
 The first match at all 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.819
 There is no plan next month 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:39.049
 Overwhelmed by a big hit in the middle of a big hit, the stage of business confidence was the worst 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.269
 I think that I make use of the building 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.269
 I want to work hard with overseas luxury 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:52.200
 truly- 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.690
 This is my first and last one. 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.349
 I'm thinking of going back 8 days in Japan 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.989
 It would be appreciated if you could see it at that theater twice 3 times 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.919
 Thank you very much after thinking 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.139
 Thank you
