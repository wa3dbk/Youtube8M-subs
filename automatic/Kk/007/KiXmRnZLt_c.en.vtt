00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.360
 I have them in their box since I do not like it 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.059

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.610
 apart I do not have a specific place in 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.710
 where to have them in here is my beautiful 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.710
 I think it's going from one place to another 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:13.250
 and I continue with this beautiful water that 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.410

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.049
 milk I had to debate between complete 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.990
 this lagoon and good decided to choose to 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:39.259
 Álava and this month I'm going to buy some 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.880

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.310
 this here I have it to frankie because the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.229
 very good care box since for 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.610
 of it since it says a few episodes 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.429
 and this I decided to leave together and good 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.550
 although this one was heard in a version that 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.500
 homeland and jackson 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.530
 the picnic I do not know what it's called but 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.460
 due to some kind of picnic and it does not say 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.460
 and there you had 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.840
 here I have 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:17.600
 gaudin that is on the side that I like 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.440
 to take this pose 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.440
 It is the d 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.050
 fair range of action 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.290
 is the version of that is with the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.290
 true 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:40.969
 with this April they know this festival of 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.760
 music music in this version this 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:46.310

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.760
 it is reached in the box and not in 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.829
 a rayon this pink and it's because 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.810
 I do not know why but he has been woken up 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.860
 in a little bit on the lips there you get 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.410
 Let's see 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.610
 I do not know why maybe it's the heat because it 's 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.040
 that we are going to have them stuck in the box 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.850
 but here it looks beautiful study for 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.380
 I love those pink and purple colors of 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.569
 fortune 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.549

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.549
 here I have here gr 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:25.100
 monstrous excursion I loved when 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:30.210

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.630

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.630
 beautiful 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:42.530
 I'm still with frankie stein dressed in caudé 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.530
 This doll I liked a lot in 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.960
 special that you can remove the 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.400
 lips 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.320
 the small fangs can be 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.920
 remove although it remains a small milestone 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:00.930
 in the mouth now it happens very beautiful is of 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.420
 creepy fusion 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.480
 and as you can see I do not have any 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.400
 complete collection 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.210
 since I have so like to jump to 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.970
 won dolls 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.490
 these two lines together because to this one 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.580
 It's your house and it was the first one I had 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.580
 so then and here I am here 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:24.000
 is frank and in basic version and here 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.900
 this operetta in this also scares that 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.900
 amaya action 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.470
 beautiful both 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.520
 here is what night is capturing what 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.920
 he had lost his name the seat 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.770
 of the good doll version 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.650
 He never says it but they come with a 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.810
 phone that is not here I'm going to reasons 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.290
 because if they are not going to be lost because the 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.290
 box is open 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.880
 on this side I have actor alain also 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.810
 monstrous discussion 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.150
 it's like they have healthier skin 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.570
 left a beam less a decade like in 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.570
 Other versions 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.520
 I also liked your design very very 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:23.090
 Pretty beautiful and very naughty 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:25.400
 here I have a lagoon with long day this is 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.370
 the combination of the two and is that of the 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:33.070
 spooky extinction movie 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.520
 simply the doll is new octavio 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.250
 cuéllar but 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.750
 as if falling there was a lot of variety but 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.800
 if I like it more, it's not one of my 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.800
 favorite favorites 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:50.510
 let's continue with now we do have to 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.760
 frank and the picnic of the vegetable box 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.390
 as I had already told you the change of 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:00.880
 box 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:04.300
 this is the cure in the movie 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.430
 this your choice flakes 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.520
 It looks very pretty I liked this 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.939
 guilty day design 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.099
 precious finally we have what it is to 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.740
 written each time I had wished 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:19.569
 really for a long time to 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.490
 written every time you are and when I saw it 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.919
 I said I took it apart that it was a 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:27.090
 little cheaper than other days so 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.130
 you have to take advantage of the opportunities 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.530
 and well here I also have all the 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.610
 accessories that come in the boxes with 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.500
 the dolls 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.600
 all the issues and half a sale said 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.690
 here 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.190
 I do not have your diaries, it's about drawing things 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.230
 of monster high and it's also a day in 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.680
 the clinician that speaks good 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.680
 technically 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:54.860
 and a little electronic too 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.330
 well in theory this is all 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.240

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.270

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.650

 I'm going to buy more but at the moment 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.810
 because a month ago I spent a lot of money 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.460

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.670
