at<00:01:11.460> Sally's<00:01:12.140> yeah<00:01:13.140> um<00:01:13.409> alright<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.150> start

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
at Sally's yeah um alright so I start

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.520 
at Sally's yeah um alright so I start
from<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> back<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:17.340> then<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.780> section<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.259> four

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
from the back and then a section of four

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.499 
from the back and then a section of four
I<00:01:19.710> should<00:01:19.979> say<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.490> thought<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.210> maybe<00:01:21.330> that

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
I should say I thought that maybe that

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.289 
I should say I thought that maybe that
would<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.689> clear<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.799> probably<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.430> my<00:01:24.240> do

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
would be clear but probably not my do

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.530 
would be clear but probably not my do
four<00:01:24.630> sections<00:01:25.520> start<00:01:26.520> from<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> back<00:01:27.710> left

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
four sections start from the back left

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.870 
four sections start from the back left
work<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.659> way<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> front<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> start

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
work my way to the front then I start

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.190 
work my way to the front then I start
back<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.600> work<00:01:33.750> my<00:01:33.900> way<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
back right and then I work my way to the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.340 
back right and then I work my way to the
frying<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.710> already<00:01:35.630> done<00:01:36.630> three<00:01:37.110> twists<00:01:38.000> um

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
frying I already done three twists um

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.750 
frying I already done three twists um
therefore<00:01:40.350> i'll<00:01:40.710> probably<00:01:41.040> get

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.570 

maybe<00:01:45.760> two<00:01:46.090> or<00:01:46.120> three<00:01:46.270> more<00:01:46.630> twists<00:01:47.370> out<00:01:48.370> of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580
