00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
it looks to be interesting i'm really

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.830 
it looks to be interesting i'm really
interested<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.859> prestige<00:02:52.859> system<00:02:53.400> and

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
interested in the prestige system and

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.770 
interested in the prestige system and
the<00:02:54.840> maps<00:02:55.340> escalation<00:02:56.340> i'm<00:02:57.209> not<00:02:57.359> sure<00:02:57.419> if

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the maps escalation i'm not sure if

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.809 
the maps escalation i'm not sure if
that's<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.139> it<00:02:58.680> says<00:02:58.889> it's<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.129> new<00:02:59.340> these<00:02:59.669> are

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819
