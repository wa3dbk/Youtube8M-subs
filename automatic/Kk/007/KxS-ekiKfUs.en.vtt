00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:09.900
 tutorial in which I will teach you two 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:14.360
 pages to download games for ya 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.320
 xirles are not my pages or anything like that 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.210
 they are pages that I found on the web 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.490
 well now in your browser I will leave you 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.530
 the download links the description of the 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.280
 video 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.380
 good 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.020
 the first one is terrible 16 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.500
 good is that it has many categories 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.280
 and in each category has many the 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.960
 second are mccown games of max payne 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.360
 one very good one already downloads most of 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.040
 the forests I have in my times are of 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.500
 this page 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.220
 well it has enough categories that it 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.420
 they set on finding 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.700
 the second 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.480
 the one of cam is a link 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.479
 a good mole this let's say kooning in 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.860
 Reality is not a link 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:10.200
 they have several links in the description 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.600
 to choose and amazon if it is by my fire 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.450
 is are several parts because only what 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.450
 left for 200mb depends on which game 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.850
 best spider with reeve is 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 of 170 so my father would be a link 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.280
 there are only enough parts to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.200
 download it are very good and they are 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.770
 I wanted to give these two pages because I 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.950
 They liked it because they wanted to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.020
 good are the ones that I always use and good 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.369
 without more card 4 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.310
 I have these two games the gta I have 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.480
 these two games thank you 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.360
 Well, let's say 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.770
 I will show you that I have two or three games 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.770
 I do not remember if I had 3 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.540
 wow 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.980
 I have the warcraft 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.980
 andy signal against him 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.030
 I have four of the frost center too 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.360
 and it will be called another pack and the san andreas 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.630
 seppi as you can see I will tell you how much 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.500
 occupies the king enrique does not occupy much nor 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.470
 It also does not occupy little but it is not the same 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.610
 that despite common ordinary four days 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.610
 just like the river 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.640
 nor hatred as it weighs you more than four days 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.640
 this only weighs 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:50.540
 four and a half no more but the other day 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:54.010
 warcraft occupies only 586 mb 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.260
 I recommend it is one of the best games 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.650
 what can exist 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.620
 and well we finished with this video of 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.010
 Show pages for games 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.010
 bye
