 Valeria Efremova coach latitudes usanova 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.460
 how he was not the task not to give 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.110
 shifting 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:16.070
 in battle the enemy himself constantly go on

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.150
 psychological pressure 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.100
