 are here for you in las vegas on the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.880
 ces and we can easily see are 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.860
 We're not over this video 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.810
 components what with computers tablets 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.000
 or has to do but we are here 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.730
 at audi august also on the spot and 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.879
 presents new technologies and beside 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.250
 me is sitting doctor level and the 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.730
 The coach will be the new one 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.940
 Virtual cockpit here imagine that 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.129
 it shows a premiere here in las vegas 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.100
 First, the interior of the coming 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.699
 audi tts and yes we are curious which 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.699
 features is 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.500
 So you see the world premiere here 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.720
 interior designs by audi tt 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.930
 the bonds from the last version of the 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.880
 tt with the with the air inlets at the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.760
 the problems optics remember now in 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.590
 new cd with displays inside the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.450
 that means when you have the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.580
 temperature understands it here in 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.200
 a corresponding display also at 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.390
 the direction choice position or at the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.369
 ventilation intensity can be seen here then 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.520
 the displays nice gadget went that was 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.470
 car in any case to another 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.720
 main point of this vehicle or better 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.300
 the ria concept is that said 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.110
 missing medium display that means we 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.040
 have the contents of the middle displays 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.420
 taken together with the communes 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.240
 hold and they are now in this 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.580
 One sees virtual cockpit 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.500
 it here in the big display 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.030
 the customer does not have to do without and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.280
 gets in the freely programmable 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.149
 the two contents come together i 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.039
 can show it off 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.470
 I'll take a look at this view 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.840
 that's the view of how the driver is 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.700
 in most 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.280
 Life is in the fan sight now 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.150
 just like the engine, so to speak 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.590
 you can see how the speed is 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.630
 move instruments and the driver can 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.320
 between the different modes 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.330
 switch 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.580
 as he canon of his 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.910
 previous vehicle on-board computer 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.430
 short time memory long time mm time 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.260
 settings and so on 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.120
 is exciting now if he is in this 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.160
 infotainment view he can do that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.810
 make it by pressing the button 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.180
 This whole view gets wider 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.050
 the tubes disappear to the side and 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.640
 now has in principle the full 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.290
 Possibility of service he otherwise 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.660
 about the middle display would have had 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.340
 that works on the one hand over that 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.470
 steering wheel that means I can do everything very well 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.870
 driver optimized from the steering wheel turn 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.570
 the eyes stay in the street and me 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.160
 can it be very driver oriented 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.560
 perform conditions on the other 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.989
 he can do that too 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.420
 the service section here the service section 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.330
 pictures on the one hand the functions after and 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.160
 still offers a touchpad with me 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.590
 different functions eyes can do that 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.240
 whole virtual cockpit also brings 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.280
 first time the new operating concept 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.350
 what the previous with the concert you 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.850
 Advantages bring a much shorter 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.840
 operation so less at the mini 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.489
 steps to 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.650
 I can do that on the navigation 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.500
 show for example in the customer 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.110
 would like to enter the navigation destination 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.640
 so far different steps needed only 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.340
 to decide it is a special decision 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.290
 the goal is that one address 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.680
 now it is so he immediately one 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.940
 list of likely they aim 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.390
 this is the home address and the 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.950
 last goals and with the offered ones 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.290
 possibilities comes to actually 7 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.519
 90 percent of the cases that not of if 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.430
 Enough there is this 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.769
 input field and he can now with the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.769
 touchpad make my typing input 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.120
 and in principle this is a search about 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.040
 different databases in the vehicle 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.750
 includes both the final goals as 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.280
 also special addresses and addresses 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.500
 adressbuch that means if I am now to 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.510
 For example, a contact would have the 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.720
 Debt crisis or something similar I could 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.420
 now find this search and 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.700
 just hit it and start driving 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.739
 already starts the navigation 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.370
 and in principle when that is started 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.230
 I can go back to the 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.970
 driver-oriented view give this 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.980
 new operating concept is also taking off 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.299
 the other functional areas i can 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.070
 again with media show 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.480
 there you have on the first step 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.100
 first of all what you need directly 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.720
 the music titles of the current playlist 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.540
 If I do not think so then I'll be great 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.150
 can i search over this again 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.169
 Buben is basically the complete one 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.880
 Browse medium 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.160
 So the entered letter becomes then 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.870
 both in the titles in the alps and in 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.430
 the interpreter wanted and the 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.510
 Conformity will be shown to the list 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.200
 that means if I now something of the 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.100
 beatles super bowl on it would be that 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.460
 album 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.880
 and already now you have finally 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.070
 seen 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.270
 made these different operations 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.450
 has to be much less menu 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.830
 step forward and say this 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.450
 uniform concept prevails 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.140
 all the functional areas through also in the 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.660
 phone 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.490
 I can see that at first sight 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.380
 the most important telephone numbers the 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.340
 others escaped from incoming 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.230
 calls and 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.710
 I can as well then one 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.449
 telephone number that is all new audi 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.070
 Vehicles are then with the 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:31.530
 virtual cockpit delivered 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.760
 optional feature that is but one man 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:38.340
 It will be in other vehicles as well 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:40.290
 It is important to say again 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.820
 that I am at the virtual cockpit 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.440
 of course a concept is what the driver is 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.449
 that's why it's going to be oriented 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.620
 everything in sport vehicles so again in the 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.100
 be found team 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.180
 in other vehicles limousines and suv 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.400
 and so on will of course continue 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.130
 even a central given is called 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.080
 will be a combination in the future 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:01.040
 created 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.040
 and when will that be about 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.740
 calculate that the first vehicles will be 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.390
 from the initiative end of the year beginning 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.510
 next year then appropriate 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.900
 Market becomes very interesting 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.120
 So you have not seen this time 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.130
 computer star of the sense but that 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.190
 Virtual cockpit was very audi 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.530
 interesting and many more videos 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.680
 finds her with us please have a look 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.680
 past
