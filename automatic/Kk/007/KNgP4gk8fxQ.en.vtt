00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.620
 the model economic ups and downs many times 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.819
 that we are out of work 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.730
 and in that we are in the maelstrom to think what we do how we settle and I 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.549
 tells us that our children are 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.140
 passive spectators of everything that is happening and this affects them a 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.279
 but the first thing is to understand that really 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.189
 if the children like for example the family are not really just like 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.980
 spectators 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.619
 bruno are already suffering 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.890
 why 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.080
 we are parents 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.050
 practically since he half of the world 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.550
 of them then what happens to us 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.289
 in such an irresponsible way 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.109
 not important is that they are to a certain clarity and be sure as soon as 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.430
 is what is about to happen 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.650
 and that can only come from how we approach 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.399
 thank God we have sent a message to the real union 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.799
 if you think we say to them 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.280
 like a minute later 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.699
 it was not better we did not show them 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.970
 we keep it aside so as not to worry 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.300
 as if this were possible 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.130
 this created a vacuum to make those gaps I always dreamed of two points 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.710
 expectations with fantasies even though they do not do it but the operation was 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.290
 valued for the next year, the days a day you said to your home you're 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.970
 tasted 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.380
 costs I am very concerned about the issue that you have to pay for certain thing and not 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.290
 there is money 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.680
 then it was said that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.450
 and you have no idea what is happening to you, bnp worried like that and want to think 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.130
 that the first thing to think about the gore is not for me something of 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.480
 I did not start thinking that I'm doing wrong 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.479
 and it may be that even at some point when really she 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.560
 realize that the economic problem 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.760
 think that he 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.930
 it's part of the economic problem no one for him is in these in this attempt 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.480
 is 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.240
 like everything in families among the best 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.950
 will be open calm state to der also I think it is also a 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.410
 good way to incorporate children 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.009
 the family economy 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.109
 and let him know that the things that one has cost him nothing and there is a 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.850
 organization so is 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.850
 all the time we are forming meteors that have some confidence 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.650
 life is not that moment of crisis and there is a much longer thing 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.650
 and every moment 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.140
 the opportunity in any case we have to take it 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.209
 so that they learn so that we have 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.760
 the advantage that we dads have that we have our children was not health 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.520
 when looking with creativity that is not a difficult circumstance 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.330
 and see how we can transform into something that is useful for our 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.009
 family 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.009
 and this is an opportunity for our children 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.609
 that they can contribute that the good solution can be part we are going to see 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.769
 the video that joaquin de orbegoso has us ready 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.260
 how do you think that 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.369
 pinal successes 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.369
 when there is economic crisis in your family 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.140
 that motivated his main rival that could give him 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.099
 this the toast 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.719
 when you have borrowed your dad's work 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.139
 the team is fine 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.999
 because she has not and they have admitted themselves 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:09.399
 and everything started to change a bit suddenly you can not go to the same school 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:10.959
 that until before suddenly 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.549
 it does not have the same mobilization that you had before and all of them also 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.989
 and in that case 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.549
 it is believed that the children 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.759
 what could they take 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.960
 actually abstaining from excesses 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.719
 Alan Elijah like 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.499
 to select it 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.809
 and make your candidate and fed up like for example save 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:35.439
 in essence to spend so much money for example a success and have opened to send 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.629
 to work but it was two hours later you were 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.640
 and in addition the lawyer affirmed today to messenger to win to him the year so 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.639
 minus two days 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.489
 be here the economic crisis 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.109
 when not criminal 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.529
 concreted 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:58.959
 according to the note the spot dollar in revenue 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.609
 convinced that he will 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.069
 the parents want to involve the children in closing the fibertel 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.799
 children have to take and a 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.559
 responsible attitude to be able to take out his family also advanced that 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:12.559
 would deserve temporary ere 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:18.959
 the responsible writer was councilor mercedes launched to know that the 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.669
 income of the white house in a sector of the canton 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.970
 the things that people do in general 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.050
 the staff of the health center 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.650
 the children must work 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.139
 aede it seems that it would work 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.770
 for the ccl 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.080
 and it should not be a forced labor but the hotel laja him 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.479
 the east zone 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.580
 went home 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.889
 demands 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.139
 canada already works in the casal fester 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.080
 restaurant 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.080
 he supported him a lot in which the weak part 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.759
 general where they inform us growing up and are working can help in the 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.759
 economy is scarce 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.039
 they have been reconsidered 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.689
 so this malick movie 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.689
 I love you with all my salary the minister 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.870
 good and we have the testimonials of these guys many of them actually 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.870
 worked up 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.150
 and he feels very proud to work and feels very good to be able to support the 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.270
 family economy maybe themselves a speed inside inclusive 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.210
 as long as you do not miss it's structural 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.070
 the children 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.320
 even work 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.390
 with that law is the side that is also playful also the experience 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.699
 same line 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.840
 is let's say not even trying a little to be responsible a bit to participate in what 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.990
 what happens in your environment 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.370
 and according to the people besides cc oo change 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.600
 they were coming to contribute to improve it is estimated that it is worth more I will want more 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.949
 his family and he is responsible for the Balearic books I think it's that 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.150
 the kit that the Peruvians have now I know that it is not a source of growth 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.349
 and create niches of work cct 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.580
 in another country since I announced astonished happens but that is our 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.469
 strong and what a shame
