come up with you can see here there is a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.990 
come up with you can see here there is a
swiveling<00:00:31.859> section<00:00:33.020> with<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.730> bolt<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.969> goes

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
swiveling section with a bolt that goes

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.389 
swiveling section with a bolt that goes
through<00:00:37.760> I've<00:00:38.760> got<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> little<00:00:40.010> wing<00:00:41.010> nut<00:00:41.219> on

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
through I've got a little wing nut on

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.260 
through I've got a little wing nut on
there<00:00:42.530> this<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.920> an<00:00:44.040> old<00:00:44.160> caster<00:00:47.270> here's

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
there this is just an old caster here's

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.830 
there this is just an old caster here's
a<00:00:48.390> similar<00:00:48.989> caster<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> used<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.510> used<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
a similar caster that I used I used a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.920 
a similar caster that I used I used a
grinding<00:00:52.289> wheel<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.250> took<00:00:53.309> off<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.940> rivet

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
grinding wheel and I took off that rivet

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.099 
grinding wheel and I took off that rivet
right<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:56.090> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.239> see<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> bolt

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
right there you can see it's not a bolt

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.319 
right there you can see it's not a bolt
or<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.379> screw<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.609> had<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.789> grind<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.270> off

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
or a screw so I had to grind that off

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.170 
or a screw so I had to grind that off
actually<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.230> take<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.250> back<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.030> use

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
actually I take that back I think I use

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.630 
actually I take that back I think I use
a<00:01:03.210> hacksaw<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.339> I<00:01:05.339> cut<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> axle<00:01:07.430> either<00:01:08.430> way

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
a hacksaw and I cut the axle either way

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.570 
a hacksaw and I cut the axle either way
even<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.659> more<00:01:09.900> work<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:11.040> once<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
even one more work and once you have the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.070 
even one more work and once you have the
wheel<00:01:11.760> removed<00:01:12.950> what<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.100> wind<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.430> with<00:01:14.490> is

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
wheel removed what you wind up with is

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.830 
wheel removed what you wind up with is
just<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.320> ball<00:01:17.250> bearing<00:01:17.759> part<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.360> this

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
just the ball bearing part and this

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.100 
just the ball bearing part and this
little<00:01:19.080> axle<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> remake<00:01:21.750> out

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
little axle that you have to remake out

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.539 
little axle that you have to remake out
of<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.439> threaded<00:01:23.070> bolt<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.700> attached<00:01:24.570> that

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
of a threaded bolt I attached that

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.880 
of a threaded bolt I attached that
caster<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.759> an<00:01:27.450> old<00:01:27.630> piece<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.909> bed<00:01:29.909> liner<00:01:30.890> this

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
caster to an old piece of bed liner this

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.840 
caster to an old piece of bed liner this
has<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.280> many<00:01:32.400> different<00:01:32.610> applications

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
has so many different applications

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.780 
has so many different applications
you've<00:01:33.630> got<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.860> straight<00:01:34.860> rigid<00:01:35.189> part<00:01:35.579> which

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
you've got a straight rigid part which

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.120 
you've got a straight rigid part which
I've<00:01:35.970> used<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.170> got<00:01:37.409> perfectly<00:01:37.890> flat

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
I've used then you got perfectly flat

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.310 
I've used then you got perfectly flat
parts<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.630> got<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.990> part<00:01:40.229> around

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
parts and then you got the part around

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.730 
parts and then you got the part around
the<00:01:40.500> wheel<00:01:40.710> well<00:01:40.979> which<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.369> rounded<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.740> that

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the wheel well which is rounded and that

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.850 
the wheel well which is rounded and that
proved<00:01:45.170> pretty<00:01:46.170> useful<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.890> case<00:01:48.710> on<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
proved pretty useful in this case on the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.899 
proved pretty useful in this case on the
bottom<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.880> used<00:01:52.460> some<00:01:53.460> padding

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
bottom of that I used some padding

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.609 
bottom of that I used some padding
because<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.420> goes<00:01:54.600> directly<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:55.170> top<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> my

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
because this goes directly on top of my

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.359 
because this goes directly on top of my
head<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.149> had<00:01:57.149> used<00:01:57.619> helmet<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:58.979> actually

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
head I had used helmet this is actually

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.639 
head I had used helmet this is actually
a<00:01:59.399> hard<00:01:59.670> hat<00:01:59.850> from<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.119> construction<00:02:00.600> site<00:02:00.810> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
a hard hat from a construction site you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.780 
a hard hat from a construction site you
can<00:02:01.740> see<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> holes<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> top

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
can see the holes on the top

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.429 
can see the holes on the top
I<00:02:02.969> tried<00:02:03.210> attaching<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> top<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.259> that

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
I tried attaching it to the top of that

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.160 
I tried attaching it to the top of that
this<00:02:04.740> proof<00:02:05.159> would<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.369> too<00:02:05.670> big<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.810> take<00:02:07.020> out

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
this proof would be too big to take out

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.920 
this proof would be too big to take out
on<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> kayak<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.979> me

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.610 

with<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.110> here<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:14.060> took<00:02:14.780> up<00:02:14.960> a<00:02:15.050> lot<00:02:15.080> less

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
with this here it took up a lot less

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.760 
with this here it took up a lot less
space<00:02:15.940> when<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.060> all<00:02:17.240> tucked<00:02:18.200> away<00:02:18.410> like

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
space when it's all tucked away like

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.740 
space when it's all tucked away like
this<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.280> could<00:02:19.730> just<00:02:19.880> put<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.090> inside<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.570> tool

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
this I could just put it inside the tool

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.890 
this I could just put it inside the tool
box<00:02:20.990> on<00:02:21.110> my<00:02:21.170> kayak<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:23.180> fit<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.480> there<00:02:23.660> with

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
box on my kayak and it fit in there with

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.810 
box on my kayak and it fit in there with
plenty<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.710> room<00:02:24.920> for<00:02:24.950> all<00:02:25.190> my<00:02:25.220> other<00:02:25.400> stuff

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
plenty of room for all my other stuff

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.810 
plenty of room for all my other stuff
and<00:02:26.120> one<00:02:26.780> other<00:02:26.900> advantage<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.740> that<00:02:28.220> it's<00:02:28.580> set

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
and one other advantage is that it's set

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.900 
and one other advantage is that it's set
lower<00:02:29.090> on<00:02:29.330> my<00:02:29.510> head<00:02:29.750> then<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.470> hard<00:02:31.430> hat<00:02:31.640> and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
lower on my head then the hard hat and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.360 
lower on my head then the hard hat and
it<00:02:32.120> added<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.840> little<00:02:32.930> more<00:02:33.050> stability<00:02:33.380> and

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
it added a little more stability and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.670 
it added a little more stability and
speaking<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.850> stability<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:37.960> strap<00:02:38.960> here<00:02:39.190> is

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
and thread it's got an adjusting loop in

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.940 
and thread it's got an adjusting loop in
it<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:59.090> can<00:02:59.270> just<00:02:59.450> look<00:02:59.540> at<00:02:59.690> any<00:02:59.840> strap<00:03:00.740> that

has<00:03:01.100> an<00:03:01.250> adjusting<00:03:01.700> loop<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.450> figure<00:03:02.690> out<00:03:02.840> how

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
has an adjusting loop to figure out how

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.710 
has an adjusting loop to figure out how
they<00:03:03.170> work<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.820> that's<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:05.060> there's<00:03:05.600> no

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
they work and that's it there's no

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.770 
they work and that's it there's no
clasps<00:03:06.260> or<00:03:06.380> anything<00:03:06.620> it's<00:03:07.040> just<00:03:07.780> sew

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.660 

now<00:05:26.350> if<00:05:26.500> you<00:05:26.620> decide<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:27.070> build<00:05:27.220> one<00:05:27.460> of<00:05:27.550> these

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
now if you decide to build one of these

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.400 
now if you decide to build one of these
things<00:05:27.880> you<00:05:28.000> got<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.210> note<00:05:28.450> you'll<00:05:28.900> notice<00:05:29.230> here

that the entire assembly is fairly well

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.780 
that the entire assembly is fairly well
balanced<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:37.510> that's<00:05:37.690> important<00:05:38.640> that<00:05:39.640> the

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
balanced and that's important that the

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.560 
balanced and that's important that the
weight<00:05:40.000> of<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.270> camera<00:05:40.660> and<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:43.060> housing<00:05:43.890> is

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
balanced with the ballast in the back

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.080 
balanced with the ballast in the back
you<00:05:50.350> can<00:05:50.440> always<00:05:50.620> add<00:05:50.920> extra<00:05:51.310> screws<00:05:51.670> and<00:05:51.940> nuts

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
you can always add extra screws and nuts

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.670 
you can always add extra screws and nuts
and<00:05:52.330> bolts<00:05:52.660> or<00:05:52.810> whatever<00:05:53.050> you're<00:05:53.290> using<00:05:53.320> for

and bolts or whatever you're using for

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.920 
and bolts or whatever you're using for
ballast<00:05:55.080> and<00:05:56.080> that's<00:05:56.350> so<00:05:56.500> that<00:05:56.680> you're

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
ballast and that's so that you're

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:26.820 
ballast and that's so that you're
balanced<00:05:58.930> well<00:05:59.170> on<00:05:59.380> that<00:05:59.560> center<00:05:59.920> point<00:06:00.130> there
