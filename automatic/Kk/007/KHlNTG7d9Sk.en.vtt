get in down the side and can eventually

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
lead to the loss of the tooth and of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.260 
lead to the loss of the tooth and of
course<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:31.619> forces<00:01:32.100> actually<00:01:32.490> create<00:01:32.970> cracks

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
course the forces actually create cracks

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.060 
course the forces actually create cracks
in<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> enamel<00:01:33.780> micro<00:01:34.380> cracks<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> enamel

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
in the enamel micro cracks in the enamel

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.940 
in the enamel micro cracks in the enamel
that<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.610> generate<00:01:35.759> big<00:01:36.090> cracks<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
that can generate big cracks and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:45.570 
that can generate big cracks and
eventually<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.880> teeth<00:01:39.119> break<00:01:39.570> apart

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
as the teeth rub together they also

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.840 
as the teeth rub together they also
trigger<00:01:48.730> the<00:01:48.790> nerves<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.480> fire<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.810> muscles

the muscles try and move the teeth

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.080 
the muscles try and move the teeth
around<00:01:53.290> into<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:53.800> position<00:01:54.070> where<00:01:54.460> they're<00:01:54.700> not

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
the forces develop as the teeth come

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.530 
the forces develop as the teeth come
together<00:03:32.580> so<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:33.670> can<00:03:33.820> see<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.090> forces

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
together so you can see the forces

together so you can see the forces
developing<00:03:35.500> relative<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.370> each<00:03:36.519> other<00:03:36.670> and

developing relative to each other and

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.050 
developing relative to each other and
also<00:03:38.380> as<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.830> patient<00:03:39.220> makes<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.550> move<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.940> the

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
also as the patient makes a move to the

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.479 
also as the patient makes a move to the
side<00:03:40.300> and<00:03:40.660> we<00:03:41.410> can<00:03:41.590> see<00:03:41.769> how<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:41.980> force<00:03:42.280> is

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
side and we can see how the force is

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.759 
side and we can see how the force is
transmitted<00:03:43.030> we<00:03:43.780> can<00:03:43.900> see<00:03:44.049> how<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.260> back<00:03:44.530> in

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
transmitted we can see how the back in

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.160 
transmitted we can see how the back in
this<00:03:44.920> case<00:03:45.190> how<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.580> back<00:03:45.880> teeth<00:03:46.120> here<00:03:46.510> are

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
this case how the back teeth here are

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.539 
this case how the back teeth here are
still<00:03:47.410> in<00:03:47.560> contact<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:50.220> sensor<00:03:51.220> also

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
still in contact and the sensor also

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.300 
still in contact and the sensor also
measures<00:03:52.380> timing<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.680> this<00:03:53.860> particular

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
measures timing so this particular

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.850 
measures timing so this particular
patient's<00:03:55.000> teeth<00:03:55.180> come<00:03:55.480> together<00:03:55.630> in<00:03:56.170> point

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
patient's teeth come together in point

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.340 
patient's teeth come together in point
five<00:03:57.390> three<00:03:58.390> one<00:03:58.540> second

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
five three one second

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.060 
five three one second
and<00:03:59.920> they're<00:04:00.070> separating<00:04:01.260> 2.48<00:04:02.260> two<00:04:02.530> seconds

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
and they're separating 2.48 two seconds

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:10.830 
and they're separating 2.48 two seconds
so<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:03.940> long<00:04:04.210> time<00:04:04.240> for<00:04:04.900> for<00:04:05.260> both<00:04:09.570> t<00:04:10.570> scan

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840
