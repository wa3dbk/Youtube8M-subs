will cover a tattoo and other things and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.569 
will cover a tattoo and other things and
I<00:01:38.790> think<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> would<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.360> great<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:40.579> coverage

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
I think it would be great for coverage

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.940 
I think it would be great for coverage
in<00:01:41.850> other<00:01:42.180> areas<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.320> under<00:01:43.619> your<00:01:43.799> eyes

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
or just darker then it's like like

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.530 
or just darker then it's like like
you're<00:02:55.980> trying<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.430> cover<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.760> shadow<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.450> you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
you're trying to cover a shadow but you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.690 
you're trying to cover a shadow but you
created<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:58.170> shadow<00:02:58.470> by<00:02:58.769> even<00:02:59.250> wearing<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
created a shadow by even wearing the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.339 
created a shadow by even wearing the
concealer<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.180> makes<00:03:00.659> any<00:03:00.870> sense<00:03:00.989> at<00:03:01.290> all

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
concealer that makes any sense at all

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.910 
concealer that makes any sense at all
once<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.099> dries<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.180> set<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.930> starts<00:03:04.709> to

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
once it dries and it's set it starts to

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.020 
once it dries and it's set it starts to
almost<00:03:06.650> oxidize<00:03:07.650> even<00:03:08.129> but<00:03:08.370> not<00:03:08.549> yellow

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
almost oxidize even but not yellow

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.990 
almost oxidize even but not yellow
oxidation<00:03:09.720> it's<00:03:10.189> like<00:03:11.189> it<00:03:11.370> just<00:03:11.400> starts<00:03:11.849> to

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
oxidation it's like it just starts to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.629 
oxidation it's like it just starts to
change<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.900> color<00:03:13.139> the<00:03:13.290> tone<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.920> gets<00:03:14.069> darker

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
change the color the tone it gets darker

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.659 
change the color the tone it gets darker
so<00:03:15.120> when<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.359> was<00:03:15.629> trying<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.349> brighten<00:03:16.680> become

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
so when I was trying to brighten become

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.430 
so when I was trying to brighten become
something<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.359> is<00:03:18.480> actually<00:03:18.930> darker<00:03:19.290> than

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
something that is actually darker than

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.809 
something that is actually darker than
what<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.620> was<00:03:19.829> working<00:03:20.430> with<00:03:20.519> from<00:03:20.760> the

tap<00:05:10.680> into<00:05:11.100> place<00:05:11.900> so<00:05:12.900> this<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.080> what<00:05:13.350> I<00:05:13.380> do

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
tap into place so this is what I do

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.490 
tap into place so this is what I do
under<00:05:14.669> my<00:05:14.790> on<00:05:14.910> dry<00:05:15.120> I<00:05:15.300> just<00:05:15.510> simply<00:05:15.900> tap<00:05:16.229> it

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
under my on dry I just simply tap it

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.240 
under my on dry I just simply tap it
into<00:05:16.820> wherever<00:05:17.820> I<00:05:17.970> want<00:05:18.300> it<00:05:18.390> to<00:05:18.450> be<00:05:18.570> and<00:05:19.250> you

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
into wherever I want it to be and you

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.110 
into wherever I want it to be and you
can<00:05:20.400> see<00:05:21.200> it<00:05:22.200> gives<00:05:22.530> a<00:05:22.740> great<00:05:23.190> amount<00:05:24.000> of

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
can see it gives a great amount of

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.590 
can see it gives a great amount of
coverage<00:05:24.510> it's<00:05:25.350> just<00:05:25.740> that<00:05:26.030> what<00:05:27.030> goes<00:05:27.270> from

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
coverage it's just that what goes from

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.300

supposed to wear off but it does wear

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.420 
supposed to wear off but it does wear
off<00:06:50.530> because<00:06:51.530> I<00:06:51.650> start<00:06:51.920> to<00:06:52.010> see<00:06:52.130> my<00:06:52.250> dark
