potential so let's go ahead and delve a

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.940 
potential so let's go ahead and delve a
little<00:00:32.520> bit<00:00:32.940> deeper<00:00:33.469> Super<00:00:34.469> Stardust<00:00:34.680> Delta

is a dual analog space shooter and what

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.380 
is a dual analog space shooter and what
that<00:00:37.500> means<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.340> your<00:00:38.879> left<00:00:39.000> analog<00:00:39.360> stick

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that means is one your left analog stick

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.680 
that means is one your left analog stick
is<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.930> able<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> move<00:00:40.289> the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
is going to be able to move the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.709 
is going to be able to move the
spaceship<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.020> 360<00:00:43.680> degree<00:00:43.800> angle<00:00:44.309> of

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
spaceship in a 360 degree angle of

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.209 
spaceship in a 360 degree angle of
instantaneously<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:46.949> analog

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
instantaneously and the right analog

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.560 
instantaneously and the right analog
stick<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.609> going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> fire<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.329> any<00:00:48.449> direction

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
stick is going to fire in any direction

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.060 
stick is going to fire in any direction
is<00:00:49.140> insanely<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.980> be

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
is insanely so you don't have to be

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.040 
is insanely so you don't have to be
facing<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.609> way<00:00:50.730> you're<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> fire<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
facing the way you're going to fire you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.200 
facing the way you're going to fire you
can<00:00:52.199> fire<00:00:52.379> behind<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> side<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
can fire behind you to the side and a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.930 
can fire behind you to the side and a
360<00:00:54.809> degree<00:00:54.870> angle<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.680> adds<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.489> lot<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
360 degree angle so it adds a lot of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.479 
360 degree angle so it adds a lot of
different<00:00:57.930> variety<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.500> adds<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.039> lot<00:00:59.160> of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
different variety and adds a lot of

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.220 
different variety and adds a lot of
positioning<00:01:00.210> where<00:01:00.660> positioning<00:01:01.109> becomes

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
positioning where positioning becomes

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.910 
positioning where positioning becomes
very<00:01:01.530> important<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> game<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> first

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
