00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
what this video is going to be about as

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.249 
what this video is going to be about as
elderberries<00:00:11.910> there's<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.630> lot<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.929> people<00:00:13.170> who

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
elderberries there's a lot of people who

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.450 
elderberries there's a lot of people who
think<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.590> elderberry<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.280> most

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
think the elderberry is the most

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.730 
think the elderberry is the most
valuable<00:00:14.700> foraging<00:00:15.630> plant<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.500> woods

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.599 

personally<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.770> think<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.189> most<00:00:20.369> valuable

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
personally I think the most valuable

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.700 
personally I think the most valuable
foraging<00:00:21.570> plant<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.140> woods<00:00:22.320> would<00:00:22.439> be<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
foraging plant in the woods would be the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.009 
foraging plant in the woods would be the
one<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.039> has<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> most<00:00:23.490> edible<00:00:23.820> parts<00:00:24.210> or

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
one that has the most edible parts or

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.019 
one that has the most edible parts or
provides<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> most<00:00:25.830> calories<00:00:26.340> or<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.609> easiest

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
provides the most calories or is easiest

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.310 
provides the most calories or is easiest
to<00:00:27.390> store<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.769> these<00:00:29.250> are<00:00:29.460> none<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.760> that

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
to store and these are none of that

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.740 
to store and these are none of that
but<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> elderberry<00:00:32.009> has<00:00:32.880> more<00:00:33.510> bio

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
but the elderberry has more bio

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.410 
but the elderberry has more bio
flavonoids<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.739> vitamin<00:00:35.370> C<00:00:35.640> than<00:00:36.180> nearly

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
flavonoids and vitamin C than nearly

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.500 
flavonoids and vitamin C than nearly
everything<00:00:36.750> else<00:00:37.350> that's<00:00:37.559> out<00:00:37.829> there<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:39.059> so

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
everything else that's out there and so

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.900 
everything else that's out there and so
a<00:00:39.540> lot<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> people<00:00:39.899> use<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.160> their<00:00:41.430> basis

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
a lot of people use that as their basis

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.270 
a lot of people use that as their basis
you<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.420> people<00:00:42.780> cure<00:00:43.350> sore<00:00:43.620> throats<00:00:44.010> with

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you know people cure sore throats with

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.229 
you know people cure sore throats with
it<00:00:44.460> colds<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.430> for<00:00:47.430> me<00:00:47.520> that's<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.000> big

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
it colds and for me that's not a big

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.299 
it colds and for me that's not a big
issue<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.660> think<00:00:48.870> when<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.739> don't<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.039> food

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
issue I think when you don't have food

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.689 
issue I think when you don't have food
calories<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> big<00:00:51.329> issue<00:00:52.129> but<00:00:53.129> anyways<00:00:53.489> I'm

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
calories is a big issue but anyways I'm

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.680 
calories is a big issue but anyways I'm
gonna<00:00:53.820> tell<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.059> how<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> started<00:00:54.600> these

know<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.300> one<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.140> two<00:00:58.230> batches<00:00:58.770> of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
know it was one or two batches of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.529 
know it was one or two batches of
elderberry<00:00:59.340> wine<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:01.850> I<00:01:02.850> threw<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> dregs

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
elderberry wine and I threw the dregs

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.329 
elderberry wine and I threw the dregs
out<00:01:03.780> there<00:01:04.019> was<00:01:04.110> probably<00:01:04.500> two<00:01:04.769> pounds<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
out there was probably two pounds of

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.010 
out there was probably two pounds of
elderberry<00:01:05.820> seeds<00:01:06.150> they're<00:01:06.390> not<00:01:06.510> two<00:01:06.659> pounds

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
elderberry seeds they're not two pounds

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
elderberry seeds they're not two pounds
two<00:01:07.170> gallons<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.770> elderberry<00:01:08.220> seeds<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.670> threw

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
two gallons of elderberry seeds I threw

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.120 
two gallons of elderberry seeds I threw
out<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.210> along<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.659> brook<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.420> I

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
out all along this brook here and I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.560 
out all along this brook here and I
think<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.369> or<00:01:14.490> two<00:01:14.520> elderberries<00:01:15.150> came<00:01:15.390> up

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
think one or two elderberries came up

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.120 
think one or two elderberries came up
from<00:01:15.689> all<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.229> those<00:01:16.290> seeds<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.860> had<00:01:17.009> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
from all of those seeds and it had to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.499 
from all of those seeds and it had to
been<00:01:17.250> thousands<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.090> seeds<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:20.509> I've

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
been thousands of seeds and I've

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.570 
been thousands of seeds and I've
recently<00:01:21.810> tried<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> plant<00:01:22.680> some<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.130> none<00:01:23.430> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
recently tried to plant some and none of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.480 
recently tried to plant some and none of
them<00:01:23.700> came<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:25.680> I've<00:01:25.770> got<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> feeling<00:01:26.400> that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
them came up so I've got a feeling that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.100 
them came up so I've got a feeling that
this<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:26.970> them<00:01:27.119> plants<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.720> will<00:01:27.900> not

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
this is one of them plants that will not

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.719 
this is one of them plants that will not
sprout<00:01:28.470> unless<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.979> passes<00:01:29.430> through<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
sprout unless it passes through the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.789 
sprout unless it passes through the
digestive<00:01:29.850> tract<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.079> animal<00:01:31.590> it's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
digestive tract of the animal it's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.270 
digestive tract of the animal it's
supposed<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.490> feed<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.560> happened<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.130> my

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
supposed to feed so what happened as my

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.740 
supposed to feed so what happened as my
plants<00:01:35.640> got<00:01:35.759> bigger<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.210> started<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.630> make

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
plants got bigger they started to make

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.300 
plants got bigger they started to make
their<00:01:36.900> own<00:01:36.960> berries<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.740> burden<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.130> come

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
their own berries and burden would come

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.219 
their own berries and burden would come
to<00:01:38.400> eat<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> berries<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> while<00:01:40.020> they're

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
to eat the berries and while they're

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.499 
to eat the berries and while they're
eating<00:01:40.590> they<00:01:40.740> would<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.040> pooping<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
eating they would be pooping and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.700 
eating they would be pooping and
everywhere<00:01:42.930> they<00:01:43.049> pooped<00:01:43.320> an<00:01:43.470> elderberry

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
everywhere they pooped an elderberry

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.450 
everywhere they pooped an elderberry
plant<00:01:44.130> would<00:01:44.250> come<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:46.460> elder
