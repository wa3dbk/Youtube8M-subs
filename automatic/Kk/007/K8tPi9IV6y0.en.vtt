tutorial what I'm gonna be doing is

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.879 
tutorial what I'm gonna be doing is
building<00:00:12.300> off<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.929> today<00:00:13.259> we'll<00:00:13.469> call<00:00:13.710> it

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
building off of this today we'll call it

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.939 
building off of this today we'll call it
hidden<00:00:14.190> door<00:00:14.490> 2.0<00:00:15.389> or<00:00:15.690> hidden<00:00:16.440> door<00:00:16.650> version

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
hidden door 2.0 or hidden door version

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.189 
hidden door 2.0 or hidden door version
two<00:00:17.340> if<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.640> will<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.420> know<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.140> think

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
two if you will you know as is I think

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.320 
two if you will you know as is I think
it's<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> pretty<00:00:19.710> good<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:20.460> design<00:00:20.760> it's<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
it's a pretty good little design it's a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.630 
it's a pretty good little design it's a
it<00:00:22.020> allows<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.470> passage<00:00:22.920> through<00:00:23.220> when<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
it allows you passage through when it

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.000 
it allows you passage through when it
can<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.300> recessed<00:00:24.750> into<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.230> wall<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.769> don't

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
can be recessed into a wall so you don't

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.580 
can be recessed into a wall so you don't
really<00:00:26.160> know<00:00:26.369> what's<00:00:26.550> there<00:00:27.170> one<00:00:28.170> flaw

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
really know what's there one flaw

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.200 
really know what's there one flaw
however<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.460> pointed<00:00:29.730> out<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.910> me<00:00:30.119> in

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
however this was pointed out to me in

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.880 
however this was pointed out to me in
the<00:00:30.300> comments<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.260> saw<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> little<00:00:31.650> bit

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
the comments you just saw a little bit

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.760 
the comments you just saw a little bit
there<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.149> were<00:00:33.300> would<00:00:33.630> say<00:00:33.840> not<00:00:34.079> running

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
there if you were would say not running

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.440 
there if you were would say not running
through<00:00:35.070> at<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.280> sprinting<00:00:35.730> speed<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.329> you're

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
through at a sprinting speed if you're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.790 
through at a sprinting speed if you're
just<00:00:36.600> pausing<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.140> agree<00:00:37.350> when<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.620> get

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
just pausing to agree when you get

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.619 
just pausing to agree when you get
caught<00:00:38.070> well<00:00:38.790> then<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.090> get<00:00:39.210> stuck<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
caught well then you get stuck in the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.819 
caught well then you get stuck in the
middle<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.020> door<00:00:40.170> system<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.739> have

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
middle of your door system and you have

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.209 
middle of your door system and you have
to<00:00:40.920> dig<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.250> way<00:00:41.399> out<00:00:41.610> which<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.629> no<00:00:42.750> good

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
to dig your way out which is no good

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.220 
to dig your way out which is no good
ideally<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.550> would<00:00:44.640> want<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.329> this

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
ideally what you would want is for this

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.190 
ideally what you would want is for this
to<00:00:46.760> keep<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> open<00:00:48.000> until<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:48.870> allowed<00:00:49.050> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to keep it open until you're allowed to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.990 
to keep it open until you're allowed to
pass<00:00:49.379> through<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.430> could<00:00:50.579> close<00:00:50.850> it

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
pass through and then you could close it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.790 
pass through and then you could close it
on<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> other<00:00:51.300> side<00:00:51.390> well<00:00:51.930> that's<00:00:52.530> kind<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
on the other side well that's kind of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.939 
on the other side well that's kind of
difficult<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.640> pressure<00:00:54.570> plates<00:00:54.949> because

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
difficult with pressure plates because

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.920 
difficult with pressure plates because
they<00:00:56.280> only<00:00:56.399> stay<00:00:56.730> open<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.180> one<00:00:57.300> or<00:00:57.420> two<00:00:57.449> ticks

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
they only stay open for one or two ticks

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.770 
they only stay open for one or two ticks
and<00:00:58.079> then<00:00:58.199> they<00:00:58.320> close<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.539> what<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.629> want

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and then they close it so what we want

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.630 
and then they close it so what we want
to<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.020> make<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.350> work<00:01:01.710> essentially<00:01:02.340> like

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
to do is make this work essentially like

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
to do is make this work essentially like
a<00:01:02.789> lever<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.809> step<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
a lever and that you step on the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.560 
a lever and that you step on the
pressure<00:01:04.559> plate<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:05.489> opens<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> door<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.479> it

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
pressure plate it opens the door and it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.140 
pressure plate it opens the door and it
stays<00:01:06.900> open<00:01:07.310> now<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.790> through<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
stays open now we can get through to the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.109 
stays open now we can get through to the
other<00:01:09.270> side<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.869> close<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.970> then

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
other side and close it there and then

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.730 
other side and close it there and then
of<00:01:12.390> course<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.900> opposite<00:01:13.290> would<00:01:13.439> happen<00:01:13.710> you

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
of course the opposite would happen you

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560 
of course the opposite would happen you
step<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.250> again<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.880> would<00:01:14.970> close<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
step on it again and it would close the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.740 
step on it again and it would close the
signal<00:01:15.900> well<00:01:16.590> I've<00:01:17.220> done<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.670> over<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.600> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
signal well I've done it over here I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.820 
signal well I've done it over here I
won't<00:01:19.020> show<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.320> what's<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.740> on

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
won't show you what's going on

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.749 
won't show you what's going on
underneath<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.280> that's<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:20.640> we're

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
underneath because that's what we're

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.359 
underneath because that's what we're
gonna<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:21.140> working<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> tutorial

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
gonna be working on in the tutorial

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.700 
gonna be working on in the tutorial
today<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:24.240> essentially<00:01:25.080> when<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.409> click<00:01:25.590> on

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
today but essentially when you click on

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.609 
today but essentially when you click on
this<00:01:25.909> boom<00:01:26.909> there<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.869> door<00:01:28.020> opens<00:01:28.350> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
this boom there it is the door opens it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.670 
this boom there it is the door opens it
stays<00:01:29.430> open<00:01:29.670> until<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.840> are<00:01:30.930> able<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.320> pass

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
stays open until you are able to pass

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.289 
stays open until you are able to pass
through<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.159> other<00:01:32.280> side<00:01:32.400> step<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.180> this

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
through to the other side step on this

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.020 
through to the other side step on this
pressure<00:01:33.570> plate<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:35.130> opposite<00:01:35.579> reaction

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
pressure plate and the opposite reaction

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.460 
pressure plate and the opposite reaction
happens<00:01:36.420> now<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.900> course<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.350> actually

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
happens now of course you can actually

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.460 
happens now of course you can actually
activate<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.130> from<00:01:38.310> either<00:01:38.490> side<00:01:39.200> works<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
activate this from either side works the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.469 
activate this from either side works the
same<00:01:40.740> because<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.310> all<00:01:41.670> connected<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.390> at

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
same because it's all connected up at

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.359 
same because it's all connected up at
the<00:01:42.540> same<00:01:42.720> mechanism<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> show

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the same mechanism and I'm going to show

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.389 
the same mechanism and I'm going to show
you<00:01:44.460> how<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.470> third

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
you how to do this so I have a third

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.030 
you how to do this so I have a third
platform<00:01:47.729> over<00:01:48.329> here<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> right<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.799> this

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
platform over here to the right and this

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.649 
platform over here to the right and this
is<00:01:50.189> essentially<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> same<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.329> first

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
is essentially the same as the first

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.170 
is essentially the same as the first
design<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.290> an<00:01:52.409> exact<00:01:52.740> clone<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.340> fact<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
design it's an exact clone in fact and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
design it's an exact clone in fact and
we're<00:01:54.299> going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.630> be<00:01:54.750> adding<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:57.210> we'll

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
we're going to be adding the the we'll

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.520 
we're going to be adding the the we'll
call<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.210> fake<00:02:00.210> lever<00:02:00.689> mechanism<00:02:00.930> or

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
call it the fake lever mechanism or

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.260 
call it the fake lever mechanism or
whatever<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.979> want<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.189> call<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:03.180> we're

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
whatever you want to call it but we're

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.480 
whatever you want to call it but we're
going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> make<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.840> pressure<00:02:04.380> plate<00:02:04.649> act<00:02:05.040> as

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
going to make this pressure plate act as

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.819 
going to make this pressure plate act as
lever<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.259> actually<00:02:07.469> not<00:02:07.590> too

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
lever and it's actually not too

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.219 
lever and it's actually not too
complicated<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:09.090> makes<00:02:09.330> use<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.569> some<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
complicated it makes use of some of the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.640 
complicated it makes use of some of the
new<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:11.520> know<00:02:11.640> 1.5<00:02:12.300> redstone<00:02:12.900> updates

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
new you know 1.5 redstone updates

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.130 
new you know 1.5 redstone updates
be<00:02:13.799> using<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.099> little<00:02:14.220> bit<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.549> this<00:02:14.930> block<00:02:15.930> of

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
be using a little bit of this block of

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.830 
be using a little bit of this block of
redstone<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.890> such<00:02:17.269> but<00:02:18.269> let's<00:02:18.450> get<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:18.810> it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
redstone and such but let's get to it

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.259 
redstone and such but let's get to it
what<00:02:19.500> I'm<00:02:19.590> gonna<00:02:19.709> do<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.220> dig<00:02:20.430> underneath<00:02:20.730> here

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
what I'm gonna do is dig underneath here

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.750 
what I'm gonna do is dig underneath here
and<00:02:21.629> we're<00:02:22.140> gonna<00:02:22.260> dig<00:02:22.620> all<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.430> stuff

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
and we're gonna dig all of this stuff

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.470 
and we're gonna dig all of this stuff
out<00:02:24.000> because<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:25.019> are<00:02:25.610> in<00:02:26.610> need<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.269> major

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
out because we are in need of a major

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.929 
out because we are in need of a major
overhaul<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:28.230> make<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.739> all<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.549> what<00:02:29.790> we

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
overhaul to make this all do what we

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.679 
overhaul to make this all do what we
wanted<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.239> do<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:32.030> dig<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.239> out<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.480> little

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
wanted to do so dig this out a little

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.229 
wanted to do so dig this out a little
bit<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:34.530> some<00:02:34.859> working<00:02:35.159> room<00:02:35.189> and<00:02:35.609> we

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
bit we have some working room and we

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.830 
bit we have some working room and we
still<00:02:36.870> need<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:37.439> have<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:38.250> redstone<00:02:39.150> directly

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
still need to have the redstone directly

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.500 
still need to have the redstone directly
underneath<00:02:40.370> here<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.400> let's<00:02:42.000> see<00:02:42.120> one<00:02:42.269> two

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
underneath here so let's see one two

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.399 
underneath here so let's see one two
three<00:02:43.849> okay<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.299> doesn't<00:02:45.750> change<00:02:46.049> we

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
three okay so that doesn't change we

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:47.660 
three okay so that doesn't change we
still<00:02:46.590> need<00:02:46.739> this<00:02:46.859> pressure<00:02:47.099> plate<00:02:47.430> to

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
still need this pressure plate to

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.750 
still need this pressure plate to
activate<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.329> redstone<00:02:49.099> but<00:02:50.099> now<00:02:50.549> what

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
activate this redstone but now what

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.899 
activate this redstone but now what
we're<00:02:50.909> gonna<00:02:50.970> do<00:02:52.280> we're<00:02:53.280> gonna<00:02:53.340> bring<00:02:53.700> this

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
we're gonna do we're gonna bring this

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.990 
we're gonna do we're gonna bring this
out<00:02:54.180> two<00:02:54.989> more<00:02:55.170> blocks<00:02:55.379> here<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:55.859> here<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.220> on

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
out two more blocks here and here and on

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.849 
out two more blocks here and here and on
each<00:02:57.239> side<00:02:58.159> we're<00:02:59.159> gonna<00:02:59.220> place<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.609> torch<00:03:00.859> dig

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
each side we're gonna place a torch dig

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.099 
each side we're gonna place a torch dig
down<00:03:02.099> one<00:03:02.400> block<00:03:02.579> further<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.720> you'll<00:03:03.870> see

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
down one block further and you'll see

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.039 
down one block further and you'll see
why<00:03:05.120> underneath<00:03:06.120> here<00:03:06.359> we're<00:03:06.540> going<00:03:06.689> to<00:03:06.780> place

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
why underneath here we're going to place

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.809 
why underneath here we're going to place
two<00:03:07.560> Pistons<00:03:08.989> one<00:03:09.989> there<00:03:10.370> we're<00:03:11.370> gonna<00:03:11.489> place

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
two Pistons one there we're gonna place

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.059 
two Pistons one there we're gonna place
a<00:03:12.030> block<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.480> redstone<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.349> then<00:03:13.859> place

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
a block of redstone and then place

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.890 
a block of redstone and then place
another<00:03:14.099> piston<00:03:14.730> here<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.450> what<00:03:15.599> these<00:03:15.750> are

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
another piston here and what these are

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.500 
another piston here and what these are
gonna<00:03:16.049> do<00:03:16.319> is<00:03:16.680> sort<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.370> play<00:03:17.639> tug-of-war<00:03:17.940> with

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
gonna do is sort of play tug-of-war with

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.479 
gonna do is sort of play tug-of-war with
this<00:03:18.690> block<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:18.989> redstone<00:03:19.379> so<00:03:19.889> this<00:03:20.099> goes<00:03:20.280> back

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
this block of redstone so this goes back

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.580 
this block of redstone so this goes back
and<00:03:20.699> forth<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.900> reason<00:03:22.139> we're<00:03:22.260> gonna<00:03:22.349> do

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
and forth and the reason we're gonna do

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.960 
and forth and the reason we're gonna do
that<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:22.889> because<00:03:23.010> we<00:03:23.250> want<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.489> when<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:23.849> in

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
that is because we want it when it's in

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.530 
that is because we want it when it's in
this<00:03:24.060> position<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.930> power<00:03:25.230> this<00:03:26.190> redstone

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
this position to power this redstone

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.920 
this position to power this redstone
here<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:29.489> you'll<00:03:30.000> see<00:03:30.269> when<00:03:30.480> we<00:03:30.599> come<00:03:30.750> back<00:03:30.870> up

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
here so you'll see when we come back up

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.119 
here so you'll see when we come back up
here<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.560> we<00:03:32.010> press<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.549> this<00:03:33.859> now<00:03:34.859> that

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
here and we press on this now that

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.960 
here and we press on this now that
redstone<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.730> powered<00:03:36.150> off<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:37.049> stays<00:03:37.500> off

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
redstone is powered off and it stays off

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.360 
redstone is powered off and it stays off
until<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.090> hit<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.449> pressure<00:03:39.780> plate<00:03:40.019> again

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
until you hit this pressure plate again

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.899 
until you hit this pressure plate again
and<00:03:42.019> then<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:43.139> goes<00:03:43.290> on<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:44.250> stays<00:03:44.549> on<00:03:44.729> well

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
and then it goes on and it stays on well

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.819 
and then it goes on and it stays on well
that's<00:03:45.000> exactly<00:03:45.239> what<00:03:45.720> we<00:03:45.959> want<00:03:46.169> you'll<00:03:46.680> see

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
that's exactly what we want you'll see

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.379 
that's exactly what we want you'll see
it's<00:03:46.979> not<00:03:47.010> actually<00:03:47.220> do<00:03:47.579> anything<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.269> the

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
it's not actually do anything to the

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.000 
it's not actually do anything to the
door<00:03:48.629> yet<00:03:48.870> because<00:03:49.260> we<00:03:49.409> haven't<00:03:49.560> hooked<00:03:49.799> it

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
door yet because we haven't hooked it

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.530 
door yet because we haven't hooked it
all<00:03:50.099> up<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.819> that's<00:03:50.940> what<00:03:51.090> we're<00:03:51.209> gonna<00:03:51.329> do

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
all up and that's what we're gonna do

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.309 
all up and that's what we're gonna do
now<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:52.079> let's<00:03:52.229> go<00:03:52.409> back<00:03:52.440> under<00:03:52.919> here<00:03:53.129> and

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
now so let's go back under here and

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.349 
now so let's go back under here and
that's<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.440> little<00:03:55.620> bit<00:03:55.790> tricky<00:03:56.790> hopefully<00:03:57.329> I

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
that's a little bit tricky hopefully I

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.770 
that's a little bit tricky hopefully I
can<00:03:57.479> get<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:58.019> right<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.949> first<00:03:58.979> time

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
can get this right the first time

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.319 
can get this right the first time
probably<00:04:01.620> not<00:04:01.769> but<00:04:01.979> let's<00:04:02.190> see<00:04:02.340> let's<00:04:03.060> take

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
probably not but let's see let's take

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.780 
probably not but let's see let's take
this<00:04:03.510> out<00:04:04.099> we're<00:04:05.099> gonna<00:04:05.159> change<00:04:05.609> the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
this out we're gonna change the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.490 
this out we're gonna change the
orientation<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:06.510> all<00:04:06.659> this<00:04:06.780> stuff<00:04:07.079> a<00:04:07.260> little

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
orientation of all this stuff a little

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.920 
orientation of all this stuff a little
bit<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:08.310> we're<00:04:08.549> going<00:04:08.699> to<00:04:08.790> have<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.599> come

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
bit so we're going to have this come

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.810 
bit so we're going to have this come
like<00:04:10.109> this<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:11.359> down<00:04:14.900> okay<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:17.190> connect<00:04:17.639> up

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
like this and down okay to connect up

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.170 
like this and down okay to connect up
there<00:04:18.919> perfect<00:04:19.919> and<00:04:20.639> then<00:04:20.789> we<00:04:20.880> need<00:04:21.000> to

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
there perfect and then we need to

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.540 
there perfect and then we need to
connect<00:04:21.539> this<00:04:21.750> one<00:04:21.810> as<00:04:22.260> well<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.979> remember

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
connect this one as well and remember

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.420 
connect this one as well and remember
this<00:04:23.729> one<00:04:23.969> gets<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.740> repeater<00:04:25.740> with<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.190> full

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
this one gets the repeater with the full

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.000 
this one gets the repeater with the full
ticks

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
ticks

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.920 
ticks
that<00:04:27.070> way<00:04:27.190> everything<00:04:27.460> works<00:04:28.240> at<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.750> same

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
that way everything works at the same

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.800 
that way everything works at the same
speed<00:04:29.670> so<00:04:30.670> to<00:04:30.730> do<00:04:31.360> that<00:04:32.970> let's<00:04:33.970> go<00:04:34.210> ahead<00:04:34.360> and

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
speed so to do that let's go ahead and

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.520 
speed so to do that let's go ahead and
run<00:04:35.200> that<00:04:36.660> this<00:04:37.660> way<00:04:38.940> so<00:04:39.940> we<00:04:40.480> will<00:04:40.600> do<00:04:40.720> that<00:04:40.930> hey

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
run that this way so we will do that hey

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.460 
run that this way so we will do that hey
repeater<00:04:42.160> full<00:04:42.820> ticks<00:04:43.120> we're<00:04:43.990> gonna<00:04:44.080> power<00:04:44.320> it

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
repeater full ticks we're gonna power it

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.960 
repeater full ticks we're gonna power it
with<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.740> torch<00:04:45.160> so<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.520> needs<00:04:45.700> to<00:04:45.760> be<00:04:45.850> in<00:04:45.910> the

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
with a torch so that needs to be in the

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.120 
with a torch so that needs to be in the
off<00:04:46.090> position<00:04:46.330> right<00:04:46.720> now<00:04:46.870> there<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:47.950> go

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
off position right now there you go

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.590 
off position right now there you go
because<00:04:48.400> if<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.610> remember<00:04:48.730> when<00:04:49.480> you're

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
because if you remember when you're

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.020 
because if you remember when you're
carrying<00:04:49.870> power<00:04:50.230> up<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:50.830> red<00:04:51.010> stones<00:04:51.340> reverse

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
carrying power up the red stones reverse

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.780 
carrying power up the red stones reverse
each<00:04:52.540> level<00:04:52.810> so<00:04:53.020> redstone<00:04:53.350> torches<00:04:53.710> on<00:04:53.890> this

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
each level so redstone torches on this

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.430 
each level so redstone torches on this
one<00:04:55.000> is<00:04:55.120> off<00:04:55.270> if<00:04:55.600> you<00:04:55.720> were<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.930> do<00:04:56.050> next<00:04:56.230> one

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
one is off if you were to do next one

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.190 
one is off if you were to do next one
above<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:56.830> it<00:04:57.040> would<00:04:57.190> be<00:04:57.310> on<00:04:57.460> again<00:04:57.760> okay<00:04:58.540> so

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
above it it would be on again okay so

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.380 
above it it would be on again okay so
the<00:04:59.800> final<00:05:00.040> thing<00:05:00.310> we<00:05:00.400> need<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.640> do<00:05:00.760> is<00:05:00.970> connect

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
the final thing we need to do is connect

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.750 
the final thing we need to do is connect
our<00:05:01.600> closing<00:05:02.020> switch<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.890> other<00:05:03.010> side<00:05:03.340> and

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
our closing switch on the other side and

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.600 
our closing switch on the other side and
what<00:05:04.000> we<00:05:04.180> can<00:05:04.330> do<00:05:04.510> here<00:05:04.780> is<00:05:04.960> simply<00:05:05.350> just<00:05:05.800> bring

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
what we can do here is simply just bring

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.920 
what we can do here is simply just bring
a<00:05:06.700> bridge<00:05:06.940> across<00:05:07.170> and<00:05:09.000> link<00:05:10.000> up<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.420> Redstone

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
a bridge across and link up the Redstone

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:11.820 
a bridge across and link up the Redstone
to<00:05:11.110> all<00:05:11.260> of<00:05:11.440> this

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
to all of this

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:19.280 
to all of this
so<00:05:12.160> now<00:05:12.540> theoretically<00:05:16.860> yeah<00:05:17.860> there<00:05:18.130> you<00:05:18.250> go

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
so now theoretically yeah there you go

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.440 
so now theoretically yeah there you go
so<00:05:20.290> you<00:05:20.380> see<00:05:20.560> it<00:05:20.650> stays<00:05:20.950> open<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:21.700> that<00:05:22.330> will

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
so you see it stays open and that will

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.120 
so you see it stays open and that will
allow<00:05:22.630> you<00:05:22.690> plenty<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:23.080> time<00:05:23.350> to<00:05:23.380> pass<00:05:23.770> through

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
allow you plenty of time to pass through

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.300 
allow you plenty of time to pass through
here<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.490> when<00:05:24.670> you<00:05:24.730> hit<00:05:24.880> this<00:05:25.060> switch<00:05:26.310> it

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
here and when you hit this switch it

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.310 
here and when you hit this switch it
closes<00:05:27.820> it<00:05:27.940> all<00:05:28.060> up<00:05:28.240> now<00:05:28.810> of<00:05:28.930> course<00:05:29.110> the

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
closes it all up now of course the

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.050 
closes it all up now of course the
mechanism<00:05:29.770> works<00:05:29.950> the<00:05:30.100> same<00:05:30.310> from<00:05:30.550> both<00:05:30.730> sides

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
mechanism works the same from both sides

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.610 
mechanism works the same from both sides
because<00:05:31.450> it's<00:05:31.660> all<00:05:31.810> hooked<00:05:32.020> up<00:05:32.140> at<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.410> same

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
because it's all hooked up at the same

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.820 
because it's all hooked up at the same
place<00:05:33.150> but<00:05:34.150> there<00:05:34.450> you<00:05:34.540> go<00:05:34.600> these<00:05:35.050> pressure

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
place but there you go these pressure

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.050 
place but there you go these pressure
plates<00:05:36.160> are<00:05:36.340> now<00:05:36.490> acting<00:05:37.060> as<00:05:37.390> as<00:05:38.080> lovers<00:05:39.070> and<00:05:39.820> I

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
plates are now acting as as lovers and I

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.340 
plates are now acting as as lovers and I
know<00:05:40.150> that<00:05:40.300> might<00:05:40.420> have<00:05:40.810> been<00:05:40.960> a<00:05:41.020> little<00:05:41.170> bit

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
know that might have been a little bit

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.960 
know that might have been a little bit
confusing<00:05:41.770> since<00:05:42.100> I<00:05:42.190> was<00:05:42.310> digging<00:05:42.670> underneath

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
confusing since I was digging underneath

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.190 
confusing since I was digging underneath
there<00:05:43.300> so<00:05:43.420> let<00:05:43.540> me<00:05:43.600> just<00:05:43.750> kind<00:05:43.840> of<00:05:43.930> show<00:05:43.990> you

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
there so let me just kind of show you

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.130 
there so let me just kind of show you
what<00:05:44.320> was<00:05:44.560> going<00:05:44.800> on<00:05:44.920> there<00:05:45.220> above-ground

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
what was going on there above-ground

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.690 
what was going on there above-ground
this<00:05:47.140> system<00:05:47.380> is<00:05:47.470> actually<00:05:47.560> very<00:05:47.890> easy<00:05:48.040> you

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
this system is actually very easy you

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.560 
this system is actually very easy you
can<00:05:48.730> simply<00:05:49.300> place<00:05:49.980> actually<00:05:51.330> place<00:05:52.330> a

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
can simply place actually place a

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.160 
can simply place actually place a
redstone<00:05:52.960> block<00:05:53.410> there<00:05:54.360> brick<00:05:55.360> here<00:05:55.660> here<00:05:56.020> and

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170 
redstone block there brick here here and

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.990 
redstone block there brick here here and
here<00:05:56.610> okay<00:05:57.610> so<00:05:59.040> remember<00:06:00.040> we<00:06:00.460> have<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:00.730> torch

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
here okay so remember we have the torch

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.740 
here okay so remember we have the torch
on<00:06:01.150> each<00:06:01.390> side<00:06:01.690> of<00:06:01.720> this<00:06:03.090> there<00:06:04.090> is<00:06:04.120> redstone

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
on each side of this there is redstone

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.250 
on each side of this there is redstone
on<00:06:05.050> top<00:06:05.320> of<00:06:05.500> these<00:06:05.710> blocks<00:06:06.900> redstone<00:06:07.900> coming

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
on top of these blocks redstone coming

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.820 
on top of these blocks redstone coming
from<00:06:08.380> here<00:06:08.740> and<00:06:08.920> then<00:06:09.790> we<00:06:09.970> have<00:06:10.180> a<00:06:10.830> piston

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
from here and then we have a piston

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.550 
from here and then we have a piston
there<00:06:12.100> and<00:06:12.700> a<00:06:13.030> piston<00:06:13.540> there<00:06:14.020> so<00:06:14.320> these

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
there and a piston there so these

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.590 
there and a piston there so these
torches<00:06:15.100> are<00:06:15.370> powering<00:06:15.730> the<00:06:15.940> Pistons<00:06:16.390> and

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
torches are powering the Pistons and

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.460 
torches are powering the Pistons and
this<00:06:17.440> is<00:06:17.620> where<00:06:17.830> we<00:06:18.010> want<00:06:18.250> the<00:06:18.990> signal<00:06:19.990> to<00:06:20.350> go

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
this is where we want the signal to go

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.960 
this is where we want the signal to go
to<00:06:20.530> so<00:06:20.860> right<00:06:20.950> now<00:06:21.100> that<00:06:21.280> signal<00:06:21.640> is<00:06:21.730> in<00:06:21.850> the

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
to so right now that signal is in the

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.390 
to so right now that signal is in the
off<00:06:22.120> position<00:06:22.450> if<00:06:22.930> we<00:06:23.440> have<00:06:23.860> our<00:06:24.040> pressure

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
off position if we have our pressure

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.830 
off position if we have our pressure
plate<00:06:24.760> above<00:06:25.090> it

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.170 

there<00:06:31.410> you<00:06:31.530> go<00:06:34.310> so<00:06:35.310> there<00:06:35.430> you<00:06:35.460> have<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:35.730> there

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
there you go so there you have it there

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.659 
there you go so there you have it there
is<00:06:36.210> the<00:06:36.540> I<00:06:37.199> don't<00:06:38.010> know<00:06:38.130> what<00:06:38.280> you<00:06:38.400> would<00:06:38.460> call

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
is the I don't know what you would call

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.420 
is the I don't know what you would call
us<00:06:38.910> we'll<00:06:39.570> just<00:06:39.780> say<00:06:39.990> that<00:06:40.020> the<00:06:40.590> pressure

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
us we'll just say that the pressure

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.270 
us we'll just say that the pressure
plate<00:06:41.729> is<00:06:41.850> acting<00:06:42.180> as<00:06:42.300> a<00:06:42.330> lever<00:06:42.570> now<00:06:42.810> so<00:06:43.280> that

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
plate is acting as a lever now so that

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.159 
plate is acting as a lever now so that
is<00:06:44.430> how<00:06:44.520> you<00:06:44.550> can<00:06:44.760> make<00:06:44.880> your<00:06:45.000> door<00:06:45.240> stay<00:06:45.780> open

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169 
is how you can make your door stay open

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.730 
is how you can make your door stay open
and<00:06:46.590> your<00:06:46.949> door<00:06:47.100> stay<00:06:47.580> closed<00:06:48.350> till<00:06:49.350> next<00:06:49.500> time

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
and your door stay closed till next time

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.650 
and your door stay closed till next time
this<00:06:49.800> is<00:06:50.010> apprentice<00:06:50.460> 8<00:06:50.580> thank<00:06:51.240> you<00:06:51.389> for

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 
this is apprentice 8 thank you for

00:06:51.660 --> 00:07:05.760 
this is apprentice 8 thank you for
stopping<00:06:51.840> by

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.110 

and<00:07:06.250> I<00:07:07.240> should<00:07:07.509> really<00:07:07.949> figure<00:07:08.949> out<00:07:09.130> a<00:07:09.190> good

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
and I should really figure out a good

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.409 
and I should really figure out a good
pathway<00:07:10.599> up<00:07:11.139> here<00:07:11.729> well<00:07:12.729> if<00:07:12.849> I'm<00:07:12.940> on<00:07:13.060> this<00:07:13.210> side

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:13.419 
pathway up here well if I'm on this side

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:16.470 
pathway up here well if I'm on this side
I'll<00:07:13.599> just<00:07:13.750> go<00:07:13.930> up<00:07:14.110> the
