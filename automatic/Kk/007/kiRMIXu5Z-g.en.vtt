00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
you do seventy percent let's say that

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.979 
you do seventy percent let's say that
you<00:02:25.070> have<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.329> green<00:02:26.329> smoothie<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.900> morning

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
you have a green smoothie in the morning

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.349 
you have a green smoothie in the morning
and<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.530> salad<00:02:27.739> for<00:02:28.070> lunch<00:02:28.100> you're<00:02:28.940> seventy

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
and a salad for lunch you're seventy

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.509 
and a salad for lunch you're seventy
percent<00:02:29.510> raw<00:02:29.900> that's<00:02:30.320> good<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.950> whatever<00:02:31.400> you

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
percent raw that's good and whatever you

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.430 
percent raw that's good and whatever you
want<00:02:31.760> cooked<00:02:32.060> for<00:02:32.269> dinner<00:02:32.299> eventually<00:02:33.200> your

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
want cooked for dinner eventually your

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.670 
want cooked for dinner eventually your
body<00:02:33.470> will<00:02:34.130> guide<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:36.049> making<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.470> best

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
body will guide you to making the best

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.229 
body will guide you to making the best
choice<00:02:36.890> possible<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:37.910> it's<00:02:38.030> not<00:02:38.180> really

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
choice possible so it's not really

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.509 
choice possible so it's not really
academic<00:02:39.079> for<00:02:39.290> me<00:02:39.380> ever<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.739> don't<00:02:39.890> think<00:02:40.160> I

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
academic for me ever I don't think I

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.610 
academic for me ever I don't think I
don't<00:02:40.820> make<00:02:41.060> myself<00:02:41.329> do<00:02:41.690> anything<00:02:42.079> I<00:02:42.230> simply

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
don't make myself do anything I simply

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.740 
don't make myself do anything I simply
do<00:02:42.829> it<00:02:42.980> because<00:02:43.250> it's<00:02:43.430> what<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:43.850> gravitate

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
do it because it's what I gravitate

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.630 
do it because it's what I gravitate
towards<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:45.890> your<00:02:46.220> own<00:02:46.400> natural

towards and so your own natural
evolution

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660
