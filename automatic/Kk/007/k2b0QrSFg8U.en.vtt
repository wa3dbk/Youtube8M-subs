make lemonade what I'm going to do is
just<00:02:34.510> let<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.140> bottle<00:02:35.470> here<00:02:35.680> and

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
just let this in the bottle here and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.180 
just let this in the bottle here and
it'll<00:02:36.310> be<00:02:36.400> queen<00:02:36.760> lord<00:02:37.000> but<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.829> need<00:02:39.040> to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
it'll be queen lord but you need to

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.150 
it'll be queen lord but you need to
check<00:02:39.459> your<00:02:39.640> hive<00:02:40.230> look<00:02:41.230> for<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.650> damage<00:02:42.010> on

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
check your hive look for the damage on

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.819 
check your hive look for the damage on
the<00:02:42.280> wings<00:02:42.519> or<00:02:43.209> you<00:02:43.569> start<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.049> seek<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.530> wing

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
the wings or you start to seek a wing

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.150 
the wings or you start to seek a wing
then<00:02:45.250> start<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.640> treat<00:02:46.379> we<00:02:47.379> do<00:02:47.620> treatment

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
then start the treat we do treatment

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.220 
then start the treat we do treatment
here<00:02:48.489> when<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:48.970> students<00:02:49.360> come<00:02:49.599> and<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:49.989> teach

here when the students come and I teach
them<00:02:50.379> different<00:02:50.769> ways<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:51.129> treat<00:02:51.390> but<00:02:52.390> I'm

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
them different ways to treat but I'm

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.319 
them different ways to treat but I'm
saying<00:02:53.590> again<00:02:53.980> none<00:02:54.340> behaves<00:02:54.670> been<00:02:54.970> treated

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
saying again none behaves been treated

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.170
