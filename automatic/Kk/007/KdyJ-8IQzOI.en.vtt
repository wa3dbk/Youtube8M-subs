00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
five or six difference makers but the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.560 
five or six difference makers but the
way<00:02:04.400> he's<00:02:04.580> playing<00:02:04.790> right<00:02:04.970> now<00:02:05.030> all<00:02:05.240> right<00:02:05.450> now

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
way he's playing right now all right now

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.840 
way he's playing right now all right now
he's<00:02:05.840> de<00:02:06.080> is<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.500> difference<00:02:06.920> against<00:02:07.580> every

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
he's de is the difference against every

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.749 
he's de is the difference against every
team<00:02:08.119> he's<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.679> is<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.830> best<00:02:10.039> player<00:02:10.220> in<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.369> HR

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
team he's I is the best player in the HR

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.729 
team he's I is the best player in the HR
right<00:02:10.970> now<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.180> way<00:02:11.420> he's<00:02:11.570> playing<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.080> no<00:02:12.709> I

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
right now the way he's playing and no I

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.020 
right now the way he's playing and no I
think<00:02:12.890> he<00:02:13.130> makes<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.400> difference<00:02:13.700> every<00:02:13.820> game

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
think he makes a difference every game

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.430 
think he makes a difference every game
