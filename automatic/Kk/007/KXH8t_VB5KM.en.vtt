00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.090
 you my makeup bases 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.500
 I hope you like it and we are going to 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.329
 start with the video I will be 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.629
 telling them that people who have 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:14.669
 Oily skin I recommend the bases 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.619
 of powder makeup and people 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.869
 who they have dry skin I recommend 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.939
 the foundation of makeup and I want them today 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.310
 I'm going to talk about the things with which 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.289
 apply makeup makeup on 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.109
 powder is applied with this brush 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.060
 It's like a big one or you can also 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.030
 use with this but this is very much 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.769
 better for that and for the bases of 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.590
 liquid makeup can use a 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.829
 leander grip or a brush of these 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.600
 are plants and synthetics can also 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.239
 use one like these that have like 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.339
 fibers and they serve a lot to blur 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.690
 super good of good and now if I'm going to 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.059
 tell what are my bases of 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.070
 favorite makeup I'll start with 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.229
 my favorite of the world world that is 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.479
 This is Giorgio Armani is the one who 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.220
 cost more expensive but is the one that used 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.140
 as on special occasions or in 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.860
 places that I want to see very 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.390
 presentable and it costs 72 dollars not 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.040
 I'm very sure so you can leave them 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.380
 all prices and links of each 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.050
 one of the phases this leaves super skin 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.700
 pretty and covers all the imperfections 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.070
 Today I'm going to talk about this base 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.480
 makeup that is called high definition 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.190
 foundation and that micro forever 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.140
 this is perfect for the days in 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.150
 that we want to take pictures or something 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.520
 because this foundation does not have 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.550
 sunscreen and that makes us not 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.110
 let's see white in the term a camera and 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.270
 also this one covers super well 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.740
 imperfections and I recommend it very much 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.840
 is now going to talk about this that 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.510
 llama no foundation foundation and is from 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.490
 pericon in you and this I recommend it 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.140
 much like for the school or for the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.500
 daily when we do not want to see each other 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.420
 produced but if we want to see 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.460
 presentable this makeup base I 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.100
 I could buy it with a vision because 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.260
 it does not have as much coverage but if we 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.180
 help a little bit I also have this from 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.090
 to be called amazonÃ­a in clayton 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.770
 power covers foundations and this is what 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.480
 I highly recommend it whenever I bring 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.490
 this makeup base they ask me and 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.020
 which one I bring and what I have 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.750
 realized is that this base is a 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.670
 a lot of time the truth or hard 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.100
 until at night and if you put it on the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.390
 tomorrow I recommend it a lot 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.550
 I also want to talk about this basis 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.980
 of makeup that is of candle earth and is 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.860
 mineral this I got it in a 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.900
 mall in usa and I'm going to 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.190
 try to find them from the link I hope that 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.260
 sell it online so that the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.570
 can get and the tone that I have 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.810
 is 6 this base also covers 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.020
 imperfections super good and it makes see the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.700
 super natural skin because it is powder and 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.800
 remember these makeup foundations in 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.560
 dust I recommend it to people 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.720
 they have oily skin and the last one is 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.730
 is copper what I have a 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.440
 color a little darker than my skin 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.900
 and I like to use it during 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.000
 summer and this leaves me super matte face 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.980
 It also covers all inaccuracies 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.270
 super good and the best of this base 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.730
 makeup is that we can get it 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.040
 in the super in the pharmacy does not know super 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.870
 easy to get it and this was all for 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.060

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.190
