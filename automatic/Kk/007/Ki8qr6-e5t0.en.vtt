okay anyway the fragment is used to make
this<00:02:17.219> core<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:18.329> we'll<00:02:18.540> come<00:02:18.719> to<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:18.930> later

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
this core but we'll come to that later

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.830 
this core but we'll come to that later
so<00:02:19.799> first<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.760> first<00:02:21.060> item<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.659> need

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
so first the first item that you need

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.020 
so first the first item that you need
for<00:02:22.319> this<00:02:22.409> mod<00:02:22.739> in<00:02:23.099> order<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.459> make<00:02:23.609> the<00:02:23.760> Iron

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
for this mod in order to make the Iron

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.110 
for this mod in order to make the Iron
Man<00:02:24.180> armor<00:02:24.299> is<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.920> armor<00:02:26.340> plate<00:02:26.609> and<00:02:27.000> you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
Man armor is this armor plate and you

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.289 
Man armor is this armor plate and you
made<00:02:27.299> it<00:02:27.480> by<00:02:28.019> doing<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:28.920> recipe<00:02:29.760> iron

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
made it by doing this recipe iron

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.220 
made it by doing this recipe iron
against<00:02:30.599> gold<00:02:30.840> bars<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.500> titanium<00:02:32.489> titanium

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
against gold bars and titanium titanium

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.890 
against gold bars and titanium titanium
ingots<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.879> yeah<00:02:35.879> does<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.209> usual<00:02:36.480> recipes

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
ingots and yeah does the usual recipes

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.690 
ingots and yeah does the usual recipes
with<00:02:37.049> armor<00:02:37.319> plate<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.739> get<00:02:37.889> shoe<00:02:38.250> shells

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
with armor plate and you get shoe shells

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.599 
with armor plate and you get shoe shells
bands<00:02:39.389> shells<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.139> soot<00:02:40.709> shells<00:02:41.069> helmet

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
bands shells and soot shells helmet

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.300 
bands shells and soot shells helmet
shells<00:02:41.909> and<00:02:42.569> now<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.840> use<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.500> suit<00:02:43.859> shell

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
shells and now you use the suit shell

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.199 
shells and now you use the suit shell
with<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.239> arc<00:02:45.870> reactor<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.950> with<00:02:47.129> a

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
with a arc reactor and with a

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.879 
with a arc reactor and with a
electronics<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.450> make<00:02:48.629> the<00:02:48.810> power<00:02:49.049> suit<00:02:49.349> now

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
electronics to make the power suit now

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.500 
electronics to make the power suit now
let's<00:02:50.099> go<00:02:50.250> over<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.519> arc<00:02:50.730> reactor<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
let's go over the arc reactor and the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.379 
let's go over the arc reactor and the
electronics<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.760> our<00:02:53.760> corrector<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.239> pretty

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
electronics and our corrector is pretty

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.420 
electronics and our corrector is pretty
much<00:02:54.510> our<00:02:54.840> men's<00:02:55.079> hearts<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.769> ever<00:02:55.980> watch<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
much our men's hearts if ever watch the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.159 
much our men's hearts if ever watch the
movie<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.329> how<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.510> make<00:02:57.720> one<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.079> those

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
movie this is how you make one of those

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.280 
movie this is how you make one of those
arc<00:02:58.469> reactors<00:02:59.040> by<00:03:00.000> putting<00:03:00.419> two<00:03:00.450> electronics

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
arc reactors by putting two electronics

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.280 
arc reactors by putting two electronics
like<00:03:01.439> those<00:03:01.680> diamonds<00:03:02.090> vibranium<00:03:03.090> core<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.019> I

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
like those diamonds vibranium core and I

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.170 
like those diamonds vibranium core and I
showed<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.650> how<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.769> make<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.250> they<00:03:05.849> can<00:03:06.090> you

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
showed you how to make that they can you

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.789 
showed you how to make that they can you
make<00:03:06.329> it<00:03:06.359> that<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.659> get<00:03:06.780> by<00:03:07.169> smelting<00:03:07.560> the

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
make it that you get by smelting the

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.970 
make it that you get by smelting the
titanium<00:03:08.430> ore<00:03:09.139> and<00:03:10.139> you'll<00:03:10.409> get<00:03:10.560> one<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:10.859> those

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
titanium ore and you'll get one of those

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.679 
titanium ore and you'll get one of those
arc<00:03:11.310> reactors<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.909> you<00:03:12.000> make<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
arc reactors and you make the

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.319 
arc reactors and you make the
electronics<00:03:13.439> like<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:14.159> I<00:03:14.519> don't<00:03:15.120> want<00:03:15.239> to

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
electronics like this I don't want to

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.899 
electronics like this I don't want to
always<00:03:15.599> say<00:03:16.139> like<00:03:16.290> but<00:03:16.620> rested<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.099> bit<00:03:17.129> up<00:03:17.400> puts

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
always say like but rested a bit up puts

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.379 
always say like but rested a bit up puts
IRA<00:03:18.569> and<00:03:19.169> so<00:03:19.590> on<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:20.310> can<00:03:20.579> see<00:03:20.819> what<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> gradual

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
IRA and so on you can see what a gradual

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.259 
IRA and so on you can see what a gradual
happy<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:22.069> now<00:03:23.069> you<00:03:23.129> need<00:03:23.340> Rockets<00:03:23.849> you<00:03:24.090> make

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
happy is now you need Rockets you make

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.689 
happy is now you need Rockets you make
rockets<00:03:24.750> by<00:03:24.930> using<00:03:25.169> this<00:03:25.470> recipe<00:03:26.040> with<00:03:26.190> TNT

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
rockets by using this recipe with TNT

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:32.449 
rockets by using this recipe with TNT
iron<00:03:26.849> bars<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:28.400> armor<00:03:29.400> plates<00:03:30.919> so<00:03:31.919> that's

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
iron bars and armor plates so that's

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.589 
iron bars and armor plates so that's
pretty<00:03:32.939> much<00:03:33.799> most<00:03:34.799> of<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.669> crafting<00:03:36.060> recipes

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
pretty much most of the crafting recipes

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.289 
pretty much most of the crafting recipes
and<00:03:36.870> now<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:37.919> curve<00:03:38.310> dress<00:03:38.519> before<00:03:38.729> the<00:03:38.909> armor

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
and now the curve dress before the armor

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.469 
and now the curve dress before the armor
should<00:03:39.479> be<00:03:39.659> on<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.810> screen<00:03:40.139> I<00:03:41.150> wanted<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.269> keep

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
should be on the screen I wanted to keep

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:46.039 
should be on the screen I wanted to keep
this<00:03:42.720> jest<00:03:43.139> only<00:03:43.680> for<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:45.209> armor<00:03:45.629> now<00:03:45.840> let's

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
this jest only for the armor now let's

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.990 
this jest only for the armor now let's
shift<00:03:46.620> click<00:03:46.889> it<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.159> and<00:03:48.859> now<00:03:49.859> you<00:03:50.729> have

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
shift click it on and now you have

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.610 
shift click it on and now you have
superpowers<00:03:52.669> yeah<00:03:53.669> I'm<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.269> herobrine<00:03:54.900> iron

fast I can jump fastest fuck I can fly

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.309 
fast I can jump fastest fuck I can fly
and<00:04:07.530> now<00:04:07.769> it's<00:04:08.759> impressive<00:04:09.359> part<00:04:09.599> to<00:04:10.019> decide

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
and now it's impressive part to decide

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.920 
and now it's impressive part to decide
the<00:04:11.129> particles<00:04:11.639> when<00:04:11.790> I'm<00:04:11.879> fly<00:04:12.120> me<00:04:12.449> and<00:04:12.870> I

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
the particles when I'm fly me and I

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.050 
the particles when I'm fly me and I
shouldn't<00:04:13.199> be<00:04:13.290> taking<00:04:13.620> fall<00:04:13.859> damage<00:04:14.250> nope<00:04:14.849> I

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
shouldn't be taking fall damage nope I

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.120 
shouldn't be taking fall damage nope I
am<00:04:15.239> NOT<00:04:15.359> taking<00:04:15.599> fall<00:04:15.959> damage<00:04:16.259> when<00:04:16.829> it<00:04:16.859> gets

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
am NOT taking fall damage when it gets

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.689 
am NOT taking fall damage when it gets
