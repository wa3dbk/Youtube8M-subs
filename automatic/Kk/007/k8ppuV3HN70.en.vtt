00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.790
 the basic place of joÃ«l veltman at 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.170
 Young Ajax against Telstar meant for 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.490
 the defender his first minutes of play 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.500
 of the new season 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.270
 The defenders returned after the World Cup 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.830
 only returned last week last month 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.260
 at ajax 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.779
 Now first 45 minutes again after the World Cup 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.029
 Hall went for my feeling okay 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.699
 conditionally good and I think so too 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.650
 game no worthier I had the idea that 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.270
 you it seemed like you were not gone 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.130
 I had a counter 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.480
 no he himself wants it either way I 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.340
 ten, however, wanted to play something for 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.309
 but yes that is a bit of the procedure 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.129
 of if you have n't played for a while 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.180
 it back after the wk how much did you like 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.789
 yes first wk and yes third 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.129
 I was thinking, and a beautiful performance 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.780
 but for me it was really a lot 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.850
 learn and of course once you get there 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.649
 because of course I also started here 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.320
 like to erase from telstar 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.280
 do it at home and therefore not a backup one 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.929
 and once you get there and want to 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.269
 like to play but I think so 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.410
 a lot of learning moments were for me 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.060
 nothing to do with my against Arjen Robben 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.759
 and from persie yes then you learn anyway 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.710
 so much to me everything very educational 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.630
 I made your first minutes again 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.460
 he already wanted to play a lot more what's up 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.040
 now the process for you 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.729
 well the procedures are more like that one 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.869
 after 45 minutes 75 so play than 90 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.180
 but yes it depends on the trainer me 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.829
 mean if he puts me in it makes me 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.530
 once again your best of course for that 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.479
 90 to play 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.860
 but take the trainer's influence from the farmer 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.439
 to yes yes I mean frank the farmer 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.390
 for the coming weekend 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.920
 I just assume my dyslexia again 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.170
 yes that is also I wait and see 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.630
 mean maybe you are leaving 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.100
 misses only at the age of 75 games or 90 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.130
 before he comes again so off 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.680
 wait and light called trainer happy 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.570
 that the linking of you is also off again 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.399

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.770
