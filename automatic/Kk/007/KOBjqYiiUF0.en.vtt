00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
lubrication and service trailer was once

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.620 
lubrication and service trailer was once
owned<00:00:07.680> by<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.890> United<00:00:08.460> States<00:00:08.519> Marine<00:00:09.450> Corps

owned by the United States Marine Corps

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.610 
owned by the United States Marine Corps
and<00:00:10.550> these<00:00:11.550> were<00:00:11.759> pulled<00:00:12.030> behind<00:00:12.410> trucks<00:00:13.410> like

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
and these were pulled behind trucks like

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.609 
and these were pulled behind trucks like
this<00:00:13.830> too<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.509> the<00:00:15.509> field<00:00:15.780> service<00:00:16.260> all<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
this too in the field service all the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.670 
this too in the field service all the
military<00:00:17.010> vehicles<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:18.170> needed<00:00:19.170> grease<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
military vehicles that needed grease and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.670 
military vehicles that needed grease and
oil<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.300> gear<00:00:21.300> oil<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.750> stuff<00:00:21.960> like<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.410> and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
oil and gear oil and stuff like that and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.599 
oil and gear oil and stuff like that and
here's<00:00:22.949> where<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:24.350> units<00:00:25.350> are<00:00:25.560> where<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.400> oil

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
here's where the units are where the oil

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.269 
here's where the units are where the oil
is<00:00:26.760> kept<00:00:27.140> got<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.260> jumped<00:00:28.590> up<00:00:28.710> right<00:00:28.949> now<00:00:29.099> but

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
is kept got it jumped up right now but

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.740 
is kept got it jumped up right now but
I'm<00:00:29.400> actually<00:00:29.699> doing<00:00:30.179> some<00:00:30.390> troubleshooting

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
I'm actually doing some troubleshooting

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.920 
I'm actually doing some troubleshooting
and<00:00:31.289> I've<00:00:32.040> installed<00:00:32.430> these<00:00:32.730> valves<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.420> here

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
and I've installed these valves on here

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.020 
and I've installed these valves on here
they're<00:00:34.110> ball<00:00:34.410> valves<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.100> isolate<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
they're ball valves to isolate the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.979 
they're ball valves to isolate the
different<00:00:36.980> pumps<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:39.739> one<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> pumps<00:00:41.160> is

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
different pumps and one of the pumps is

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.139 
different pumps and one of the pumps is
for<00:00:42.989> gear<00:00:43.379> oil<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.100> other<00:00:44.280> ones<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.850> grease

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
for gear oil the other ones for grease

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.680 
for gear oil the other ones for grease
and<00:00:45.600> then<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.710> motor<00:00:46.890> oil<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:48.120> I've

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and then one is for motor oil so I've

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.330 
and then one is for motor oil so I've
got<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> tank<00:00:49.260> pressurized<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.250> you

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
got the tank pressurized so when you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.680 
got the tank pressurized so when you
turn<00:00:50.550> these<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:52.100> that's<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.550> get<00:00:56.690> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
turn these on that's what you get and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.369 
turn these on that's what you get and
the<00:00:58.590> reason<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.030> put<00:01:00.030> those<00:01:00.239> ball<00:01:00.870> valves<00:01:01.260> on

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the reason I put those ball valves on

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.100 
the reason I put those ball valves on
there<00:01:01.590> was<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.250> could<00:01:02.870> test<00:01:03.870> each

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
there was just so you could test each

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.840 
there was just so you could test each
individual<00:01:04.830> thing<00:01:05.070> because<00:01:05.309> I'm<00:01:05.430> only<00:01:05.580> going

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
individual thing because I'm only going

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.460 
individual thing because I'm only going
to<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.030> using<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> these<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.990> time<00:01:07.020> once

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
to be using one of these at a time once

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.859 
to be using one of these at a time once
I<00:01:07.650> clean<00:01:07.920> them<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> fix<00:01:08.640> them<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.659> I'll

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
I clean them up and fix them then I'll

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.200 
I clean them up and fix them then I'll
be<00:01:10.020> greasing<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.439> car<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.580> know<00:01:11.670> first<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
be greasing the car you know first and

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.149 
be greasing the car you know first and
other<00:01:13.170> stuff<00:01:13.470> second<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
other stuff second this is a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.450 
other stuff second this is a
four-cylinder<00:01:15.090> air-cooled<00:01:16.220> engine<00:01:17.220> you'll

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
four-cylinder air-cooled engine you'll

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.280 
four-cylinder air-cooled engine you'll
see<00:01:17.670> them<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:18.000> generators<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.900> everything

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
see them on generators and everything

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
see them on generators and everything
else<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:19.680> they've<00:01:19.890> adapted<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.729> use<00:01:20.909> for

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
else but they've adapted it for use for

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.359 
else but they've adapted it for use for
this<00:01:21.680> compressor<00:01:22.680> unit<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.130> drives

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
in this case I'll be using rotella 15 W

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.550 
in this case I'll be using rotella 15 W
40<00:02:11.160> once<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.000> get<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.360> thing<00:02:12.629> set<00:02:12.870> up
