00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
so we thought something like this that

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.429 
so we thought something like this that
would<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.340> different<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.000> unique<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.900> be

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
would be so different and unique and be

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.830 
would be so different and unique and be
able<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.770> connect<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.670> men's<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.689> know

able to connect with that men's you know
fishing<00:01:16.439> market<00:01:17.009> would<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.790> really<00:01:18.000> cool<00:01:18.180> so

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
