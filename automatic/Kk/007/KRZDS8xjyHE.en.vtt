racist<00:00:04.060> net<00:00:04.510> we've<00:00:05.050> had<00:00:05.200> a<00:00:05.229> lot<00:00:05.529> of<00:00:05.559> questions

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:06.069 
racist net we've had a lot of questions

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:07.530 
racist net we've had a lot of questions
about<00:00:06.220> the<00:00:06.519> difference<00:00:06.550> between<00:00:06.939> the<00:00:07.300> sight

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
about the difference between the sight

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.089 
about the difference between the sight
stroke<00:00:07.899> versus<00:00:08.349> a<00:00:08.380> breath<00:00:08.740> stroke

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:09.099 
stroke versus a breath stroke

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.230 
stroke versus a breath stroke
particularly<00:00:09.640> in<00:00:09.730> an<00:00:09.790> open<00:00:10.060> water

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
particularly in an open water

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.060 
particularly in an open water
environment<00:00:10.900> so<00:00:11.440> while<00:00:11.620> we're<00:00:11.769> here<00:00:11.890> in<00:00:11.980> the

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
environment so while we're here in the

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.470 
environment so while we're here in the
pool<00:00:12.280> we<00:00:12.430> thought<00:00:12.610> we<00:00:12.760> would<00:00:12.850> illustrate<00:00:13.330> to

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
pool we thought we would illustrate to

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.970 
pool we thought we would illustrate to
you<00:00:13.570> the<00:00:13.690> difference<00:00:14.050> between<00:00:14.230> the<00:00:14.559> two

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
you the difference between the two

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.679 
you the difference between the two
before<00:00:15.580> we<00:00:15.670> illustrate<00:00:16.150> it<00:00:16.269> you<00:00:16.449> need<00:00:16.599> to

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689 
before we illustrate it you need to

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.269 
before we illustrate it you need to
understand<00:00:17.109> there's<00:00:17.320> two<00:00:17.470> things<00:00:17.710> one<00:00:18.070> on<00:00:18.099> a

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
understand there's two things one on a

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.829 
understand there's two things one on a
sight<00:00:18.579> stroke<00:00:18.880> you<00:00:19.029> don't<00:00:19.179> need<00:00:19.329> to<00:00:19.449> have<00:00:19.599> your

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:19.839 
sight stroke you don't need to have your

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.749 
sight stroke you don't need to have your
entire<00:00:20.109> mouth<00:00:20.380> out<00:00:20.619> of<00:00:20.800> the<00:00:20.859> water<00:00:21.070> you<00:00:21.640> need

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
entire mouth out of the water you need

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.460 
entire mouth out of the water you need
the<00:00:21.909> water<00:00:22.089> level<00:00:22.570> just<00:00:22.779> below<00:00:22.989> your<00:00:23.289> eyes

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
the water level just below your eyes

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.140 
the water level just below your eyes
just<00:00:23.499> enough<00:00:24.130> to<00:00:24.249> be<00:00:24.339> able<00:00:24.400> to<00:00:24.579> see<00:00:24.730> the<00:00:24.849> buoys

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
just enough to be able to see the buoys

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.099 
just enough to be able to see the buoys
and<00:00:25.300> where<00:00:25.449> you're<00:00:25.599> going

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
and where you're going

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.779 
and where you're going
I'm<00:00:26.499> the<00:00:26.769> breaststroke<00:00:27.159> you<00:00:27.429> need<00:00:27.579> to<00:00:27.640> make

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
I'm the breaststroke you need to make

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.609 
I'm the breaststroke you need to make
sure<00:00:27.819> that<00:00:28.119> you<00:00:28.239> take<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:28.779> time<00:00:28.960> to<00:00:29.019> actually

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
sure that you take the time to actually

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.679 
sure that you take the time to actually
inhale<00:00:30.039> when<00:00:30.279> you're<00:00:30.429> on<00:00:30.550> your<00:00:30.729> side<00:00:30.970> I<00:00:31.359> know

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
inhale when you're on your side I know

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:32.790 
inhale when you're on your side I know
it<00:00:31.869> sounds<00:00:32.110> silly<00:00:32.290> while<00:00:32.500> you're<00:00:32.649> watching

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
it sounds silly while you're watching

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.290 
it sounds silly while you're watching
this<00:00:33.100> but<00:00:33.250> think<00:00:33.489> about<00:00:33.579> don't<00:00:33.910> open<00:00:34.120> water

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
this but think about don't open water

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.479 
this but think about don't open water
environment<00:00:34.930> if<00:00:35.559> you<00:00:35.769> don't<00:00:36.010> already<00:00:36.190> have<00:00:36.340> a

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
environment if you don't already have a

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.310 
environment if you don't already have a
pattern<00:00:36.940> of<00:00:37.059> how<00:00:37.329> many<00:00:37.660> strokes<00:00:38.019> you're<00:00:38.199> going

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
pattern of how many strokes you're going

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.990 
pattern of how many strokes you're going
to<00:00:38.379> go<00:00:38.500> before<00:00:38.710> your<00:00:39.100> sight<00:00:39.370> you're<00:00:39.820> going<00:00:39.940> to

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
to go before your sight you're going to

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.369 
to go before your sight you're going to
start<00:00:40.269> to<00:00:40.359> convolute<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.019> two<00:00:41.199> together

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
start to convolute the two together

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.810 
start to convolute the two together
you're<00:00:41.769> breathing<00:00:42.219> you're<00:00:42.340> citing<00:00:42.699> your

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
you're breathing you're citing your

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.220 
you're breathing you're citing your
sighting<00:00:43.179> you're<00:00:43.329> breathing<00:00:43.719> and<00:00:43.929> then

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
sighting you're breathing and then

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.389 
sighting you're breathing and then
that's<00:00:44.410> when<00:00:44.559> you<00:00:44.620> get<00:00:44.769> into<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:44.980> downward

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
that's when you get into a downward

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:46.439 
that's when you get into a downward
spiral<00:00:45.429> pretty<00:00:46.059> quickly

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
spiral pretty quickly

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:47.970 
spiral pretty quickly
so<00:00:46.899> let<00:00:47.050> us<00:00:47.140> illustrate<00:00:47.289> to<00:00:47.679> you<00:00:47.739> what<00:00:47.890> it

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
so let us illustrate to you what it

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.619 
so let us illustrate to you what it
looks<00:00:48.160> like<00:00:48.339> again<00:00:48.699> you<00:00:49.000> can<00:00:49.120> take<00:00:49.269> this<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.539> an

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
looks like again you can take this to an

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.450 
looks like again you can take this to an
open<00:00:49.899> water<00:00:50.079> environment<00:00:50.679> we<00:00:50.980> want<00:00:51.250> you<00:00:51.370> to

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
open water environment we want you to

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.919 
open water environment we want you to
see<00:00:51.640> how<00:00:51.789> you<00:00:51.850> can<00:00:52.000> practice<00:00:52.210> it<00:00:52.510> in<00:00:52.629> a<00:00:52.690> pool

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
see how you can practice it in a pool

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.229 
see how you can practice it in a pool
learn<00:00:53.829> to<00:00:53.980> use<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.339> pool<00:00:54.519> to<00:00:54.879> set<00:00:55.120> the

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
learn to use the pool to set the

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.239 
learn to use the pool to set the
environment<00:00:55.390> up<00:00:55.839> for<00:00:56.079> out<00:00:56.199> swimming<00:00:57.010> in<00:00:57.160> an

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
environment up for out swimming in an

environment up for out swimming in an
open<00:00:57.519> water<00:00:57.670> environment

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.820 

the<00:01:46.820> whole<00:01:47.000> idea<00:01:47.390> here<00:01:47.659> is<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.170> have<00:01:48.590> to

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
the whole idea here is that you have to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.920 
the whole idea here is that you have to
have<00:01:49.010> any<00:01:49.250> predetermined<00:01:49.670> amount<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.690> strokes

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
have any predetermined amount of strokes

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.420 
have any predetermined amount of strokes
you're<00:01:51.170> going<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.350> take<00:01:51.560> before<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.130> sight

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
you're going to take before you sight

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.820 
you're going to take before you sight
the<00:01:53.240> better<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:53.720> are<00:01:53.900> as<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.080> swimmer<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.680> more

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
the better you are as a swimmer the more

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.990 
the better you are as a swimmer the more
distance<00:01:55.250> you're<00:01:55.369> going<00:01:55.400> to<00:01:55.580> cover<00:01:55.760> with

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
distance you're going to cover with

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.600 
distance you're going to cover with
stroke<00:01:56.300> first<00:01:57.229> hope<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.979> sooner<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.340> you're

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
stroke first hope the sooner that you're

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.530 
stroke first hope the sooner that you're
going<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.790> need<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.119> sight

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
going to need to sight

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.480 
going to need to sight
think<00:01:59.750> about<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.140> if<00:02:00.619> you're<00:02:00.830> covering<00:02:01.250> two

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
think about it if you're covering two

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.920 
think about it if you're covering two
and<00:02:01.670> three<00:02:01.820> yards<00:02:02.150> with<00:02:02.270> every<00:02:02.479> pull<00:02:02.720> through

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
and three yards with every pull through

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.270 
and three yards with every pull through
and<00:02:03.050> you<00:02:03.140> put<00:02:03.320> your<00:02:03.470> head<00:02:03.649> down<00:02:03.680> at<00:02:03.920> an<00:02:04.009> open

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
and you put your head down at an open

and you put your head down at an open
water<00:02:04.430> environment<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.659> swim<00:02:05.960> 30

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
water environment and you swim 30

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.150 
water environment and you swim 30
strokes<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:06.890> can<00:02:07.040> get<00:02:07.130> up<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.250> 90<00:02:07.490> yards<00:02:07.899> off

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
strokes you can get up to 90 yards off
