back<00:00:34.160> of<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.430> cradle<00:00:34.640> already<00:00:35.150> it<00:00:35.300> doesn't

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
back of the cradle already it doesn't

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.180 
back of the cradle already it doesn't
come<00:00:35.750> like<00:00:35.930> this<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:36.380> will<00:00:36.500> have<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:36.739> attach

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
come like this you will have to attach

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.880 
come like this you will have to attach
this<00:00:37.520> plate<00:00:37.850> yourself<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.350> we'll<00:00:39.620> start<00:00:39.829> by

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
this plate yourself so we'll start by

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.950 
this plate yourself so we'll start by
looking<00:00:40.190> at<00:00:40.550> our<00:00:40.820> clamping<00:00:41.390> base<00:00:41.540> a<00:00:41.570> little

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
looking at our clamping base a little

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.540 
looking at our clamping base a little
bit<00:00:42.079> this<00:00:42.320> is<00:00:42.530> designed<00:00:42.950> to<00:00:43.160> accommodate

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
bit this is designed to accommodate

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.930 
bit this is designed to accommodate
round<00:00:44.120> bars<00:00:44.480> or<00:00:44.750> railings<00:00:45.320> between<00:00:45.950> 787<00:00:46.850> inch

and<00:00:47.180> one<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.840> quarter<00:00:48.140> inches<00:00:48.470> in<00:00:48.649> diameter

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
and one and a quarter inches in diameter

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.729 
and one and a quarter inches in diameter
you<00:00:49.489> have<00:00:49.970> this<00:00:50.270> knob<00:00:50.600> here<00:00:50.930> on<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.290> side<00:00:51.470> so

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
you have this knob here on the side so

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.799 
you have this knob here on the side so
you<00:00:51.770> can<00:00:52.040> loosen<00:00:52.309> it<00:00:52.489> up<00:00:52.670> by<00:00:52.940> going<00:00:53.149> one<00:00:53.450> way

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
you can loosen it up by going one way

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.470 
you can loosen it up by going one way
tighten<00:00:54.320> it<00:00:54.350> up<00:00:54.620> again<00:00:55.160> by<00:00:55.460> going<00:00:55.760> back<00:00:56.239> the

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
tighten it up again by going back the

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.780 
tighten it up again by going back the
other<00:00:56.719> way<00:00:56.809> here's<00:00:57.710> our<00:00:57.890> one<00:00:58.070> inch<00:00:58.100> B<00:00:58.520> size

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
other way here's our one inch B size

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.940 
other way here's our one inch B size
ball<00:00:59.180> this<00:00:59.360> has<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.600> bit<00:00:59.809> of<00:00:59.989> an<00:01:00.260> odd<00:01:00.410> shape<00:01:00.440> to

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
ball this has a bit of an odd shape to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.770 
ball this has a bit of an odd shape to
it<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.160> has<00:01:01.340> that<00:01:01.520> 90<00:01:01.910> degree<00:01:02.000> turn<00:01:02.480> right

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
it it has that 90 degree turn right

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.479 
it it has that 90 degree turn right
there<00:01:02.989> in<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.290> middle<00:01:03.469> and<00:01:03.680> it's<00:01:04.070> like<00:01:04.280> that

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
there in the middle and it's like that

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.969 
there in the middle and it's like that
because<00:01:04.850> this<00:01:05.089> is<00:01:05.299> often<00:01:05.780> used<00:01:06.020> as<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.619> yoke

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
because this is often used as a yoke

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.429 
because this is often used as a yoke
mount<00:01:07.280> for<00:01:07.549> use<00:01:07.700> in<00:01:07.909> an<00:01:08.149> aircraft<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.079> what<00:01:09.319> you

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
mount for use in an aircraft so what you

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.679 
mount for use in an aircraft so what you
can<00:01:09.590> do<00:01:09.740> is<00:01:09.950> get<00:01:10.549> this<00:01:10.670> mounted<00:01:10.880> off<00:01:11.329> of<00:01:11.539> the

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
can do is get this mounted off of the

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.830 
can do is get this mounted off of the
yoke<00:01:11.899> you<00:01:12.350> can<00:01:12.499> get<00:01:12.679> your<00:01:13.039> arm<00:01:13.789> mounted<00:01:14.450> onto

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
yoke you can get your arm mounted onto

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.959 
yoke you can get your arm mounted onto
that<00:01:14.959> one-inch<00:01:15.439> ball<00:01:15.709> and<00:01:16.009> get<00:01:16.399> your<00:01:16.520> iPad

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:19.059 
that one-inch ball and get your iPad
there<00:01:17.240> onto<00:01:17.749> the<00:01:17.929> other<00:01:18.139> end<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:18.740> this<00:01:18.889> is

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
there onto the other end so this is

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:20.440 
there onto the other end so this is
going<00:01:19.279> to<00:01:19.369> give<00:01:19.549> you<00:01:19.639> some<00:01:19.850> good<00:01:20.060> extension

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
out away from the yoke now it's not

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.419 
out away from the yoke now it's not
exclusively<00:01:23.840> used<00:01:23.959> as<00:01:24.380> an<00:01:24.679> aircraft<00:01:24.859> mount

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429

as<00:01:31.729> it's<00:01:31.880> low<00:01:32.149> vibration<00:01:32.869> this<00:01:33.020> isn't

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
as it's low vibration this isn't

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.499 
as it's low vibration this isn't
something<00:01:33.679> that<00:01:34.039> I<00:01:34.340> would<00:01:34.789> recommend<00:01:35.090> for<00:01:35.389> use

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
something that I would recommend for use

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.480 
something that I would recommend for use
on<00:01:35.719> handlebars<00:01:36.200> but<00:01:36.439> if<00:01:36.829> it<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.069> a<00:01:37.099> little<00:01:37.310> bit

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
on handlebars but if it is a little bit

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.980 
on handlebars but if it is a little bit
more<00:01:37.639> low<00:01:37.849> vibration<00:01:38.509> it's<00:01:38.630> going<00:01:38.779> to<00:01:38.840> work

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
more low vibration it's going to work

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.559 
more low vibration it's going to work
fine<00:01:39.229> for<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:39.709> here's<00:01:40.579> our<00:01:40.759> custom<00:01:41.179> cradle
