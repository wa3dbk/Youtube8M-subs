00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.620 
probably did not ovulate or if I did
ovulate<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.739> was<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.070> like<00:03:26.250> let<00:03:27.150> go<00:03:27.180> very

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
ovulate it was just like let go very

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.130 
ovulate it was just like let go very
weak<00:03:27.900> ovulation<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:30.180> he<00:03:30.299> tested<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.750> without

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
weak ovulation so he tested that without

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.080 
weak ovulation so he tested that without
the<00:03:31.410> clothing<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.010> that's<00:03:32.250> what<00:03:32.430> my<00:03:32.549> normal

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
the clothing and that's what my normal

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.120 
the clothing and that's what my normal
biological<00:03:33.360> ovulation<00:03:34.350> was<00:03:34.530> at<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.860> point

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
biological ovulation was at that point

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.190 
biological ovulation was at that point
like<00:03:35.340> pretty<00:03:35.970> bad<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.480> probably<00:03:36.870> didn't<00:03:37.110> even

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
like pretty bad and probably didn't even

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.110 
like pretty bad and probably didn't even
ovulate<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.709> think<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.040> was<00:03:38.130> like<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.250> four<00:03:38.610> no<00:03:39.030> it

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
ovulate I think it was like a four no it

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.340 
ovulate I think it was like a four no it
was<00:03:39.239> six<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.690> think<00:03:40.400> um<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.180> then<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:43.049> next

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
was six I think um and then the next

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.660 
was six I think um and then the next
cycle<00:03:43.530> which<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.950> think<00:03:44.100> was<00:03:44.190> in<00:03:44.310> like<00:03:44.430> November

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
cycle which I think was in like November

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.460 
cycle which I think was in like November
or<00:03:45.030> something<00:03:45.269> like<00:03:45.330> that<00:03:45.390> he<00:03:45.750> tested<00:03:46.170> me<00:03:46.260> on

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
or something like that he tested me on

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.150 
or something like that he tested me on
clomid<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:48.290> it's<00:03:49.290> kind<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.590> funny<00:03:49.799> because<00:03:49.920> I

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
clomid and it's kind of funny because I

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.550 
clomid and it's kind of funny because I
think<00:03:50.400> 50<00:03:50.970> milligrams<00:03:51.390> will<00:03:51.600> clomid<00:03:52.019> my

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
think 50 milligrams will clomid my

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.979 
think 50 milligrams will clomid my
ovulation<00:03:53.549> went<00:03:53.880> down<00:03:54.060> even<00:03:54.390> more<00:03:54.420> than<00:03:54.870> what

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
ovulation went down even more than what

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.539 
ovulation went down even more than what
it<00:03:55.110> was<00:03:55.200> without<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.590> coma<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.280> was<00:03:56.400> like

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
it was without the coma so it was like

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.699 
it was without the coma so it was like
at<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.700> four<00:03:57.060> which<00:03:57.690> means<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.110> did<00:03:58.320> not<00:03:58.500> ovulate

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
at a four which means I did not ovulate

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.509 
at a four which means I did not ovulate
that<00:03:59.190> month<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.750> then<00:04:00.750> oh<00:04:01.260> my<00:04:01.410> god<00:04:01.590> y'all<00:04:01.950> in

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
that month and then oh my god y'all in

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.020 
that month and then oh my god y'all in
January<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.420> had<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:03.810> cyst<00:04:04.200> my<00:04:04.769> period<00:04:05.160> my<00:04:05.250> cycle

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
January I had a cyst my period my cycle

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.530 
January I had a cyst my period my cycle
was<00:04:06.180> gone<00:04:06.390> for<00:04:06.840> like<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:08.090> missed<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.209> complete

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540
