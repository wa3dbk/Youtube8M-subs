 subscribers could use by 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.590
 example in this kit as there are pistons 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.200

 I'm going to put it into practice, I'm going to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.570
 improvise I'm going to improvise is a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.130
 fast trap here in olimpo and good 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.960
 welcome trola thank you very much 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.220
 flames troll that I blow you have and the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.170
 that has put this that I take it what 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.330
 bust or small good the case 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.550
 we have water we have lava we have 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.990
 everything until you get in I'm going to play in this 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.270
 map that has not entered 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.280
 Well, I guess how can there be 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.740
 how bad we started, of course, I do not have 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.019
 armor nor do I have anything worth it or it's worth 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.510
 this for me for me for me for me 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.220
 ok or with the most diapers peak 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.680
 ok let's start to build a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.690
 trap I'm going to make a trap several already 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.610
 I'm going to do a two for one I'm going to take 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.170
 wood is to say I'm going to make a trap 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.200
 with the piston that when someone enters 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.390
 with a button we activate it and it throws you 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.530
 empty it waited for you to support this with 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.210
 one hand up because I'm going to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.520
 improvise this that makes the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.880
 I bust and we started with this theory 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.500
 I'm going to polish this to see this guy no no to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.000
 the very good a greeting to your mom very 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.070
 good that jump has been good good 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 delicious like if that jump has been 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.790
 the best jump you have seen in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.800
 your life my good mother let's go to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.660
 make the trap such that here we are going to 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.550
 go down three blocks down and 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.680
 simply with a piston is that with 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.450
 the pistons already do many things that is 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.000
 can do many things I will do my 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.220
 territory my house already underground here 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.660
 the bad thing is that people are saying to me 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.010
 I'll make a trap I do not 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.410
 you have lost before but many people 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.440
 that follows me already knows it ok we're going to 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.240
 do this here this I'm going to cover it and 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.950
 some naughty I have I want to 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.780
 someone seriously itches some has to 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.450
 chop ok let's put the piston here 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.500
 a sticky piston that moves already and that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.810
 do the traction and push 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.050
 with same stone or with what you want 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.730
 worth what you want with earth and good 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.250
 it's just putting a button here 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.450
 lol lately I skipped the antivirus 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.190
 when I record I am not, is that it has 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.110
 some mental problem and I antivirus does not 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.730
 I know it's worth I'll put it a little more 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.150
 wide that they can not kill us 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.920
 distance here I think they do not kill us 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.700
 just in case I think that not here does not happen 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.209
 nothing is worth going to place a button 5 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.120
 here and I have rocks yes ok let's go to 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.590
 make sticks and with sticks and stones you do 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.330
 a button you see this I'm going to tell you what 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.850
 add because this way I save myself 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.950
 making buttons we put a button here 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.920
 we do the push and the block does not 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.810
 we give it back and it is removed and here 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.489
 you can shoot a lot of people worth we're going to 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.980
 cut down what are we going to chop so that 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.780
 all fall to the void and it is already 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.340
 we already have one of the traps that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.870
 you are willing and so I will now go to 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.299
 do something else and in the following 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.040
 to see how I improvise, I'm going to put this 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.080
 so let's put here another new 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.569
 piston and we're going to make a trap that you 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.010
 crushes is worth when you enter inside already 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.709
 you have seen it on my channel but good 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.810
 you put a block here and this block you 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.250
 crush would be to place here a button to 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.379
 see beata for here I shit on everything e 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.450
 I have the house destroyed we have double 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.450
 trap today is worth saying here you put a 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.950
 button and when you activate the block you 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.530
 crushes and takes little life away from you 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.450
 Little worth you see, I think it takes half 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.920
 heart every second looks every bit ay 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.660
 I removed half have seen him not because 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.150
 just like when someone stays 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.680
 worth dying trapped believe it and 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.180
 we were let's go let's go let's try 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.090
 look for someone and they sting the most 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.829
 as fast as possible with that one pique me 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.569
 because I just wanted to teach the kit 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.790
 troll and if I can kill someone with 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.340
 these impromptu traps all-in is the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.319
 clipper almost explodes me in the face to see 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.790
 we are here in the middle is worth me had 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.739
 what to measure because he did not come or give 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.329

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.280
 and nobody was coming to see small murderer 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.349
 murderer is sometimes called truth to see if 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.940
 well the killer come look look like 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.890
 comfortable 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.180
 to see me, I have to go running to the trap 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.980
 I have a duty to catch the chest 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.680
 let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.140

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.870
