here<00:00:06.629> we<00:00:06.750> are<00:00:06.870> looking<00:00:07.109> for<00:00:07.290> science<00:00:07.710> around

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
here we are looking for science around

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.589 
here we are looking for science around
the<00:00:08.250> home<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.820> here<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.210> found<00:00:09.480> it

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
the home and here we found it

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.140 
the home and here we found it
conveniently<00:00:10.170> put<00:00:10.440> into<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.950> bottle<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:11.670> Val

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
conveniently put into a bottle so Val

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.180 
conveniently put into a bottle so Val
what's<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.750> here<00:00:12.929> well<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> bottle<00:00:14.099> of

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
what's in here well this is a bottle of

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.790 
what's in here well this is a bottle of
box<00:00:14.460> furs<00:00:14.759> or<00:00:15.030> mimosa<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.719> sparkling<00:00:16.560> wine

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
box furs or mimosa is sparkling wine

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.470 
box furs or mimosa is sparkling wine
mixed<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.310> orange<00:00:17.670> juice<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.359> could

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
mixed with orange juice but you could

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.210 
mixed with orange juice but you could
try<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:19.080> any<00:00:19.320> fizzy<00:00:19.680> drinks<00:00:19.980> such<00:00:20.189> as

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
try this with any fizzy drinks such as

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.269 
try this with any fizzy drinks such as
champagne<00:00:20.850> beer<00:00:21.449> or<00:00:21.779> caller<00:00:22.080> okay<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:22.949> where's

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
champagne beer or caller okay so where's

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.220 
champagne beer or caller okay so where's
the<00:00:23.430> science<00:00:23.730> well<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.750> ever<00:00:24.869> noticed

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the science well have you ever noticed

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.170 
the science well have you ever noticed
when<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.710> pour<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> glass<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.310> champagne<00:00:26.880> into

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
when you pour a glass of champagne into

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.720 
when you pour a glass of champagne into
a<00:00:27.330> dry<00:00:27.720> glass<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.710> bubbles<00:00:29.070> very<00:00:29.369> quickly

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
a dry glass the bubbles very quickly

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.939 
a dry glass the bubbles very quickly
rise<00:00:30.179> up<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> glass<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.720> often<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.439> overflows

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
rise up the glass and often it overflows

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.880 
rise up the glass and often it overflows
but<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.300> wet<00:00:33.630> glass<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.590> find

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
but if you do it the wet glass you find

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.440 
but if you do it the wet glass you find
that<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> bubbles<00:00:35.280> don't<00:00:35.790> rise<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.270> so

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that the bubbles don't rise up so

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.150 
that the bubbles don't rise up so
quickly<00:00:36.690> yes<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.590> finish<00:00:37.890> your<00:00:38.010> glass

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
quickly yes if you finish your glass

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.740 
quickly yes if you finish your glass
already<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.640> someone's<00:00:38.910> topping<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.329> up<00:00:39.450> then

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
already and someone's topping it up then

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.510 
already and someone's topping it up then
often<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.410> doesn't<00:00:40.559> faze<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> did<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
often it doesn't faze like it did the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.190 
often it doesn't faze like it did the
first<00:00:41.610> time<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.480> quick<00:00:42.809> why<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
first time so it's that quick why is

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.650 
first time so it's that quick why is
that<00:00:43.879> Caroline<00:00:44.879> why<00:00:45.030> don't<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.329> open<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that Caroline why don't you open the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.439 
that Caroline why don't you open the
bottle<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.170> I'll<00:00:46.379> explain<00:00:49.969> how<00:00:50.969> your<00:00:51.090> open<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
bottle and I'll explain how your open it

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.560 
bottle and I'll explain how your open it
professionally<00:00:52.260> done<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.010> before<00:00:56.570> now

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
professionally done this before now

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.139 
professionally done this before now
Caroline<00:00:57.960> you've<00:00:58.109> got<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> dry<00:00:58.620> glass<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.030> as

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
Caroline you've got the dry glass and as

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.270 
Caroline you've got the dry glass and as
you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:01.050> very<00:01:01.379> quickly<00:01:01.620> or<00:01:01.859> girls<00:01:02.129> or

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you can see it very quickly or girls or

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.210 
you can see it very quickly or girls or
look<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.390> saw<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> way<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.870> glass

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
look at that when I saw the way it glass

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.940 
look at that when I saw the way it glass
and<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.420> fizzing<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.799> it's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and as you can see it's fizzing but it's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.679 
and as you can see it's fizzing but it's
not<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.340> dramatic<00:01:08.760> effect<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.270> not<00:01:09.450> come

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
not as dramatic effect it's not come

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.719 
not as dramatic effect it's not come
right<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> top<00:01:10.590> oh<00:01:10.860> well<00:01:11.189> yeah<00:01:11.490> that's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
right up to the top oh well yeah that's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.190 
right up to the top oh well yeah that's
that's<00:01:12.000> completely<00:01:12.360> different<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
that's completely different so what is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.100 
that's completely different so what is
happening<00:01:13.439> there<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:13.799> well<00:01:14.790> glass<00:01:15.390> contains

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
happening there then well glass contains

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.280 
happening there then well glass contains
microscopic<00:01:17.030> imperfections<00:01:18.030> tiny<00:01:18.869> scratches

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
microscopic imperfections tiny scratches

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.990 
microscopic imperfections tiny scratches
that<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.710> can't<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.340> your<00:01:20.460> naked<00:01:20.520> eye

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that you can't see with your naked eye

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.600 
that you can't see with your naked eye
and<00:01:21.270> dust<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.049> well<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.560> these<00:01:23.159> act<00:01:23.400> as

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and dust as well and these act as

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.380 
and dust as well and these act as
nucleation<00:01:24.330> sites<00:01:24.990> these<00:01:25.710> are<00:01:25.920> places<00:01:26.130> where

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
nucleation sites these are places where

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.480 
nucleation sites these are places where
pockets<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.540> gas<00:01:27.829> escaping<00:01:28.829> from<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> liquid

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
pockets of gas escaping from the liquid

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.730 
pockets of gas escaping from the liquid
can<00:01:30.060> form<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.900> edge<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> glass<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
can form on the edge of the glass and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.700 
can form on the edge of the glass and
turn<00:01:32.100> into<00:01:32.280> bubbles<00:01:32.840> now<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.140> glass<00:01:34.380> which

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
turn into bubbles now in my glass which

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.210 
turn into bubbles now in my glass which
is<00:01:34.890> wet<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.970> water<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> N<00:01:37.140> side<00:01:37.170> acts<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:38.189> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
is wet the water on the N side acts as a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.609 
is wet the water on the N side acts as a
barrier<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.600> means<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> gas<00:01:40.350> and

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
barrier and that means that the gas and

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.770 
barrier and that means that the gas and
the<00:01:40.680> liquid<00:01:40.740> has<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.549> diffuse<00:01:42.090> through<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the liquid has to diffuse through the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.109 
the liquid has to diffuse through the
water<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.380> reach<00:01:43.560> those<00:01:43.829> nucleation<00:01:44.369> sites<00:01:44.909> in

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
water to reach those nucleation sites in

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.030 
water to reach those nucleation sites in
the<00:01:45.299> glass<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.320> slows<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.920> whole

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
the glass and that slows the whole

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.880 
the glass and that slows the whole
process<00:01:47.310> down<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.360> that's<00:01:48.570> why<00:01:48.930> your<00:01:49.649> glass

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
process down so that's why your glass

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.280 
process down so that's why your glass
overflowed<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.729> my<00:01:51.180> glass<00:01:51.450> didn't<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.170> does

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
overflowed and my glass didn't so does

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.749 
overflowed and my glass didn't so does
that<00:01:52.350> mean<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:52.829> slow<00:01:53.100> down<00:01:53.280> or<00:01:53.490> speed<00:01:53.640> up

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
that mean you can slow down or speed up

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.510 
that mean you can slow down or speed up
this<00:01:54.000> whole<00:01:54.119> process<00:01:54.920> absolutely<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.189> what

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
this whole process absolutely and what

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.100 
this whole process absolutely and what
we're<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.850> do<00:01:56.969> next<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.479> box<00:01:57.750> first

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
we're going to do next of the box first

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.740 
we're going to do next of the box first
is<00:01:58.320> see<00:01:58.860> how<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.369> maximize<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.299> face<00:02:00.540> or

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
is see how we can maximize the face or

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.330 
is see how we can maximize the face or
dead<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.500> completely

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.860 

so<00:02:05.340> we're<00:02:05.520> back<00:02:05.550> here<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:05.940> clean<00:02:06.270> glasses<00:02:06.479> or

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
so we're back here with clean glasses or

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.540 
so we're back here with clean glasses or
at<00:02:07.050> least<00:02:07.200> they<00:02:07.409> were<00:02:07.470> cleaned<00:02:07.950> vows<00:02:08.280> they

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
at least they were cleaned vows they

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.219 
at least they were cleaned vows they
want<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:08.820> done<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.090> them<00:02:09.240> well<00:02:09.869> Caroline

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
want to be done to them well Caroline

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.660 
want to be done to them well Caroline
did<00:02:10.410> your<00:02:10.530> glass<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:11.009> added<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.370> teaspoon

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
did your glass have added a teaspoon

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.970 
did your glass have added a teaspoon
full<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.240> sugar<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.630> sin<00:02:13.230> my<00:02:13.410> glass<00:02:13.680> I've

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
full of sugar and sin my glass I've

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.270 
full of sugar and sin my glass I've
courted<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.520> an<00:02:14.670> olive<00:02:15.150> oil<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.660> can<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.100> wet

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
courted it an olive oil I can see so wet

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.560 
courted it an olive oil I can see so wet
so<00:02:17.310> what<00:02:17.700> differences<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.209> going<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> make

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
so what differences is going to make

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.990 
so what differences is going to make
well<00:02:19.380> sugar<00:02:19.620> contains<00:02:20.160> millions<00:02:20.730> of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
well sugar contains millions of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.390 
well sugar contains millions of
nucleation<00:02:21.450> sites<00:02:21.870> many<00:02:22.320> many<00:02:22.590> more<00:02:22.890> than<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
nucleation sites many many more than the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.820 
nucleation sites many many more than the
dry<00:02:23.580> gas<00:02:23.820> alone<00:02:24.150> whereas<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.170> olive<00:02:25.470> oil<00:02:25.650> on

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
dry gas alone whereas the olive oil on

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.680 
dry gas alone whereas the olive oil on
my<00:02:26.010> glass<00:02:26.310> acts<00:02:26.610> as<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.910> really<00:02:27.360> effective

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
my glass acts as a really effective

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.140 
my glass acts as a really effective
barrier<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.680> much<00:02:29.250> better<00:02:29.490> than<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> water

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
barrier it's much better than the water

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.020 
barrier it's much better than the water
at<00:02:30.680> preventing<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.860> gas<00:02:32.070> from<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.520> Box<00:02:32.730> furs

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
at preventing the gas from the Box furs

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.449 
at preventing the gas from the Box furs
from<00:02:33.630> diffusing<00:02:34.110> through<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.920> glass<00:02:35.130> and

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
from diffusing through to the glass and

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.060 
from diffusing through to the glass and
the<00:02:35.520> all-important<00:02:36.270> nucleation<00:02:36.720> sites<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:38.010> I

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
the all-important nucleation sites so I

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.199 
the all-important nucleation sites so I
think<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.310> can<00:02:38.459> guess<00:02:38.610> what's<00:02:38.790> gonna<00:02:38.850> happen

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
think I can guess what's gonna happen

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.820 
think I can guess what's gonna happen
but<00:02:39.239> sure<00:02:39.510> we<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> go<00:02:39.989> yeah<00:02:40.380> let's<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.800> a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
but sure we have a go yeah let's have a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:57.800 
but sure we have a go yeah let's have a
go<00:02:46.970> whoa<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.390> don't<00:02:50.060> 123<00:02:53.690> look<00:02:54.690> at<00:02:55.610> gonna<00:02:56.610> go<00:02:56.810> yes

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
go whoa I don't 123 look at gonna go yes

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.590 
go whoa I don't 123 look at gonna go yes

is doing nothing just as I said look I
told<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:01.080> see<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.220> science<00:03:02.850> in<00:03:03.030> a

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
told you see there it is science in a

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.090 
told you see there it is science in a
bottle<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.810> thanks<00:03:04.260> very<00:03:04.290> much<00:03:04.500> for<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:04.890> Val
