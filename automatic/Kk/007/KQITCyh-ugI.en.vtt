00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello today there is my beauty 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.040
 favorites for september and im 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.410
 september I have a very big one 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.030
 keep in mind also make up 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.880
 that's what I'm doing otherwise 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.820
 not at all and therefore it is surprising 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.170
 me all the more that I really like it 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.930
 We have found so again 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.279
 a little eyeshadow and were 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.810
 also cream the shadow and this 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.220
 consistency that is a bit creamier 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.439
 are to play 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.080
 and I especially liked that 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.059
 found on the essence days no matter 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.210
 what i'd pencil decision in the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.950
 Color only eighth celebrity I always have 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.020
 used 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.120
 on my lower lash line around the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.370
 whole eyelash wreath a bit like that 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 darken a bit more often too 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.219
 shape 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.140
 but the whole thing with such a smash up 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.930
 just a bit more islands 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.510
 and I just think that gives 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.879
 you do not have to praise a totally nice one 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.289
 somehow dark extremely dark 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.789
 Eyeshadow on the real song 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.129
 have and still does that 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.879
 a bit so 1 mog i effect in her know 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.869
 what I mean 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.130
 but you have now may not crass 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.659
 skills have to somehow too 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.090
 wear but one it carries to be easy 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.220
 for a small pen and so you can 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.979
 once blurred on that with the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.619
 Hands in the brush and that was it you can 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.930
 synonymous if you use such a rather 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.180
 want to have smoother eyeliner strokes 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.659
 and the cool thing is that he did it right 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.670
 really long and holds for two euros 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.409
 in september i also have a brush 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 I found it again quite a long time 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.810
 somehow I do not know where misplaced 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.970
 but I actually have it too 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.119
 missed and almost wanted him already 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.640
 reorder 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.280
 namely that of rio technics the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.409
 meat is actually a book brush 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.180
 but like many others 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.460
 youtuber also said you have you too 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.590
 already said he is a real one 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.840
 a little too big and actually one too 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.980
 a bit too loose and for what 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.970
 but love him all 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.730
 including me is water so 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.850
 except to apply is a child game 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.680
 so that it does not matter if it is now without contour 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.270
 So you can wear contours on 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.220
 by being a bit spitzy 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.140
 or even large area 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.600
 browser which I like to do is 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.000
 for example, if I'm a little too hard or too much 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.190
 have applied the book or too 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.980
 browser contour lining then can 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.570
 you blind it very well again 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.460
 and the whole thing does not look that hard anymore 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.800
 from I link you as always when I 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.680
 early technics show a blogpost from 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.960
 magic mia in the infobox and there you can 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.630
 you see where he's just like technics for 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.060
 how much money could continue to get in 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.340
 september also in paris and was in the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.630
 city ​​farmer pharmacy where you can look at each 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.050
 Case should go in if you look for 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:51.030
 interested in beauty and care and there 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:55.320
 I have the embryo left de crem 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.060
 Come in trier and that is 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.130
 a cream that I believe in principle 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.050
 it dispensed a great deal of perfume 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.340
 or essential oil or so to use 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.280
 and the ingredients are here 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.860
 kept simple and fast as possible 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.150
 I have not got you that long yet 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.400
 tested and I'm actually very much 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.410
 Careful what you're about but me 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.760
 I must say I love this cream now 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.770
 I already hope that I will continue to do so 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.360
 good but tolerated until now tolerate 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.220
 I like her very much and what I like about her 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.480
 love is the smell of 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.390
 Somehow it does not smell like that 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.120
 really really fresh so a bit 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.980
 after nivea cream totally delicious I love 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.540
 that smell and what I like too much 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.140
 It is nice that she is very beautiful 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.700
 is rich and nourishes my skin well 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.770
 but not extreme at the same time 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.930
 but slowly one does not look too extreme 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.950
 So one quickly sees exactly 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.540
 really normal 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.370
 I can do it both in the morning as well 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.420
 use in the evening and feel my skin 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.980
 very good 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.020
 also taken from Paris from the 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:58.040
 supermarket in front of k is the magnifying glass of tina 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:59.570
 the caritas body cream or body 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.640
 butter and I could not before 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.280
 smell it was a big one 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.320
 Surprise and I find it smells 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.840
 very, very good, too, this one not very much 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.090
 fresh but a bit funny 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.280
 spicy and somehow reminds me that way 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.160
 a little bit of already autumn winter what 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.670
 he is now the case, too, he suits it 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.110
 very good in the season and I think 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.910
 or not very nice looks 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.650
 but she also feels very good 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.740
 I thought she was of consistency 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.520
 a little firmer, but it's more likely 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.430
 such as a pudding or something a bit 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.660
 However, on the skin feels 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.070
 surprisingly light so it is not 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.620
 the richest of all body mother 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.820
 but she still tends on very well 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.460
 especially if you want something 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.860
 moves a little faster and therefore 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.140
 in any case very often actually 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.880
 daily in september used the last 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.790
 You have favorites in my make-up 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.520
 tutorial where i see this kylie 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.260
 jenner make up after make-up and 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.910
 There I used a lipliner on 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.900
 the lips and the manhattan 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.660
 extreme weighs his in the color 59 g 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.310
 I hope for everyone involved and forward 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.630
 also me that this lipliner 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.520
 there is still that is pretty 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.560
 i blew him in september 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.200
 actually worn almost every day that 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.000
 is such a rosewood musician sound that has 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.010
 what music but also that 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.510
 friendly he is not heard though 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.230
 not too dark you can be heavy 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.180
 describe 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.870
 but you do not see any journal like this 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.110
 think if someone gets it 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.330
 extremely long also gets drinking food 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.830
 and so on everything from no problem 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.710
 At the same time, it is very much the same 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.500
 Creamy in the order and can not get either 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.180
 so in wrinkles of consistency 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.700
 really 1a is also so has one 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.860
 Matt finish which I think is really great 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.529
 And does not cost too much 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.729
 you down 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.899
 So how is that really even when they are watching? 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.549
 have thrown under the 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.989
 probably my favorite favorite out 

00:05:59.549 --> 00:06:02.069
 this month and then that's it 

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:03.629
 to my favorites 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:06.409
 I hope you liked them 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.409
 see you next time
