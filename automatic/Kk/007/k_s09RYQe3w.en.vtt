00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
so let's just start off with some

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.290 
so let's just start off with some
practical<00:00:37.170> information<00:00:37.380> now<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.820> first<00:00:39.059> boss

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
a couple of times and failed and I did

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.310 
a couple of times and failed and I did
try<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.430> sneak<00:00:44.730> past<00:00:45.059> them<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
try to just sneak past them so it is

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.740 
try to just sneak past them so it is
possible<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:47.280> completely<00:00:48.090> circumvent<00:00:48.690> the

that you will have to actually kill the
ads<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.869> remember<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> instance<00:01:13.710> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
ads as if you remember the instance you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.950 
ads as if you remember the instance you
have<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.790> gnome<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.720> want<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
kill and he runs off you have to engage

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.030 
kill and he runs off you have to engage
him<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.540> battle<00:01:18.750> three<00:01:19.080> times<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> end

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
him in battle three times and at the end

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.100 
him in battle three times and at the end
he's<00:01:20.280> standing<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.450> top<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> where<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
he's standing right on top of where the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.440 
he's standing right on top of where the
first<00:01:22.290> boss<00:01:22.560> spawns<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.970> remember<00:01:24.360> how

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
first boss spawns and you remember how

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.240 
first boss spawns and you remember how
it<00:01:24.479> looks<00:01:24.780> right<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.439> boss<00:01:25.619> shoot<00:01:26.040> through

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
it looks right the boss shoot through

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.760 
it looks right the boss shoot through
the<00:01:26.310> wall<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.850> basically<00:01:27.659> buries<00:01:28.229> them<00:01:28.530> in

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the wall and basically buries them in

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.160 
the wall and basically buries them in
rubble<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.060> that's<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.869> walk

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
rubble so and that's when you can walk

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.700 
rubble so and that's when you can walk
past<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:32.009> no<00:01:32.729> matter<00:01:32.909> what<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.509> will<00:01:34.049> put<00:01:34.680> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
past but no matter what I will put a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.830 
past but no matter what I will put a
note<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> video<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> will<00:01:36.509> know<00:01:36.659> if

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
note in the video so you will know if

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.190 
note in the video so you will know if
you<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.409> actually<00:01:37.829> kill<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.520> ads<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:38.970> not

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
you have to actually kill the ads or not

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.870 
you have to actually kill the ads or not
now<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.409> video<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.250> encounter<00:01:41.579> is
