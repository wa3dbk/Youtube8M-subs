fingers going to be pointing that down

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.690 
fingers going to be pointing that down
that<00:01:53.750> way<00:01:53.899> this<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:54.800> going<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.100> create<00:01:55.250> across

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
that way this is going to create across

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.120 
that way this is going to create across
like<00:01:56.270> not<00:01:56.570> sort<00:01:56.930> of<00:01:57.490> from<00:01:58.490> there<00:01:59.800> from<00:02:00.800> there

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
like not sort of from there from there

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.040 
like not sort of from there from there
you're<00:02:01.429> going<00:02:01.459> to<00:02:01.610> go<00:02:02.360> put<00:02:02.630> your<00:02:02.720> fingers

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.859 
through those four holes
come<00:02:05.600> up<00:02:05.869> through<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.590> middle<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.100> out<00:02:07.869> let's

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
come up through the middle and out let's

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.869 
come up through the middle and out let's
make<00:02:09.110> that

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
make that

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.100
