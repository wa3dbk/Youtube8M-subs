think<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.390> think<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:18.960> does<00:02:19.170> have<00:02:19.380> definite

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
think so I think this does have definite

think so I think this does have definite
Kubrick<00:02:21.090> fingerprints<00:02:21.660> all<00:02:21.780> over<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.110> and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
Kubrick fingerprints all over it and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.080 
Kubrick fingerprints all over it and
it's<00:02:22.740> hard<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.010> duplicate<00:02:23.490> Kubrick<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.000> know

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
it's hard to duplicate Kubrick you know

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.460 
it's hard to duplicate Kubrick you know
without<00:02:24.300> seeming<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.840> you're<00:02:25.050> just<00:02:25.260> trying

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
without seeming like you're just trying

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.380 
without seeming like you're just trying
to<00:02:25.560> duplicate<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.160> duplicate<00:02:26.640> Kubrick<00:02:27.030> say

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
to duplicate a duplicate Kubrick say

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.960 
to duplicate a duplicate Kubrick say
that<00:02:27.570> like<00:02:27.840> five<00:02:28.140> times<00:02:28.440> fast<00:02:28.709> but<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.640> think

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
that like five times fast but I think

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.790 
that like five times fast but I think
that<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.720> looks<00:02:30.750> like<00:02:31.080> there's<00:02:31.290> some<00:02:31.440> genuine

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
that it looks like there's some genuine

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.620 
that it looks like there's some genuine
artistry<00:02:32.220> going<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.610> here<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.120> Glaser

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
artistry going on here and that Glaser

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.570 
artistry going on here and that Glaser
has<00:02:33.900> an<00:02:34.170> actual<00:02:34.620> voice<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.130> know<00:02:35.250> it's<00:02:35.400> not

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
has an actual voice you know it's not

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.470 
has an actual voice you know it's not
just<00:02:35.640> an<00:02:36.420> homage<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.380> Kubrick<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.910> that's<00:02:39.150> I

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
just an homage to Kubrick so that's I

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.360 
just an homage to Kubrick so that's I
find<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.080> interesting<00:02:40.290> now<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.040> said

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
find that interesting now that said

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.030 
find that interesting now that said
though<00:02:41.610> Kubrick<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:43.050> me<00:02:43.230> at<00:02:43.380> least<00:02:43.560> hit<00:02:43.890> or

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
though Kubrick is to me at least hit or

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.230 
though Kubrick is to me at least hit or
miss<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.280> he's<00:02:44.580> always<00:02:44.730> been<00:02:44.940> hit<00:02:45.090> or<00:02:45.209> miss

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
miss and he's always been hit or miss

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.480 
miss and he's always been hit or miss
with<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.290> mainstream<00:02:46.470> movie<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.040> public

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
with the mainstream movie going public

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.830 
with the mainstream movie going public
of<00:02:47.610> course<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.940> think<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.180> shining<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
of course I think the shining is the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.620 
of course I think the shining is the
most<00:02:49.020> well<00:02:49.290> known<00:02:49.550> popular<00:02:50.550> film<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.180> his<00:02:51.360> I

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
most well known popular film of his I

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.270 
most well known popular film of his I
love<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.230> think<00:02:52.380> it's<00:02:52.470> really<00:02:52.739> good

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
love it I think it's really good

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.130 
love it I think it's really good
and<00:02:53.519> perhaps<00:02:53.730> 2001<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.600> Space<00:02:54.930> Odyssey

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
and perhaps 2001 a Space Odyssey

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.080 
and perhaps 2001 a Space Odyssey
although<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:55.950> wonder<00:02:56.370> how<00:02:56.459> many<00:02:56.519> people<00:02:56.670> have

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
although I wonder how many people have

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.790 
although I wonder how many people have
heard<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.900> versus<00:02:58.260> how<00:02:58.320> many<00:02:58.380> people<00:02:58.709> have

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
heard of it versus how many people have

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.229 
heard of it versus how many people have
actually<00:02:58.980> sat<00:02:59.370> through<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.670> entire<00:02:59.910> thing

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
actually sat through the entire thing

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.690 
actually sat through the entire thing
it's<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.959> little<00:03:01.170> difficult<00:03:01.380> um<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.280> that's

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
it's a little difficult um and that's

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.190 
it's a little difficult um and that's
just<00:03:03.030> me<00:03:03.180> coming<00:03:03.480> as<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> more<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.170> know

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
just me coming as a more you know

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.860 
just me coming as a more you know
narrative<00:03:04.920> based<00:03:05.100> movie<00:03:06.060> goer<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.330> like<00:03:06.660> those

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
narrative based movie goer I like those

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.560 
narrative based movie goer I like those
kind<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.230> films<00:03:07.470> more<00:03:07.709> than<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:08.070> more

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
kind of films more than this more

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.720 
kind of films more than this more
experimental<00:03:09.570> film<00:03:09.840> but<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.220> still<00:03:11.459> it

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
experimental film but so but still it

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.729 
experimental film but so but still it
has<00:03:11.790> its<00:03:12.420> audience<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.140> think<00:03:13.410> there<00:03:13.680> will

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
has its audience so I think there will

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.110 
has its audience so I think there will
definitely<00:03:13.890> be<00:03:14.130> people<00:03:14.430> who<00:03:14.550> are<00:03:14.640> interested

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
definitely be people who are interested

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.390 
definitely be people who are interested
in<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.810> don't<00:03:16.170> know<00:03:16.410> if<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:17.040> could<00:03:17.250> maybe

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
in this so I don't know if I could maybe

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.890 
in this so I don't know if I could maybe
make<00:03:17.670> myself<00:03:17.910> sit<00:03:18.330> through<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.660> whole<00:03:18.870> thing

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
make myself sit through this whole thing

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.620 
make myself sit through this whole thing
if<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.350> wasn't<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.739> know<00:03:20.299> for<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.420> sake<00:03:21.600> of

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
if it wasn't you know for the sake of

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.509 
if it wasn't you know for the sake of
reviewing<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.470> or<00:03:22.620> checking<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.010> out<00:03:23.100> for<00:03:23.160> work

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
reviewing it or checking it out for work

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.970 
reviewing it or checking it out for work
I<00:03:23.760> think<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.239> purely<00:03:25.019> as<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> movie<00:03:25.560> goer<00:03:25.739> it

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
I think is purely as a movie goer it

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.289 
I think is purely as a movie goer it
might<00:03:26.130> be<00:03:26.280> difficult<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.850> would<00:03:26.910> find<00:03:27.180> it

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
might be difficult I would find it

to she's doing very well in Hollywood
especially<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.120> guess<00:04:13.300> because<00:04:13.569> she's<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.720> part

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
especially I guess because she's a part

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.390 
especially I guess because she's a part
of<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.080> Avengers<00:04:14.349> franchise<00:04:14.709> that's<00:04:15.190> really

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
of the Avengers franchise that's really

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.069 
of the Avengers franchise that's really
upped<00:04:15.580> her<00:04:15.700> profile<00:04:16.090> significantly<00:04:16.720> she<00:04:16.930> was

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
upped her profile significantly she was

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.530 
upped her profile significantly she was
in<00:04:17.199> her<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.739> still<00:04:18.459> not<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.699> big<00:04:18.850> box-office<00:04:19.269> draw

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
in her I still not a big box-office draw

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.780 
in her I still not a big box-office draw
on<00:04:19.750> her<00:04:19.870> own<00:04:20.049> yet<00:04:20.320> but<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.340> think<00:04:21.639> she's

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
on her own yet but I think she's

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.310 
on her own yet but I think she's
definitely<00:04:21.970> getting<00:04:22.360> work<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.110> she's

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
definitely getting work and she's

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.480

definitely<00:04:23.470> I<00:04:23.710> think<00:04:23.740> at<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:23.979> top<00:04:24.160> of<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.340> lot

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
definitely I think at the top of a lot

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.980 
definitely I think at the top of a lot
of<00:04:24.610> people's<00:04:24.880> lists<00:04:25.180> for<00:04:25.360> who<00:04:25.600> they<00:04:25.720> want<00:04:25.900> to

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
of people's lists for who they want to

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.500 
of people's lists for who they want to
cast<00:04:26.250> but<00:04:27.250> still<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:27.729> she<00:04:27.790> doesn't<00:04:28.120> need<00:04:28.449> to

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
cast but still so she doesn't need to

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.330 
cast but still so she doesn't need to
take<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.750> risk<00:04:29.020> like<00:04:29.110> this<00:04:29.440> so<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:29.680> commend<00:04:30.100> her

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
take a risk like this so I commend her

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.909 
take a risk like this so I commend her
for<00:04:30.370> wanting<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:31.030> reinvent<00:04:31.570> herself<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.680> try

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
though that I'm a little disappointed

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.420

that<00:04:38.169> she<00:04:38.350> continues<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.860> try<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.160> play<00:04:39.310> off

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
that she continues to try and play off

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.879 
that she continues to try and play off
of<00:04:39.580> this<00:04:39.870> initial<00:04:40.870> sex<00:04:41.169> symbol<00:04:41.500> image<00:04:41.740> that

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.390 
I've said before also there was a really
great<00:05:20.169> article<00:05:20.470> in<00:05:20.590> Newsweek<00:05:20.800> when<00:05:21.220> Halle

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
great article in Newsweek when Halle

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.089 
great article in Newsweek when Halle
Berry<00:05:21.639> was<00:05:21.849> in<00:05:22.110> kalamoon<00:05:23.110> film<00:05:23.380> that<00:05:23.860> if<00:05:24.010> you

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
Berry was in kalamoon film that if you

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.920 
Berry was in kalamoon film that if you
have<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.280> very<00:05:24.490> short<00:05:24.789> window<00:05:24.970> of<00:05:25.150> time<00:05:25.720> when

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
have a very short window of time when

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.210 
have a very short window of time when
you're<00:05:26.050> at<00:05:26.139> the<00:05:26.260> top<00:05:26.440> in<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:26.680> game<00:05:26.919> as<00:05:27.099> well

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
you're at the top in that game as well

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.120 
you're at the top in that game as well
because<00:05:27.910> new<00:05:28.660> is<00:05:28.960> always<00:05:29.229> the<00:05:29.470> sexiest

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
because new is always the sexiest

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.159 
because new is always the sexiest
so<00:05:30.310> you're<00:05:30.550> easily<00:05:30.729> replaced<00:05:31.270> and<00:05:31.840> I<00:05:32.020> also

so you're easily replaced and I also

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
feel I'm not so happy that she's

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.610 
feel I'm not so happy that she's
focusing<00:05:34.210> on<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.570> sex<00:05:34.840> symbol<00:05:35.020> aspects<00:05:35.500> of

her persona here because I thought she

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.700 
her persona here because I thought she
moved<00:05:37.419> away<00:05:37.510> from<00:05:37.720> that<00:05:38.050> in<00:05:38.139> the<00:05:38.200> Avengers<00:05:38.590> I

Johansson do you think she this is do

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.840 
Johansson do you think she this is do
you<00:06:42.350> like<00:06:42.470> her<00:06:42.620> taking<00:06:43.130> on<00:06:43.220> this<00:06:43.310> kind<00:06:43.490> of<00:06:43.670> role

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
you like her taking on this kind of role

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.580 
you like her taking on this kind of role
and<00:06:44.060> do<00:06:44.480> you<00:06:44.570> how<00:06:44.750> do<00:06:44.810> you<00:06:44.930> feel<00:06:45.170> do<00:06:45.320> you<00:06:45.410> want

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
and do you how do you feel do you want

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.170 
and do you how do you feel do you want
to<00:06:45.710> see<00:06:45.830> her<00:06:45.950> keep<00:06:46.160> that<00:06:46.340> sexiness<00:06:46.790> that's

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
to see her keep that sexiness that's

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.240 
to see her keep that sexiness that's
been<00:06:47.360> a<00:06:47.390> part<00:06:47.600> of<00:06:47.750> her<00:06:47.870> career<00:06:48.350> in<00:06:49.130> the

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
been a part of her career in the

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.380 
been a part of her career in the
beginning<00:06:49.610> and<00:06:49.730> I<00:06:49.790> think<00:06:50.000> part<00:06:50.210> of<00:06:50.270> the<00:06:50.360> reason

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
beginning and I think part of the reason

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.600 
beginning and I think part of the reason
she<00:06:50.750> wasn't<00:06:50.900> so<00:06:51.110> successful<00:06:51.650> at<00:06:51.710> first<00:06:51.950> or<00:06:52.340> do

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
she wasn't so successful at first or do

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.130 
she wasn't so successful at first or do
you<00:06:52.700> like<00:06:52.910> that<00:06:53.060> maybe<00:06:53.270> you<00:06:53.600> know<00:06:53.690> she's<00:06:53.960> going

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
you like that maybe you know she's going

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.380 
you like that maybe you know she's going
off<00:06:54.380> and<00:06:54.560> to<00:06:54.680> more<00:06:55.010> fully<00:06:55.340> realized<00:06:55.580> roles<00:06:56.120> and

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
off and to more fully realized roles and

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.270 
off and to more fully realized roles and
is<00:06:56.600> this<00:06:56.750> a<00:06:56.810> step<00:06:57.110> back<00:06:57.350> or<00:06:57.830> maybe<00:06:57.950> this<00:06:58.130> is

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
is this a step back or maybe this is

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.730 
is this a step back or maybe this is
just<00:06:58.310> the<00:06:58.760> mid<00:06:58.970> step<00:06:59.270> as<00:07:00.170> she<00:07:00.410> makes<00:07:00.590> that

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
just the mid step as she makes that

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.470 
just the mid step as she makes that
