00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.909
 hello to bobbys passierball picks up the tv 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.910
 We have the last exercises 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.340
 one by hand and with grasp 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.910
 busy today we want to try 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.970
 to play with both at the same time 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.090
 okay i have a little exercise for you 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.940
 first thought about it before and then 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.180
 Let's see what this exercise is 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180
 consists 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.170
 what did we play for the first one 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:11.210
 goals quarter now again briefly to 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.910
 explanation what is a target time the time 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.260
 describes how long a tone a note 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.990
 sounds okay 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.000
 as an example, I play one first 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.370
 whole note 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.220
 then I play you a half note and 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.140
 then i play you a fair fashion 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.830
 we use our metronome and set 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.110
 it at a reasonable speed 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.860
 I have an 80 in this case 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.860
 beats per minute 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:02:09.290
 123 missing whole now two half note 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:16.030
 1 234 123 123 and now the many notes 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:16.030
 which we also need in this exercise 34 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.080
 11 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.519
 what counts first for the times 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.189
 Now there are more in the 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.099
 Exercise what did we play 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:33.739
 on the one hand we play a which we 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.219
 with our index finger in the fifth bunch 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:42.769
 then we play on the side 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:44.840
 a de it will me in the fifth bunch 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.049
 the a-side are also back in 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.099
 our forefinger then we play 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.290
 h in the seventh and on the side it will be 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.790
 we attack with our ring finger 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.949
 the grasping hand and e in the seventh bunch 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.919
 on the a side we have to go again 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:08.319
 grab with the ring finger 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:08.319
 So that means without metronom first 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.310
 1234 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:27.489
 this will be repeated the next dates 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.319
 which we play then would be a 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.000
 Forefinger attacked in the fifth fret 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.070
 the a side 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.950
 then a g in the fifth bunch on the 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:42.270
 b-side again with ours 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:46.910
 index finger then seized ag in the seventh 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:49.890
 bunch seized on the a-side and a 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.750
 in the seventh bunch on the b-side 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.750
 again in the middle of it 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.990
 that was the first hand we could handle 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.890
 Both want hands together 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.920
 that means we should go for it 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.920
 respect, think highly of 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.620
 that we play the change clean and 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.139
 then also the side to do if the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.330
 side is gripped 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.889
 not too early nor too late otherwise 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.620
 The sound does not sound clean 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:39.969
 okay again in the team first man 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:43.419
 or metronome we play the a that ddh 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:47.650
 and se each gripped most of the fingers 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:50.830
 in the fifth federal on the side and on 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.840
 the side of the question seized in the seventh 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.249
 bund intervened on the side and the hustle 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:01.110
 in the seventh bunch on the a-side now 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:01.110
 we pay attention to our future 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:15.360
 always make sure that if he does 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.940
 a train ride is also used 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:23.069
 can be played so that he is in sync 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:31.250
 with the hands time the exercise still 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:31.250
 my whole now with metronome 1234 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.660
