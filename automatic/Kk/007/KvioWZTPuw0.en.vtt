thought<00:03:00.079> was<00:03:00.709> gonna<00:03:00.859> be<00:03:00.950> bad<00:03:01.220> in<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.489> game<00:03:01.609> Oh

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
thought was gonna be bad in this game Oh

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.870 
thought was gonna be bad in this game Oh
terrific<00:03:02.510> oh<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.230> thought<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.609> movement

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
terrific oh I thought that the movement

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.819 
terrific oh I thought that the movement
was<00:03:05.120> gonna<00:03:05.390> be<00:03:05.480> really<00:03:05.630> love<00:03:06.079> your<00:03:06.290> face<00:03:06.590> no

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
was gonna be really love your face no

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.310 
was gonna be really love your face no
but<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.220> don't<00:03:07.310> get<00:03:07.489> a<00:03:07.549> huge<00:03:07.910> boost<00:03:08.209> when<00:03:09.170> you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
but you don't get a huge boost when you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.229 
but you don't get a huge boost when you
do<00:03:09.440> jump<00:03:09.799> and<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.130> can't<00:03:10.370> boost<00:03:10.549> all<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.000> time

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
do jump and you can't boost all the time

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.620 
do jump and you can't boost all the time
so<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.600> like<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.350> lot<00:03:12.760> this<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.000> sign<00:03:14.239> of
