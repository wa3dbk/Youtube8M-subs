they're going to be showing you today is
the<00:00:17.520> eq<00:00:17.940> 50<00:00:18.300> from<00:00:18.510> easton<00:00:19.010> we<00:00:20.010> received<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the eq 50 from easton we received a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.300 
the eq 50 from easton we received a
stick<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> couple<00:00:21.090> months<00:00:21.390> ago<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.310> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
stick a couple months ago and the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.000 
stick a couple months ago and the
patterns<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.390> asked<00:00:24.689> us<00:00:24.750> if<00:00:24.900> we<00:00:25.080> would

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
patterns that they asked us if we would

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.460 
patterns that they asked us if we would
like<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.310> use<00:00:26.539> they<00:00:27.539> sent<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.930> us<00:00:28.050> or<00:00:28.230> our

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
like to use they sent to us or our

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.500 
like to use they sent to us or our
particular<00:00:28.800> patterns<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:29.760> this

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
particular patterns that we like this

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.790 
particular patterns that we like this
one<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.050> i<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.289> let<00:00:31.500> me<00:00:31.590> flip<00:00:31.769> this

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
one here that i have let me flip this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.530 
one here that i have let me flip this
around<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.610> as<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.239> pattern

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
around so you can see it as the pattern

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420 
around so you can see it as the pattern
3<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.989> halt<00:00:34.140> pattern<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.710> 100<00:00:35.160> flex

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
3 is to halt pattern and 100 flex

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.520 
3 is to halt pattern and 100 flex
actually<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> exact<00:00:36.989> stick<00:00:37.260> or<00:00:37.410> this

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
actually this is the exact stick or this

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.740 
actually this is the exact stick or this
is<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.739> stick<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.370> used<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> test<00:00:39.629> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
is the stick that I used that I test it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.190 
is the stick that I used that I test it
out<00:00:39.899> over<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.950> last<00:00:41.190> month<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.200> we're

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
out over the last month or so we're

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.840 
out over the last month or so we're
going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.379> go<00:00:43.469> over<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.649> few<00:00:43.770> key<00:00:44.399> points<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
going to go over a few key points to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.160 
going to go over a few key points to
stick<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.300> what<00:00:45.420> makes<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.719> stick<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> little

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
stick and what makes a stick a little

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.020 
stick and what makes a stick a little
different<00:00:46.620> than<00:00:46.739> most<00:00:47.340> other<00:00:47.579> graphite

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
different than most other graphite

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
different than most other graphite
sticks<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.510> out<00:00:48.719> there<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.500> market

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
sticks that are out there and the market

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.020 
sticks that are out there and the market
today<00:00:49.950> because<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> ton<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.820> them

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
today because there is a ton of them

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.610 
today because there is a ton of them
that<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:51.840> coming<00:00:52.199> through<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.530> all

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that are coming through with all

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.619 
that are coming through with all
different<00:00:52.800> types<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.550> technology<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.239> far<00:00:54.480> as

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
different types of technology as far as

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.529 
different types of technology as far as
foams<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.680> blades<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.370> different<00:00:56.699> different

things<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.050> they're<00:00:58.199> trying<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
things that they're trying to do now to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.010 
things that they're trying to do now to
help<00:00:59.219> you<00:01:00.210> know<00:01:00.300> make<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> shot<00:01:00.809> more

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
help you know make the shot more

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.290 
help you know make the shot more
accurate<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.190> come<00:01:02.399> through<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> lot<00:01:02.820> faster

without<00:01:04.049> any<00:01:04.439> twerker<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> bend<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.610> blade

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
without any twerker or a bend in a blade

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.000 
without any twerker or a bend in a blade
so<00:01:06.450> what<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:06.840> gonna<00:01:06.930> point<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
so what I'm gonna point out first is the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.460 
so what I'm gonna point out first is the
blade<00:01:08.520> down<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:10.020> you're<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.350> see

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
blade down here as you're going to see

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.719 
blade down here as you're going to see
there's<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> there's<00:01:11.130> these<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.310> weights

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
there's a there's these little weights

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.730 
there's a there's these little weights
that<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> blade<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that they have in a blade here and this

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.440 
that they have in a blade here and this
is<00:01:13.799> called<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> focus<00:01:14.670> weight<00:01:14.850> technology

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
is called the focus weight technology

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
is called the focus weight technology
and<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.409> they<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:17.070> put<00:01:17.250> weights

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and what they do is they put weights

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.240 
and what they do is they put weights
down<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.180> also<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.650> butt<00:01:19.830> end<00:01:19.979> here

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
down here and also in the butt end here

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.980 
down here and also in the butt end here
and<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> sample<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> butt<00:01:21.869> end

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and I do have a sample of the butt end

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.270 
and I do have a sample of the butt end
on<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> inside<00:01:22.439> let<00:01:22.590> me<00:01:22.680> flip<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:22.890> around<00:01:23.070> so

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
on the inside let me flip this around so

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.859 
on the inside let me flip this around so
you<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.790> year<00:01:24.030> there's<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> button

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you can see this year there's the button

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
there's a little chart you can't see it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.640 
there's a little chart you can't see it
on<00:01:29.640> my<00:01:29.880> stick<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.450> because<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:30.900> taped<00:01:31.110> but

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
on my stick here because it's taped but

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.780 
on my stick here because it's taped but
when<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.890> buy<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> stick<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.579> store

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
when you buy the stick in a store

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.390 
when you buy the stick in a store
there's<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.890> line<00:01:35.220> in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
there's going to be a little line in

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.609 
there's going to be a little line in
here<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.729> tells<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.090> let<00:01:36.960> me<00:01:37.049> quick<00:01:37.409> take

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
here that tells you let me quick take

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.929 
here that tells you let me quick take
out<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> butt<00:01:38.369> end<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.640> you'll<00:01:38.729> see<00:01:38.850> exactly

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
out the butt end and you'll see exactly

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
out the butt end and you'll see exactly
what<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.360> mean<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> butt<00:01:40.710> end<00:01:40.860> right

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
what I mean this is the butt end right

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.380 
what I mean this is the butt end right
here<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.490> notice<00:01:41.700> there<00:01:42.000> are<00:01:42.119> four

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
here and as you notice there are four

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.319 
here and as you notice there are four
weights<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.810> there<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.250> on<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> chef<00:01:45.149> that's

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
weights in there and on the chef that's

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.960 
weights in there and on the chef that's
off<00:01:45.540> at<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> top<00:01:45.930> part<00:01:46.369> where<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.520> cut<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
off at the top part where you cut it it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.340 
off at the top part where you cut it it
actually<00:01:48.090> tells<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.570> either<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.170> out

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
actually tells you either to take out

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.200 
actually tells you either to take out
the<00:01:49.500> weights<00:01:49.680> or<00:01:49.860> keep<00:01:50.040> them<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.369> this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the weights or keep them in this

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.999 
the weights or keep them in this
particular<00:01:51.509> version<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.619> off<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.890> another

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
particular version is off of another

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.819 
particular version is off of another
stick<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.970> should<00:01:54.869> specify<00:01:55.409> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
stick that we have should specify that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.950 
stick that we have should specify that
the<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.570> clear

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the one that I have here is the clear

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.990 
the one that I have here is the clear
this<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> clear<00:01:58.619> version<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.670> stick

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
this is the clear version to the stick

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.450 
this is the clear version to the stick
and<00:02:00.210> also<00:02:00.810> show<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.140> what<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.250> grip

and also show you what the the grip

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.550 
and also show you what the the grip

version looks like is more of a red
version<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:06.000> here<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.469> is

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
version that we have here and this is

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.900 
version that we have here and this is
actually<00:02:07.740> another<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.369> our<00:02:08.489> guys<00:02:08.640> that

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
actually another one of our guys that

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.639 
actually another one of our guys that
here<00:02:09.030> hockey<00:02:09.239> us<00:02:09.450> calm<00:02:09.869> tested<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.440> stick

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
here hockey us calm tested this stick

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.080 
here hockey us calm tested this stick
out<00:02:10.800> he<00:02:10.920> likes<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> grip<00:02:11.400> pattern<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.819> like<00:02:12.000> to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
out he likes the grip pattern I like to

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.330 
out he likes the grip pattern I like to
clear

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
clear

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.140 
clear
pattern<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:14.459> basically<00:02:15.459> what<00:02:15.700> he<00:02:15.819> had<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.030> do

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
pattern so basically what he had to do

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.430 
pattern so basically what he had to do
was<00:02:16.269> he<00:02:16.420> kept<00:02:16.629> this<00:02:16.750> dick<00:02:17.019> he's<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.379> little

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
was he kept this dick he's a little

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.100 
was he kept this dick he's a little
taller<00:02:17.739> than<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.069> am<00:02:18.099> so<00:02:18.760> he<00:02:18.879> kept<00:02:19.150> most<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:20.019> the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
taller than I am so he kept most of the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.290 
taller than I am so he kept most of the
weights<00:02:20.290> in<00:02:20.500> there<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:21.670> help<00:02:21.790> balance<00:02:21.970> to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
weights in there to help balance to

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.360 
weights in there to help balance to
balance<00:02:22.810> at<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:22.930> bottom<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.069> way<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
balance at the bottom of the way to the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.970 
balance at the bottom of the way to the
stick<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.700> what<00:02:24.819> does<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.209> pretty<00:02:25.420> cool<00:02:25.980> as

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
stick and what does is pretty cool as

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.220 
stick and what does is pretty cool as
you're<00:02:27.129> coming<00:02:27.400> through<00:02:27.459> your<00:02:27.730> shot<00:02:28.360> because

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
you're coming through your shot because

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.449 
you're coming through your shot because
we<00:02:29.379> do<00:02:29.560> cut<00:02:29.860> our<00:02:30.459> sticks<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:32.739> you<00:02:33.069> know<00:02:33.190> can

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
we do cut our sticks it you know can

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.430 
we do cut our sticks it you know can
throw<00:02:33.730> off<00:02:33.910> some<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.420> balance<00:02:34.750> on<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
throw off some of the balance on the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.930 
throw off some of the balance on the
stick<00:02:35.830> itself<00:02:36.099> you<00:02:36.250> can<00:02:36.280> actually<00:02:36.610> feel<00:02:36.760> where

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
stick itself you can actually feel where

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.789 
stick itself you can actually feel where
most<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.269> sticks<00:02:37.510> become<00:02:37.810> bottom<00:02:38.560> had<00:02:38.709> the

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
most of the sticks become bottom had the

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:39.930 
most of the sticks become bottom had the
I<00:02:38.860> should<00:02:39.069> cut<00:02:39.220> him<00:02:39.310> depending<00:02:39.610> on<00:02:39.730> how<00:02:39.819> much

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
I should cut him depending on how much

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.030 
I should cut him depending on how much
you<00:02:40.090> cut<00:02:40.239> off<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.480> stick<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.500> what<00:02:41.650> Easton<00:02:41.890> did

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
you cut off the stick so what Easton did

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.080 
you cut off the stick so what Easton did
is<00:02:42.129> they<00:02:42.250> actually<00:02:42.370> added<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:43.030> little

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
is they actually added this little

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.330 
is they actually added this little
weight<00:02:43.480> technology<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.680> actually

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
weight technology and that actually

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.770 
weight technology and that actually
helps<00:02:45.610> when<00:02:45.760> you're<00:02:45.910> when<00:02:46.420> you're<00:02:46.510> coming

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
helps when you're when you're coming

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.000 
helps when you're when you're coming
through<00:02:46.810> with<00:02:47.019> your<00:02:47.110> follow<00:02:47.319> through<00:02:47.410> on<00:02:47.650> the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
through with your follow through on the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.069 
through with your follow through on the
puck<00:02:48.489> itself<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.120> actually<00:02:49.450> helps<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.930> keep

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
puck itself it actually helps to keep

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.660 
puck itself it actually helps to keep
the<00:02:50.290> blade<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.590> little<00:02:50.890> bit<00:02:51.010> more<00:02:51.130> true<00:02:51.370> or<00:02:51.519> so

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
the blade a little bit more true or so

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.580 
the blade a little bit more true or so
it<00:02:51.790> does<00:02:51.940> not<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.329> work<00:02:52.450> or<00:02:52.780> bend<00:02:53.140> as<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.410> take

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
it does not to work or bend as you take

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.190 
it does not to work or bend as you take
a<00:02:53.620> shot<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.849> by<00:02:55.329> doing<00:02:55.569> that<00:02:55.690> adding<00:02:56.110> that

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
a shot and by doing that adding that

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.750 
a shot and by doing that adding that
focus<00:02:56.560> wake<00:02:56.739> technology<00:02:57.280> into<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.549> blade

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
focus wake technology into the blade

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.190 
focus wake technology into the blade
here<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.390> would<00:02:58.510> make<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.780> seem<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:58.989> little

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
here it would make it seem a little

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.920 
here it would make it seem a little
bottom<00:02:59.560> heavy<00:02:59.709> when<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.010> started<00:03:00.340> cutting<00:03:00.610> off

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
bottom heavy when I started cutting off

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.680 
bottom heavy when I started cutting off
you<00:03:01.930> know<00:03:02.049> some<00:03:02.349> of<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.620> shaft<00:03:03.579> here<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.540> what

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
you know some of the shaft here so what

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.030 
you know some of the shaft here so what
they<00:03:04.780> did<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.049> again<00:03:05.110> like<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.530> said<00:03:05.560> they<00:03:05.860> put

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
they did it again like I said they put

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.470 
they did it again like I said they put
these<00:03:06.160> little<00:03:06.340> weights<00:03:06.579> in<00:03:06.730> here<00:03:06.849> Dale<00:03:06.970> almost

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
these little weights in here Dale almost

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.110 
these little weights in here Dale almost
look<00:03:07.629> like<00:03:07.660> watch<00:03:08.049> watch<00:03:08.709> batteries<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:10.090> are

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
look like watch watch batteries that are

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.610 
look like watch watch batteries that are
in<00:03:10.299> here<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.780> keep<00:03:10.959> those<00:03:11.170> weights<00:03:11.440> in

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
in here and you keep those weights in

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.410 
in here and you keep those weights in
there<00:03:11.769> depending<00:03:12.340> on<00:03:12.370> how<00:03:12.579> much<00:03:12.879> that<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.239> cut

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
there depending on how much that you cut

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.069 
there depending on how much that you cut
off<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.540> shaft<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.890> stick<00:03:15.099> here<00:03:15.400> Wade<00:03:16.079> again

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
off the shaft this stick here Wade again

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.530 
off the shaft this stick here Wade again
with<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.709> four<00:03:17.920> weights<00:03:18.190> in<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.639> I

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
with the four weights in it and I

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.569 
with the four weights in it and I
believe<00:03:19.810> he<00:03:20.319> did<00:03:20.859> you<00:03:20.980> cut<00:03:21.130> anything<00:03:21.310> off<00:03:21.519> of

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
believe he did you cut anything off of

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.160 
believe he did you cut anything off of
this<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:22.209> did<00:03:22.329> not<00:03:22.450> cut<00:03:22.660> anything<00:03:22.840> off<00:03:23.049> the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
this you did not cut anything off the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.479 
this you did not cut anything off the
sticks<00:03:23.410> he<00:03:23.530> kept<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.799> four<00:03:23.980> weights<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.370> there

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
sticks he kept the four weights in there

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.039 
sticks he kept the four weights in there
because<00:03:24.579> it<00:03:24.760> felt<00:03:24.940> more<00:03:25.359> balanced<00:03:25.780> for<00:03:25.930> him

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
because it felt more balanced for him

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.309 
because it felt more balanced for him
for<00:03:26.319> that<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.620> came<00:03:27.549> into<00:03:27.700> 416<00:03:28.540> grams<00:03:28.810> so

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
for that and came into 416 grams so

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.930 
for that and came into 416 grams so
there's<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.560> little<00:03:29.680> heavier<00:03:30.099> than<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.579> lot<00:03:30.819> of

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
there's a little heavier than a lot of

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.780 
there's a little heavier than a lot of
your<00:03:31.060> high-end<00:03:32.099> high-end<00:03:33.099> sticks<00:03:33.609> that<00:03:33.760> are

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
your high-end high-end sticks that are

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.670 
your high-end high-end sticks that are
being<00:03:34.030> put<00:03:34.239> out<00:03:34.269> there<00:03:34.359> I<00:03:34.660> know<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.349> most<00:03:35.590> of

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
being put out there I know that most of

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.500 
being put out there I know that most of
the<00:03:35.769> market<00:03:36.040> today<00:03:36.160> is<00:03:36.400> all<00:03:36.880> about<00:03:36.910> lightness

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
the market today is all about lightness

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.300 
the market today is all about lightness
making<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.900> lighter<00:03:38.109> making<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.560> lighter<00:03:38.769> but

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
making a lighter making it lighter but

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.830 
making a lighter making it lighter but
Easton<00:03:39.670> decided<00:03:40.090> to<00:03:40.180> focus<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.599> little<00:03:40.690> bit

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
Easton decided to focus a little bit

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.879 
Easton decided to focus a little bit
more<00:03:41.139> on<00:03:41.349> on<00:03:42.660> on<00:03:43.660> precision<00:03:44.169> with<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.470> shot<00:03:44.739> and

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
more on on on precision with a shot and

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.140 
more on on on precision with a shot and
how<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.069> stick<00:03:45.340> feels<00:03:45.579> when<00:03:45.819> it's<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:46.030> your

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
how to stick feels when it's in your

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.460 
how to stick feels when it's in your
hand<00:03:46.329> instead<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.599> making<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.019> super<00:03:47.169> light

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
hand instead of making it super light

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.680 
hand instead of making it super light
and<00:03:47.709> then<00:03:47.950> as<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:48.190> start<00:03:48.280> cutting<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:49.450> stick

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
and then as you start cutting the stick

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.420 
and then as you start cutting the stick
down<00:03:49.870> then<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.319> becomes<00:03:50.620> unbalanced<00:03:51.340> and

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
down then it becomes unbalanced and

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.490 
down then it becomes unbalanced and
that's<00:03:51.669> basically<00:03:52.000> where<00:03:52.450> they<00:03:52.599> went<00:03:52.780> with

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
that's basically where they went with

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.409 
that's basically where they went with
this<00:03:53.680> dick<00:03:53.889> so<00:03:54.069> it<00:03:54.130> feels<00:03:54.250> really<00:03:54.519> nice<00:03:54.730> the

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419
