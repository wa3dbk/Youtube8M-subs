this is my first video in quite a while

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.450 
this is my first video in quite a while
and<00:00:18.940> it<00:00:19.210> is<00:00:19.330> going<00:00:19.600> to<00:00:19.750> be<00:00:19.960> on<00:00:20.200> how<00:00:20.950> to<00:00:21.010> set<00:00:21.430> up

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
and it is going to be on how to set up

and it is going to be on how to set up
and<00:00:21.910> clean<00:00:22.090> a<00:00:22.480> ball<00:00:22.690> python<00:00:22.869> cage<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.760> once<00:00:25.300> you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
and clean a ball python cage so once you

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.190 
and clean a ball python cage so once you
have<00:00:25.660> everything<00:00:25.930> out<00:00:26.650> of<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:27.040> cape<00:00:28.110> she

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:44.240 

confessed<00:00:32.370> to<00:00:33.370> eat

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.260 

to<00:00:45.250> be<00:00:45.400> what<00:00:45.790> you<00:00:46.000> never<00:00:46.360> shown<00:00:47.400> to<00:00:48.400> you<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
to be what you never shown to you you

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.040 
to be what you never shown to you you
have<00:00:52.329> to<00:00:52.449> have<00:00:52.930> your<00:00:53.110> substrate<00:00:53.620> ready<00:00:55.050> for

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
have to have your substrate ready for

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.910 
have to have your substrate ready for
the<00:00:56.170> substrate<00:00:56.620> I<00:00:57.040> use<00:00:57.540> eco<00:00:58.540> earth<00:00:58.780> yeah<00:00:59.470> it's

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
the substrate I use eco earth yeah it's

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.210 
the substrate I use eco earth yeah it's
a<00:01:00.309> compressed<00:01:01.150> brick<00:01:01.960> of<00:01:02.110> coconut<00:01:02.559> fiber<00:01:02.589> and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
a compressed brick of coconut fiber and

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.719 
a compressed brick of coconut fiber and
you<00:01:04.210> add<00:01:04.360> four<00:01:04.780> quarts<00:01:05.379> of<00:01:05.500> water<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.580> and

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
you add four quarts of water to it and

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.290 
you add four quarts of water to it and
it<00:01:07.090> expands<00:01:07.450> up<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.750> eight<00:01:08.110> times<00:01:08.350> its<00:01:08.680> size<00:01:09.300> so

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
it expands up to eight times its size so

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.380 
it expands up to eight times its size so
to<00:01:11.170> measure<00:01:11.440> it<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.920> measuring<00:01:12.640> cup<00:01:12.820> obviously

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
to measure it is measuring cup obviously

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.370 
to measure it is measuring cup obviously
and<00:01:14.910> after<00:01:15.910> you<00:01:16.030> add<00:01:16.240> four<00:01:16.840> cups<00:01:16.869> of<00:01:17.200> these

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
and after you add four cups of these

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.260 
and after you add four cups of these
you'll<00:01:18.130> have<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.580> ton<00:01:18.759> of<00:01:18.789> substrate<00:01:20.280> after<00:01:21.280> 20

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
you'll have a ton of substrate after 20

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.230 
you'll have a ton of substrate after 20
to<00:01:22.539> 30<00:01:22.869> minutes<00:01:23.289> of<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:24.100> water<00:01:24.340> with<00:01:24.940> the

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
to 30 minutes of the water with the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.670 
to 30 minutes of the water with the
equal<00:01:26.140> earth<00:01:26.289> then<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.430> can<00:01:27.610> put<00:01:27.820> it<00:01:28.680> into

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
equal earth then you can put it into

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.930 
equal earth then you can put it into
your<00:01:30.479> cleaned<00:01:31.479> out<00:01:31.600> cage<00:01:32.190> after<00:01:33.190> you're<00:01:33.759> done

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
your cleaned out cage after you're done

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.350 
your cleaned out cage after you're done
putting<00:01:34.420> all<00:01:34.810> your<00:01:34.869> substrate<00:01:35.440> from<00:01:35.740> your<00:01:36.070> bin

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
putting all your substrate from your bin

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.840 
putting all your substrate from your bin
into<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.780> cage<00:01:38.500> then<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.130> can<00:01:39.310> start<00:01:39.550> putting

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
into the cage then you can start putting

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.570 
into the cage then you can start putting
all<00:01:40.270> your<00:01:40.830> stuff<00:01:41.830> back<00:01:42.009> in<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.490> have<00:01:43.110> two<00:01:44.110> hides

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
bottom with a god I can't remem 18 gauge

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.999

and I have a piece of wood just kind of

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.400 
and I have a piece of wood just kind of
for<00:02:03.190> decoration<00:02:03.789> you<00:02:03.880> don't<00:02:04.030> need<00:02:04.239> one<00:02:04.450> and

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
for decoration you don't need one and

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.270 
for decoration you don't need one and
also<00:02:05.560> have<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.190> lot<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.759> plants<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:08.619> we<00:02:08.920> really

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
also have a lot of plants but we really

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.110 
also have a lot of plants but we really
need<00:02:09.459> is<00:02:09.489> two<00:02:10.179> thermometers<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:12.120> fish

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
need is two thermometers the fish

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.140 
need is two thermometers the fish
thermometers<00:02:13.750> work<00:02:14.080> well<00:02:14.319> because<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.940> can

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
thermometers work well because you can

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.949 
thermometers work well because you can
put<00:02:16.450> them<00:02:16.569> like<00:02:17.140> exactly<00:02:17.739> on<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.920> ground<00:02:18.220> so

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
put them like exactly on the ground so

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.600 
put them like exactly on the ground so
they<00:02:19.959> measure<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.530> temperature<00:02:20.980> on<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
they measure the temperature on the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.710 
they measure the temperature on the
ground<00:02:21.880> where<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> snake<00:02:22.780> mostly<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.319> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
ground where the snake mostly is and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.510 
ground where the snake mostly is and
that<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.930> really<00:02:26.590> all<00:02:27.870> once<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.310> put<00:02:30.310> all<00:02:30.489> your

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
that is really all once you put all your

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.600 
that is really all once you put all your
stuff<00:02:30.700> in<00:02:31.150> you've<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.989> water<00:02:32.260> bowl<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:34.230> have

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
stuff in you've a water bowl and I have

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.860 
stuff in you've a water bowl and I have
aqua<00:02:36.610> tizer<00:02:36.840> which<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:38.020> add<00:02:38.349> two<00:02:38.770> drops<00:02:39.870> every

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
aqua tizer which I add two drops every

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.490 
aqua tizer which I add two drops every
like<00:02:41.709> bowl<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.989> takes<00:02:44.290> all<00:02:44.470> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
like bowl and that takes all the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.190 
like bowl and that takes all the
chlorine<00:02:44.980> out<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.580> tap<00:02:45.790> water<00:02:46.829> and

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
chlorine out of the tap water and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.990 
chlorine out of the tap water and
pretty<00:02:49.069> much<00:02:49.190> all<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.930> did<00:02:50.930> get<00:02:51.140> him<00:02:51.530> another

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
pretty much all I did get him another

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.369 
pretty much all I did get him another
log<00:02:53.000> that's<00:02:53.840> really<00:02:54.260> all<00:02:54.560> that's<00:02:55.550> new<00:02:55.819> for<00:02:55.849> him

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
log that's really all that's new for him

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.750 
log that's really all that's new for him
so<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:59.269> this<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.450> your<00:02:59.680> life<00:03:00.680> what<00:03:01.129> my<00:03:01.340> final

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
so so this is your life what my final

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.610 
so so this is your life what my final
Kate<00:03:01.940> setup<00:03:02.300> looks<00:03:02.450> like<00:03:02.750> it's<00:03:04.000> pretty<00:03:05.620> like

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
Kate setup looks like it's pretty like

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.759 
Kate setup looks like it's pretty like
compact<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.400> guess<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:09.290> because<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.590> has<00:03:09.739> a

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
compact I guess just because it has a

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.610 
compact I guess just because it has a
lot<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:09.980> plants<00:03:10.510> but<00:03:11.510> i<00:03:11.780> also<00:03:12.140> like<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.410> mention

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
lot of plants but i also like to mention
