wah-wah pedal on to add like sort of

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.560 
wah-wah pedal on to add like sort of
extra<00:00:11.099> sort<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> white<00:00:11.639> noise<00:00:11.940> it's<00:00:12.420> because

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
extra sort of a white noise it's because

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.759 
extra sort of a white noise it's because
if<00:00:12.660> you're<00:00:12.750> gonna<00:00:12.840> do<00:00:12.990> some<00:00:13.139> scratching<00:00:13.590> stuff

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
if you're gonna do some scratching stuff

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.760 
if you're gonna do some scratching stuff
it's<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.190> high<00:00:14.400> ends<00:00:14.759> better<00:00:15.650> turn<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
it's but the high ends better turn the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.849 
it's but the high ends better turn the
pickup<00:00:17.100> selector<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.730> maximum<00:00:18.720> rock<00:00:19.470> power

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
pickup selector to maximum rock power

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.800 
pickup selector to maximum rock power
and<00:00:20.220> then<00:00:21.199> just<00:00:22.199> kind<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.880> but<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.300> use<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and then just kind of but I use the you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.509 
and then just kind of but I use the you
know<00:00:24.869> my<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.289> hand<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.769> scratcher<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
know my this hand is the scratcher and

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:41.000 
know my this hand is the scratcher and
and<00:00:26.789> then<00:00:27.420> nothing<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.410> goes<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and then nothing and it goes like that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.350 
and then nothing and it goes like that
leave<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> full<00:00:42.420> treble<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.899> his<00:00:43.079> back<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:47.360> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
leave a full treble on his back and the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.209 
leave a full treble on his back and the
total<00:00:48.809> change<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.260> come<00:00:49.289> from<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.129> know

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
total change has come from you know

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.369 
total change has come from you know
where<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.480> left<00:00:51.809> hands<00:00:51.989> rubbing<00:00:52.199> on

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
where you know the left hands rubbing on

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.689 
where you know the left hands rubbing on
the<00:00:52.469> string

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.090 

it's<00:00:58.269> less<00:00:58.539> kind<00:00:58.809> of<00:00:58.870> about<00:00:59.109> this<00:00:59.710> is<00:00:59.890> how<00:01:00.070> a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
it's less kind of about this is how a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.619 
it's less kind of about this is how a
thing<00:01:00.399> is<00:01:00.550> done<00:01:00.789> it's<00:01:00.999> more<00:01:01.179> kind<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.449> about

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
thing is done it's more kind of about

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.710 
thing is done it's more kind of about
just<00:01:01.960> like<00:01:02.440> having<00:01:02.800> a<00:01:02.890> disregard<00:01:03.730> for<00:01:03.940> the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
just like having a disregard for the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.359 
just like having a disregard for the
tradition<00:01:05.290> of<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.500> instrument<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.040> this<00:01:06.250> is

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
tradition of the instrument and this is

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.399 
tradition of the instrument and this is
just<00:01:06.549> a<00:01:06.640> piece<00:01:06.820> of<00:01:06.970> wood<00:01:07.149> it's<00:01:07.600> six<00:01:07.840> wires<00:01:08.080> it's

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
just a piece of wood it's six wires it's

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.740 
just a piece of wood it's six wires it's
a<00:01:08.470> few<00:01:08.649> electronics<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.759> know<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.299> was

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
a few electronics you know and I was

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.450 
a few electronics you know and I was
writing<00:01:11.020> down<00:01:11.049> notes<00:01:11.439> to<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:11.710> song<00:01:11.799> one<00:01:12.189> day<00:01:12.340> and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
writing down notes to a song one day and

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.830 
writing down notes to a song one day and
I<00:01:12.520> penciled<00:01:12.909> my<00:01:12.970> hand<00:01:13.180> I<00:01:13.299> had<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.570> you<00:01:13.810> know

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
I penciled my hand I had the you know

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.039 
I penciled my hand I had the you know
the<00:01:14.220> delay<00:01:15.220> pedal<00:01:15.580> sets<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:16.000> short<00:01:16.479> delay<00:01:16.630> and

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
the delay pedal sets a short delay and

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:26.850 
the delay pedal sets a short delay and
then<00:01:17.170> I<00:01:25.289> mean<00:01:26.289> that's<00:01:26.439> not<00:01:26.560> particularly

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
then I mean that's not particularly

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.160 
then I mean that's not particularly
rocket<00:01:27.280> science<00:01:27.670> it's<00:01:27.789> a<00:01:27.850> pencil<00:01:28.060> delay<00:01:28.780> pedal

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
rocket science it's a pencil delay pedal

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.020 
rocket science it's a pencil delay pedal
but

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.719 

this<00:01:35.540> was<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.840> 2003

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
this was the 2003

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.029 
this was the 2003
which<00:01:38.090> is<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.299> again<00:01:39.049> a<00:01:39.079> delay<00:01:39.500> pedal<00:01:39.649> sets<00:01:39.950> a

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
which is a again a delay pedal sets a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.630 
which is a again a delay pedal sets a
short<00:01:40.280> delay<00:01:40.810> sort<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.869> slap<00:01:42.170> back<00:01:42.409> delay<00:01:42.640> the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
short delay sort of slap back delay the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.999 
short delay sort of slap back delay the
whammy<00:01:43.850> pedal<00:01:44.000> set<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.719> an<00:01:44.990> octave<00:01:45.590> below<00:01:46.869> and

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
whammy pedal set to an octave below and

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.990 
whammy pedal set to an octave below and
then<00:01:49.009> I<00:01:49.369> just<00:01:49.729> use<00:01:50.530> picking<00:01:51.530> mouth<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:52.700> right

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
then I just use picking mouth and right

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.210 
then I just use picking mouth and right
hand<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.360> just<00:01:53.479> sort<00:01:53.659> of<00:01:53.750> baby<00:01:54.619> slap<00:01:55.009> the

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
hand to just sort of baby slap the

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:56.590 
hand to just sort of baby slap the
strings<00:01:55.579> while<00:01:55.850> manipulating<00:01:56.479> them

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.050 

and<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.170> made<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.560> sound<00:02:59.060> more

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
and that just made the sound more

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.260 
and that just made the sound more
voluptuous<00:03:00.420> by<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.110> short<00:03:02.010> delay<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.610> slap

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
voluptuous by the short delay a slap

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.920 
voluptuous by the short delay a slap
