00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.840 

so<00:00:01.170> now<00:00:01.589> that<00:00:01.650> we<00:00:01.890> understand<00:00:03.020> number<00:00:04.020> systems

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850 
so now that we understand number systems

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.700 
so now that we understand number systems
one<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.029> questions<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.540> often<00:00:07.080> comes<00:00:07.410> is

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
one of the questions that often comes is

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.430 
one of the questions that often comes is
is<00:00:10.370> how<00:00:11.370> do<00:00:11.429> computers<00:00:12.120> represent<00:00:12.750> numbers

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
is how do computers represent numbers

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.970 
is how do computers represent numbers
that<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.099> do<00:00:14.790> numbers<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.719> always<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:16.500> of

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
that is do numbers have to always be of

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.890 
that is do numbers have to always be of
a<00:00:17.160> certain<00:00:17.490> length<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.090> if<00:00:18.390> they<00:00:18.570> are<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.810> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
a certain length and if they are of a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.970 
a certain length and if they are of a
certain<00:00:19.230> length<00:00:19.380> what<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.710> they<00:00:19.830> represent

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
certain length what do they represent

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.620 
certain length what do they represent
the<00:00:20.789> most<00:00:21.060> common<00:00:21.600> number<00:00:21.810> we<00:00:22.140> represent<00:00:22.769> in

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
the most common number we represent in

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.700 
the most common number we represent in
on<00:00:24.630> computers<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.800> integers<00:00:27.199> integers<00:00:28.199> are

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
on computers are integers integers are

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.550 
on computers are integers integers are
are<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.150> most<00:00:30.330> common<00:00:30.720> numbers<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.380> integers

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
are the most common numbers and integers

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.740 
are the most common numbers and integers
by<00:00:32.460> definition<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.430> are<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.420> number

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
by definition if you are on the number

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.819 
by definition if you are on the number
line<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.380> positive<00:00:38.040> integers<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.940> some

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
line you have positive integers so some

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.400 
line you have positive integers so some
some<00:00:40.829> maximum<00:00:41.489> positive<00:00:41.760> integer<00:00:42.570> zero<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
some maximum positive integer zero to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.369 
some maximum positive integer zero to
maximum<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.399> some<00:00:47.780> negative<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
maximum and some negative on the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.979 
maximum and some negative on the
negative<00:00:49.800> number<00:00:50.190> line<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.059> numbers

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
negative number line so we have numbers

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.279 
negative number line so we have numbers
represented<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> number<00:00:53.610> line<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:57.289> for

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
represented on the number line so for

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.920 
represented on the number line so for
the<00:00:58.350> most<00:00:58.530> part<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.370> are<00:00:59.399> happy<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> represent

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the most part we are happy to represent

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.579 
the most part we are happy to represent
numbers<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.620> being<00:01:02.239> unsigned<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.600> that's

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
numbers as being unsigned and that's

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.510 
numbers as being unsigned and that's
what<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:04.920> did<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.460> last<00:01:06.770> last<00:01:07.770> description

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
what we did in the last last description

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.640 
what we did in the last last description
when<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.119> say<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> number<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.840> unsigned<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.590> are

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
when we say a number is unsigned we are

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.330 
when we say a number is unsigned we are
primarily<00:01:11.220> focusing<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.210> numbers<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.680> range

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
primarily focusing on numbers that range

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.499 
primarily focusing on numbers that range
from<00:01:14.880> from<00:01:15.689> 0<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.170> some<00:01:16.560> positive<00:01:16.610> maximum<00:01:17.610> so

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
from from 0 to some positive maximum so

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.679 
from from 0 to some positive maximum so
unsigned<00:01:19.170> numbers<00:01:19.590> don't<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.689> positive

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
unsigned numbers don't have a positive

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.620 
unsigned numbers don't have a positive
or<00:01:21.869> negative<00:01:22.320> sign<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:23.759> an<00:01:23.909> unsigned<00:01:24.270> number

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
or negative sign so an unsigned number

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
or negative sign so an unsigned number
so<00:01:24.900> let's<00:01:25.049> take<00:01:25.290> an<00:01:25.409> example<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.979> an<00:01:26.070> unsigned

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
so let's take an example of an unsigned

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.899 
so let's take an example of an unsigned
number<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.540> an<00:01:27.689> unsigned<00:01:28.020> number<00:01:28.439> 1<00:01:29.130> 0<00:01:29.490> 0

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
number here is an unsigned number 1 0 0

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.149 
number here is an unsigned number 1 0 0
0<00:01:30.770> 1<00:01:31.770> 1<00:01:31.799> 0<00:01:32.100> 1<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.110> told<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.100> is

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
0 1 1 0 1 and if I told you that this is

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.580 
0 1 1 0 1 and if I told you that this is
an<00:01:35.310> unsigned<00:01:35.670> number<00:01:36.060> which<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.390> binary<00:01:36.810> we

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
an unsigned number which is in binary we

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.350 
an unsigned number which is in binary we
know<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> represents<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.939> know<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.240> it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
know what it represents we know that it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.490 
know what it represents we know that it
represents<00:01:39.960> again<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:40.979> gonna<00:01:41.840> just<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.079> make

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
represents again I'm gonna just to make

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.710 
represents again I'm gonna just to make
the<00:01:43.649> point<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.220> say<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.000> has<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> position

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the point I say that this has a position

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:54.800 
the point I say that this has a position
of<00:01:45.810> 0<00:01:46.140> 1<00:01:46.799> 2<00:01:47.520> 3<00:01:48.170> 4<00:01:49.170> 5<00:01:50.009> 6<00:01:50.939> &amp;<00:01:51.270> 7<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:53.600> one<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 &amp; 7 and so one of the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.380 
of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 &amp; 7 and so one of the
convenient<00:01:55.170> things<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.700> look<00:01:57.240> at

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
convenient things to do is to look at

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.069 
convenient things to do is to look at
the<00:01:57.509> numbers<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:59.100> identify<00:01:59.820> the

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
the numbers and just identify the

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.260 
the numbers and just identify the
coefficients<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.860> nonzero<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:03.090> this

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
coefficients that are nonzero in this

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.209 
coefficients that are nonzero in this
case<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:03.960> coefficients<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
case the one coefficients so the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.109 
case the one coefficients so the
coefficients<00:02:06.030> occur<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.799> positions

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
coefficients occur in positions

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.589 
coefficients occur in positions
zero<00:02:10.119> one<00:02:10.929> two<00:02:11.409> three<00:02:11.680> four<00:02:12.219> five<00:02:12.909> six<00:02:13.329> and

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
zero one two three four five six and

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.309 
zero one two three four five six and
seven

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
seven

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.830 
seven
and<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:16.659> place<00:02:16.989> values<00:02:17.790> accordingly<00:02:18.790> are<00:02:20.700> one

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
and the place values accordingly are one

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.649 
and the place values accordingly are one
that's<00:02:22.840> 2<00:02:23.319> this<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.189> 4<00:02:24.670> because<00:02:25.090> that's<00:02:25.239> 2<00:02:25.540> to

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
that's 2 this is 4 because that's 2 to

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:33.360 
that's 2 this is 4 because that's 2 to
the<00:02:25.780> 2<00:02:26.019> this<00:02:26.349> is<00:02:26.530> 8<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:29.099> 6<00:02:30.239> 16<00:02:31.319> 32<00:02:32.370> 64

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
the 2 this is 8 and this is a 6 16 32 64

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.250 
the 2 this is 8 and this is a 6 16 32 64
and<00:02:33.930> 128<00:02:35.639> so<00:02:36.639> I'm<00:02:37.000> going<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> write<00:02:38.049> this

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
and 128 so I'm going to write this

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:48.330 
and 128 so I'm going to write this
number<00:02:38.739> as<00:02:40.139> 1<00:02:41.139> plus<00:02:42.120> 4<00:02:43.120> plus<00:02:44.019> 8<00:02:44.829> plus<00:02:46.650> 128<00:02:47.650> which

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
number as 1 plus 4 plus 8 plus 128 which

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.289 
number as 1 plus 4 plus 8 plus 128 which
is<00:02:48.699> the<00:02:49.150> number<00:02:51.030> 141<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.810> base<00:02:53.639> 10<00:02:54.639> so<00:02:55.030> what<00:02:55.150> if

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
is the number 141 in base 10 so what if

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.059 
is the number 141 in base 10 so what if
we<00:02:55.389> want<00:02:55.599> to<00:02:55.659> represent<00:02:55.870> numbers<00:02:56.349> that<00:02:56.829> can

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
we want to represent numbers that can

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.610 
we want to represent numbers that can
have<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.549> sign<00:02:57.819> that<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.780> can<00:02:58.959> be<00:02:59.109> a<00:02:59.290> positive

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
have a sign that it can be a positive

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.009 
have a sign that it can be a positive
number<00:02:59.949> or<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.519> negative<00:03:00.699> number<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:01.659> let's

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
number or a negative number so let's

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.020 
number or a negative number so let's
take<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> look<00:03:02.530> at<00:03:02.739> what<00:03:03.040> what<00:03:03.790> such<00:03:04.000> a

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
take a look at what what such a

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.929 
take a look at what what such a
representation<00:03:04.870> would<00:03:04.959> look<00:03:05.169> like<00:03:05.379> so<00:03:05.939> the

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
representation would look like so the

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:12.589 
representation would look like so the
number<00:03:07.299> zero<00:03:07.780> one<00:03:08.019> zero<00:03:08.680> zero<00:03:09.639> zero<00:03:10.500> 1<00:03:11.500> 1<00:03:11.769> zero

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
number zero one zero zero zero 1 1 zero

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.119 
number zero one zero zero zero 1 1 zero
let's<00:03:13.599> say<00:03:13.750> this<00:03:13.900> were<00:03:14.079> a<00:03:14.139> sign<00:03:14.500> number<00:03:14.979> in

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
let's say this were a sign number in

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.550 
let's say this were a sign number in
base<00:03:15.340> two<00:03:15.759> what<00:03:16.689> we<00:03:16.840> do<00:03:17.049> when<00:03:17.379> we're

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
base two what we do when we're

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.789 
base two what we do when we're
representing<00:03:18.129> sign<00:03:18.400> numbers<00:03:18.879> is<00:03:19.150> we<00:03:20.019> assign<00:03:20.560> a

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
representing sign numbers is we assign a

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.179 
representing sign numbers is we assign a
special<00:03:21.159> meaning<00:03:21.849> to<00:03:22.199> the<00:03:23.199> most<00:03:23.470> significant

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.189 
special meaning to the most significant

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:31.189 
special meaning to the most significant
bit<00:03:24.430> we<00:03:25.209> call<00:03:25.479> this<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.989> sign<00:03:28.739> bit<00:03:29.739> and

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
bit we call this the sign bit and

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.490 
bit we call this the sign bit and
significance<00:03:32.199> is<00:03:32.439> that<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:33.099> sign<00:03:33.669> bit<00:03:33.970> is

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
significance is that a sign bit is

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.030 
significance is that a sign bit is
either<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.650> 0<00:03:36.250> or<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.549> 1<00:03:36.729> to<00:03:37.659> represent<00:03:38.040> positive

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
either a 0 or a 1 to represent positive

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.690 
either a 0 or a 1 to represent positive
numbers

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.190 

our<00:03:44.830> negative<00:03:45.830> numbers

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.100 

so<00:03:51.040> here<00:03:51.280> is<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.400> number<00:03:51.670> because<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.900> has<00:03:53.080> a

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
so here is a number because it has a

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.390 
so here is a number because it has a
zero<00:03:53.650> here<00:03:53.950> is<00:03:54.130> has<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.970> be<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.180> positive<00:03:55.599> number

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
zero here is has to be a positive number

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.059 
zero here is has to be a positive number
so<00:03:57.400> let's<00:03:58.030> understand<00:03:58.660> what<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.650> number

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
so let's understand what this number

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.270 
so let's understand what this number
represents<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:01.090> this<00:04:01.840> this<00:04:02.680> number<00:04:02.920> then

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
represents so this this this number then

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.970 
represents so this this this number then
has<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:04.150> bit<00:04:04.450> this<00:04:04.780> bit<00:04:04.840> represents<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.770> place

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
has the bit this bit represents a place

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.400 
has the bit this bit represents a place
value<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.550> two<00:04:06.880> this<00:04:07.510> represents<00:04:08.140> a<00:04:08.200> place

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
value of two this represents a place

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.360 
value of two this represents a place
value<00:04:08.620> of<00:04:08.860> four<00:04:09.700> so<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.690> then<00:04:11.440> we<00:04:11.680> have<00:04:11.830> six

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
value of four so and then we have six

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.960 
value of four so and then we have six
eight<00:04:13.050> 16<00:04:14.050> 32<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:16.560> 64<00:04:17.560> so<00:04:18.100> this<00:04:18.310> number<00:04:18.519> then

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
eight 16 32 and 64 so this number then

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:28.170 
eight 16 32 and 64 so this number then
represents<00:04:20.220> 64<00:04:21.510> plus<00:04:22.510> four<00:04:22.990> plus<00:04:23.310> two<00:04:27.180> which

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
represents 64 plus four plus two which

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.710 
represents 64 plus four plus two which
is<00:04:28.620> 70<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.860> base<00:04:30.479> 10

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
is 70 in base 10

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.650 
is 70 in base 10
now<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:33.040> a<00:04:33.070> number<00:04:33.310> that<00:04:33.910> is<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.090> positive

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
now this is a number that is a positive

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.870 
now this is a number that is a positive
number<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.260> what<00:04:35.590> if<00:04:35.680> we<00:04:35.889> have<00:04:36.040> a<00:04:36.070> sign<00:04:36.430> number

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
number so what if we have a sign number

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.330 
number so what if we have a sign number
that<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.180> negative<00:04:37.419> number<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:38.320> sign<00:04:38.979> number

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
that is a negative number a sign number

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.129 
that is a negative number a sign number
that<00:04:39.520> is<00:04:39.639> negative<00:04:40.180> let's<00:04:40.479> take<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.720> simple

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
that is negative let's take a simple

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:47.610 
that is negative let's take a simple
example<00:04:41.290> of<00:04:41.800> such<00:04:42.010> a<00:04:42.040> number<00:04:46.169> here<00:04:47.169> is<00:04:47.290> a<00:04:47.320> sign

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
example of such a number here is a sign

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.560 
example of such a number here is a sign
number<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.250> is<00:04:48.570> negative<00:04:49.570> so<00:04:49.840> 1<00:04:50.260> 0<00:04:51.030> 0<00:04:52.030> 0<00:04:52.710> 1<00:04:53.710> 1<00:04:54.040> 0

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
number that is negative so 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.100 
number that is negative so 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
1<00:04:55.570> and<00:04:55.930> again<00:04:56.860> we<00:04:57.280> notice<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:58.030> because<00:04:58.840> this

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
1 and again we notice that because this

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.880 
1 and again we notice that because this
bit<00:04:59.410> is<00:04:59.620> a<00:04:59.950> 1<00:05:00.570> this<00:05:01.570> tells<00:05:01.900> us<00:05:02.080> that<00:05:02.500> this

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
bit is a 1 this tells us that this

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.290 
bit is a 1 this tells us that this
number<00:05:03.160> has<00:05:03.580> to<00:05:03.789> be<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:04.030> negative<00:05:04.900> number<00:05:05.229> so

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
number has to be a negative number so

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.190 
number has to be a negative number so
what<00:05:07.300> does<00:05:07.450> it<00:05:07.570> represent

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
what does it represent

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.200 
what does it represent
well<00:05:08.770> our<00:05:09.010> place<00:05:09.520> values<00:05:10.060> are<00:05:10.470> 1<00:05:11.789> that's<00:05:12.789> a<00:05:12.940> 2

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
well our place values are 1 that's a 2

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.880 
well our place values are 1 that's a 2
that's<00:05:13.930> 4<00:05:14.310> that's<00:05:15.310> an<00:05:15.460> 8<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:16.229> this<00:05:17.229> still<00:05:17.650> has

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
that's 4 that's an 8 and this still has

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.590 
that's 4 that's an 8 and this still has
a<00:05:18.160> place<00:05:18.400> value<00:05:18.880> which<00:05:19.030> is<00:05:19.530> 128<00:05:20.530> but<00:05:21.430> now<00:05:22.000> we

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
a place value which is 128 but now we

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.020 
a place value which is 128 but now we
notice<00:05:22.990> that<00:05:23.169> this<00:05:23.350> number<00:05:23.430> will<00:05:24.430> actually

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
notice that this number will actually

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:34.129 
notice that this number will actually
represent<00:05:25.630> 1<00:05:25.960> plus<00:05:26.490> 4<00:05:27.490> plus<00:05:28.180> 8<00:05:28.780> plus<00:05:29.460> a<00:05:30.840> minus

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.490 

1:28<00:05:35.580> because<00:05:36.580> that's<00:05:36.760> a<00:05:36.850> negative<00:05:37.290> number<00:05:38.290> so

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
1:28 because that's a negative number so

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.870 
1:28 because that's a negative number so
this<00:05:39.070> number<00:05:39.250> represents<00:05:40.060> a<00:05:40.240> minus<00:05:41.200> 1<00:05:41.620> 1<00:05:41.950> 5<00:05:42.460> in

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
this number represents a minus 1 1 5 in

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:51.120 
this number represents a minus 1 1 5 in
base<00:05:44.130> 10<00:05:47.220> so<00:05:48.540> so<00:05:49.540> in<00:05:49.720> summary<00:05:50.110> then<00:05:50.380> let's<00:05:50.740> see

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
base 10 so so in summary then let's see

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.360 
base 10 so so in summary then let's see
if<00:05:51.460> we<00:05:51.790> can<00:05:52.050> understand<00:05:53.050> something<00:05:53.680> about<00:05:53.800> the

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
if we can understand something about the

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.340 
if we can understand something about the
ranges<00:05:55.240> that<00:05:55.540> these<00:05:56.020> these<00:05:56.590> two<00:05:56.650> number

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
ranges that these these two number

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.120 
ranges that these these two number
representations<00:05:59.350> can<00:05:59.680> can<00:06:00.400> capture<00:06:00.850> so<00:06:02.130> let's

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
representations can can capture so let's

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.260 
representations can can capture so let's
look<00:06:03.669> at<00:06:03.970> how<00:06:04.450> sign<00:06:05.260> unsigned<00:06:06.040> numbers<00:06:06.520> go

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
look at how sign unsigned numbers go

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.420 
look at how sign unsigned numbers go
from<00:06:07.300> for<00:06:07.900> example<00:06:08.320> if<00:06:08.410> I<00:06:08.500> have<00:06:08.590> 8<00:06:08.830> bits<00:06:09.190> that<00:06:09.400> I

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
from for example if I have 8 bits that I

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.280 
from for example if I have 8 bits that I
have<00:06:09.790> at<00:06:10.169> 8<00:06:11.169> bits<00:06:11.590> to<00:06:11.860> represent<00:06:12.330> then<00:06:13.330> I<00:06:13.600> can

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
have at 8 bits to represent then I can

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:21.620 
have at 8 bits to represent then I can
go<00:06:14.470> from<00:06:14.680> 0<00:06:15.250> so<00:06:16.030> from<00:06:16.240> here<00:06:16.800> all<00:06:17.800> the<00:06:17.860> way<00:06:18.520> up<00:06:18.820> to

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.870 

255<00:06:24.390> now<00:06:25.390> if<00:06:25.690> I<00:06:25.960> have<00:06:26.140> a<00:06:26.169> sign<00:06:26.650> number<00:06:27.130> again<00:06:27.729> in

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
255 now if I have a sign number again in

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.620 
255 now if I have a sign number again in
8<00:06:28.150> bits<00:06:29.669> because<00:06:30.669> I<00:06:30.700> have<00:06:30.940> to<00:06:31.060> represent<00:06:31.180> both

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
8 bits because I have to represent both

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.110 
8 bits because I have to represent both
positive<00:06:32.260> and<00:06:32.380> negative<00:06:33.070> numbers<00:06:33.550> I<00:06:33.760> will

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
positive and negative numbers I will

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:41.310 
positive and negative numbers I will
only<00:06:34.419> be<00:06:34.540> able<00:06:35.200> to<00:06:35.320> represent<00:06:39.360> 127<00:06:40.360> on<00:06:40.600> the

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
only be able to represent 127 on the

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.880 
only be able to represent 127 on the
positive<00:06:41.860> side<00:06:41.890> and<00:06:42.430> I<00:06:43.210> will<00:06:43.720> represent<00:06:44.169> minus

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
positive side and I will represent minus

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.020 
positive side and I will represent minus
128<00:06:45.820> on<00:06:46.330> the<00:06:46.860> negative<00:06:47.860> side<00:06:47.890> so<00:06:48.370> the<00:06:48.490> range<00:06:48.729> is

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
128 on the negative side so the range is

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.750 
128 on the negative side so the range is
from<00:06:49.600> minus<00:06:50.110> 128<00:06:50.710> to<00:06:51.250> Plus<00:06:51.870> 127<00:06:53.640> here<00:06:54.640> is<00:06:54.729> a

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
from minus 128 to Plus 127 here is a

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.510 
from minus 128 to Plus 127 here is a
neat<00:06:55.030> little<00:06:55.110> trick<00:06:56.110> that<00:06:56.440> we<00:06:56.740> use<00:06:56.979> sometimes

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
neat little trick that we use sometimes

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.480 
neat little trick that we use sometimes
when<00:06:57.789> we<00:06:57.940> want<00:06:58.090> to<00:06:58.270> show<00:06:58.539> numbers<00:06:59.200> and<00:06:59.740> show

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
when we want to show numbers and show

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.090 
when we want to show numbers and show
them<00:07:00.700> in<00:07:01.020> not<00:07:02.020> in<00:07:02.169> their<00:07:02.320> full<00:07:02.590> glory<00:07:02.620> in

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.100 
them in not in their full glory in

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.790 
them in not in their full glory in
binary<00:07:03.640> but<00:07:04.030> to<00:07:04.330> show<00:07:04.930> them<00:07:05.169> as<00:07:07.020> in<00:07:08.020> hex<00:07:08.350> so<00:07:08.620> we

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
binary but to show them as in hex so we

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:17.610 
binary but to show them as in hex so we
could<00:07:08.950> write<00:07:09.130> this<00:07:09.340> number<00:07:09.850> again<00:07:10.630> as<00:07:14.250> 8<00:07:16.229> 4<00:07:17.229> by

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
could write this number again as 8 4 by

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.690 
could write this number again as 8 4 by
D<00:07:18.280> because<00:07:18.760> that's<00:07:19.240> a<00:07:19.390> 1<00:07:19.630> 1<00:07:19.930> 0<00:07:20.350> 1<00:07:20.380> which<00:07:20.919> is<00:07:21.100> 12

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:21.700 
D because that's a 1 1 0 1 which is 12

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.880 
D because that's a 1 1 0 1 which is 12
plus<00:07:22.030> 1<00:07:22.950> which<00:07:23.950> is<00:07:24.300> 13<00:07:25.300> 13<00:07:25.570> stands<00:07:25.990> for<00:07:26.229> D<00:07:26.380> so<00:07:26.830> I

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:26.890 
plus 1 which is 13 13 stands for D so I

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.750 
plus 1 which is 13 13 stands for D so I
could<00:07:27.100> represent<00:07:27.310> this<00:07:27.760> number<00:07:28.030> as<00:07:28.390> 0<00:07:28.780> x8<00:07:29.760> D

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:30.760 
could represent this number as 0 x8 D

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.909 
could represent this number as 0 x8 D
and<00:07:31.060> that's<00:07:31.600> simply<00:07:31.840> a<00:07:31.990> convenient<00:07:32.500> way<00:07:32.860> so

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
and that's simply a convenient way so

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.920 
and that's simply a convenient way so
that<00:07:33.190> when<00:07:33.550> we<00:07:33.729> look<00:07:33.880> at<00:07:34.000> numbers<00:07:34.630> it's

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
that when we look at numbers it's

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.140 
that when we look at numbers it's
sometimes<00:07:35.770> simpler<00:07:36.190> to<00:07:36.340> represent<00:07:36.820> them<00:07:36.970> as

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.150 
sometimes simpler to represent them as

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.070 
sometimes simpler to represent them as
binary<00:07:37.830> represent<00:07:38.830> them<00:07:38.979> as<00:07:39.160> hex<00:07:39.490> or

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 
binary represent them as hex or

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:50.420 
binary represent them as hex or
represent<00:07:41.080> them<00:07:41.289> as<00:07:42.180> decimal

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.430 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.150 

okay
