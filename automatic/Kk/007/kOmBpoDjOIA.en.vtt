important<00:04:31.750> thing<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.080> start<00:04:32.440> putting<00:04:32.680> in

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
important thing is to start putting in

important thing is to start putting in
the<00:04:33.190> electron<00:04:33.790> rich<00:04:34.090> alkaline<00:04:35.050> fluid<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:35.620> you

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
the electron rich alkaline fluid so you

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.890 
the electron rich alkaline fluid so you
can<00:04:35.860> neutralize<00:04:36.400> those<00:04:36.700> acids<00:04:37.300> from<00:04:37.720> the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
can neutralize those acids from the

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.810 
can neutralize those acids from the
foods<00:04:38.140> that<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:38.590> are<00:04:38.770> eating<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.220> help<00:04:39.669> to

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
foods that you are eating and help to

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.360 
foods that you are eating and help to
maintain<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.600> alkaline<00:04:41.080> design<00:04:41.440> when<00:04:42.250> I

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
maintain that alkaline design when I

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.880 
maintain that alkaline design when I
have<00:04:42.550> any<00:04:42.700> patients<00:04:43.240> who<00:04:43.360> have<00:04:43.630> an<00:04:43.930> illness<00:04:44.440> of

any time I always suggest that no matter

any time I always suggest that no matter
what<00:04:48.880> else<00:04:49.060> they're<00:04:49.330> doing<00:04:49.690> they<00:04:50.620> always<00:04:51.220> add
