00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.510 
like rubbed Watergate all over him in a
sense<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.350> he<00:02:50.410> really<00:02:50.709> was<00:02:50.860> never<00:02:51.070> adequately

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
sense and he really was never adequately

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.300 
sense and he really was never adequately
able<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.030> explain<00:02:52.450> or<00:02:52.930> he<00:02:53.050> refused<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.650> why<00:02:53.980> he

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
able to explain or he refused to why he

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.460 
able to explain or he refused to why he
did<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.330> looked<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:55.690> he<00:02:55.900> maybe<00:02:56.200> had<00:02:56.440> a

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
did it so it looked like he maybe had a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.230 
did it so it looked like he maybe had a
connection<00:02:56.800> there<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.730> think<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.060> lot<00:02:58.209> of

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
connection there and I think a lot of

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.270 
connection there and I think a lot of
Americans<00:02:58.750> how<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.350> against<00:02:59.709> him<00:02:59.860> there's<00:03:00.250> a

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
Americans how that against him there's a

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.250 
Americans how that against him there's a
lot<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.520> cynicism<00:03:00.820> in<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.900> know<00:03:02.020> political

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
lot of cynicism in you know political

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.040 
lot of cynicism in you know political
life<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.760> end<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.060> 70s<00:03:04.480> from<00:03:04.870> that

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
life in the end of the 70s from that

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.170 
life in the end of the 70s from that
Watergate<00:03:05.470> scandal<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.310> think<00:03:06.700> even<00:03:06.940> going

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
Watergate scandal and I think even going

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.970 
Watergate scandal and I think even going
backwards<00:03:07.720> through<00:03:07.959> like<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.290> 68<00:03:08.770> convention

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
backwards through like the 68 convention

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.670 
backwards through like the 68 convention
and<00:03:09.520> even<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.209> like<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.600> Warren<00:03:10.959> Report<00:03:11.110> look

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
and even to like the Warren Report look

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.199 
and even to like the Warren Report look
at<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:11.860> Kennedy<00:03:12.160> assassination<00:03:12.310> that

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
at the Kennedy assassination that

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.030 
at the Kennedy assassination that
Americans<00:03:13.750> had<00:03:13.900> begun<00:03:14.170> fundamentally<00:03:14.890> to

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
Americans had begun fundamentally to

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.740 
Americans had begun fundamentally to
distrust<00:03:15.519> their<00:03:15.670> government<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:16.239> they're

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
distrust their government so they're

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.199 
distrust their government so they're
really<00:03:16.900> ready<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.410> change<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.220> they're<00:03:19.120> going

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
really ready to change and they're going

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.940 
really ready to change and they're going
to<00:03:19.300> change<00:03:19.480> with<00:03:19.690> Jimmy<00:03:19.930> Carter<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.680> know<00:03:20.709> in

you know Ford kind of had this kind of
like<00:03:49.870> Rose<00:03:50.500> Garden<00:03:50.950> strategy<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.700> trying<00:03:51.820> to

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
fireworks but nevertheless it was really

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.570 
fireworks but nevertheless it was really
good<00:04:04.420> I<00:04:04.630> think<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.019> know<00:04:05.140> like<00:04:05.440> on<00:04:05.620> TV<00:04:06.070> for<00:04:06.400> him

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
good I think you know like on TV for him

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.520 
good I think you know like on TV for him
but<00:04:07.030> he<00:04:07.180> really<00:04:07.420> failed<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.900> connect<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.350> think

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
but he really failed to connect I think

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.350 
but he really failed to connect I think
with<00:04:08.650> ordinary<00:04:08.980> voters<00:04:09.370> by<00:04:09.580> doing<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.150> so

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
with ordinary voters by doing that so

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.210 
with ordinary voters by doing that so
that<00:04:11.110> might<00:04:11.290> have<00:04:11.440> been<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:11.799> know<00:04:11.890> kind<00:04:12.100> of<00:04:12.130> a

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
that might have been you know kind of a

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.380 
that might have been you know kind of a
flawed<00:04:12.459> strategy

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
flawed strategy

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.480 
flawed strategy
today<00:04:13.750> there<00:04:14.530> were<00:04:14.590> other<00:04:14.800> you<00:04:15.100> know<00:04:15.190> kind<00:04:15.460> of

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
today there were other you know kind of

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.400 
today there were other you know kind of
minor<00:04:15.760> things<00:04:15.910> like<00:04:16.359> economically<00:04:17.109> I<00:04:17.230> know

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
minor things like economically I know

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.009 
minor things like economically I know
that<00:04:17.769> Ford<00:04:18.190> is<00:04:18.640> a<00:04:19.000> little<00:04:19.299> bit<00:04:19.420> more<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.930> the

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
that Ford is a little bit more to the

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.840 
that Ford is a little bit more to the
right<00:04:20.200> of<00:04:20.530> most<00:04:20.739> of<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:20.950> country<00:04:20.980> he<00:04:21.549> wanted

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
right of most of the country he wanted

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.570 
right of most of the country he wanted
to<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.210> think<00:04:22.630> like<00:04:23.260> end<00:04:23.470> price<00:04:23.770> controls<00:04:24.280> on

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.960 
to I think like end price controls on
like<00:04:25.420> oil<00:04:25.690> reserves<00:04:26.320> or<00:04:26.470> something<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:26.980> you

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
like oil reserves or something and you

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.240 
like oil reserves or something and you
know<00:04:28.060> kind<00:04:28.300> of<00:04:28.390> a<00:04:28.480> lazy<00:04:29.170> fare<00:04:29.440> deregulation

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
know kind of a lazy fare deregulation

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.860 
know kind of a lazy fare deregulation
kind<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.670> mode<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.180> didn't<00:04:31.450> play<00:04:31.540> very

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
kind of mode and that didn't play very

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.800 
kind of mode and that didn't play very
well<00:04:31.980> for<00:04:32.980> him<00:04:33.130> I<00:04:33.160> think<00:04:33.420> but<00:04:34.420> at<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.600> end<00:04:34.630> of

almost<00:05:31.390> had<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:31.600> nomination<00:05:32.080> that<00:05:32.110> year<00:05:32.470> he

almost had the nomination that year he

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.490 
almost had the nomination that year he
challenged<00:05:33.370> Gerald<00:05:33.729> Ford<00:05:34.030> and<00:05:34.240> I<00:05:34.780> believe<00:05:35.290> it

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
challenged Gerald Ford and I believe it

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.190 
challenged Gerald Ford and I believe it
was<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.710> last<00:05:35.740> time<00:05:36.160> in<00:05:36.790> 1976<00:05:37.720> that<00:05:37.960> a

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
was the last time in 1976 that a

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.500 
was the last time in 1976 that a
convention<00:05:38.919> open<00:05:39.370> kind<00:05:39.669> of<00:05:39.760> in<00:05:39.850> you<00:05:40.090> know<00:05:40.210> not

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
convention open kind of in you know not

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.420 
convention open kind of in you know not
knowing<00:05:40.720> who<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.200> winner<00:05:41.470> was<00:05:41.680> yet<00:05:42.010> it's<00:05:42.310> kind

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
knowing who the winner was yet it's kind

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.770 
knowing who the winner was yet it's kind
of<00:05:42.520> in<00:05:42.640> disarray<00:05:42.910> we<00:05:43.210> thought<00:05:43.390> that<00:05:43.570> maybe

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
of in disarray we thought that maybe

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.170 
of in disarray we thought that maybe
kind<00:05:44.380> of<00:05:44.500> the<00:05:44.830> GOP<00:05:45.580> might<00:05:45.820> have<00:05:45.910> done<00:05:46.030> that

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
kind of the GOP might have done that

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.700 
kind of the GOP might have done that
this<00:05:46.360> year<00:05:46.630> but<00:05:46.810> they<00:05:46.900> kind<00:05:47.110> of<00:05:47.169> cleaned<00:05:47.500> up

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
this year but they kind of cleaned up

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.620 
this year but they kind of cleaned up
that<00:05:47.740> mess<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:48.460> I<00:05:48.850> think<00:05:49.210> they're<00:05:49.330> raring<00:05:49.510> to

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
that mess and I think they're raring to

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.469 
that mess and I think they're raring to
go<00:05:49.780> with<00:05:49.960> Romney<00:05:50.200> but<00:05:51.010> Reagan<00:05:51.479> represents

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
go with Romney but Reagan represents

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.690 
go with Romney but Reagan represents
that<00:05:52.600> West<00:05:52.900> Coast<00:05:53.020> conservatism<00:05:53.950> you<00:05:54.520> might

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
that West Coast conservatism you might

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.400 
that West Coast conservatism you might
remember<00:05:54.940> that<00:05:55.150> Goldwater's<00:05:55.930> from<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.229> West

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410

Nixon's from the West

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.850 
Nixon's from the West
Reagan<00:05:58.330> is<00:05:58.419> from<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.720> West<00:05:58.900> you<00:05:59.140> know<00:05:59.290> so<00:05:59.710> it's

kind of feel that's that's going to

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.580 
kind of feel that's that's going to
sweep<00:06:06.280> down<00:06:06.520> the<00:06:07.180> math<00:06:07.630> really<00:06:07.900> a<00:06:08.080> big<00:06:08.290> way<00:06:08.410> in
