00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
to do is just allow this to cook for a

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.960 
to do is just allow this to cook for a
couple<00:01:17.020> of<00:01:17.289> minutes<00:01:17.590> until<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:18.280> onions<00:01:18.700> have

a<00:01:21.340> little<00:01:21.520> crisp<00:01:21.970> I'm<00:01:22.810> also<00:01:23.110> going<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.679> add<00:01:23.979> one

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
defrost a little bit but realistically

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.590 
defrost a little bit but realistically
this<00:01:36.340> shouldn't<00:01:36.670> take<00:01:36.909> more<00:01:37.119> than<00:01:37.179> a<00:01:37.360> couple

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
baking powder so it will rise so we're

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.430

essentially<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.859> isn't<00:02:53.160> actually<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.549> quiche

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
essentially this isn't actually a quiche

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.630 
essentially this isn't actually a quiche
as<00:02:54.150> such<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:54.890> basically<00:02:55.890> think<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.459> as<00:02:56.609> a

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
as such it's basically think of it as a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.430 
as such it's basically think of it as a
quiche<00:02:57.060> if<00:02:57.299> you've<00:02:57.480> got<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.750> egg<00:02:57.930> mixture<00:02:58.319> and

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
quiche if you've got the egg mixture and

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.780 
quiche if you've got the egg mixture and
the<00:02:58.709> pastry<00:02:59.190> mixed<00:02:59.519> together<00:02:59.640> it's<00:03:00.620> like<00:03:01.620> a

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
the pastry mixed together it's like a

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.460 
the pastry mixed together it's like a
sort<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.819> an<00:03:02.940> egg<00:03:03.180> frittata<00:03:03.390> tart<00:03:04.079> sort<00:03:04.410> of

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
sort of an egg frittata tart sort of

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.099 
sort of an egg frittata tart sort of
type<00:03:04.650> thing<00:03:04.920> it's<00:03:05.069> really<00:03:05.519> nice<00:03:05.700> though<00:03:06.109> so

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
type thing it's really nice though so

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.949 
type thing it's really nice though so
mixing<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.190> all<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.670> there<00:03:08.879> we're<00:03:09.810> also

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
mixing that all in there we're also

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.910 
mixing that all in there we're also
going<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.379> mix<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.829> our<00:03:12.290> bacon<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.470> onion<00:03:13.829> and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
going to mix in our bacon and onion and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.030 
going to mix in our bacon and onion and
vegetable<00:03:14.489> mixture<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.660> just<00:03:15.959> toss<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.739> all

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
vegetable mixture so just toss that all

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.479 
vegetable mixture so just toss that all
in<00:03:17.390> stop<00:03:18.390> stirring<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.590> around<00:03:22.160> so<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.370> is

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
in stop stirring that around so this is

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.339 
in stop stirring that around so this is
going<00:03:23.609> to<00:03:23.669> be<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.819> fairly<00:03:24.180> lumpy<00:03:24.720> mixture<00:03:25.169> but

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
going to be a fairly lumpy mixture but

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.170 
going to be a fairly lumpy mixture but
that's<00:03:25.560> fine<00:03:25.980> because<00:03:26.340> as<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.609> say<00:03:26.819> it's<00:03:27.000> sort

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
that's fine because as I say it's sort

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.809 
that's fine because as I say it's sort
of<00:03:27.590> it's<00:03:28.590> meant<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:28.919> be<00:03:29.010> lumping<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.549> it'll

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
of it's meant to be lumping and it'll

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.710 
of it's meant to be lumping and it'll
all<00:03:30.419> get<00:03:30.630> mixed<00:03:30.840> together<00:03:31.109> fairly<00:03:31.859> certain

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
all get mixed together fairly certain

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.770 
all get mixed together fairly certain
