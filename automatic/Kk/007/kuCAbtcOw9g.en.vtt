00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.880
 the slowest possible team yet 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.890
 somehow chemistry gets what happens 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.600
 I'm curious 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.180
 the best team of all time and only 78 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:36.840
 but ultimately 12 started because last 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:39.110

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.110

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.300

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.289

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.590

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.219

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.219
 his adventures 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.390
 Now people want to let go of 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.390
 chance 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:49.210

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.269
 First victory I had 100 people 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.500

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.930
