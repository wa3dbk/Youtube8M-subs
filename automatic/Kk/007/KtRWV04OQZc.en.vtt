00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.960
 welcome interested 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.180
 Today we get the gigabyte for the time being 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.960
 no seven state budget gaming 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.120
 keyboards 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.800
 This is for an against keyboard too 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.500
 a really low price available 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.430
 and today I'll show you something 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.050
 is offered 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.849
 it should also let me know that 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.220
 this review on my own 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.230
 subjective opinion based in the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.000
 box are two things the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.610
 keyboard and the fast 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.040
 installation instructions the gigawatt sky 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.890
 seven stars used usb 2.0 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.780
 interface and roberto switches 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.640
 about five are used 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.500
 Millions of tastes should endure 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.690
 This keyboard is with three 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.830
 different colors illuminated blue 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.830
 green and turquoise 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.750
 The cable is 18 meters long and beautiful 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.600
 and what's really good about this 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.400
 lower price is usb 2.0 is called 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.710
 connection I have to use immediately 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.750
 say that this really does exist 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.150
 keyboard looks and makes me a little bit 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.250
 The weight of this was surprising 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.030
 is not that small and that 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.310
 not bad 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.500
 the housing or frame is as well 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.960
 on most plastic keyboards 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.479
 by the way, the vsk seven stars is one 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.140
 low profile keyboard with ultra thin 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.789
 fit 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.369
 You will not get a palm rest here 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.770
 But again, no obligation 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.539
 There is a hand rest available only 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.550
 just not as much as with one 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.530
 ordinary palm rest that is 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.570
 this is where the medium feels like typing 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.820
 really good and the best word 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.399
 the expression what I mean exactly would be 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.590
 probably knows it is only very little power 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.020
 needed to press the buttons and 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.250
 that's why the robot switches are these 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.110
 also very quiet compared to 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.910
 However, mechanical keyboards are 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.770
 mechanical keyboards for me after 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.090
 this is the better choice 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.910
 probably because I'm the whole one 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.950
 time a self use this vsk 7 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.570
 stuff is lit with blue greens 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.100
 and turquoise leds 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.840
 Of course not everyone can drive 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.880
 At the same time you can be 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.950
 switch between these gentleman by 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.360
 you suppressed this wheel here 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.760
 then we come but these two rehe 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.380
 a little later I should first 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.239
 let you know that this keyboard 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.610
 Such a kind of anti-ghosting ability 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.380
 offers so what you only extreme 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.299
 Rarely on keyboards in this 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.579
 Price range seven buttons can 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.450
 simultaneously pressed without conflict 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:46.079
 and that will choose the following wsd 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.730
 Cow left shift and the space bar this 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.470
 Keyboard is also with a lock button 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.360
 equipped with the windows button 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.310
 deactivated so that during the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.350
 if you accidentally play this 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.540
 third should not be so unfortunate 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.370
 moments in the game comes in the top 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.590
 series we also have the media here 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.989
 keys which can be used if 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.440
 this pressed together with the fn key 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.079
 become 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.060
 up in the middle are two-wheelers 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.829
 the first to adjust the brightness 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.630
 the leds and those who advise and 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.269
 presses either switch between 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.430
 blue green or turquoise lighting 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.140
 or turn off the entire lighting 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.340
 completely off 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.740
 as a second advice is for the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.140
 volume control by turning this wheel 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.670
 Suppressed to one looks on the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.500
 Back of the keyboard are located 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.080
 Of course, rubber feet two 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.880
 hinged here and three standard 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.980
 rubber feet should prevent here 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.780
 that the keyboard does not slip away 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.860
 Software or drivers will be for this 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.380
 keyboard needed 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.630
 It's all planning play and that would be it 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.790
 actually the gigabyte ska 7 stuff 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.350
 gaming keyboard is a good choice though 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.480
 you are looking for one 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.880
 High quality gaming keyboard at one 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.160
 very low price is one thing the 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.140
 something bothers me is the low profile me 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.150
 Prefer standard buttons but that is 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.709
 Of course preference was what made me change 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.540
 impressed is the 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.390
 You can switch between lighting 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.239
 blue green and turquoise leds sake 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.340
 all this on a single keyboard too 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.380
 a pretty low price easy 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.989
 a budget gaming keyboard i would 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.239
 this area before is no 712 give the 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.310
 definitely recommend keyboard 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.230
