00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.360
 video I want you the new update 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:14.070
 for the lg situ that is now 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.439
 Android 4.4 also known as Kitkat 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.670
 from the advertising measures the google and 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:26.460
 have closed away so much can be 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.890
 do not recognize after the update so 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.500
 significant changes are for example 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.320
 the customization of this status will do that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.180
 are now white symbols 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.469
 You can also get the bar from here 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.840
 high mission 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.329
 before you had to always touch here 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.200
 So slight improvement is there 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.300
 already to recognize 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.629
 and of course the performance it 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:55.079
 also better noticeable mostly 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:56.180
 here in the directory can be the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.489
 but already recognize 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.780
 the task manager is the same as before 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.489
 stayed and also otherwise has become 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.439
 then of course the battery life 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.390
 So that's an important improvement 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.100
 feature what many have noticed 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.860
 that has noticeably improved since 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.720
 So you have really good update 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.780
 brought out what stability again 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.619
 bring some adjustments and more 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.650
 power 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.869
 also regarding the battery of course the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.409
 Applications will probably be something 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.270
 better executed and more efficient and 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.509
 Here we have the once again 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.780
 software information 4 4 2 that's how 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.659
 said the update is now in 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.079
 germany directly from the device available 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.399
 So therefore to more or halt on the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.240
 software on pc 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.700
 Who does not get it , he can stop 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.180
 also the manual flash the files for 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:05.630
 the 16 and 32 gb versions are identical 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:07.770
 according to the md5 key so there you can 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.840
 of course at your own risk that 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.500

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.690
 original system on it yes that is 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.400
 that we have been the system for the first time 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.690
