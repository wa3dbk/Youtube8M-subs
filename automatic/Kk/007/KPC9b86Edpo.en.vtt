 forward olivero you 're seeing is 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.060
 putting the shrimp on a comal these 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.830
 shrimp because they do not need oil 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.440
 you already have the marinade then it is not 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.440
 necessary that we are putting you going 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.450
 put a paper so that 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.080
 evaporate and cook faster too 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.150
 we are putting the pineapple of the comal 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.910
 this is bushes and the one that comes as well 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.950
 golden in the comal or its history 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.590
 also our rich this pineapple is 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.100
 Optional I like a lot as you know 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.500
 with the shrimp roll like that already 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.560
 let's flip when no longer so a 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.260
 color more to vitor as pink color 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.300
 when they are ready for the return 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.619
 what the shrimp are cooking 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.510
 Now let's put the tortilla 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.450
 flour this can be whole or can 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.739
 to be normal 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.849
 in an approximate time of 30 seconds 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.170
 we just removed the pill from 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.420
 microwave this is for it to be fine 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:29.590
 soft and good we are going to put cream 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.910
 to the tortilla this is so that it does not 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.920
 to make it easier than the tortilla 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.860
 hit but see is not doing it all 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.349
 the tortilla only in the middle and by 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.840
 the shores the truth that I'm putting 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.040
 with these because he does not want to talk 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.900
 so I have to say everything I 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.900
 now I notice that we are dating 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.370
 quite that it sounded I ask a little 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.700
 cheese 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.680
 the spinach this tortilla did not have it 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.629
 integral but can use it integrated 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.629
 I always at the peak of a rooster 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.500
 It's fine as I tell you, it's a fist 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.290
 of the waterfall is the most common and in 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.189
 salad since we are well rich now 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.189
 follow the avocado 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.469
 well that's how part of the avocado 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.000
 I 've never done it here the truth 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.890
 he is always bringing it to me and I was 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.960
 explaining how to do it but I tell you it's 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.750
 better than it lastrÃ³ until the shrimps 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.290
 the pineapple 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.910
 is a little sore then they do not have 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.900
 to do it fast because the shrimp 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:49.630
 and they are collected, they do not leave the same 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:53.080
 they are hard we pass it to the tortilla 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.960
 well and it's only half cream half 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.569
 and half of all the vegetables of all 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:04.409
 the ingredients now the shrimp 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.650
 well from the iron to the cue and will continue 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.280
 nice warm 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.430
 and this roll tastes very good fresh 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.430
 for me 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.470
 I do not want to talk but says he 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.680
 we put a little more cheese on top 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.230
 to stick the other ingredients and 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.630
 now it's going to be the moment of what 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.650
 fun to roll it 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.800
 includes this little boy shrimp child 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.800
 wrapped 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.219
 he heard that where he works in them what 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:43.820
 we do very fast thus reaching the 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:48.160
 orders according to what they tell me 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.160
 and they are tightening it very well 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.849
 and I tell you this roll tastes good 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:05:00.780
 cool if you re warm up it's not going to 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:03.449
 just know right now because it is cool 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.069
 the other ingredients the spinach the 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.340
 pico de gallo all that is cold in the 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:14.039
 cream cheese, avocado and 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:16.319
 Shrimp are hot good to say 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.780
 how it is rolled up see how I hit it 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:21.690
 can surround and does not take off 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.310
 and we 're going to cut it now to cut what 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.160
 that you put work 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:30.810
 ok to cut it says the part where 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:34.590
 we are folding is down we go 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.210
 to cut the ends although it tells me 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.180
 they have to put enough cream 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.100
 so that it is not going to take off like this 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.000
 It was weak but the center is already 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.000
 more tied 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.800
 and well, as a snack is very rich 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.510
 I recommend them, they can do it 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.370
 also chicken the chicken can be cold 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.630
 or hot mixteca slow chicken true 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.490
 warm the chicken also in in strips 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:03.150
 so on the plate it also comes out very rich 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.010
 then as a snack see I'm going to take out 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.800
 one 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:10.190
 then see how they are to my camera not 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.930
 It is very readable but 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.930
 you see everything there the ingredients 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.240
 Well, you're ready, well, this is good 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.950
 video was a bit slow because he forgives 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.230
 neither he nor I had done the truth 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.150
 had seen how he did it and then he 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.440
 says that in this roll they take as 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.500
 minute and a half in his work to 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.790
 doing it well is very easy and I do not know 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.310

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.880
 similar with other different 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.480
 ingredients and well it's a recipe 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.520
