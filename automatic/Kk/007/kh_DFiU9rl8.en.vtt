00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.939
 hello friends hall youtube my name 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.970
 is john thompson and cordial 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.689
 Welcome to another issue of 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.340
 ruby cheers hidrive in the background 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.489
 is not the new team truck nee 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.489
 No, that's the kia cee'd of my eu 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.870
 departure in design and subscribers 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.020
 next product so thought 'what would be 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.079
 julie id if not from top gear that 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.820
 current test vehicle sometimes proof 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.950
 that it can be fast 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.810
 or that is not a kia 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.610
 but first from the view of the 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.920
 technical side info is settled 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.760
 the car in the f category 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.160
 front wheel drive you see the two then 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.410
 I do not have much over it 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.260
 hardly anything moves to talk further 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.449
 say 92 kw 154 jews more the whole 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.719
 12 tons of engine draws its 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.939
 merciless power from 1 6 liters displacement 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.920
 next to the car did not open in the 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.600
 muckibude sent namely to 600 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.590
 built on front-wheel drive left us 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.049
 see especially in the acceleration 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.799
 and at the start has increased properly 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.649
 performance data 2 177 kw 416 newton meters 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.600
 the whole on just over 1.1 tons 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.729
 and the engine is also brought opel 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.130
 namely 1.9 liters 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.600
 performance 0 to 104 7 seconds 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.340
 top speed 261 km / h like 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.469
 I have lived again a few dates 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.119
 chosen for the vehicle namely the 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.590
 kia cee'd we see the first here 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.060
 By now, there are already the series 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.450
 third 2030 around the third generation 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.749
 got out of this car was built in 2006 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.179
 until 2012 what looks like 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:55.429
 So from the seed of the english 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.189
 pronounced seed ce is called 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.529
 European community and there should times 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.149
 One with a comb and idea is not about 

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:03.649
 the mark of earthy but what 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.619
 really fell for it but stands for 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.810
 European design namely kiel has become 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.789
 sat down thought we need 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.500
 a design what the europeans correctly 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.239
 appeals well and that is up to you 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.670
 I have not succeeded every time 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.190
 In any case, it is one of the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.690
 Highest volume vehicles from kia 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.320
 the ground group and the technique shares 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.240
 the kia with the hyundai i30 the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.430
 engines range of 1 liter with 4- 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.990
 90 ps until the 2nd 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.150
 the top model with 143 ps in the previous year is 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:39.010
 the standard model with 16 images in it 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:42.930
 that has 125 ps exactly 510 3 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.340
 seconds top speed 205 km h 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.100
 I think kia sees the pull here 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.850
 not really somehow unaware 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.250
 from the semmel 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.170
 but only the rims open it 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.160
 any case worth this daring times to the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.530
 to beat the course 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.160
 and that means yes we have gotten us 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.840
 racer out some say he knows 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.080
 two facts about ends 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.420
 and both are wrong without the name tom 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.970
 Stick and you can see it in there already 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.060
 over chemically a wing plant behind 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.760
 on it that the carriage needs with 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.960
 lightly hit formally clear drive 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.370
 and so much power it can 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.150
 actually underlined only backwards 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.280
 start 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.230
 but here when the wheels turn in 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.780
 it's ok to have eaten the asphalt 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.950
 also properly forward 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.110
 The engine also sounds like this 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.670
 bitter done differently's purely in wilson 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.730
 the first stock sample for the 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.140
 Wing rear is relatively faithful 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.400
 that looks really good the first one 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.739
 group already mastered as usual 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.200
 are their view of the external cameras 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.020
 with the inside camera together 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.090
 in chicago you go to the right 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.180
 We obviously can see from the spring 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.680
 paint again when we want 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.989
 but in any case the autogenic 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.209
 really good figure a bit restless here 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.189
 Steer but that's only because of the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.000
 replays has not been that way in the forest 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:02.430
 purely in hammerhead left right light 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.989
 understeer but copied from the stick he 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.519
 to go back to the gas very early 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.340
 rich as much momentum and 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.750
 we try to take that looks 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.269
 not the right afloat on everyone 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.689
 In the case of punctuality, the car is full of sru 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.459
 that looks good too 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.620
 it has taken place here very far 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.209
 while he is and it's fine or something 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.880
 fast people here shake I think 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.440
 the top time here is the top time no 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.020
 It is ironic that they are right 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.949
 afloat from penultimate turn beautiful because 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.039
 left them 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.650
 hardly a car has been so far as it goes 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.110
 There is much momentum and there are games 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.970
 We cross the line and now 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.530
 matte foam or even you see 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.349
 top the best time set up by fat 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.960
 nitro say that were lotus a minute 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:49.289
 I think slower and faster 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.900
 anyway no more a minute 19 sa 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.360
 fast but it was not like that 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.740
 so fast not so fast 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:01.289
 and the end time a minute 19 6 59 and 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.180
 currently holding place two in the academy 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.750
 what did he have a little bit the neck 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.159
 Broken 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.510
 Tomsic reported I got the 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.669
 he briefly entertained on which he 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.430
 his test laps turned a lot 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.720
 Performance only on the front axle 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.610
 First you have to go to the street 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.570
 get the car a bit 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.699
 broken neck 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.919
 but I think the kia was really on 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.330
 limit its performance so 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.389
 much more you do not get out there 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.909
 and ahaus there just no lotus from 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.759
 podium away anyway a look at the a 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:34.919
 class as it is currently sorted whole 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:37.770
 top fat nitro with a lotus traveler 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.770
 jerseys and current holds the bastille 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.979
 with his victory the red lantern in the 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.690
 hand 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.020
 I'm only out until the next 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.020
 let's see
