 what it was to the television 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.189
 g that unit represents a scythe 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.970
 this is one of the many that we have brought 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.110
 so that people can discover rediscover what is 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.389
 p these specimens that had mastered the art 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:23.459
 all the planet 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.109

 from all over the world 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.429
 The idea is 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:57.639
 that the people 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.269

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.499
 habitat 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:32.059
 in this way we make people participate they can erect a snake 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.469
 a selected animal 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:38.709
 because they are animals that we do not capture in the natural habitat, 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.449
 We wanted apart from egg in an incubator between 90 and 120 days 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.259
 are born and in that moment man 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:46.319

 out of the country wearing this type shows always trying to improve it 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:17.009
 Sometimes the savings are added sometimes it is a sample 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:22.620
 only from snakes sometimes only from spiders this is a the motorcycle culture
