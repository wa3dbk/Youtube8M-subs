00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:02.960 

I've<00:00:01.709> been<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:01.920> writer<00:00:02.129> all<00:00:02.310> my<00:00:02.460> life<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.820> I've

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
I've been a writer all my life and I've

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.999 
I've been a writer all my life and I've
run<00:00:03.480> with<00:00:03.750> shoes<00:00:03.990> pretty<00:00:04.319> much<00:00:04.440> all<00:00:04.589> that<00:00:04.740> time

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
run with shoes pretty much all that time

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.099 
run with shoes pretty much all that time
but<00:00:05.730> as<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.879> result<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.420> research<00:00:06.750> I

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
but as a result of this research I

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.540 
but as a result of this research I
thought<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.680> should<00:00:07.740> try<00:00:08.010> barefoot<00:00:08.370> running

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
thought I should try barefoot running

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.919 
thought I should try barefoot running
and<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.910> actually<00:00:09.090> have<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.389> say<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.780> really

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
and I actually have to say I really

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:18.769 
and I actually have to say I really
enjoyed<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.889> it's<00:00:11.040> been<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.219> lot<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.429> fun<00:00:17.779> humans

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
enjoyed it it's been a lot of fun humans

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.849 
enjoyed it it's been a lot of fun humans
have<00:00:18.869> been<00:00:18.930> running<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.289> at<00:00:19.380> least<00:00:19.470> 2<00:00:19.680> million

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
have been running for at least 2 million

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.050 
have been running for at least 2 million
years<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.460> course<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.640> most<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.000> that

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
years and of course for most of that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.140 
years and of course for most of that
time<00:00:21.300> humans<00:00:21.689> were<00:00:21.869> running<00:00:22.109> barefoot<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
time humans were running barefoot and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.310 
time humans were running barefoot and
modern<00:00:24.150> running<00:00:24.480> shoes<00:00:24.689> were<00:00:24.900> actually<00:00:25.170> only

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
modern running shoes were actually only

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560 
modern running shoes were actually only
invented<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.920> mid-1970s<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.330> have

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
invented in the mid-1970s so we have

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.089 
invented in the mid-1970s so we have
this<00:00:27.660> idea<00:00:27.810> now<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.560> know<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.859> order<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
this idea now that you know in order to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.589 
this idea now that you know in order to
run<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.460> need<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.849> need<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.240> know<00:00:30.420> all<00:00:30.480> you

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
run you need you need you know all you

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.060 
run you need you need you know all you
need<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> pair<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.320> shoes<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.800> common

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
need a pair of shoes it's a common

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.979 
need a pair of shoes it's a common
statement<00:00:32.309> right<00:00:32.610> well<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.390> that's<00:00:33.840> not

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
statement right well actually that's not

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.900 
statement right well actually that's not
true<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.500> don't<00:00:34.710> need<00:00:34.890> shoes<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.610> need

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
true you don't need shoes you just need

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.209 
true you don't need shoes you just need
feet<00:00:39.110> there's<00:00:40.110> probably<00:00:40.230> two<00:00:40.590> stages<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
feet there's probably two stages in the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.369 
feet there's probably two stages in the
evolution<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.700> foot<00:00:42.059> initially<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.140> foot

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
evolution of foot initially the foot

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.950 
evolution of foot initially the foot
evolved<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.340> walking<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.879> also<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> climb

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
evolved for walking and also to climb

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.900 
evolved for walking and also to climb
trees<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.280> some<00:00:47.489> point<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.820> human

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
trees but at some point in human

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.819 
trees but at some point in human
evolution<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.840> think<00:00:49.050> about<00:00:49.200> 2<00:00:49.410> million<00:00:49.590> years

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
evolution we think about 2 million years

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.189 
evolution we think about 2 million years
ago<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> big<00:00:51.000> environmental<00:00:51.329> change

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
ago there was a big environmental change

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.410 
ago there was a big environmental change
in<00:00:52.440> Africa<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.160> woodlands<00:00:54.120> started

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
in Africa and the woodlands started

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.000 
in Africa and the woodlands started
disappearing<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> savannas<00:00:55.649> started

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
disappearing and the savannas started

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.250 
disappearing and the savannas started
growing<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.579> at<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.239> point<00:00:57.480> new<00:00:57.989> foods

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
growing and at that point new foods

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.959 
growing and at that point new foods
started<00:00:58.649> appearing<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> them<00:00:59.879> of

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
started appearing and one of them of

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.849 
started appearing and one of them of
course<00:01:00.000> was<00:01:00.390> was<00:01:00.750> meat<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.649> all<00:01:01.739> these

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
course was was meat for all these

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.560 
course was was meat for all these
ungulates<00:01:02.190> out<00:01:02.520> there<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> grasslands

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
ungulates out there on the grasslands

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.530 
ungulates out there on the grasslands
and<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:04.619> order<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.949> become<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.250> hunter<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.909> think

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and in order to become a hunter I think

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.109 
and in order to become a hunter I think
humans<00:01:06.869> started<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.500> evolve<00:01:07.590> running<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
humans started to evolve running and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.490 
humans started to evolve running and
what<00:01:09.240> we're<00:01:09.390> good<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.020> running<00:01:10.260> it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
what we're good at is it running it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
what we're good at is it running it
running<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.220> speeds<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.850> make<00:01:12.119> animals

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
running at speeds that make animals

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.539 
running at speeds that make animals
gallop<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> heat

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
gallop and if you do that in the heat

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.969 
gallop and if you do that in the heat
for<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> long<00:01:15.180> period<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.540> time<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.140> animal

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
for a long period of time that animal

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.890 
for a long period of time that animal
will<00:01:17.100> overheat<00:01:17.520> because<00:01:17.700> quadrupeds<00:01:18.479> cannot

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
will overheat because quadrupeds cannot

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.679 
will overheat because quadrupeds cannot
pant<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.680> gallop<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> same<00:01:20.640> time<00:01:20.850> so

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
pant and gallop at the same time so

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.359 
pant and gallop at the same time so
imagine<00:01:22.229> you're<00:01:22.320> chasing<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.740> gazelle<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
imagine you're chasing a gazelle or a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.700 
imagine you're chasing a gazelle or a
kudu<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:24.000> something<00:01:24.360> animal<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.530> can

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
kudu or something animal if you can

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.499 
kudu or something animal if you can
chase<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.159> animal<00:01:26.490> make<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.150> animal

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
chase that animal make that animal

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.140 
chase that animal make that animal
gallop<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.290> 10<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> 15<00:01:28.829> minutes<00:01:29.070> you've<00:01:29.970> got

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
gallop for 10 to 15 minutes you've got

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.940 
gallop for 10 to 15 minutes you've got
dinner

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.260 

we<00:01:35.950> wanted<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.310> figure<00:01:36.460> out<00:01:36.640> how<00:01:36.790> people<00:01:37.090> ran

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
we wanted to figure out how people ran

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.600 
we wanted to figure out how people ran
without<00:01:37.960> shoes<00:01:38.380> before<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.400> shoe<00:01:39.520> was

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
without shoes before the shoe was

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.860 
without shoes before the shoe was
invented<00:01:40.090> because<00:01:40.240> people<00:01:40.690> have<00:01:40.780> been

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
invented because people have been

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.380 
invented because people have been
running<00:01:41.080> for<00:01:41.200> millions<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:41.560> years<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:42.390> we're

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
running for millions of years and we're

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.540 
running for millions of years and we're
really<00:01:43.480> we<00:01:44.380> weren't<00:01:44.530> really<00:01:44.710> sure<00:01:44.830> what

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
really we weren't really sure what

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.980 
really we weren't really sure what
happens<00:01:45.850> when<00:01:46.030> one<00:01:46.270> barefoot<00:01:46.540> runners<00:01:46.780> run

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
happens when one barefoot runners run

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.990 
happens when one barefoot runners run
and<00:01:47.170> how<00:01:47.290> well<00:01:47.530> they<00:01:47.740> can<00:01:47.770> they<00:01:48.250> can<00:01:48.280> do<00:01:48.580> it<00:01:48.700> so

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
and how well they can they can do it so

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.750 
and how well they can they can do it so
we<00:01:49.660> started<00:01:49.960> bringing<00:01:50.170> in<00:01:50.440> habitual<00:01:51.310> barefoot

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
we started bringing in habitual barefoot

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.730 
we started bringing in habitual barefoot
runners<00:01:52.030> into<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.330> lab<00:01:52.480> to<00:01:52.750> see<00:01:52.930> just<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.590> see

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
runners into the lab to see just to see

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.410 
runners into the lab to see just to see
how<00:01:53.890> their<00:01:54.100> they<00:01:54.580> use<00:01:54.700> their<00:01:54.880> bodies<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:55.330> how

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
how their they use their bodies and how

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:13.680 
how their they use their bodies and how
they<00:01:55.570> use<00:01:55.690> their<00:01:55.720> feet<00:01:59.220> all<00:02:00.220> right<00:02:00.340> here<00:02:00.580> we<00:02:00.610> go

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.320 

what<00:02:14.320> we<00:02:14.410> discovered<00:02:14.500> was<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:15.330> barefoot

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
what we discovered was that barefoot

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.660 
what we discovered was that barefoot
runners<00:02:16.600> run<00:02:16.960> very<00:02:17.950> differently<00:02:18.310> from<00:02:18.400> the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
runners run very differently from the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.600 
runners run very differently from the
way<00:02:18.790> your<00:02:19.240> typical<00:02:19.510> shod<00:02:19.840> runner<00:02:20.340> right<00:02:21.340> so

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
way your typical shod runner right so

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.010 
way your typical shod runner right so
the<00:02:21.910> shoe<00:02:22.090> has<00:02:22.240> got<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.420> big<00:02:22.630> deal<00:02:22.870> it's

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
the shoe has got a big deal it's

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.420 
the shoe has got a big deal it's
designed<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.410> make<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.650> very<00:02:23.740> comfortable<00:02:24.190> to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
designed to make it very comfortable to

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.670 
designed to make it very comfortable to
land<00:02:24.970> on<00:02:25.060> your<00:02:25.180> heel<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.720> lot<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:25.930> shod

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
land on your heel and so a lot of shod

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.620 
land on your heel and so a lot of shod
runners<00:02:27.040> land<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.580> heel<00:02:27.790> all<00:02:28.210> right<00:02:28.360> and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
runners land on the heel all right and

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
runners land on the heel all right and
then<00:02:28.750> they<00:02:28.870> bring<00:02:29.020> them<00:02:29.170> up<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.290> their<00:02:29.440> foot

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
then they bring them up to their foot

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:39.470 
then they bring them up to their foot
down

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.780 

so<00:02:40.480> when<00:02:41.049> you<00:02:41.200> land<00:02:41.470> again<00:02:41.860> on<00:02:41.950> your<00:02:42.040> heal<00:02:42.340> your

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
so when you land again on your heal your

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.729 
so when you land again on your heal your
body<00:02:43.180> comes<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.599> a<00:02:43.629> dead<00:02:43.810> stop<00:02:44.110> there's<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.560> lot

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
body comes to a dead stop there's a lot

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.890 
body comes to a dead stop there's a lot
of<00:02:44.769> mass<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:45.579> there's<00:02:45.760> an<00:02:45.849> impact<00:02:46.239> is<00:02:46.689> that

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
of mass and so there's an impact is that

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.429 
of mass and so there's an impact is that
there's<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.140> rapid<00:02:47.620> force<00:02:49.109> it's<00:02:50.109> it's<00:02:50.379> like

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
there's a rapid force it's it's like

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.990 
there's a rapid force it's it's like
somebody<00:02:50.680> heating<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.159> on<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.579> heel<00:02:51.760> with<00:02:51.970> a

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
somebody heating you on the heel with a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.880 
somebody heating you on the heel with a
hammer<00:02:52.239> about<00:02:53.140> two<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.409> three<00:02:53.439> times<00:02:53.590> your

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
hammer about two to three times your

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.800 
hammer about two to three times your
body<00:02:54.099> weight<00:02:54.159> so<00:02:55.120> when<00:02:55.269> we<00:02:55.359> started<00:02:55.659> bringing

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
body weight so when we started bringing

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.720 
body weight so when we started bringing
barefoot<00:02:56.200> runners<00:02:56.439> into<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.739> lab<00:02:56.920> we

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
barefoot runners into the lab we

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.490 
barefoot runners into the lab we
discovered<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.180> they<00:02:58.420> they<00:02:59.049> didn't<00:02:59.260> like<00:02:59.379> to

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
discovered that they they didn't like to

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.440 
discovered that they they didn't like to
do<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.799> right<00:02:59.980> they<00:03:00.400> typically<00:03:00.849> landed<00:03:01.359> on

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
do that right they typically landed on

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.849 
do that right they typically landed on
the<00:03:01.540> front<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.810> their<00:03:01.989> foot<00:03:02.230> pretty

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
the front of their foot pretty

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.890 
the front of their foot pretty
horizontally<00:03:03.549> not<00:03:03.579> not<00:03:03.970> not<00:03:04.209> not<00:03:04.269> not<00:03:04.480> like

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
horizontally not not not not not like

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.170 
horizontally not not not not not like
that<00:03:05.139> but<00:03:05.170> just<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.010> little<00:03:06.190> bit<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.879> that<00:03:06.909> they

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
that but just a little bit so that they

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.509 
that but just a little bit so that they
land<00:03:07.659> underneath<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.200> heads<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.159> fourth

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
land underneath the heads of the fourth

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.000 
land underneath the heads of the fourth
and<00:03:09.700> fifth<00:03:09.879> metatarsal<00:03:10.150> often<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.560> then<00:03:11.859> they

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
and fifth metatarsal often and then they

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.610 
and fifth metatarsal often and then they
bring<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:12.280> heel<00:03:12.430> down<00:03:12.639> and<00:03:13.230> when<00:03:14.230> we<00:03:14.319> ran<00:03:14.470> them

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
bring the heel down and when we ran them

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.020 
bring the heel down and when we ran them
over<00:03:14.680> force<00:03:15.040> plates<00:03:15.310> we<00:03:15.549> discovered<00:03:16.000> that

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
over force plates we discovered that

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.629 
over force plates we discovered that
they<00:03:16.629> didn't<00:03:16.930> have<00:03:17.049> that<00:03:17.290> big<00:03:17.920> spike<00:03:18.400> that

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
they didn't have that big spike that

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.460 
they didn't have that big spike that
impacts<00:03:19.180> transient<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.049> typically

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
impacts transient that is typically

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:32.250 
impacts transient that is typically
associated<00:03:21.010> with<00:03:21.129> a<00:03:21.639> history

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.110 

so<00:03:32.830> what<00:03:32.950> barefoot<00:03:33.280> runners<00:03:33.549> tend<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.849> do<00:03:33.970> is

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
so what barefoot runners tend to do is

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.640 
so what barefoot runners tend to do is
try<00:03:34.209> landing<00:03:34.810> more<00:03:35.049> towards<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.379> front<00:03:35.560> of

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
try landing more towards the front of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.199 
try landing more towards the front of
the<00:03:35.769> foot<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.189> then<00:03:36.250> letting<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.640> he'll<00:03:36.909> come

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
the foot and then letting the he'll come

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.880 
the foot and then letting the he'll come
down<00:03:37.239> afterwards<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.200> what<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.470> does<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.709> it

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
down afterwards and what that does is it

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.190 
down afterwards and what that does is it
converts<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:40.060> energy<00:03:40.090> that<00:03:40.989> would<00:03:41.079> otherwise

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
converts the energy that would otherwise

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.330 
converts the energy that would otherwise
be<00:03:41.439> a<00:03:41.829> dead<00:03:42.129> stop<00:03:42.400> right<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.970> vertical

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
be a dead stop right a vertical

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.160 
be a dead stop right a vertical
deceleration<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.489> leg<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:46.180> converts<00:03:47.019> that

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
deceleration of the leg it converts that

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.050 
deceleration of the leg it converts that
into<00:03:47.260> rotational<00:03:48.129> energy<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.940> can

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
into rotational energy you can

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.280 
into rotational energy you can
understand<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.690> difference<00:03:50.049> with<00:03:50.200> the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
understand the difference with the

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.289 
understand the difference with the
following<00:03:50.650> very<00:03:51.069> commonplace<00:03:51.549> observation

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
following very commonplace observation

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.809 
following very commonplace observation
imagine<00:03:53.170> dropping<00:03:53.349> the<00:03:53.620> pin<00:03:53.860> onto<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.579> ground

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
imagine dropping the pin onto the ground

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.869 
imagine dropping the pin onto the ground
but<00:03:55.379> falling<00:03:56.379> vertically<00:03:56.950> dumb<00:03:57.310> that's<00:03:57.640> like

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
but falling vertically dumb that's like

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.270 
but falling vertically dumb that's like
a<00:03:57.909> heel<00:03:58.239> strike<00:03:58.569> wet<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:59.260> entire<00:03:59.440> leg<00:03:59.950> strike

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
a heel strike wet the entire leg strike

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.009 
a heel strike wet the entire leg strike
the<00:04:00.459> ground<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.849> comes<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.180> stop<00:04:01.420> into<00:04:01.780> big

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
the ground and comes to stop into big

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:09.030 
the ground and comes to stop into big
impact<00:04:02.500> for<00:04:02.590> them<00:04:06.840> on<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.019> other<00:04:08.140> hand<00:04:08.260> if

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
impact for them on the other hand if

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.430 
impact for them on the other hand if
you're<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.280> forefoot<00:04:09.849> strike<00:04:10.480> then<00:04:10.900> you<00:04:11.109> can

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
you're a forefoot strike then you can

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.020 
you're a forefoot strike then you can
think<00:04:11.590> of<00:04:11.769> it<00:04:11.920> like<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.280> pen<00:04:12.519> landing<00:04:12.909> at<00:04:13.000> an

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
think of it like the pen landing at an

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.479 
think of it like the pen landing at an
oblique<00:04:13.389> angle<00:04:13.530> but<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.620> hits<00:04:14.799> a<00:04:14.920> ground<00:04:15.220> and

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
oblique angle but it hits a ground and

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.340 
oblique angle but it hits a ground and
it<00:04:15.819> doesn't<00:04:16.090> come<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.269> desktop<00:04:16.840> but<00:04:17.049> starts

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
it doesn't come to desktop but starts

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.890 
it doesn't come to desktop but starts
rotating<00:04:17.560> so<00:04:18.459> not<00:04:18.669> all<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.150> energy<00:04:19.510> kinetic

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
rotating so not all the energy kinetic

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.479 
rotating so not all the energy kinetic
energy<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.500> plane<00:04:20.709> actually<00:04:20.889> absorbed<00:04:21.400> by

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
energy of the plane actually absorbed by

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.770 
energy of the plane actually absorbed by
the<00:04:21.519> impact<00:04:21.940> some<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.240> it<00:04:22.360> gets<00:04:22.510> this

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
the impact some of it gets this

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.409 
the impact some of it gets this
transferred<00:04:23.410> from<00:04:23.949> moving<00:04:24.400> down<00:04:24.639> to<00:04:24.820> rotation

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
transferred from moving down to rotation

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.820 
transferred from moving down to rotation
and<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.020> impact<00:04:26.229> forces<00:04:26.560> are<00:04:26.710> much

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
and so the impact forces are much

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.590 
and so the impact forces are much
smaller<00:04:27.070> in<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.580> forefoot<00:04:27.910> strike<00:04:28.180> compared<00:04:28.539> to

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
smaller in a forefoot strike compared to

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:40.320 
smaller in a forefoot strike compared to
a<00:04:28.660> he<00:04:28.810> strikes<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:38.760> lot<00:04:39.760> of<00:04:39.880> runners<00:04:40.030> get

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
a he strikes a lot of runners get

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.270 
a he strikes a lot of runners get
injured<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:41.199> they<00:04:41.289> what<00:04:41.470> they<00:04:41.590> get<00:04:41.770> typically

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
injured and they what they get typically

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.909 
injured and they what they get typically
often<00:04:43.030> are<00:04:43.150> repetitive<00:04:43.870> stress<00:04:44.289> injuries<00:04:44.680> and

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
often are repetitive stress injuries and

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.480 
often are repetitive stress injuries and
so<00:04:45.550> one<00:04:46.240> hypothesis<00:04:47.050> is<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.349> that<00:04:47.919> impact

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
so one hypothesis is that that impact

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.640 
so one hypothesis is that that impact
caused<00:04:48.849> by<00:04:49.120> landing<00:04:49.570> on<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.780> heel<00:04:49.990> which

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
caused by landing on the heel which

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.830 
caused by landing on the heel which
causes<00:04:51.099> that<00:04:51.220> big<00:04:51.520> impact<00:04:52.030> transient<00:04:52.539> could

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
causes that big impact transient could

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.689 
causes that big impact transient could
be<00:04:52.960> injurious<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.680> its<00:04:53.800> associated<00:04:54.400> with

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
be injurious and its associated with

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.029 
be injurious and its associated with
pain<00:04:55.449> in<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.780> soft<00:04:56.260> tissues<00:04:56.620> at<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.830> bottom

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
pain in the soft tissues at the bottom

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.820 
pain in the soft tissues at the bottom
of<00:04:57.099> the<00:04:57.190> foot<00:04:57.570> its<00:04:58.570> associated<00:04:59.110> with<00:04:59.440> shin

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
of the foot its associated with shin

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.520 
of the foot its associated with shin
splints<00:05:00.280> may<00:05:01.180> cause<00:05:01.419> some<00:05:01.870> other<00:05:02.020> kinds<00:05:02.470> of

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
splints may cause some other kinds of

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.250 
splints may cause some other kinds of
injury<00:05:03.130> so<00:05:03.760> our<00:05:03.910> hypothesis<00:05:04.780> is<00:05:05.020> that

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
injury so our hypothesis is that

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.740 
injury so our hypothesis is that
individuals<00:05:06.099> who<00:05:06.580> don't<00:05:06.880> land<00:05:07.180> on<00:05:07.360> their<00:05:07.539> heel

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
individuals who don't land on their heel

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.810 
individuals who don't land on their heel
but<00:05:08.139> avoid<00:05:08.500> those<00:05:08.710> big<00:05:08.949> impacts<00:05:09.340> by<00:05:09.550> landing

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
but avoid those big impacts by landing

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.640 
but avoid those big impacts by landing
on<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:09.970> front<00:05:10.150> of<00:05:10.180> their<00:05:10.330> foot<00:05:10.539> may<00:05:11.199> be<00:05:11.260> less

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
on the front of their foot may be less

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.189 
on the front of their foot may be less
susceptible<00:05:12.430> to<00:05:12.820> those<00:05:13.539> kinds<00:05:13.900> of<00:05:13.930> repetitive

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
susceptible to those kinds of repetitive

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:24.559 
susceptible to those kinds of repetitive
stress<00:05:14.560> injuries

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.850 

so<00:05:25.569> we've<00:05:25.779> been<00:05:25.930> studying<00:05:26.199> barefoot<00:05:26.619> runners

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
so we've been studying barefoot runners

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.379 
so we've been studying barefoot runners
now<00:05:26.979> for<00:05:27.189> quite<00:05:27.339> a<00:05:27.399> while<00:05:27.580> and<00:05:27.879> we<00:05:28.119> went<00:05:28.270> to

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
now for quite a while and we went to

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.579 
now for quite a while and we went to
Africa<00:05:28.779> we<00:05:28.899> looked<00:05:29.050> at<00:05:29.139> people<00:05:29.259> who've<00:05:29.409> never

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:29.589 
Africa we looked at people who've never

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:31.290 
Africa we looked at people who've never
worn<00:05:29.919> shoes<00:05:30.219> and<00:05:30.490> they've<00:05:30.580> been<00:05:30.669> running<00:05:30.819> 20

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
worn shoes and they've been running 20

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.540 
worn shoes and they've been running 20
kilometers<00:05:31.719> a<00:05:31.809> day<00:05:31.869> and<00:05:32.409> I<00:05:32.680> just<00:05:33.039> decided<00:05:33.159> I

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
kilometers a day and I just decided I

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.279 
kilometers a day and I just decided I
had<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:33.729> try<00:05:33.969> running<00:05:34.330> barefoot<00:05:34.539> myself<00:05:35.020> so<00:05:35.259> I

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
had to try running barefoot myself so I

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.649 
had to try running barefoot myself so I
last<00:05:36.099> summer<00:05:36.339> actually<00:05:36.580> i<00:05:36.879> was<00:05:37.029> running<00:05:37.240> one

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
last summer actually i was running one

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.480 
last summer actually i was running one
day<00:05:37.839> and<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.080> just<00:05:38.349> decided<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:39.069> take<00:05:39.159> my<00:05:39.309> shoes

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
day and I just decided to take my shoes

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.579 
day and I just decided to take my shoes
off<00:05:39.610> and<00:05:39.879> I<00:05:40.029> i<00:05:40.270> found<00:05:40.779> it<00:05:40.869> was<00:05:40.960> just<00:05:41.169> incredibly

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:41.589 
off and I i found it was just incredibly

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:43.739 
off and I i found it was just incredibly
fun<00:05:41.889> and<00:05:42.129> since<00:05:42.969> then<00:05:43.149> I've<00:05:43.300> actually<00:05:43.509> started

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:43.749 
fun and since then I've actually started

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:46.290 
fun and since then I've actually started
running<00:05:44.110> barefoot<00:05:44.319> frequently<00:05:44.979> and<00:05:45.189> I<00:05:46.089> just<00:05:46.210> I

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
running barefoot frequently and I just I

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.730 
running barefoot frequently and I just I
really<00:05:46.419> love<00:05:46.659> it<00:05:46.809> it<00:05:46.930> feels<00:05:47.080> great<00:05:47.379> I've

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
really love it it feels great I've

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.219 
really love it it feels great I've
stopped<00:05:48.339> heel<00:05:49.029> striking<00:05:49.300> and<00:05:49.569> I<00:05:49.599> now<00:05:49.779> have

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
stopped heel striking and I now have

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.259 
stopped heel striking and I now have
become<00:05:50.469> a<00:05:50.499> 4-foot<00:05:50.919> striker<00:05:51.189> and<00:05:51.520> and<00:05:52.050> it's<00:05:53.050> fun
