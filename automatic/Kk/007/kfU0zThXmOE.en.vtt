00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.390 
deal's gap o P faction server and today
I'm<00:00:16.320> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.470> be<00:00:16.529> showing<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.859> guys<00:00:16.920> how<00:00:17.070> to

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
I'm going to be showing you guys how to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.950 
I'm going to be showing you guys how to
make<00:00:17.670> your<00:00:17.760> bases<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> little<00:00:18.480> more<00:00:18.600> secure<00:00:18.900> and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
make your bases a little more secure and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.439 
make your bases a little more secure and
a<00:00:19.350> little<00:00:19.590> less<00:00:19.740> writable<00:00:20.160> now<00:00:20.970> most<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.330> you

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
a little less writable now most of you

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.779 
a little less writable now most of you
know<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.439> my<00:00:22.740> faction<00:00:22.980> server<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.760> can

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
know that on my faction server you can

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.179 
know that on my faction server you can
destroy<00:00:24.240> obsidian<00:00:24.720> by<00:00:25.109> hitting<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.010> with<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
destroy obsidian by hitting it with a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.800 
destroy obsidian by hitting it with a
certain<00:00:26.460> number<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.699> explosions<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.689> you

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
certain number of explosions but you

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.929 
certain number of explosions but you
can't<00:00:28.019> tell<00:00:28.170> ever<00:00:28.380> do<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:28.740> bedrock<00:00:29.099> now

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
can't tell ever do that with bedrock now

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.820 
can't tell ever do that with bedrock now
bedrock<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.480> fairly<00:00:30.720> easy<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.199> acquire<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
bedrock is fairly easy to acquire you

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.709 
bedrock is fairly easy to acquire you
can<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.160> by<00:00:32.279> donating<00:00:32.700> or<00:00:33.000> from<00:00:33.510> drop

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
can get it by donating or from drop

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.260 
can get it by donating or from drop
parties<00:00:34.110> or<00:00:34.320> rating<00:00:34.710> or<00:00:34.910> killing<00:00:35.910> donors<00:00:36.239> or

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
parties or rating or killing donors or

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.910 
parties or rating or killing donors or
anything<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.469> fairly<00:00:37.770> easy

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
anything like that so it's fairly easy

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.100 
anything like that so it's fairly easy
to<00:00:38.070> get<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.430> tons<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.790> people<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.180> but

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
to get and tons of people have it but

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.810 
to get and tons of people have it but
not<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> lot<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.829> people<00:00:41.070> know<00:00:41.100> how<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.399> use<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
not a lot of people know how to use it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.670 
not a lot of people know how to use it
effectively<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.050> not<00:00:43.170> used<00:00:43.379> effectively

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
effectively if it's not used effectively

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.549 
effectively if it's not used effectively
then<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.789> can't<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:45.270> make<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.750> good<00:00:46.350> base

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
then you can't really make a good base

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.260 
then you can't really make a good base
with<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.010> I'm<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> demonstrate<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
with it and I'm going to demonstrate to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.639 
with it and I'm going to demonstrate to
you<00:00:48.360> guys<00:00:48.510> how<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.079> make<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.230> bases

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you guys how you can make your bases

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.490 
you guys how you can make your bases
more<00:00:49.829> secure<00:00:50.160> using<00:00:50.550> bedrock<00:00:51.379> one<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
more secure using bedrock one of the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.260 
more secure using bedrock one of the
most<00:00:52.620> common<00:00:52.949> ways<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.399> people<00:00:53.489> glitch<00:00:54.059> into

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
most common ways that people glitch into

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
most common ways that people glitch into
bedrock<00:00:54.539> bases<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.140> destroy<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> chest<00:00:55.770> on

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
bedrock bases and destroy the chest on

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.500 
bedrock bases and destroy the chest on
the<00:00:55.949> inside<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.610> through<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> ender<00:00:57.329> pearl

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the inside is through the ender pearl

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.029 
the inside is through the ender pearl
glitch<00:00:57.750> which<00:00:58.410> i'm<00:00:58.530> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> show<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.859> guys

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
glitch which i'm going to show you guys

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.310 
glitch which i'm going to show you guys
now<00:00:59.370> so<00:01:00.120> i<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> bedrock<00:01:00.780> platform<00:01:01.230> up

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
now so i have a bedrock platform up

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.090 
now so i have a bedrock platform up
there<00:01:01.350> I'm<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.250> survival<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.120> see

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
there I'm in survival as you can see

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.990 
there I'm in survival as you can see
we're<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> chuck<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> bunch<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.820> ender

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
we're going to chuck a bunch of ender

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500 
we're going to chuck a bunch of ender
pearls<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:08.030> say<00:01:09.030> did<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
pearls up there say did I get it that

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.140 
pearls up there say did I get it that
time<00:01:09.630> nope<00:01:10.409> yep<00:01:10.830> glitch<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.520> throw<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:11.790> with

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
time nope yep glitch right throw so with

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.510 
time nope yep glitch right throw so with
one<00:01:12.330> stack<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.780> ender<00:01:12.960> pearls<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.409> was<00:01:14.130> able<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
one stack of ender pearls I was able to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
one stack of ender pearls I was able to
to<00:01:14.909> glitch<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.240> through<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.170> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
to glitch right through there and I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.179 
to glitch right through there and I
would<00:01:16.590> now<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.340> or<00:01:18.060> inside<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.860> base<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:20.100> it

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
would now be on or inside a base if it

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.550 
would now be on or inside a base if it
only<00:01:20.280> had<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.520> layer<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.970> bedrock<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.659> that

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
only had one layer of bedrock and that

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.130 
only had one layer of bedrock and that
one<00:01:22.770> thing<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.979> lot<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.310> people<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.140> because

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
one thing a lot of people do is because

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.690 
one thing a lot of people do is because
they<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.350> bedrock<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.009> they<00:01:26.130> think<00:01:26.189> nobody

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
they have bedrock and they think nobody

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.730 
they have bedrock and they think nobody
will<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:26.939> able<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.240> inside<00:01:27.570> they<00:01:28.470> leave

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
will be able to get inside they leave

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.069 
will be able to get inside they leave
their<00:01:28.920> chest<00:01:29.189> completely<00:01:29.490> uncovered<00:01:30.079> what

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
their chest completely uncovered what

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.690 
their chest completely uncovered what
you<00:01:31.170> want<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> do<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.979> cover<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.460> chest

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you want to do is cover your chest

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.280 
you want to do is cover your chest
completely<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.329> water<00:01:33.540> make<00:01:33.990> sure<00:01:34.140> they're

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
completely in water make sure they're

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230 
completely in water make sure they're
completely<00:01:34.590> surrounded<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.150> have

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
completely surrounded or if you have

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.010 
completely surrounded or if you have
lava<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:37.350> better<00:01:37.590> yet<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.610> use<00:01:38.790> that

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
lava it's better yet to to use that

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.330 
lava it's better yet to to use that
that'll<00:01:40.020> make<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.140> very<00:01:40.320> secure<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.920> even<00:01:41.250> if

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that'll make it very secure and even if

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.280 
that'll make it very secure and even if
people<00:01:41.579> are<00:01:41.790> able<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.150> blow<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.600> by<00:01:43.049> some

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
people are able to blow it up by some

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.889 
people are able to blow it up by some
method<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.390> stuff<00:01:45.600> will<00:01:45.720> burn

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
method then all of the stuff will burn

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.330 
method then all of the stuff will burn
and<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> satisfaction<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.220> knowing

that they didn't get anything out of the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.139 
that they didn't get anything out of the
raid<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:50.100> good<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.340> encased<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.909> chest

from getting creepy right but back to

from getting creepy right but back to
the<00:01:54.899> problem<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.229> hand<00:01:55.280> how<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.610> prevent

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
the problem at hand how do we prevent

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.630 
the problem at hand how do we prevent
people<00:01:57.299> from<00:01:57.500> glitching<00:01:58.500> into<00:01:58.890> our<00:01:59.340> bedrock

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
people from glitching into our bedrock

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.480 
people from glitching into our bedrock
basis<00:02:00.149> now<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.259> thing<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.040> you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
basis now one thing you can do is you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.280 
basis now one thing you can do is you
can<00:02:02.520> build<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.909> way<00:02:03.360> down<00:02:03.390> at<00:02:03.750> bedrock<00:02:03.899> level

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
can build it way down at bedrock level

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.380 
can build it way down at bedrock level
the<00:02:05.250> problem<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.090> requires

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the problem with that is it requires

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.080 
the problem with that is it requires
clearing<00:02:07.290> however<00:02:07.979> however<00:02:08.520> much<00:02:08.759> space<00:02:09.030> you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
clearing however however much space you

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.490 
clearing however however much space you
want<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.929> your<00:02:09.989> base<00:02:11.750> down<00:02:12.750> at<00:02:13.260> bed

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
want to have in your base down at bed

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.810 
want to have in your base down at bed
och<00:02:13.560> level<00:02:13.830> which<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.070> really<00:02:14.250> annoying<00:02:14.490> and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
och level which is really annoying and

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.570 
och level which is really annoying and
you<00:02:15.510> may<00:02:15.630> not<00:02:15.750> want<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:15.960> do<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:17.370> method

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
you may not want to do that this method

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.740 
you may not want to do that this method
requires<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.240> have<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.360> little<00:02:18.570> extra

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
requires you to have a little extra

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.030 
requires you to have a little extra
bedrock<00:02:19.290> which<00:02:19.530> isn't<00:02:19.800> really<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:20.010> problem

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
bedrock which isn't really a problem

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.940 
bedrock which isn't really a problem
because<00:02:20.430> most<00:02:20.670> people<00:02:20.940> have<00:02:20.970> tons<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.420> bedrock

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
because most people have tons of bedrock

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.010 
because most people have tons of bedrock

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
base area will be up here there we go

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.670 
base area will be up here there we go
alright<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.420> we'll<00:03:03.540> go<00:03:03.660> ahead<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.080> put<00:03:04.440> a

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
and get some more ender pearls here is

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.340 
and get some more ender pearls here is
we're<00:03:15.239> going<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.390> do<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.630> same<00:03:15.840> glitching

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
we're going to do the same glitching

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.430 
we're going to do the same glitching
thing<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.709> did<00:03:16.920> before<00:03:17.750> but<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.080> now<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.350> we've

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
thing I did before but so now that we've

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.780 
thing I did before but so now that we've
got<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.590> room<00:03:19.920> on<00:03:20.100> there<00:03:20.280> it's<00:03:20.459> going<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.730> be

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
got that room on there it's going to be

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.789 
got that room on there it's going to be
much<00:03:21.000> harder<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.570> glitch<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:27.650> all<00:03:28.650> right

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
much harder to glitch in all right

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.740 
much harder to glitch in all right
almost<00:03:29.070> got<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.580> time<00:03:29.610> so<00:03:29.970> let's<00:03:30.540> try<00:03:30.690> it

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
almost got it that time so let's try it

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.440 
almost got it that time so let's try it
again<00:03:31.670> give<00:03:32.670> myself<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:33.000> bunch<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.239> ender

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
again give myself a bunch of ender

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.970 
again give myself a bunch of ender

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.449 
this little fake room that we have in
here<00:03:55.160> I'm<00:03:56.160> no<00:03:56.459> longer<00:03:56.640> able<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.030> throw<00:03:57.269> pearls

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
here I'm no longer able to throw pearls

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.509 
here I'm no longer able to throw pearls
because<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.760> other<00:04:00.030> room<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.299> too<00:04:00.450> small<00:04:00.480> and

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
because the other room is too small and

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.220 
because the other room is too small and
you<00:04:02.519> can't<00:04:02.790> throw<00:04:03.000> pearls<00:04:03.239> too<00:04:03.780> close<00:04:04.049> to

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
you can't throw pearls too close to

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.990 
you can't throw pearls too close to
walls<00:04:04.440> with<00:04:04.769> factions<00:04:05.190> installed<00:04:05.820> on<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
walls with factions installed on the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.819 
walls with factions installed on the
server<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.989> this<00:04:07.140> is<00:04:07.260> basically<00:04:07.350> just<00:04:07.650> a

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
server so this is basically just a

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.440 
server so this is basically just a
little<00:04:08.040> room<00:04:08.250> where<00:04:08.579> people<00:04:08.970> will<00:04:09.060> get<00:04:09.180> stuck

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
little room where people will get stuck

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.240 
little room where people will get stuck
and<00:04:09.660> let<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.320> TP<00:04:10.560> out<00:04:10.680> because<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:10.980> can't<00:04:11.160> do

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
and let the TP out because I can't do

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.949 
and let the TP out because I can't do
anything<00:04:11.390> so<00:04:12.390> this<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.660> something<00:04:12.840> very

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
anything so this is something very

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.870 
anything so this is something very
simple<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.560> can<00:04:13.920> do<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.160> your<00:04:14.250> bases<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.760> make

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
simple you can do to your bases to make

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.000 
simple you can do to your bases to make
them<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.030> little<00:04:15.150> less<00:04:15.450> readable<00:04:15.769> how<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:16.859> works

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
them a little less readable how it works

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.640 
them a little less readable how it works
very<00:04:17.130> well<00:04:17.250> it's<00:04:17.970> very<00:04:18.150> simple<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.630> do<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:18.870> it

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
very well it's very simple to do and it

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.050 
very well it's very simple to do and it
allows<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.310> not<00:04:20.519> build<00:04:20.700> your<00:04:20.880> base<00:04:21.000> is

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
allows you to not build your base is

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.330 
allows you to not build your base is
down<00:04:21.390> at<00:04:21.510> bedrock<00:04:21.660> level<00:04:22.070> so<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.130> don't<00:04:23.280> have

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
down at bedrock level so you don't have

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.560 
down at bedrock level so you don't have
to<00:04:23.460> clear<00:04:23.700> a

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
to clear a

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.990 
to clear a
land<00:04:24.840> it's<00:04:25.710> really<00:04:25.830> nice<00:04:26.040> really<00:04:26.550> simple

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
land it's really nice really simple

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.480 
land it's really nice really simple
really<00:04:27.150> quick<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:27.990> do<00:04:28.230> and<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.860> will<00:04:29.010> save<00:04:29.280> you

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
really quick to do and it will save you

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.290 
really quick to do and it will save you
a<00:04:29.730> lot<00:04:30.510> of<00:04:30.570> your<00:04:30.750> stuff<00:04:31.020> in<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.940> hopefully<00:04:32.940> will
