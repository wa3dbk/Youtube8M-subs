00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
juicing pretty crazy things like we

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.900 
juicing pretty crazy things like we
think<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.920> as<00:00:14.040> far<00:00:14.190> as<00:00:14.250> i<00:00:14.400> know<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.759> only

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
think and as far as i know it's the only

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.630 
think and as far as i know it's the only
physics-based<00:00:15.269> fighting<00:00:15.809> game<00:00:16.220> out<00:00:17.220> there<00:00:17.250> as

far as i know and once you play this and

far as i know and once you play this and
you<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.699> you're<00:00:20.789> actually<00:00:20.939> boxing<00:00:21.779> or

fighting and making contact like you

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.160

people<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.769> real<00:00:25.980> life<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.880> really<00:00:27.090> hard<00:00:27.359> to

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
people in real life it's really hard to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.179 
people in real life it's really hard to
play<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> fighting<00:00:28.199> game<00:00:28.230> any<00:00:28.560> other<00:00:28.769> way<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
play a fighting game any other way I

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.679 
play a fighting game any other way I
mean<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.910> test<00:00:30.210> whether<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.570> like

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
mean as you can test whether you like

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.620 
mean as you can test whether you like
fighting<00:00:31.019> games<00:00:31.199> or<00:00:31.380> boxing<00:00:31.710> games<00:00:31.859> are<00:00:32.009> not

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
startling to watch and now I think maybe

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.930 
startling to watch and now I think maybe
you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.100> see<00:00:38.280> some<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.670> Freddie<00:00:38.850> and

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
sorry as I go silent as I'm intensely

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.370 
sorry as I go silent as I'm intensely
competing<00:01:22.250> with<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:26.479> think<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:26.780> think<00:01:27.289> we

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
competing with you think you think we

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.990 
competing with you think you think we
wouldn't<00:01:27.920> be<00:01:28.039> so<00:01:28.189> serious<00:01:28.399> about<00:01:28.579> it<00:01:28.729> after

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
wouldn't be so serious about it after

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.020 
wouldn't be so serious about it after
working<00:01:29.780> on<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.960> game<00:01:30.079> for<00:01:30.350> over<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.560> year<00:01:30.649> but

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
working on the game for over a year but

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.639 
working on the game for over a year but
but<00:01:32.030> I<00:01:32.090> mean<00:01:32.240> again<00:01:32.509> it's<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:33.170> beauty<00:01:33.469> of<00:01:33.560> all

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
but I mean again it's the beauty of all

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.319 
but I mean again it's the beauty of all
this<00:01:33.829> stuff<00:01:34.039> that<00:01:34.490> we<00:01:34.579> can<00:01:34.729> actually<00:01:34.850> do<00:01:35.149> this

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
this stuff that we can actually do this

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.779 
this stuff that we can actually do this
i<00:01:35.479> mean<00:01:35.509> no<00:01:36.039> matter<00:01:37.039> what<00:01:37.219> other<00:01:37.340> games<00:01:37.549> come

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
i mean no matter what other games come

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.370 
i mean no matter what other games come
out<00:01:37.909> fighting<00:01:38.270> games<00:01:38.450> boxing<00:01:38.929> games<00:01:39.079> come<00:01:39.259> out

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
out fighting games boxing games come out

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.260 
out fighting games boxing games come out
unless<00:01:39.860> it's<00:01:40.159> physics<00:01:40.490> based<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.850> just<00:01:41.060> can't

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
unless it's physics based you just can't

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.340 
unless it's physics based you just can't
mimic<00:01:41.539> this<00:01:41.780> any<00:01:41.990> other<00:01:42.049> way<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:47.509> it<00:01:47.810> truly<00:01:48.020> it

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
mimic this any other way and it truly it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.870 
mimic this any other way and it truly it
surely<00:01:48.590> approximates<00:01:49.130> boxing<00:01:49.520> like<00:01:49.670> Freddie

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
surely approximates boxing like Freddie

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.760 
surely approximates boxing like Freddie

you're<00:02:10.819> going<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.000> have<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.239> fight<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.780> style

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
you're going to have to fight a style

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.360 
you're going to have to fight a style
that<00:02:13.549> best<00:02:14.360> suits<00:02:14.720> your<00:02:15.620> physical<00:02:15.980> attributes

that's<00:02:17.299> going<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.540> make<00:02:17.629> online<00:02:17.870> gameplay

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
that's going to make online gameplay

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.770 
that's going to make online gameplay
even<00:02:19.160> more<00:02:19.340> deep<00:02:19.579> because<00:02:19.849> you're<00:02:20.569> going<00:02:20.690> to

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
even more deep because you're going to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.120 
even more deep because you're going to
fight<00:02:20.930> against<00:02:21.170> all<00:02:21.350> kinds<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.709> people<00:02:21.829> that

are faster or slower taller shorter and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.809 
are faster or slower taller shorter and
it's<00:02:26.660> going<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.810> change<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.139> way<00:02:27.260> they<00:02:27.380> fight

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
it's going to change the way they fight

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.830 
it's going to change the way they fight
and<00:02:28.819> when<00:02:29.030> fight<00:02:29.209> night<00:02:29.359> round<00:02:29.389> free<00:02:29.690> you

and when fight night round free you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.170 
and when fight night round free you
could<00:02:29.989> not<00:02:30.139> do<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.519> our<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:32.030> is

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
could not do that so this is our this is

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.030 
could not do that so this is our this is

here was one of the dev teams kind of
complaints<00:02:37.760> about<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.209> corner<00:02:38.630> game<00:02:38.750> and

I'm leaving this up here for purposes of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.770 
I'm leaving this up here for purposes of
our<00:02:42.920> demo<00:02:43.269> was<00:02:44.269> that<00:02:44.389> fight<00:02:44.630> night<00:02:44.750> round

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
our demo was that fight night round

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.680 
our demo was that fight night round
three<00:02:45.139> what<00:02:45.859> I<00:02:45.889> did<00:02:46.280> wasn't<00:02:47.120> necessarily

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
three what I did wasn't necessarily

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.599 
three what I did wasn't necessarily
exactly<00:02:48.079> what<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.500> would<00:02:48.590> do<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:48.889> kind<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.400> in

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
exactly what you would do and kind of in

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.250 
exactly what you would do and kind of in
real<00:02:49.910> life<00:02:50.060> boxing<00:02:50.510> but<00:02:50.599> worst<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.959> all<00:02:51.079> was

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
real life boxing but worst of all was

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.129 
real life boxing but worst of all was
that<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:52.430> took<00:02:52.700> me<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.269> had<00:02:53.359> to<00:02:53.450> do<00:02:53.569> my<00:02:53.780> thing

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
that it took me to I had to do my thing

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.259 
that it took me to I had to do my thing
then<00:02:55.010> what<00:02:55.190> are<00:02:55.280> some<00:02:55.400> cut<00:02:55.549> sequences<00:02:56.060> and

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
then what are some cut sequences and

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.640 
then what are some cut sequences and
then<00:02:56.420> your<00:02:56.630> competitor<00:02:57.109> would<00:02:57.260> do<00:02:57.410> their

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
then your competitor would do their

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.650 
then your competitor would do their
thing<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.190> you'd<00:02:58.730> spend<00:02:58.970> about<00:02:59.120> a<00:02:59.180> minute<00:02:59.540> in

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
thing and you'd spend about a minute in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.870 
thing and you'd spend about a minute in
between<00:02:59.780> rounds<00:02:59.989> doing<00:03:00.650> your<00:03:00.829> things<00:03:01.069> and<00:03:01.400> you

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
between rounds doing your things and you

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.330 
between rounds doing your things and you
really<00:03:02.060> wanted<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.359> spite<00:03:02.599> and<00:03:03.139> so<00:03:04.130> what<00:03:04.250> this

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
really wanted to spite and so what this

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.800 
really wanted to spite and so what this
allows<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.849> do<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.120> one<00:03:05.359> which<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.569> very
