beauty haul because haven't done one in
quite<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> while<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.289> I've<00:00:17.220> been<00:00:17.400> buying<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.820> lot

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
quite a while and I've been buying a lot

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.820 
quite a while and I've been buying a lot
more<00:00:18.090> like<00:00:18.240> makeup<00:00:18.539> stuff<00:00:18.960> recently<00:00:19.260> rather

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
more like makeup stuff recently rather

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.160 
more like makeup stuff recently rather
than<00:00:20.100> just<00:00:20.340> like<00:00:20.550> skincare<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.240> things<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.140> I

than just like skincare and things so I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.470 
than just like skincare and things so I
thought<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.949> justified<00:00:23.460> having<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.150> whole

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
thought that it justified having a whole

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.990 
thought that it justified having a whole
video<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.320> itself<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.189> I've<00:00:26.609> kind<00:00:26.939> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
light seems to be really why I don't

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270 
light seems to be really why I don't
know<00:00:51.390> why<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.379> really<00:00:52.590> nice<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:53.160> like

know why it's a really nice just like

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.540 
know why it's a really nice just like
golden<00:00:53.789> glow<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.690> costs<00:00:55.050> full<00:00:55.379> pound<00:00:55.590> 69<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
golden glow and it costs full pound 69 I

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.389

believe<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.930> reduced<00:00:58.260> from<00:00:58.320> 699<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
believe but it is reduced from 699 to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.160 
believe but it is reduced from 699 to
the<00:00:59.489> price<00:00:59.640> might<00:00:59.910> go<00:01:00.090> back<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.660> got<00:01:01.050> the

the price might go back up I got the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.050 
the price might go back up I got the
shade<00:01:01.350> medium<00:01:01.739> dark<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:03.260> yeah<00:01:04.909> she<00:01:05.909> really

favorite<00:01:26.909> scent<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.540> i<00:01:27.630> find<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.200> different

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
favorite scent and i find that different

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.580 
favorite scent and i find that different
Battiste<00:01:29.579> actually<00:01:30.390> work<00:01:30.600> differently<00:01:31.290> like

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
Battiste actually work differently like

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.530 
Battiste actually work differently like
and<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> sounds<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:32.759> ridiculous<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.479> i

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and it sounds really ridiculous but i

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.910 
and it sounds really ridiculous but i
find<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.930> some<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.229> them<00:01:34.320> aren't<00:01:34.530> really

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
find that some of them aren't really

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.569 
find that some of them aren't really
like<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.970> good<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.509> me<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.979> one<00:01:38.250> is

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
like that good for me and this one is

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.399 
like that good for me and this one is
probably<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.240> best<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.720> me<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.140> getting<00:01:40.259> rid

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
probably the best for me for getting rid

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.440 
probably the best for me for getting rid
of<00:01:40.470> grease<00:01:40.790> whereas<00:01:41.790> some<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> other<00:01:42.299> ones

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.120 
of grease whereas some of the other ones
i<00:01:42.570> find<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.140> don't<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.530> rid<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.740> greece's

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
brow palette but i find this one to be

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.110 
brow palette but i find this one to be
the<00:03:43.569> best<00:03:43.780> for<00:03:44.019> my<00:03:44.199> skin<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:44.889> it's<00:03:45.699> just<00:03:45.940> got

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
the best for my skin and it's just got

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.150 
the best for my skin and it's just got
the<00:03:46.209> highlight<00:03:46.629> it's<00:03:47.019> got<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.440> dark<00:03:47.859> brown

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
the highlight it's got a dark brown

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.520 
the highlight it's got a dark brown
powder<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.419> then<00:03:49.510> it's<00:03:49.690> got<00:03:49.780> like<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.959> waxy

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
powder and then it's got like a waxy

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.189 
powder and then it's got like a waxy
finish<00:03:50.949> so<00:03:51.639> i<00:03:51.669> find<00:03:52.329> this<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.930> probably<00:03:53.079> the

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
finish so i find this is probably the

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.050 
finish so i find this is probably the
best<00:03:53.349> for<00:03:53.500> my<00:03:53.620> eyebrows<00:03:54.010> i'm<00:03:54.280> not<00:03:54.549> sure<00:03:54.760> if<00:03:54.879> re

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
best for my eyebrows i'm not sure if re

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.490 
best for my eyebrows i'm not sure if re
i'm<00:03:55.209> actually<00:03:55.329> do<00:03:55.540> any<00:03:55.690> other<00:03:55.720> colors<00:03:56.199> of<00:03:56.349> this

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
i'm actually do any other colors of this

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.140 
i'm actually do any other colors of this
i<00:03:56.739> think<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.340> literally<00:03:57.669> is<00:03:57.699> just<00:03:58.030> this

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
i think it literally is just this

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.509 
i think it literally is just this
palette<00:03:58.660> which<00:03:59.169> is<00:03:59.379> good<00:03:59.560> for<00:03:59.739> me<00:03:59.769> but<00:04:00.280> save

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
palette which is good for me but save

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.830 
palette which is good for me but save
someone<00:04:00.819> realized<00:04:01.000> i<00:04:01.150> browse<00:04:01.449> it's<00:04:01.599> probably

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
someone realized i browse it's probably

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.900 
someone realized i browse it's probably
not<00:04:02.019> ideal<00:04:02.500> but<00:04:03.250> this<00:04:03.310> is<00:04:03.549> just<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.760> perfect

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
not ideal but this is just the perfect

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.640 
not ideal but this is just the perfect
shade<00:04:04.239> i<00:04:04.419> used<00:04:04.629> it<00:04:04.780> today<00:04:04.900> actually<00:04:05.139> so<00:04:05.560> you

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
shade i used it today actually so you

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.619 
shade i used it today actually so you
can<00:04:05.889> see<00:04:06.160> i<00:04:06.430> really<00:04:06.970> like<00:04:07.120> this<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.449> this<00:04:07.510> is

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629

599<00:04:08.260> which<00:04:08.590> is<00:04:08.709> really<00:04:08.919> affordable<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.660> it's

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
599 which is really affordable and it's

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.020

probably my favorite broker ever then

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.900 
probably my favorite broker ever then
from<00:04:13.389> barry<00:04:13.599> mi<00:04:13.930> also<00:04:14.470> repurchased<00:04:15.280> showgirl

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
from barry mi also repurchased showgirl

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.810 
from barry mi also repurchased showgirl
which<00:04:16.329> i<00:04:16.570> had<00:04:16.840> before<00:04:17.320> but<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:18.190> went<00:04:18.400> missing

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
which i had before but it went missing

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.339 
which i had before but it went missing
before<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.209> really<00:04:19.419> had<00:04:19.539> chance<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.930> trial<00:04:20.229> it

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
before I really had chance to trial it

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.110 
before I really had chance to trial it
properly<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.889> I<00:04:21.280> believe<00:04:21.579> this<00:04:21.820> is<00:04:21.880> about

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
properly and I believe this is about

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.909 
properly and I believe this is about
four<00:04:22.450> pounds<00:04:22.630> but<00:04:22.930> i'm<00:04:23.050> not<00:04:23.200> sure<00:04:23.440> i'll<00:04:23.740> have

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
four pounds but i'm not sure i'll have

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.850 
four pounds but i'm not sure i'll have
to<00:04:24.099> double<00:04:24.219> check<00:04:24.400> this<00:04:25.030> is<00:04:25.240> just<00:04:25.419> the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
to double check this is just the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.219 
to double check this is just the
lengthening<00:04:26.400> mascara<00:04:26.550> of<00:04:27.090> theirs<00:04:27.389> and<00:04:27.689> it's

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
lengthening mascara of theirs and it's

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.589 
lengthening mascara of theirs and it's
actually<00:04:28.379> quite<00:04:28.800> heavy<00:04:29.280> like<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.789> find<00:04:30.509> this

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
actually quite heavy like I find this

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.290 
actually quite heavy like I find this
quite<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.840> heavy<00:04:31.050> mascara<00:04:31.590> like<00:04:32.370> holding<00:04:33.120> wise

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
quite a heavy mascara like holding wise

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.450 
quite a heavy mascara like holding wise
but<00:04:33.840> when<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.139> apply<00:04:34.469> it<00:04:34.500> i<00:04:34.740> find<00:04:35.039> it<00:04:35.159> doesn't

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
but when you apply it i find it doesn't

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.890 
but when you apply it i find it doesn't
really<00:04:35.580> give<00:04:35.759> much<00:04:35.909> product<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.389> the<00:04:36.479> lashes

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
really give much product to the lashes

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.469 
really give much product to the lashes
and<00:04:37.139> it<00:04:37.919> does<00:04:38.159> lengthen<00:04:38.639> them<00:04:38.819> but<00:04:39.090> i<00:04:39.120> find

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
and it does lengthen them but i find

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.230 
and it does lengthen them but i find
that<00:04:39.719> it<00:04:39.840> looks<00:04:40.080> too<00:04:41.039> natural<00:04:41.550> for<00:04:41.759> me<00:04:41.879> like<00:04:42.090> i

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
that it looks too natural for me like i

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.610 
that it looks too natural for me like i
quite<00:04:42.569> like<00:04:42.750> when<00:04:42.960> you<00:04:43.050> can<00:04:43.199> see<00:04:43.379> that<00:04:43.409> I've

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
quite like when you can see that I've

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.920 
quite like when you can see that I've
got<00:04:43.650> mascara<00:04:44.069> on<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:45.210> this<00:04:45.599> is<00:04:45.750> good<00:04:45.900> for
