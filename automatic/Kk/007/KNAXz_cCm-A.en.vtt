00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.079
 my dad lives in africa 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.729
 I live in the Netherlands with my mom 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.230
 we live in a large concrete flat 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.230
 those are all houses that are stacked on top of each other 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.880
 Next to our place is a busy road, cars and buses run long 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:30.519
 successively there is also a playground in the shoes and the square 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.760
 but says it does watch out with the plans 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.760
 because the playground is right next to a busy road 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.660
 my dad country in africa 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.120
 I think a lot of camels and zebras are riding there 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.790
 but I'm going to see Dad soon 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.530
 Mom says we have to take the plane for a long time 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.820
 as long as we can watch a movie en route 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.120
 I don't know what Africa looks like 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.120
 but mama says it's very different from the netherlands 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.830
 of course I am bringing a lot of things 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.830
 all my best and all my plane in my suitcase 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.020
 let us know become a pilot 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.190
 dad wrote us a letter 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.940
 he's glad we come 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.940
 me too but i don't want to miss my friends 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.580
 mama says I would probably get new friends there 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.200
 and maybe I'll ride a zebra 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.810
 fortunately, men come along 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.200
 Dad had run out of airport 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.910
 it's very hot here 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.910
 and people wear long dresses 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.970
 but says that you can shoot away 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.410
 they help to keep the 49 away 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.320
 one may also wear it tonight 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.680
 dementia is also just a dark brown 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.710
 i am light brown man my swollen with yellow hair 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.690
 many people look at us 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.690
 that's because we all have a different color, says dad 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.360
 what a beautiful house dad says 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.780
 very different from our house in the Netherlands 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.200
 the house is a very large garden with fruit trees 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.570
 there are also pauwels 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.109
 I see no can yet participate 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.859
 don't send any zebras yet 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.159
 I walk into the garden with mommy and daddy and I see a lot 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.119
 they are all just food 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.119
 astrazeneca it seems whole 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.829
 play together 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.489
 a whole other game they make this is with branches and behind the stall 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.949
 there is a football life 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.000
 Fortunately 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.359
 what i can do very well 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.689
 I always do that with my friends in the Netherlands 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.609
 after playing football it all became very hot 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.799
 a boy grabbed home sprayed 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.959
 that boy has porridge and sprayed wet, I have to laugh very hard 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.399
 fortunately that is not then he is also very hot he is happy with one 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:54.989
 cold shower 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.769
 it is getting dark slowly 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.129
 there are all colors in the elevator and in the church leaders of a month 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.169
 earlier 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:05.249
 the decision can be 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.249
 Papa's kaftan completely dried up due to the heat 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.149
 I get to sign with own blue 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:16.399
 In the evening, Daddy, Mom and I go for a nice meal with the three of us 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.460
 the food is very sharp 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.509
 and it clicks on my tongue 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:22.590
 he has food 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.749
 strange names such as oprah and yes 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.169
 those are vegetables 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.179
 but then on its africa spaces 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:32.179
 Dad is very proud that I just eat it on time 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:37.349
 outside it has become dark I jump the big test of cash register and 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.739
 mama's slovenia and pebbles of free that is a mosquito net 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.419
 sassenheimers to stop the air horn has a gift for 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.269
 me 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.200
 it's a weird one 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.200
 but nice soft cuddling nature 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.359
 I also have a nice room on the other side of the corridor 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.079
 I ask men 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.470
 to be able to paint on the wall with soap remnants in my room 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.569
 the app may 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.549
 together we will start 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.419
 I wear the brakes with paint 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.459
 and then grabbed brushes 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.619
 we lay the newspapers well on the floor 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:14.809
 and I put this on 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.599
 where the zebra just need to get more 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.970
 as mama shit paints my planes ready to take off 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.870
 the room will be really beautiful 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.870
 much nicer than a room in the Netherlands 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.379
 i like it in africa 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:32.479
 it is very beautiful here everything has so many colors 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:35.469
 and I made new friends 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:37.860
 I often also think of the Netherlands 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.059
 I miss my friends 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:41.479
 and aunt 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.590
 I miss grandpa and grandma very much too 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.590
 so eager to tell you how beautiful it is here 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.689
 also a lot of drawings for them 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:53.120
 they send kinheim envelope to my friends 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.439
 aunt and grandfather and grandmother 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.439
 what they have never been to africa 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.139
 here you can see how our journey went 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.039
 we started in the Netherlands 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.719
 that is in the north at the very top of this map 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:09.180
 you see the rain clouds 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.620
 and the Dutch flag 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.810
 the plane flew south to africa 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.960
 Africa is a big compliment with many countries 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.969
 and we went to my dad's land 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:23.650
 nigeria 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.879
 you see that flag of nigeria 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.009
 he is green and white 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.460
 nigeria is twenty times the size of the netherlands 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.749
 and a home ten times as many people 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:36.729
 home and wild animals 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.199
 in nigeria it is very hot 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.020
 that comes 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.699
 because it work 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:41.800
 always summer
