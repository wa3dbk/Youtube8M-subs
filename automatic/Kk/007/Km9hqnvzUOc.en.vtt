00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.860
 A) Yes 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.230
 they have existed for a long time 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.710
 rumors about the presence of UFOs 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.390
 close to the sun but experts say 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.400
 that anything that comes to 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.280
 get closer to our nearest star 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.260
 it would be destroyed because of its 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.830
 surface temperature of 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.680
 approximately 5,500 degrees Celsius 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.739
 and more than 15.5 million degrees 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.570
 centigrade in the core this heat 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.480
 incinerate and any material 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.629
 known at a distant distance by not 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.360
 talk about the radiation that the sun emits 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.180
 however the conspiranoics say that 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.190
 if the object is an extraterrestrial craft 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.649
 could be equipped with a technology 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.070
 advanced with the ability to support the 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:17.289
 enormous solar heat these ships would be of 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.710
 an exceptional civilization 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.610
 advanced to create a material what 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.160
 strong enough to 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.560
 protect yourself from heat and fire damage 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.899
 as well as to keep any being 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.110
 I live inside, safe from the high 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.940
 unbearable temperatures but the most 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.400
 surprising is that the probe 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.310
 spacecraft alone would have captured several of 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.510
 these objects of extraterrestrial origin 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.340
 near the sun 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.680
 the nasa would be aware of the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.780
 existence of civilizations with ships 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.140
 space capable of resisting 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.750
 extremely high temperatures although 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.850
 other conspiracy theories suggest that 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.770
 the large solar flares that 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.100
 affect the earth are caused 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.750
 experiments carried out by the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.300
 extraterrestrials that feed on the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.250
 solar energy or that the sun would be a 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.619
 kind of portal used by 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.980
 extraterrestrial civilizations for 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.290
 travel throughout the universe and again 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.540
 a huge UFO has been captured by the 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.630
 space probe only in the process of collision 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.540
 with the sun 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.970
 the mother ship near the sun according to 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.280
 daily express the space agency 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.790
 American published last week 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.800
 images of a large solar flare 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.660
 but what nobody expected to find 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.910
 it was a mother ship of origin 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.090
 extraterrestrial near our star 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.150
 nearest published on youtube by the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.300
 stress user cap 1 on July 17, 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.640
 2015 and with the support of scott de guarín 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.370
 Website editor or photos and things 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.770
 daily the images seem to show that 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.280
 NASA is aware of the presence of 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.290
 these ships this object has clearly 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.420
 a structure and if the nasa what 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.210
 discredit would be an insult to the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.280
 intelligence of people as he says 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.410
 the description of the video published by 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.050
 stress cap 1 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.030
 if they publish these data then they should 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.980
 of waiting for the experts in UFOs 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.379
 find the anomalies and share them 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.330
 Guarín said he asked the 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.180
 NASA experts on this new 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.780
 anomaly near the sun but still not 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.530
 have pronounced about this this UFO is 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.690
 awesome said guarín every time 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.840
 I try to ask NASA for an opinion on 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.030
 these UFOs on twitter ignore me 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.459
 they have never responded and refuse to 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.610
 talk about these giant UFOs near 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.430
 our sun these boats sometimes 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.530
 they are even the size of the moon 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.049
 this new UFO is like it's from 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.200
 age size still matters to the 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.260
 nasa I'm going to try again to send a 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.260
 message to the nasa on twitter let's see 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.170
 if they respond 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.540
 Guarín believes that these gigantic ships 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.299
 they are devourers of solar energy and if 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.459
 we continue sharing our sun not 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.579
 will last a long time before it 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.159
 Exhaustion for its part the nasa ensures that 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.109
 all these anomalies in the images 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.510
 provided by the space probe 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.669
 Soho are caused by energy 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.460
 released to the entire solar system during 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.010
 a solar rash sometimes with both 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.870
 power as the equivalent of 160 billion 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.330
 of tnt megatons 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.730
 however this new mothership 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.100
 draining solar energy during a 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.870
 solar explosion has become subject 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.660
 of conversation on social networks 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.720
 that as always happens in these cases 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.110
 the most skeptical assure that they are not 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.090
 ships from other worlds many believe that 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.760
 the UFOs and other points that appear 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.340
 around the sun are only a part of 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.470
 the enormous liberation of electrons ions 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.830
 and atoms during a mass ejection 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.630
 Coronal others believe that it is simply 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.000
 a solar flare that creates a 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.850
 sudden flash on the surface of the 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.340
 sun but whatever the answer to 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.740
 this new mystery the reality is that 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.110
 the space probe has only helped the 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.540
 astronomers to discover more than 3,000 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.910
 unknown comets in our system 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.060
 solar but has also revealed some 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.210
 of the extraterrestrial ships more 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.800
 extraordinary never seen ships 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.310
 extraterrestrial or optical phenomena 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.129
 caused by solar explosions like 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.969
 you always decide 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:39.739

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:59.949
 who has spoken m &amp; r creepy 666 goodbye 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.050
