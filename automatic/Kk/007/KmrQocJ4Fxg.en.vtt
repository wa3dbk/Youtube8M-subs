the fact that this is a bit mask allows

the fact that this is a bit mask allows
you<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.120> combine<00:03:12.270> these<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:13.380> one<00:03:13.680> plus<00:03:13.860> two

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
you to combine these so one plus two

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.610 
you to combine these so one plus two
equals<00:03:14.520> three<00:03:15.080> meaning<00:03:16.080> that<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.320> set<00:03:16.530> the
