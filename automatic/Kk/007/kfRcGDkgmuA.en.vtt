here it looks very messy when it's done
with<00:00:22.769> its<00:00:22.949> bloom<00:00:23.250> cycle<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:25.109> will<00:00:25.260> follow

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
with its bloom cycle and it will follow

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.640 
with its bloom cycle and it will follow
it<00:00:25.920> will<00:00:26.070> keep<00:00:26.279> blooming<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
it will keep blooming so what the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.279 
it will keep blooming so what the
challenge<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.760> plant<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.750> how

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
challenge is with this plant is is how

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.380 
challenge is with this plant is is how
do<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.710> those<00:00:31.920> dead<00:00:32.309> flower<00:00:32.700> heads<00:00:33.090> off

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
do you get those dead flower heads off

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.950 
do you get those dead flower heads off
as<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.710> new<00:00:34.890> flower<00:00:35.219> buds<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.969> following<00:00:36.540> up

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
as the new flower buds are following up

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650 
as the new flower buds are following up
it's<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.309> my<00:00:38.489> biggest<00:00:38.730> complaints<00:00:39.510> about

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it's one of my biggest complaints about

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.260 
it's one of my biggest complaints about
the<00:00:40.020> plant<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> designer<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the plant and as a designer it's one of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.350 
the plant and as a designer it's one of
the<00:00:42.360> reasons<00:00:42.750> i<00:00:42.930> stopped<00:00:43.290> using<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.920> plant

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
the reasons i stopped using this plant

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
the reasons i stopped using this plant
pretty<00:00:45.360> much<00:00:45.660> because<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.219> lot<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
pretty much because it's a lot of

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.590 
pretty much because it's a lot of
maintenance<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:49.100> for<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> show<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
maintenance for for the show but if you

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.750 
maintenance for for the show but if you
like<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.079> plant<00:00:52.469> let<00:00:53.039> me<00:00:53.190> show<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.489> how<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
like this plant let me show you how to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.810 
like this plant let me show you how to
take<00:00:54.090> care<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.489> basically<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.789> have

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
to be willing to give up some of the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.369 
to be willing to give up some of the
buds<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.820> look<00:01:00.030> closely<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.170> can

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
buds if you look closely here you can

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.070 
buds if you look closely here you can
see<00:01:01.620> some<00:01:01.920> fresh<00:01:02.670> flowering<00:01:03.300> heads<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.930> are

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
see some fresh flowering heads that are

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.590 
see some fresh flowering heads that are
starting<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.589> come<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.939> while<00:01:05.939> all<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.420> these

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
starting to come out while all of these

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.030 
starting to come out while all of these
dead<00:01:06.960> flower<00:01:07.290> heads<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.040> there<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:10.040> you've

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
dead flower heads are on there so you've

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.830 
dead flower heads are on there so you've
just<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.760> willing<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.210> give<00:01:12.420> some<00:01:12.689> of

those up knowing that once you've

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.130 
those up knowing that once you've
cleaned<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> plant<00:01:15.180> up<00:01:15.450> you'll<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:15.840> one

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
cleaned the plant up you'll get one

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.560 
cleaned the plant up you'll get one
large<00:01:16.350> flush<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.100> blooms<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:18.390> will

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
large flush of blooms that will

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.999 
large flush of blooms that will
typically<00:01:18.990> follow<00:01:19.409> your<00:01:19.740> dead<00:01:19.979> heading<00:01:20.540> so

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
typically follow your dead heading so

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.620 
typically follow your dead heading so
i'm<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.299> hand

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
i'm going to do this one with hand

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.770 
i'm going to do this one with hand
pruning<00:01:25.170> shears<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.210> really<00:01:27.210> I've<00:01:27.390> got<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
pruning shears and really I've got a I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.050 
pruning shears and really I've got a I
also<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> make<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.130> plant<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.759> little

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
also want to make the plant a little

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.719 
also want to make the plant a little
denser<00:01:30.600> than<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:31.520> it's<00:01:32.520> got

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
denser than it is right now it's got

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.380 
denser than it is right now it's got
some<00:01:33.030> gaps<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.250> when<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.280> clean<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.090> up

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
some gaps in it and when we clean it up

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.499 
some gaps in it and when we clean it up
pretty<00:01:36.720> good<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.079> shear<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.950> bit<00:01:38.509> you'll

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
pretty good and shear it a bit you'll

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.260 
pretty good and shear it a bit you'll
get<00:01:39.869> better<00:01:40.140> infill<00:01:40.920> typically<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.970> where<00:01:42.119> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
get better infill typically to where you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.380 
get better infill typically to where you
have<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.509> more<00:01:42.899> fuller<00:01:44.450> looking<00:01:45.450> plant<00:01:45.810> so

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
have a more fuller looking plant so

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.020 
have a more fuller looking plant so
initially<00:01:48.390> I'm<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
initially I'm just going to go in and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.910 
initially I'm just going to go in and
take<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.090> big<00:01:51.509> pieces<00:01:52.049> off<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.770> going

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
take the big pieces off that are going

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.069 
take the big pieces off that are going
to<00:01:52.979> give<00:01:53.189> me<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.579> form<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:54.390> after<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
to give me the form that I'm after and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.490 
to give me the form that I'm after and
once<00:01:55.979> I've<00:01:56.219> established<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:57.149> form<00:01:57.659> then

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
once I've established that form then

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.670 
once I've established that form then
I'll<00:01:58.649> go<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.490> any<00:02:00.240> dead<00:02:00.840> flower<00:02:01.259> heads

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
I'll go in and any dead flower heads

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.889 
I'll go in and any dead flower heads
that<00:02:02.040> are<00:02:02.189> below<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.820> surface<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.540> where<00:02:03.780> I've

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
that are below the surface of where I've

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.709 
that are below the surface of where I've
cut<00:02:04.229> off<00:02:04.439> I'll<00:02:05.070> go<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:05.820> individually

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
cut off I'll go in there individually

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.529 
cut off I'll go in there individually
and<00:02:06.960> start<00:02:07.829> cherry<00:02:08.580> picking<00:02:09.060> those<00:02:09.209> out<00:02:09.509> of
