00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.600
 Yes i am weak today 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:13.050
 Today and last time, set up headphones 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:19.020
 It is an animation about the setting of the headphones to Presse 4 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:20.440
 Last time I put out the video, it was Presse 4 After all I can not hear the foot 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.190
 Configuration 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.710
 Say whether the PlayStation 4 Dette you doing any feeling 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.470
 Mail 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.370
 Huh 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.760
 It's not a large amount but a bit messy 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.440
 You too 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:41.640
 I'm thinking about reviewing the settings a bit yesterday 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.750
 I'd been doing a variety launched a ghost 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.970
 I really can not help with the settings on the headphone side 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.329
 so 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.200
 What if in 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.440
 I feel like I'm playing this game 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.250
 I know something not in surround 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 I feel like I'm looking at it for a while 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.300
 The salon did not become this setting 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.300
 here 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.640
 Sound and screen from this this is an audio output setting 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:19.580
 This is 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:22.450
 If it is in the state of pure state initial setting and linear pcm is said to be checked 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.040
 I think, but with this 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.140
 Light terminal 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.140
 To an optical digital output 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.700
 If you are using headphones 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.890
 So people who are Maybe headphone amplifier 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.300
 But 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.909
 Maybe Hey guys something and has become not hear a little from there to the Playstation 4 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.149
 I think 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:52.140
 That person has a bit stream here 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:56.409
 Brackets $ b linear pcm overthrow maybe Please change to this 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.920
 I think that sounds will come out at Stero 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.920
 About 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.600
 what 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.740
 Surround headphones 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.580
 People who use virtual surround or real surround headphones 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.290
 To say 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.800
 I think that the amplifier Gatsui together when you bought a Well arguably headphone 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.040
 The 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:21.250
 To 5.1 channel 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.840
 The amplifier that distributes or converts the sound 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.470
 Oh dear 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.680
 It should be about 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:33.370
 Some people say and to the amplifier connects the play station in the digital cable of light 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:39.280
 Maybe I'd think most 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:45.129
 The man bit stream brackets Dolby or instead of here linear pcm 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.760
 Bracket dts This is supported by the headphone amplifier used 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.950
 Teru person 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.110
 My own Dolby 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.040
 It corresponds to dolby digital, and headphones by changing this to dollar 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.099
 From 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:03.180
 I wonder if it is 5.1 channel in chanpo surround 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:07.260
 Ghost maybe it will be out vomiting in it 5.1 channel alloy channel 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.120
 If you choose this linear pcm, you will probably become a terrorist 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.360
 Well, what would it be? There was no such thing as an amp 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.250
 Huh 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.010
 Same as listening to regular music 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.340
 Headphone earphone 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.200
 Or if you're listening on a TV speaker 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.410
 What 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.770
 Basically linear pcm 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.110
 so 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.260
 5.1 Channel Association 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.040
 Surround speaker sound system 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:40.519
 Surround headphones or mud b or dts 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.519
 Change to the bitstream and by doing this 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.370
 For now 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.940
 When you launch the game 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.840
 In surround 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:58.010
 Markhor of Duty ghost something is supposed to become sound in surround comes out 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.940
 It's just like doing this so you can almost hear your feet with the original settings 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:06.930
 Become 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:08.600
 I think that the sound will come out in the same way as the preste muscle, so from here 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.600
 For example it just a little bit 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.600
 Well Made up you are using a real surround headphones 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.570
 The person who has adjustment function in what headphones itself 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.109
 What 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:28.420
 Sound adjustment after doing this 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:30.630
 Please and I think that this in the perfect way, was introduced during this period 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:35.180
 My triton pro 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.889
 Settings to the almost unchanged 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.430
 Only a little volume of the center speaker 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:47.499
 Hey Hey was dropped a yourself 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:50.620
 I felt that the gunshot was kind of annoying with press for 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:54.069
 I lowered the center and lowered the rear a little 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.759
 Use at max until the rear now Rutte but I think this is such a story 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:58.880
 I lowered the rear a bit so maybe 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.300
 Ghost of Preste 4 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:08.129
 I think is perfect 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.129
 Today the video, please That's it also thank the next time Bye Bye
