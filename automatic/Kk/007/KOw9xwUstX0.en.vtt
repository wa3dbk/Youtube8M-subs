probably and again 13 years ago is a

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.730 
probably and again 13 years ago is a
long<00:00:18.480> time<00:00:18.869> if<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:20.130> had<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:24.260> think<00:00:25.260> back<00:00:25.500> that

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
long time if I had to think back that

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.480 
long time if I had to think back that
far<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.430> would<00:00:27.060> say<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.900> first<00:00:28.529> time<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.340> was

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
far I would say the first time it was

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.999 
far I would say the first time it was
probably<00:00:30.179> brought<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.109> my<00:00:31.230> attention<00:00:31.260> was

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
probably brought to my attention was

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.600 
probably brought to my attention was
probably<00:00:32.489> by<00:00:32.820> page<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:34.950> probably

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
probably by page and it was probably

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.420 
probably by page and it was probably
page<00:00:36.120> telling<00:00:36.690> me<00:00:36.870> David<00:00:37.770> or<00:00:37.890> cat<00:00:38.100> loves<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430

type of thing and I mean that was really

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.130 
type of thing and I mean that was really
kind<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.350> long<00:00:46.800> before<00:00:47.750> anything<00:00:48.750> took<00:00:48.960> place

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
kind of long before anything took place

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.670 
kind of long before anything took place
but<00:00:49.710> he<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.700> probably<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:52.050> first<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.440> to
