your<00:03:12.790> special<00:03:13.120> grenades<00:03:13.390> which<00:03:13.570> is<00:03:13.720> this

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
your special grenades which is this

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.990 
your special grenades which is this

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
takes up the special green spot if you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.880 
takes up the special green spot if you
hold<00:03:16.270> down<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.660> left<00:03:16.690> bumper<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.590> kind<00:03:17.860> of

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
hold down the left bumper it kind of

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.320 
hold down the left bumper it kind of
pulsates<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.519> little<00:03:18.700> bit<00:03:18.790> now<00:03:18.940> I'm<00:03:19.120> yet<00:03:19.300> to

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
pulsates a little bit now I'm yet to

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.759 
pulsates a little bit now I'm yet to
determine<00:03:19.750> whether<00:03:20.230> or<00:03:20.320> not<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.739> actually

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
determine whether or not it actually

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.800 
determine whether or not it actually
makes<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.400> Tom<00:03:21.700> Hawk<00:03:21.880> stronger<00:03:22.360> or<00:03:22.480> whether<00:03:22.690> or

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
makes a Tom Hawk stronger or whether or

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.290 
makes a Tom Hawk stronger or whether or
not<00:03:22.900> goes<00:03:23.110> faster<00:03:23.530> what<00:03:23.800> exactly<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.340> does<00:03:24.550> but

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
not goes faster what exactly it does but

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.509 
not goes faster what exactly it does but
you<00:03:25.570> can<00:03:25.720> see<00:03:25.959> it's<00:03:26.290> still<00:03:26.830> pretty<00:03:27.040> powerful

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
you can see it's still pretty powerful

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.670 
you can see it's still pretty powerful
you<00:03:27.820> just<00:03:28.030> throw<00:03:28.480> in<00:03:28.570> passes<00:03:28.989> amies<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.470> takes

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
you just throw in passes amies it takes

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.740 
you just throw in passes amies it takes
them<00:03:29.860> out<00:03:30.010> now<00:03:30.370> mind<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.209> we<00:03:31.360> all<00:03:31.450> have<00:03:31.540> mints
