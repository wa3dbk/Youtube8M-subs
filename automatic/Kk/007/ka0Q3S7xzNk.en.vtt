00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.689
 what's the fun it's better this young 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.689
 girl is today we find ourselves 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.060
 for a new video tutorial this time 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.500
 this will be all the more so not a 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.900
 video at all because I had to 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.370
 delete the previous ones for 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.369
 reasons that you know if you are 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.810
 subscriber to my channel short we came in 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.589
 does so to put viewfinder again 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.710
 on world of tanks 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:25.890
 so you have this site here I would put 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.109
 well in the description of me from the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.779
 video you click it land it 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.369
 on this site and you exceptional the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.410
 viewfinder that you want then be you 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.810
 take this one not just those that 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.410
 I took that is the most used either 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.730
 this one in all cases in all 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.040
 case you click on the image you 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.670
 so here you have some 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.930
 images what does it look like and enters by 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.230
 a little parenthesis for those who 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.480
 weave the artillery you have time 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.610
 in seconds to remove it with its 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.690
 target 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.250
 I was explained then I do not have 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.350
 still used artillery brief you 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.050
 considering that we are currently the eu points if 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.870
 you take see points 4 the weight 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.390
 5.4 all points three points 2 you 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.780
 games made in gold stock united faudel 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.550
 his record for me so I 'll be worth 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.880
 so here you go download the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.770
 voiceover folder djemila so you 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.829
 open the folder 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.299
 then what you do is that 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.969
 you will extract your file 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.890
 on your desk 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.909
 so the bio here is here you ok for 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.729
 I do not do it because it's already 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.850
 there so then once you have it 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.250
 extracted at the office he will end up here 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.140
 both targets it's not necessary 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.920
 opened its voice you have on 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.130
 computer the golf at these voices where the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.899
 star makes world of tanks game world of 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.720
 tanks 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.310
 then I take them out rays fight mode 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.780
 pessac 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.939
 and there usually there will not that 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.829
 precisely there you make you done 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.750
 copy by you click copy a 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.530
 shortly after you knew how to pick up I 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.950
 do not do it because I'm going to do 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.450
 take off the thing otherwise and that's it if you 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.630
 have already launched or adopting as 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.599
 as I have it if you mr yourself 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.620
 restart your tank and we end up 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.959
 right now 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.019
 finally we find ourselves right away to 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.349
 show you the results at any return 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.970
 the world 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.040
 so here it is to see 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.959
 directly their results from your 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.819
 installation 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.040
 you are going in ridiculous and here you are 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.840
 will see that good bah I selected 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.130
 otherwise all the viewers will be 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.030
 changed the la 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.030
 sakho difference already between 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.480
 no big difference talked about 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.800
 yeah finally I confess after you 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.300
 you put what you want you 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.810
 discover what there is a lot of stuff 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.830
 different 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.990
 the same for the sniper elsewhere 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.630
 that's a little bit because I'm in 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.670
 doing any object 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.010
 to record the fight to show you 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.930
 so normally it will finally grow 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.890
 of cause and put you to the first 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.380
 no one first time you go 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.440
 see this framework that is going to grow 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.160
 and so to explain very briefly 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.200
 in fact what it gives that is the case 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.850
 you 're connected to part then the 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.170
 charging time c30 seconds but 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.540
 some cases part starts you have the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.030
 exact time 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.830
 q but your dear to reload this is 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.180
 the time left to stretch the time 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.220
 who passes and other tanks to reload 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.680
 your point of view so super useful or 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.160
 to finally look at the layer 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.800
 scared low is the same 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.040
 just take into account that 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.630
 did this thing there she handed 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.650
 entirely here it's not actually here 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.330
 it's not two different players 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.400
 it's one and the same day change 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.500
 start like this and then until 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.650
 it's green and then enough life 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.000
 when george entire family bongo 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.070
 had separated but hey it's the same 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.560
 gauge compared to before a super thing 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.030
 nice for those who do not 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.650
 would not want to see this gauge there 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.020
 you know the the harker in verve well 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.870
 heard we can for him so much 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.000
 remove the green fund but I mean 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.360
 everything will be opened in the red circle 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.560
 done and the other little advantage of that 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.600
 on the stage at least at least 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.480
 impression but good even if it's a 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.680
 little bit like your wife having fun 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.170
 a little better a little bit more 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.970
 reduced the basic reticle reticle I 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.550
 think not true false here I hope 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.260
 have you been on this tutorial and then 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.460
 do not hesitate to really like it 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.200
 been the bridegroom players me I tell you 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.200
 more - approached video ciao people
