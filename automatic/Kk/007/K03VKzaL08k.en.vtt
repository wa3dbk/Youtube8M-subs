because of they cruise this shore they

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.670 
because of they cruise this shore they
come<00:00:39.220> to<00:00:39.370> an<00:00:39.460> end<00:00:39.640> they<00:00:39.790> keep<00:00:40.000> on<00:00:40.330> cruising<00:00:40.840> so

it's a challenge those fish are there

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.730 
it's a challenge those fish are there
somewhere<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.210> know<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.840> sometimes<00:03:29.050> I<00:03:29.410> can<00:03:29.590> feel

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
somewhere I know it sometimes I can feel

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.320
