00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
I use my fingers to part out rows of

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.830 
I use my fingers to part out rows of
hair<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.790> because<00:02:14.790> I'm<00:02:14.940> at<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.090> front<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.630> try

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
hair and because I'm at the front I try

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.570 
hair and because I'm at the front I try
to<00:02:15.900> make<00:02:16.170> sure<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.380> it's<00:02:16.710> kind<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.040> even<00:02:17.250> with

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
to make sure that it's kind of even with

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.400 
to make sure that it's kind of even with
the<00:02:17.730> other<00:02:17.910> side<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.630> I'm<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.930> looking<00:02:19.170> at

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
the other side so I'm just looking at

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.490 
the other side so I'm just looking at
the<00:02:19.500> other<00:02:19.650> side<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.250> see<00:02:20.640> if<00:02:20.760> it's<00:02:20.910> even<00:02:21.300> in

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
the other side to see if it's even in

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.810 
the other side to see if it's even in
this<00:02:22.500> does<00:02:22.740> not<00:02:22.920> have<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.190> be<00:02:23.280> perfect<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:23.760> I

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
this does not have to be perfect but I

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.780 
this does not have to be perfect but I
do<00:02:23.910> like<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.300> little<00:02:24.870> bit<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.490> symmetry<00:02:26.490> at<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
do like a little bit of symmetry at the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.960 
do like a little bit of symmetry at the
front<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.240> my<00:02:27.270> hair<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:28.220> do<00:02:29.220> tangle<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.760> roll<00:02:29.940> a

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
front of my hair I do tangle that roll a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.270 
front of my hair I do tangle that roll a
little<00:02:30.240> bit<00:02:30.420> more<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:31.140> my<00:02:31.350> small<00:02:31.770> tooth<00:02:31.980> comb

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
little bit more with my small tooth comb

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.370 
little bit more with my small tooth comb
and<00:02:32.580> then<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:32.880> add<00:02:33.090> my<00:02:33.300> eco<00:02:33.480> styler<00:02:33.840> gel<00:02:33.930> with

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
and then I add my eco styler gel with

00:02:34.380 --> 00:03:23.490 
and then I add my eco styler gel with
olive<00:02:34.740> oil<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.190> begin<00:02:35.580> twisting

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.530 

I've<00:03:24.460> twisted<00:03:24.730> all<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.150> hair<00:03:25.330> in<00:03:25.420> that

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
I've twisted all the hair in that

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.360 
I've twisted all the hair in that
section<00:03:26.080> so<00:03:26.320> now<00:03:26.350> I'm<00:03:26.650> just<00:03:26.770> going<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.070> grab<00:03:27.340> it

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
section so now I'm just going to grab it

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.340 
section so now I'm just going to grab it
and<00:03:27.580> I'm<00:03:27.850> showing<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.210> how<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.480> do<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.900> African

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
and I'm showing you how I do the African

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.220 
and I'm showing you how I do the African
30<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:29.860> take<00:03:30.760> about<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.240> much<00:03:31.480> thread<00:03:31.870> and

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
30 I take about this much thread and

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.440 
30 I take about this much thread and
this<00:03:32.380> is<00:03:32.560> just<00:03:32.830> regular<00:03:33.250> weaving<00:03:34.000> thread<00:03:34.270> that

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
this is just regular weaving thread that

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.720 
this is just regular weaving thread that
you<00:03:34.600> would<00:03:34.750> used<00:03:34.990> for<00:03:35.230> sewing<00:03:35.530> if<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.490> length

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
you would used for sewing if that length

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.030 
you would used for sewing if that length
is<00:03:36.880> too<00:03:37.120> short<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:38.020> just<00:03:38.440> continue

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
is too short you can just continue

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.710 
is too short you can just continue
threading<00:03:39.460> with<00:03:39.550> another<00:03:39.880> piece<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.120> thread

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
threading with another piece of thread

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.470 
threading with another piece of thread
I'm<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.500> added<00:03:41.770> on<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.190> or<00:03:42.550> if<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.150> too

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
I'm just added on to it or if it's too

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.320 
I'm just added on to it or if it's too
long<00:03:43.660> you<00:03:43.930> can<00:03:44.140> cut<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:44.800> at<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:44.950> end<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:46.060> create

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
long you can cut it at the end to create

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.000 
long you can cut it at the end to create
a<00:03:46.360> tension<00:03:46.690> spot<00:03:47.140> while<00:03:47.380> I'm<00:03:47.590> wrapping<00:03:47.980> the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
a tension spot while I'm wrapping the

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.510 
a tension spot while I'm wrapping the
thread<00:03:48.400> around<00:03:48.550> my<00:03:48.850> hair<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.410> tie<00:03:50.410> one<00:03:50.890> end<00:03:51.100> of

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
thread around my hair I tie one end of

00:03:51.520 --> 00:04:11.210 
thread around my hair I tie one end of
the<00:03:51.700> thread<00:03:51.940> into<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.300> knot

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.820 

I<00:04:11.600> wrap<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.630> thread<00:04:13.020> around<00:04:13.050> that<00:04:13.440> tension

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
I wrap the thread around that tension

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.680 
I wrap the thread around that tension
spot<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.070> few<00:04:14.340> times<00:04:14.580> so<00:04:14.760> it's<00:04:14.970> secure<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.600> then

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
spot a few times so it's secure and then

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:46.330 
spot a few times so it's secure and then
I<00:04:15.990> start<00:04:16.440> moving<00:04:16.709> my<00:04:16.980> hand<00:04:17.280> downward

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.129 

once<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:47.490> get<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.819> the<00:04:47.909> end<00:04:48.060> of<00:04:48.150> my<00:04:48.270> hair<00:04:48.509> I<00:04:48.719> tie<00:04:49.110> a

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
once I get to the end of my hair I tie a

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.619 
once I get to the end of my hair I tie a
knot<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:50.460> it's<00:04:50.610> probably<00:04:50.939> better<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.240> go<00:04:51.479> a

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
knot and it's probably better to go a

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.670 
knot and it's probably better to go a
little<00:04:51.960> bit<00:04:52.199> past<00:04:52.229> your<00:04:52.710> hair<00:04:53.039> but<00:04:54.000> I<00:04:54.379> did<00:04:55.379> it<00:04:55.530> I

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
little bit past your hair but I did it I

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.219 
little bit past your hair but I did it I
finished<00:04:56.219> the<00:04:56.310> last<00:04:56.490> section<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.270> twist<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.110> I

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
finished the last section of twist and I

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.869 
finished the last section of twist and I
didn't<00:04:58.560> even<00:04:58.680> bother<00:04:58.919> threading<00:04:59.490> that<00:04:59.610> hair<00:04:59.849> I

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
didn't even bother threading that hair I

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.540 
didn't even bother threading that hair I
just<00:04:59.939> started<00:05:00.479> removing<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:01.139> thread<00:05:01.439> so<00:05:01.889> are

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
just started removing the thread so are

just started removing the thread so are
you<00:05:02.699> going<00:05:02.819> to<00:05:02.879> do<00:05:03.030> is<00:05:03.240> find<00:05:03.719> the<00:05:04.199> knot<00:05:04.409> that

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
you going to do is find the knot that

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.980 
you going to do is find the knot that
you<00:05:04.710> created<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:05.639> you<00:05:06.240> just<00:05:06.419> have<00:05:06.599> to<00:05:06.629> move

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
you created and you just have to move

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.330 
you created and you just have to move
the<00:05:07.229> hair<00:05:07.439> from<00:05:07.680> around<00:05:07.889> it<00:05:08.099> you<00:05:08.159> don't<00:05:08.280> even

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
the hair from around it you don't even

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.339 
the hair from around it you don't even
have<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.729> untie<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.180> knot<00:05:09.330> just<00:05:10.139> start

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
have to untie the knot just start

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:11.929 
have to untie the knot just start
pulling<00:05:10.650> your<00:05:10.800> hair<00:05:10.979> from<00:05:11.129> out<00:05:11.400> of<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.639> thread

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:11.939 
pulling your hair from out of the thread

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.179 
pulling your hair from out of the thread
and<00:05:11.969> it<00:05:12.240> comes<00:05:12.479> out<00:05:12.629> so<00:05:12.870> easily<00:05:13.139> then<00:05:13.979> you<00:05:14.069> can

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:14.189 
and it comes out so easily then you can

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:15.740 
and it comes out so easily then you can
just<00:05:14.340> find<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.639> thread<00:05:14.849> and<00:05:15.000> pull<00:05:15.210> it<00:05:15.360> and

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
just find the thread and pull it and

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:26.200 
just find the thread and pull it and
it's<00:05:15.900> out

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.700 

my<00:05:27.210> hair<00:05:27.390> was<00:05:27.540> not<00:05:27.750> laying<00:05:28.020> down<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.440> way<00:05:28.530> that

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
my hair was not laying down the way that

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.040 
my hair was not laying down the way that
I<00:05:28.800> wanted<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.430> so<00:05:29.820> I<00:05:29.970> just<00:05:30.240> added<00:05:30.450> my<00:05:30.690> satin
