 in no specific order is to say the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.030
 number one is not that it's the one that 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.909
 like but simply the furniture 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.979
 giving as output 5 the grill of the king 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.869
 eagle is one of my favorite de facto 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.000
 you can probably see it 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.070
 they have already heard me say it before they are 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.140
 the favorite grills as I already finished it 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.090
 to say 10 seconds ago your design is 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.860
 quite interesting I really like how 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.810
 it looks blank however in black 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.940
 I also know how you like more 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.799
 in white or in black number 4 the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.600
 grill flash this grill from the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.119
 accordions of innova pretty as can 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.799
 see it looks like flash looks like lightning 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.149
 I've also said it before I like it 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.440
 very much and is one of my favorites 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.990
 number 3 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.970
 the new grills of the black hawk and 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.220
 the white sox or the white hawks and 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.770
 blacks I really like this design because 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.380
 it's similar to the king to look a little 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.960
 but they are so beautiful and interesting 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.850
 something something different than what we were 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.039
 accustomed so that's why that's a 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.590
 from my favorite number 2 the grill of 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.659
 bond production I do not know really not 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.310
 I remember how is the exact name I think 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.380
 that is the grill evo this is also 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.120
 of the brand of innova pretty and I like 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.580
 very much how it looks very 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.290
 very different is really very 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.360
 innovative this design so I'm 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.310
 also like a lot and finally a 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.390
 grill that can not miss the grill 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.010
 more classic is very very characteristic 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.230
 commemorative I do not know what the word is 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.210

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.680
