harboring concerns about you know where
the<00:03:50.669> Chelsea<00:03:51.090> would<00:03:51.209> go<00:03:51.329> on<00:03:51.450> forever<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:51.930> ever

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
the Chelsea would go on forever and ever

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.349 
the Chelsea would go on forever and ever
and<00:03:52.530> with<00:03:52.680> all<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.950> money<00:03:53.099> they<00:03:53.340> had<00:03:53.519> was<00:03:53.760> just

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
and with all the money they had was just

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.390 
and with all the money they had was just
phenomenal<00:03:54.540> really<00:03:55.169> could<00:03:55.319> buy<00:03:55.530> off<00:03:55.560> all<00:03:56.130> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
phenomenal really could buy off all the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.150 
phenomenal really could buy off all the
players<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.930> last<00:03:58.230> four<00:03:58.500> seasons<00:03:58.680> almost

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
players so the last four seasons almost

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.580 
players so the last four seasons almost
seemed<00:03:59.489> like<00:03:59.720> 26<00:04:00.720> years<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:01.109> a<00:04:01.139> lot<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.349> funds

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
seemed like 26 years for a lot of funds

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.330 
seemed like 26 years for a lot of funds
and<00:04:02.329> yeah<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:03.389> think<00:04:03.690> it's<00:04:04.590> certainly<00:04:04.859> on<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> par

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
and yeah I think it's certainly on a par

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.080 
and yeah I think it's certainly on a par
with<00:04:05.370> what<00:04:06.299> what's<00:04:06.660> been<00:04:07.139> achieved<00:04:07.310> 293<00:04:08.310> maybe

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
with what what's been achieved 293 maybe

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.509 
with what what's been achieved 293 maybe
even<00:04:09.329> engine<00:04:09.599> edging<00:04:10.169> it<00:04:10.290> as<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.590> best<00:04:10.769> title

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519
