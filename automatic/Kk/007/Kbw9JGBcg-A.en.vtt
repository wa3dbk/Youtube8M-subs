the chick taken as a man and wolf fall
and<00:04:07.890> then<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:08.250> guess<00:04:08.430> take<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.790> on<00:04:08.910> what<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.600> think

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
and then I guess take it on what I think

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.240 
and then I guess take it on what I think
is<00:04:09.930> going<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.170> be<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.290> tougher<00:04:10.680> challenge<00:04:10.709> in
