think<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.119> number<00:01:54.330> three<00:01:54.540> formation<00:01:55.020> this

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
think the number three formation this

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.230 
think the number three formation this
season<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> 44<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.700> main<00:01:56.909> reason<00:01:57.060> that

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
season is the 44 the main reason that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.700 
season is the 44 the main reason that
the<00:01:57.390> four-four<00:01:57.780> defense<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.470> in<00:01:58.680> my

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
the four-four defense is not in my

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.410 
the four-four defense is not in my
opinion<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.220> number<00:01:59.610> one<00:01:59.790> formation<00:02:00.330> in

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
opinion the number one formation in

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.450 
opinion the number one formation in
madden<00:02:00.630> 25<00:02:00.900> is<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> personnel

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
madden 25 is because of the personnel

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.090 
madden 25 is because of the personnel
that<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.030> use<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.110> 44<00:02:04.500> last<00:02:04.799> year

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
that you have to use in a 44 last year

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.890 
that you have to use in a 44 last year
we<00:02:05.189> were<00:02:05.280> able<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.549> audible<00:02:06.060> down<00:02:06.210> into<00:02:06.479> 44

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
we were able to audible down into 44

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.440 
we were able to audible down into 44
from<00:02:07.110> 43<00:02:07.590> stack<00:02:07.860> or<00:02:08.399> from<00:02:08.670> dime<00:02:08.909> or<00:02:09.239> from<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
from 43 stack or from dime or from a

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.999 
from 43 stack or from dime or from a
court<00:02:09.750> or<00:02:09.929> anything<00:02:10.379> we<00:02:10.500> wanted<00:02:10.769> to<00:02:10.829> get

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
court or anything we wanted to get

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.740 
court or anything we wanted to get
whatever<00:02:11.610> personnel<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.269> wanted<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.659> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
whatever personnel we wanted on the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.619 
whatever personnel we wanted on the
field<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.739> year<00:02:13.819> you<00:02:14.819> cannot<00:02:15.150> do<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.569> I

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
field this year you cannot do that I

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.860 
field this year you cannot do that I
think<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.019> limits<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.340> options<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.450> 44

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
think that limits the options of the 44

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.050 
think that limits the options of the 44
playbook<00:02:19.290> or<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.800> 44<00:02:20.160> formation<00:02:20.760> which<00:02:20.910> can

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
playbook or the 44 formation which can

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.750 
playbook or the 44 formation which can
be<00:02:21.150> found<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.480> 43<00:02:21.989> playbook<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.640> but<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
be found in the 43 playbook and but you

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.230 
be found in the 43 playbook and but you
see<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.209> very<00:02:24.510> effective<00:02:24.630> for<00:02:24.930> me

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
see this is a very effective for me

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.690 
see this is a very effective for me
and<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.380> easily<00:02:26.770> set<00:02:26.950> up<00:02:26.980> pressure<00:02:27.340> left

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
and you can easily set up pressure left

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.010 
and you can easily set up pressure left
and<00:02:27.850> right<00:02:28.000> actually<00:02:28.450> did<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.570> blitz<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
and right actually did a blitz of the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.110 
and right actually did a blitz of the
day<00:02:29.200> on<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.440> 44<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.130> if<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.760> guys<00:02:30.850> want<00:02:31.060> to

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
day on the 44 and if you guys want to

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.490 
day on the 44 and if you guys want to
check<00:02:31.150> out<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:31.570> blitz<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.930> day<00:02:32.080> I'll<00:02:32.260> try

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
check out that blitz of the day I'll try

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.020 
check out that blitz of the day I'll try
to<00:02:32.560> leave<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.770> link<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.250> annotation<00:02:33.850> for

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
to leave a link in the annotation for

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.640 
to leave a link in the annotation for
you<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.780> guys<00:02:34.900> could<00:02:35.050> check<00:02:35.290> out<00:02:35.410> that

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
you so you guys could check out that

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.920 
you so you guys could check out that
check<00:02:36.340> out<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.610> video<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:37.120> my<00:02:37.510> opinion<00:02:37.780> the

check out that video in my opinion the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.480 
check out that video in my opinion the
two-deep<00:02:38.350> it's<00:02:38.590> probably<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.920> best<00:02:39.190> play<00:02:39.400> out

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
two-deep it's probably the best play out

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.940 
two-deep it's probably the best play out
of<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.640> 44<00:02:40.230> arguably<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.350> best<00:02:41.470> play<00:02:41.740> in

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
of the 44 arguably the best play in

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.520 
of the 44 arguably the best play in
Madden<00:02:42.220> these<00:02:43.150> yellow<00:02:43.510> zones<00:02:43.780> they<00:02:44.260> play

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
Madden these yellow zones they play

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.070 
Madden these yellow zones they play
phenomenal<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.580> I'm<00:02:45.910> just<00:02:46.270> always<00:02:46.570> always

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
phenomenal and I I'm just always always

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.410 
phenomenal and I I'm just always always
loving<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.710> this<00:02:48.100> formation<00:02:48.340> all<00:02:49.120> right<00:02:49.240> so

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
loving this this formation all right so

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.590 
loving this this formation all right so
here<00:02:49.570> we<00:02:49.660> are<00:02:49.750> number<00:02:49.960> two<00:02:51.450> formation<00:02:52.450> in

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
here we are number two formation in

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.410 
here we are number two formation in
madden<00:02:53.290> NFL<00:02:53.560> 25<00:02:53.710> is<00:02:54.400> going<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:54.970> be<00:02:55.090> from<00:02:55.300> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
madden NFL 25 is going to be from the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.920 
madden NFL 25 is going to be from the
nickel<00:02:56.010> strong<00:02:57.010> formation<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.510> reason<00:02:58.840> I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
nickel strong formation and the reason I

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.500 
nickel strong formation and the reason I
the<00:02:59.350> chem<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.770> comes<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.160> at<00:03:00.250> number<00:03:00.510> number

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
the chem this comes in at number number

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.390 
the chem this comes in at number number
two<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.020> not<00:03:02.110> number<00:03:02.410> one<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.770> because<00:03:03.100> it's<00:03:03.310> a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
two and not number one is because it's a

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.130 
two and not number one is because it's a
little<00:03:03.670> bit<00:03:03.820> limited<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.750> what<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:04.900> mean<00:03:05.080> by

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
little bit limited and what I mean by

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.260 
little bit limited and what I mean by
that<00:03:05.320> is<00:03:05.710> you<00:03:06.100> could<00:03:06.310> only<00:03:06.550> set<00:03:06.850> up<00:03:07.000> pressure

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
that is you could only set up pressure

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.630 
that is you could only set up pressure
out<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.630> sugar<00:03:07.930> DS<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:09.220> know<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.520> other

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
out of the sugar DS you know the other

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.460 
out of the sugar DS you know the other
plays<00:03:09.940> aren't<00:03:10.420> as<00:03:10.480> good<00:03:10.660> for<00:03:10.870> pressure<00:03:11.080> so<00:03:11.380> the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
plays aren't as good for pressure so the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.380 
plays aren't as good for pressure so the
sugar<00:03:11.650> these<00:03:11.890> are<00:03:12.070> but<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.790> nickel<00:03:13.120> strong

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
sugar these are but the nickel strong

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.730 
sugar these are but the nickel strong
what<00:03:13.570> it<00:03:13.660> brings<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.020> table<00:03:14.200> as<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.590> brings

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
what it brings to the table as it brings

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.940 
what it brings to the table as it brings
fast<00:03:15.130> setups<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:15.900> very<00:03:16.900> intense<00:03:17.530> pressure

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
fast setups and very intense pressure

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.280 
fast setups and very intense pressure
the<00:03:18.490> pressure<00:03:18.640> is<00:03:18.940> very<00:03:19.000> fast<00:03:19.480> literally<00:03:20.230> you

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
the pressure is very fast literally you

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.630 
the pressure is very fast literally you
have<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.530> make<00:03:20.680> two<00:03:20.920> adjustments<00:03:21.490> and<00:03:21.550> the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
have to make two adjustments and the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.400 
have to make two adjustments and the
pressure<00:03:21.820> comes<00:03:22.090> in<00:03:22.270> I<00:03:22.450> think<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:22.990> this<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.230> a

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
pressure comes in I think that this is a

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.350 
pressure comes in I think that this is a
better<00:03:23.740> overall<00:03:24.160> formation<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:24.940> beginners

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
better overall formation for beginners

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.120 
better overall formation for beginners
because<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:25.840> simplified<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.650> only<00:03:26.800> get<00:03:27.010> the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
because it's simplified you only get the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.370 
because it's simplified you only get the
call<00:03:27.280> for<00:03:27.580> plays<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.660> pressure<00:03:28.900> sets<00:03:29.230> up

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
call for plays and the pressure sets up

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.470 
call for plays and the pressure sets up
for<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.770> it's<00:03:30.250> set<00:03:30.430> up<00:03:30.460> for<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.360> guys

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
for you it's set up for you you guys

the blitz of the days and we'll be

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.280 
the blitz of the days and we'll be
talking<00:03:34.330> blitz<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.870> day<00:03:34.990> with<00:03:35.140> these

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
sugar knees pretty soon we'll break

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.760 
sugar knees pretty soon we'll break
these<00:03:37.270> down<00:03:37.330> for<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.840> coming<00:03:38.380> in<00:03:38.500> at<00:03:38.590> number

these down for you coming in at number

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.580 
these down for you coming in at number
two<00:03:39.100> though<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.670> nickel<00:03:40.030> strong<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.660> the

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
two though the nickel strong and the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.140 
two though the nickel strong and the
cool<00:03:41.770> part<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.040> though<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.550> is<00:03:42.730> really<00:03:43.120> a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
cool part is though it is really a

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.110 
cool part is though it is really a
balanced<00:03:43.870> personnel<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.580> actually<00:03:45.850> is<00:03:46.090> a

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
balanced personnel and it actually is a

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.940 
balanced personnel and it actually is a
really<00:03:46.390> good<00:03:46.630> defense<00:03:47.080> but<00:03:47.260> in<00:03:47.380> my<00:03:47.470> opinion<00:03:47.620> it

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
really good defense but in my opinion it

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.650 
really good defense but in my opinion it
limits<00:03:48.400> itself<00:03:48.700> because<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.090> can<00:03:49.210> only<00:03:49.240> call

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
limits itself because you can only call

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.440 
limits itself because you can only call
certain<00:03:50.080> plays<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.710> now<00:03:51.520> guys<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:52.060> number

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
certain plays and now guys the number

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.690 
certain plays and now guys the number
one<00:03:52.720> formation<00:03:53.080> in<00:03:53.500> my<00:03:53.650> opinion<00:03:53.980> for<00:03:54.280> men<00:03:54.460> NFL

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
one formation in my opinion for men NFL

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.470 
one formation in my opinion for men NFL
25<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:56.020> 46<00:03:56.440> bear<00:03:57.070> under<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.760> 46<00:03:58.180> banner

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
25 is the 46 bear under the 46 banner

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.910 
25 is the 46 bear under the 46 banner
was<00:03:58.600> probably<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.990> number<00:03:59.200> one<00:03:59.260> formation<00:03:59.800> in

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
was probably the number one formation in

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.250 
was probably the number one formation in
madden<00:04:00.190> 13<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:01.360> I<00:04:01.750> think<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.020> makes<00:04:02.140> a

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
madden 13 and I think it makes a

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.170 
madden 13 and I think it makes a
reappearance<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:03.040> men<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.190> fell<00:04:03.490> 25<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.120> the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
reappearance and men and fell 25 and the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.480 
reappearance and men and fell 25 and the
reason<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:04.870> because<00:04:04.930> when<00:04:05.920> you<00:04:06.040> know<00:04:06.250> how<00:04:06.430> to

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
reason is because when you know how to

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.980 
reason is because when you know how to
run<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:06.820> formation<00:04:07.120> if<00:04:07.390> you<00:04:07.480> lab<00:04:07.780> it

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
run this formation if you lab it

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.170 
run this formation if you lab it
properly<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.890> figure<00:04:09.220> out<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.520> the<00:04:09.790> way<00:04:09.940> that

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
properly you figure out the the way that

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.240 
properly you figure out the the way that
we<00:04:10.240> like<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.540> run<00:04:10.690> this<00:04:10.810> formation<00:04:11.250> this

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
we like to run this formation this

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.250 
we like to run this formation this
formation<00:04:12.580> has<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.240> limitless<00:04:13.870> amount<00:04:14.170> of

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
formation has a limitless amount of

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.530 
formation has a limitless amount of
potential<00:04:14.500> any<00:04:15.070> play<00:04:15.550> on<00:04:15.730> this<00:04:15.850> formation<00:04:16.210> you

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
potential any play on this formation you

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.930 
potential any play on this formation you
could<00:04:16.690> set<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:16.989> pressures<00:04:17.410> up<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:18.460> you<00:04:18.850> know

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
could set the pressures up and you know

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.880 
could set the pressures up and you know
we<00:04:19.030> worked<00:04:19.210> really<00:04:19.299> hard<00:04:19.480> in<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.840> e<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.290> in

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
we worked really hard in the e in the in

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.440 
we worked really hard in the e in the in
the<00:04:20.920> lab<00:04:21.130> over<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:21.790> last<00:04:21.940> couple<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.270> days

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
the lab over the last couple of days

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.860 
the lab over the last couple of days
really<00:04:22.720> working<00:04:23.230> on<00:04:23.320> this<00:04:23.410> formation<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.870> you

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
really working on this formation and you

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.510 
really working on this formation and you
know<00:04:25.960> we<00:04:26.110> knew<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:26.560> we<00:04:26.890> could<00:04:27.040> run<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.310> out<00:04:27.430> of

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
know we knew that we could run it out of

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.800 
know we knew that we could run it out of
the<00:04:27.580> cover<00:04:27.790> two<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.270> cover<00:04:28.480> two<00:04:28.660> men

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
the cover two and the cover two men

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.840 
the cover two and the cover two men
enter<00:04:29.050> but<00:04:29.230> now<00:04:29.710> we<00:04:29.770> have<00:04:29.980> expanded<00:04:30.550> our

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
enter but now we have expanded our

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.490 
enter but now we have expanded our
horizons<00:04:31.030> we<00:04:31.570> actually<00:04:31.810> got<00:04:31.930> in<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.080> fraction

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
horizons we actually got in the fraction

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.170 
horizons we actually got in the fraction
what<00:04:32.620> we<00:04:32.710> worked<00:04:32.890> on<00:04:33.010> it<00:04:33.100> really<00:04:33.250> hard<00:04:33.340> figured

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
what we worked on it really hard figured

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.330 
what we worked on it really hard figured
out<00:04:34.270> how<00:04:34.390> to<00:04:34.450> send<00:04:34.690> pressure<00:04:34.960> out<00:04:35.229> of<00:04:35.590> any<00:04:35.830> play

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
out how to send pressure out of any play

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.730 
out how to send pressure out of any play
in<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:37.060> 46<00:04:37.540> bear<00:04:37.780> under<00:04:38.020> formation<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.650> this

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
in the 46 bear under formation and this

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.940 
in the 46 bear under formation and this
is

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
is

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.770 
is
to<00:04:39.010> make<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.370> almost<00:04:39.790> unstoppable<00:04:40.120> defense

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
to make it a almost unstoppable defense

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.870 
to make it a almost unstoppable defense
again<00:04:41.170> this<00:04:41.350> season<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:42.160> pressure<00:04:42.430> comes<00:04:42.730> in

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
again this season the pressure comes in

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.060 
again this season the pressure comes in
so<00:04:43.060> fast<00:04:43.330> they're<00:04:43.930> easy<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.440> set<00:04:44.620> up<00:04:44.650> literally

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
so fast they're easy to set up literally

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.760 
so fast they're easy to set up literally
you<00:04:45.340> make<00:04:45.550> five<00:04:46.270> adjustments<00:04:47.080> but<00:04:47.410> you<00:04:47.590> don't

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
you make five adjustments but you don't

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.410 
you make five adjustments but you don't
have<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:47.950> manually<00:04:48.370> touch<00:04:48.670> anybody<00:04:49.180> you<00:04:49.270> don't

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
have to manually touch anybody you don't

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.150 
have to manually touch anybody you don't
have<00:04:49.510> to<00:04:49.600> reboot<00:04:50.050> anybody<00:04:50.470> or<00:04:50.860> anything<00:04:51.040> like

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
have to reboot anybody or anything like

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.010 
have to reboot anybody or anything like
that<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.670> you<00:04:52.150> can<00:04:52.330> get<00:04:52.450> double<00:04:52.870> side

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
that and you can get double side

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.260 
that and you can get double side
pressure<00:04:53.460> sending<00:04:54.460> six<00:04:54.760> guys<00:04:54.940> at<00:04:55.180> the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
pressure sending six guys at the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.760 
pressure sending six guys at the
quarterback<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:55.780> this<00:04:55.870> is<00:04:56.200> a<00:04:56.290> very<00:04:56.590> good

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
quarterback and this is a very good

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.160 
quarterback and this is a very good
formation<00:04:57.550> because<00:04:57.970> it's<00:04:58.300> very<00:04:58.510> easy<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:58.900> set

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
formation because it's very easy to set

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.740 
formation because it's very easy to set
up<00:04:59.200> and<00:04:59.440> the<00:05:00.010> zones<00:05:00.370> play<00:05:00.880> absolutely

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
up and the zones play absolutely

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.880 
up and the zones play absolutely
phenomenal<00:05:02.050> take<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.410> look<00:05:02.530> at<00:05:02.590> this<00:05:02.650> cover

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
phenomenal take a look at this cover

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.680 
phenomenal take a look at this cover
three<00:05:03.160> here<00:05:03.370> this<00:05:03.850> is<00:05:04.060> probably<00:05:04.300> one<00:05:04.540> of<00:05:04.570> the

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
three here this is probably one of the

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.090 
three here this is probably one of the
main<00:05:04.840> plays<00:05:05.170> out<00:05:05.380> of<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.500> bear<00:05:05.620> under<00:05:05.860> you<00:05:05.950> see

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
main plays out of the bear under you see

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.920 
main plays out of the bear under you see
these<00:05:06.220> yellow<00:05:06.580> zones<00:05:06.880> just<00:05:07.150> drop<00:05:07.510> into<00:05:07.780> a

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
these yellow zones just drop into a

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.290 
these yellow zones just drop into a
deeper<00:05:08.410> level<00:05:08.980> of<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.310> field<00:05:09.550> allows<00:05:09.970> us<00:05:10.180> to

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
deeper level of the field allows us to

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.240 
deeper level of the field allows us to
use<00:05:10.360> or<00:05:10.660> that<00:05:10.780> safety<00:05:11.320> in<00:05:11.470> the<00:05:11.890> middle<00:05:12.100> of<00:05:12.190> the

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
use or that safety in the middle of the

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.920 
use or that safety in the middle of the
field<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.670> be<00:05:13.120> confident<00:05:13.600> that<00:05:13.840> those

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
field and be confident that those

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.480 
field and be confident that those
yellows<00:05:14.290> are<00:05:14.350> going<00:05:14.500> to<00:05:14.560> play<00:05:14.740> properly<00:05:15.220> and

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
yellows are going to play properly and

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.310 
yellows are going to play properly and
with<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:16.240> pressure<00:05:16.510> that<00:05:16.630> we<00:05:16.810> can<00:05:16.930> send<00:05:17.200> from

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
with the pressure that we can send from

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.560 
with the pressure that we can send from
the<00:05:17.440> bounder<00:05:17.860> makes<00:05:18.160> us<00:05:18.370> defense<00:05:18.910> in<00:05:19.120> my

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
the bounder makes us defense in my

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.990 
the bounder makes us defense in my
opinion<00:05:19.930> number<00:05:20.380> one<00:05:20.620> in<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:20.980> game<00:05:21.340> because

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
opinion number one in the game because

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.580 
opinion number one in the game because
we<00:05:22.120> can<00:05:22.270> not<00:05:22.750> only<00:05:22.840> can<00:05:23.080> with<00:05:23.170> some<00:05:23.320> pressure

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
we can not only can with some pressure

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.350 
we can not only can with some pressure
but<00:05:24.130> we<00:05:24.220> have<00:05:24.340> good<00:05:24.520> run<00:05:24.790> defense<00:05:25.090> because

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
but we have good run defense because

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.930 
but we have good run defense because
we're<00:05:25.480> at<00:05:25.540> a<00:05:25.600> 46<00:05:26.170> formation<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:26.950> it's<00:05:27.730> just<00:05:27.850> a

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
we're at a 46 formation and it's just a

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.520 
we're at a 46 formation and it's just a
very<00:05:28.180> good<00:05:28.300> playbook<00:05:28.930> it's<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.140> very<00:05:29.350> good

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
very good playbook it's a very good

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.160 
very good playbook it's a very good
formation<00:05:29.920> to<00:05:30.190> use<00:05:30.520> and<00:05:30.790> in<00:05:31.480> my<00:05:31.630> opinion<00:05:31.780> there

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
formation to use and in my opinion there

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.930 
formation to use and in my opinion there
is<00:05:32.200> no<00:05:32.470> better<00:05:32.650> formation<00:05:33.190> in<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.430> game<00:05:33.700> at

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
is no better formation in the game at

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.510 
is no better formation in the game at
this<00:05:34.150> look<00:05:34.450> at<00:05:34.540> this<00:05:34.630> point<00:05:35.110> for<00:05:35.890> my<00:05:36.040> labbing

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
this look at this point for my labbing

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.970 
this look at this point for my labbing
time<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.570> all<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.840> time<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:38.050> put<00:05:38.320> in<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.590> think

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
time and all the time I put in I think

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.770 
time and all the time I put in I think
the<00:05:39.070> 46<00:05:39.490> barinder<00:05:39.850> it<00:05:39.970> takes<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.330> cake<00:05:40.480> once

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
the 46 barinder it takes the cake once

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.200 
the 46 barinder it takes the cake once
again<00:05:41.020> this<00:05:41.170> year<00:05:41.310> with<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.430> ease<00:05:42.760> that<00:05:43.030> it<00:05:43.120> is

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
again this year with the ease that it is

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.940 
again this year with the ease that it is
to<00:05:43.330> set<00:05:43.480> up<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.690> pressure<00:05:43.930> and<00:05:44.230> the<00:05:44.560> coverage

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
to set up the pressure and the coverage

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.530 
to set up the pressure and the coverage
out<00:05:45.130> of<00:05:45.220> it<00:05:45.310> it's<00:05:45.430> not<00:05:45.610> as<00:05:45.850> good<00:05:46.180> as<00:05:46.300> it<00:05:46.390> was

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
out of it it's not as good as it was

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.270 
out of it it's not as good as it was
last<00:05:46.690> year<00:05:46.900> you<00:05:47.530> do<00:05:47.650> have<00:05:47.740> to<00:05:47.860> make<00:05:47.890> some<00:05:48.160> more

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
last year you do have to make some more

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.520 
last year you do have to make some more
adjustments<00:05:48.400> but<00:05:49.030> again<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:49.990> comes<00:05:50.320> with

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
adjustments but again that comes with

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.040 
adjustments but again that comes with
the<00:05:50.620> territory<00:05:51.030> you<00:05:52.030> know<00:05:52.150> a<00:05:52.300> gap<00:05:52.690> is<00:05:52.870> no

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
the territory you know a gap is no

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.870 
the territory you know a gap is no
longer<00:05:53.320> in<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:53.800> bear<00:05:53.980> under<00:05:54.280> except<00:05:54.700> for<00:05:54.850> a

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
longer in the bear under except for a

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.670 
longer in the bear under except for a
couple<00:05:54.940> of<00:05:55.300> different<00:05:55.630> ways<00:05:55.660> and<00:05:56.110> you<00:05:56.410> have<00:05:56.560> to

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
couple of different ways and you have to

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.180 
couple of different ways and you have to
really<00:05:56.950> commit<00:05:57.130> to<00:05:57.400> running<00:05:57.580> in<00:05:57.790> a<00:05:57.880> gap<00:05:58.180> but

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
really commit to running in a gap but

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.070 
really commit to running in a gap but

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.050 
normal which the nickel strong and the
nickel<00:06:26.800> normal<00:06:27.070> are<00:06:27.160> kind<00:06:27.370> of<00:06:27.460> up<00:06:27.610> for<00:06:27.640> grabs

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
nickel normal are kind of up for grabs

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.970 
nickel normal are kind of up for grabs
the<00:06:28.540> reason<00:06:28.840> I<00:06:28.900> put<00:06:29.110> nickels<00:06:29.320> strong<00:06:29.740> in

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
the reason I put nickels strong in

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.470 
the reason I put nickels strong in
instead<00:06:30.310> of<00:06:30.370> nickel<00:06:30.700> normal<00:06:31.030> is<00:06:31.120> because

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
instead of nickel normal is because

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.720 
instead of nickel normal is because
nickel<00:06:32.140> strong<00:06:32.470> has<00:06:32.770> that<00:06:33.070> safety<00:06:33.520> already

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
nickel strong has that safety already

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.980 
nickel strong has that safety already
there<00:06:33.880> you<00:06:33.970> don't<00:06:34.120> have<00:06:34.240> to<00:06:34.330> manually<00:06:34.720> move

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
there you don't have to manually move

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.200 
there you don't have to manually move
anybody<00:06:35.290> and<00:06:35.680> so<00:06:36.160> I<00:06:36.190> think<00:06:36.340> that<00:06:36.520> makes<00:06:36.970> it<00:06:37.180> a

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
anybody and so I think that makes it a

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.480 
anybody and so I think that makes it a
little<00:06:37.810> bit<00:06:37.990> less<00:06:38.140> of<00:06:38.350> a<00:06:38.470> setup<00:06:38.740> which<00:06:39.190> saves

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
little bit less of a setup which saves

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.040 
little bit less of a setup which saves
you<00:06:39.670> time<00:06:39.850> and<00:06:40.090> allows<00:06:40.270> you<00:06:40.450> to<00:06:40.600> adjust<00:06:40.720> to

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
you time and allows you to adjust to

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.290 
you time and allows you to adjust to
what<00:06:41.200> your<00:06:41.350> opponent's<00:06:41.770> doing<00:06:42.100> so<00:06:42.550> depending

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
what your opponent's doing so depending

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.760 
what your opponent's doing so depending
on<00:06:43.420> your<00:06:43.570> preference<00:06:44.080> if<00:06:44.200> you're<00:06:44.380> good<00:06:44.620> with

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
on your preference if you're good with

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.050 
on your preference if you're good with
your<00:06:44.920> user<00:06:45.130> skill<00:06:45.490> and<00:06:45.610> you<00:06:45.670> can<00:06:45.790> set<00:06:45.970> up

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
your user skill and you can set up

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.240 
your user skill and you can set up
blitzes<00:06:46.210> fast<00:06:46.600> maybe<00:06:47.230> the<00:06:47.410> nickel<00:06:47.680> normal<00:06:48.040> but

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
blitzes fast maybe the nickel normal but

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.830 
blitzes fast maybe the nickel normal but
if<00:06:48.340> you're<00:06:48.520> not<00:06:48.730> good<00:06:49.000> with<00:06:49.030> user<00:06:49.360> skill<00:06:49.690> I

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
if you're not good with user skill I

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.420 
if you're not good with user skill I
think<00:06:50.290> the<00:06:50.380> nickel<00:06:50.620> strong<00:06:50.830> takes<00:06:51.100> the<00:06:51.250> cake

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
think the nickel strong takes the cake

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.600 
think the nickel strong takes the cake
there<00:06:51.640> so<00:06:51.850> thank<00:06:52.300> you

in medan fell 25 but once again guys I

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:09.580

think<00:07:07.129> the<00:07:07.219> 46<00:07:07.669> Barinder<00:07:08.180> is<00:07:08.300> by<00:07:08.479> far<00:07:08.719> one<00:07:09.050> of

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
think the 46 Barinder is by far one of

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.290 
think the 46 Barinder is by far one of
the<00:07:09.680> best<00:07:09.740> plays<00:07:10.099> in<00:07:10.280> the<00:07:10.370> game<00:07:10.400> so<00:07:10.759> are<00:07:11.060> the

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.300 
the best plays in the game so are the

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.179 
the best plays in the game so are the
best<00:07:11.479> formations<00:07:11.960> in<00:07:12.050> the<00:07:12.080> game<00:07:12.259> so<00:07:12.500> that's<00:07:12.949> it

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:13.189 
best formations in the game so that's it

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:14.559 
best formations in the game so that's it
if<00:07:13.370> you<00:07:13.460> guys<00:07:13.610> are<00:07:13.789> new<00:07:13.879> to<00:07:14.000> the<00:07:14.030> channel<00:07:14.449> and
