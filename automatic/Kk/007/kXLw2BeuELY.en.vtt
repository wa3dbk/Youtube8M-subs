00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.379
 very good to all the sun here I bring you 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.939
 a new guide this time from pvp 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.010
 structured as you see my character has 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.230
 given a quite important change in 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.580
 comparison with previous videos that 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.400
 it looked like he was dressed in any 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.350
 thing and basically this guide I'm going to 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.110
 use to explain how he has 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.090
 happened this because I have already found 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.620
 a lot of people that are not good that I 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.870
 asks what color where did the 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.040
 armor italy what the first thing that 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.390
 you have to keep in mind is that 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.550
 As you go up in level, you are going 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.770
 giving some chests those chests contain 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.720
 and I suppose some of you 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.580
 you have thrown even the objects because 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.980
 it did not work what you have to do 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.980
 next when you have items or 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.190
 You save or directly buy a 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.829
 recycling kit the npc from here of the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.610
 of the glory merchants buy a 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.670
 pp recycling kit that costs 100 d 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.440
 of glory and breaks them unfortunately 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.570
 right now I do not have any and I have here 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.280
 to break so good everyone says it 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.720
 that you have with the recycling point a 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.090
 pullover breaking that will come out 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.210
 I have that I have up here let's see 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.170
 can not get out dust that would be a 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.030
 base component or tournament vouchers 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.880
 free that is with which this is done 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.410
 tier or deer or deer ticket is 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.930
 because they have the true range 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.080
 right now what 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.820
 that goes from 10 to 19 that is from 1 to 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.140
 9 will be rabbit and so on 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.200
 apart from these two things you will need 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.450
 two plus one of them is bought 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.570
 also here in the merchant east of 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.729
 justice on the second tab and here 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.979
 you have the vouchers of each piece that 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.810
 ye ar you want to grade grade ar 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.450
 an armor like the case that I'm going to 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.580
 put then nothing will come here coat 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.900
 in my case it is the heavy one as you give it 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.810
 heavy coat and shopping 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.290
 then the last material that makes us 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.170
 lack can be an orb or a crystal that 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.080
 I do not have or a chip according to royalty 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.850
 that you put in the mystic forge because 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.060
 all this is towards the mystic force that 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.190
 there is here according to the rarity that you put 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.140
 will come out one set or another is supposed to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.000
 The more oddities, the cooler 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.650
 the set in this case we will use it 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.319
 a splinter of an armor but for 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.480
 that you see portman uses a splinter 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.969
 you just have to come here to the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.310
 mystic forge you put the elite dance 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:26.120
 that you want to please 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.549
 I do not know why it's not going 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.700
 let's see what I did not get the video 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.629
 ok now you put here and you have 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.819
 put the powder base of this one you put 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.200
 I will put for free for example and 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.000
 you put a splinter in the case of 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.940
 you have to give and forge and it is assumed that 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.010
 have to follow the apocalypto yes 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.560
 here is here you have the che 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.010
 apocalypse to put an orb it will come out 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.409
 another thing will come out another item other others is 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.680
 different that you put a crystal then 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.680
 others it is different that you put the splinter 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.810
 with the powder with deer voucher 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.650
 the set will come out as it were between 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.000
 quotes from that deer range and so 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.909
 successively it does not have more mystery 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.829
 do the same with the weapons equal 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.980
 You buy the weapon ticket 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:19.020
 splinter or crystal orb together with the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.990
 dust and the vale 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.930
 the tournament ticket of the rank in which 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.270
 you are and forge it and then it will come out 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.760
 I say it's usually that the more 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.610
 rarity the goal I say if he got him 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.960
 a splinter then one more item will come out and 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.070
 Well, better and nothing was all that 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.390
 I had to say I hope that I have 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.960
 served those who do not know how 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.760
 forge the new skin within the pp 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.070
 structured and I hope it has served 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.810
 it's been a pleasure thank you for the video and 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.810
 see you next until after
