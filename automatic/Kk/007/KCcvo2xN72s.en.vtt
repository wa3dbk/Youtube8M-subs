00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.860
 to 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:14.000
 OMG 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.000
 ye ye ah ye 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.720
 Rewritten commandment 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:30.710
 Moses ascended back to Mount Sinai according to the word of God. 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:35.740
 I heard prayer to God to forgive the sins of the people. 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.740
 Rajah God told Moses. 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:45.030
 I have two identical tablets that I gave to others 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:50.540
 Go up the mountain again tomorrow morning. 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:55.610
 I will write back the words that were on the broken plate. 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:01:01.610
 At that time, do not cipher it and do not come up with it. 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:04.330
 No one by releasing small amounts or even devised entered in the mountains nearby mountains 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.330
 Not even . 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:17.430
 The contradiction is to hear these words and make two stone tablets that are the same as the first, 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:22.770
 I went up to the mountain in the morning . 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:30.030
 Moses was with the Lord for 40 days in the mountain 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:34.580
 God wrote in the same words he used to write on the tablets 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:41.990
 When Moses came down from the mountain with the stone plate on which the Word of God was written 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.990
 In the face of Moses the brightness was low, but Moses did not know 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.780
 But the children of Israel worshiped the face of Moses, 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:57.149
 I was surrounded by Moses. 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.869
 Moses tells of God's word at the gathering of all the people of Israel 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.869
 I gave it to you. 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:10.780
 Your God has built a tent of worship jipin with a covenant in that way 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.630
 He said to worship God 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.670
 Which shoulder is what 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.330
 Gonna say a box to put the Word of God engraved stone tablets 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:28.770
 According to God's word, Moses and the Israelites 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:35.580
 Ohsyeoteoyo the Ten Commandments are all built the ark in the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:40.790
 Then there will be three clouds . The glory of God's glory has appeared. 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.790
 It was the cloud that led the people. 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:52.410
 Clouds rise above peer Tabernacle people ah gatjiman a forward 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:56.400
 If the cloud without stopping p rise above the tabernacle 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:00.540
 The people stopped pacing too . 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:04.939
 While the people of Israel moved forward to the Promised Land 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.939
 It was odd watching film moves
