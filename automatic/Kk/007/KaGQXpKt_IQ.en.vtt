00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
well so it is really common for people

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.150 
well so it is really common for people
to<00:04:15.260> share<00:04:15.739> different<00:04:16.519> phones<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.690> iphone<00:04:18.380> for

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
example okay well that's pretty much on

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.940 
example okay well that's pretty much on
every<00:04:22.280> carrier<00:04:22.580> as<00:04:23.060> well<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:23.780> even<00:04:24.620> if<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:24.830> go
