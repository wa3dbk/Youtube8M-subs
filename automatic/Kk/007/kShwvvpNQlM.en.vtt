00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:15.909
 In this work, once it was about creating a large new frame 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.380
 but 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.320
 End-user trainers are also American 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.160
 Though it became commonplace in the management method 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.619
 Sex and just 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.199
 Discontinuation of sales 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.190
 It is a word 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.960
 This is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.869
 It is a product to sell and its target can be expanded 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.960
 Squeeze out 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.030
 Against that market 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.810
 Make a direct phone call if you prefer direct mail 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.790
 It was late 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.490
 Each establishment of whether it should be taken in new 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.310
 Manage it clearly step by step 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.310
 It is a habit to catch on perfection 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.060
 And make it to everyone who has been a major Hilton 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.820
 It was appropriate to meet the gap scientifically 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.820
 It is called 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.130
 More important 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.100
 There is a test is already completely as a modest price cut etc. 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.670
 It is called 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.000
 It was normal play, but stock 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.380
 There was a word 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.100
 That's it, regardless of the recruiting Hokuto in the printing industry 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.150
 There is one function that can be ordered 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.160
 Slider shoot 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.170
 Ordering person in charge Starter than client ordering person in charge 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.860
 Absurdity 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.230
 I understood the other day 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.180
 It is a foul and is like marketing 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.979
 Of the world 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.800
 was bsi 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.260
 That's the end of the day, and now it's the first briefing session across the industry 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.170
 Pedigree that what is important 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.950
 Do you feel like experiencing new developments that will create the background for deliberation? 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.140
 If you replace it with a personal salesperson 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.870
 Oh, I will study thoroughly 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.950
 Fukuda that learning becomes very important 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.950
 is not it 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.260
 I have already beaten and recently I did the same thing 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.049
 I just want to collaborate 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.180
 Anyway, when I go to the Internet homepage 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.979
 End 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.559
 Of course important 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:19.110
 Mark I think everyone is famous in the US 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.080
 I live nearby with snakes in San Diego 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.639
 It is said like Tokyo 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.899
 It will be noticed if you show this place 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:30.409
 This label company has never had a special technology 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.279
 There are also companies that started out 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:35.869
 Overwhelmingly one 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:37.189
 Traffic accident 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:38.780
 Low price is important 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.789
 Then it is the internet 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:42.789
 It was strong 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.760
 Make it a growing company Gartner shaped 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.919
 Active on the Internet expensive 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:53.379
 When I am public and private, the English version of the printing company and the whole company 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.359
 There are many member Internet companies 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.529
 That's why 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:58.619
 Both will be given 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:00.069
 It should be a while ago 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.890
 I want to talk about it first 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.800
 Such an economy's autonomy in bcp assessment as a challenge for our industry 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.449
 Has been commercialized 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:13.429
 The fastest number of Internet users from residents 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:14.379
 Beginning 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.740
 Prior to publication in Japanese clothing 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.130
 Even if things are about 3 times from the homepage hp 80,000 yen this time course 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.780
 It is strange to audit at any time 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.609
 box 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.489
 I have summer vacation when anyone can make it 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.979
 I am not that kind of thing because of the influence of the Internet 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.110
 By using the Internet originally 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.269
 how bcs change 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.749
 Yes, if you use the Internet in that industry 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:42.019
 Video revenue structure vibrator also with customers 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.550
 Before we can communicate 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.989
 I will study 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.760
 This is a long way to Thailand 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.129
 Students in Defense Minister 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.269
 Because it is a thing of the world 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.359
 But one by one 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.910
 If you study, you will always have a point about Tsuda 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.790
 If you acquire the basic principle of course read the association of the 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.629
 Do not stick 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.319
 Well anyway 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.179
 The tone to be processed next is real while making the rent revision 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:13.199
 How much does Masuga want to utilize in the meaning of 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.700
 But it was really good until now 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.700
 I want all the lights to go out 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.090
 Well there are three points as well 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.090
 Shout out that it feels like you just make it 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.750
 I do not know at all 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.960
 From Palette High School 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.039
 I did not understand 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.379
 There is no added value against it because it doesn't move 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:46.400
 Supplied 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.669
 I am not jealous 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.129
 A beauty who is a printer at 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.129
 What you want to do using a bookmarklet 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.469
 Well speaking like that, the first thing that comes out is the net 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.870
 Is there any way to use it to make a print order? 

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:01.289
 There is 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.689
 It means that it comes to beat profit securing 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:05.400
 Because there is 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.610
 Two more after this 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.659
 There is one side 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:08.650
 one 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.789
 What is unfolding 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.509
 Why print office is working on the Internet 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.909
 Businessmen by using the internet 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:17.190
 I'm in 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.779
 Movie printing 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.389
 It's a school process 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:21.639
 Shortened 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.870
 Told about printed data sources 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.930
 Then in terms of being used by customers in the future 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.250
 Recently billion yen 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.820
 It is represented by the word paas 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.940
 All data on the net are high among crude 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.330
 It can be freely used and the union is very deep afterward 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.000
 Is cheap and fast 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.400
 So it is supposed to carry out the same paper as the previous year 4 fusion 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.540
 Venture companies don't fit 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.339
 Clients rushed there 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:53.520
 Also two points 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.509
 Actually it is very important in the third negotiation 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:58.280
 The Internet is 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.620
 In the process of reaching English in English 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.169
 It's 9 days different 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.269
 I wonder what four of those points are in other advertising media 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.740
 It aired in dollars / yen jpy 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.319
 How much it looks and how it looks 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.099
 It is to measure that 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.770
 Much higher than the actual ad 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.619
 It is called the Internet 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:21.619
 A medium that can analyze to a very detailed point 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.389
 There are many different technologies. 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.340
 Incorporate software from Google in the US 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.900
 Can do things 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.449
 Then 06% 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.389
 It is possible to improve the reversal activity executive committee secretary Lee Katsuka 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:35.939
 is not it 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:36.980
 That means 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.249
 Printing company talks to now 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.760
 I finished the work when I delivered the print 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.550
 From now on printing company 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.219
 It was effective after delivering the printed matter 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:51.779
 Ten additional body can measure the effect separately 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.610
 That means these printing companies have a net 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.050
 It is natural to say that using customers and trading means is attracting customers 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.910
 But I measured the effect more than that 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.810
 To the customer 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.419
 It is said that the US result is such a situation 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:07.320
 The sound of wind 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.809
 Create an environment that can be summed up 

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:11.589
 Penalties are important 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:16.299
 Until now printing major Inoue Hisashi store is one way, but donate printing 

00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:18.089
 From where I was 

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:19.419
 Becoming a printing company 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.789
 If you do not try to make it known as a whole 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:25.229
 Foreign Minister who uses the Internet in it 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:28.400
 Anesthesia Became a company in this company 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:39.330
 Went out
