00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:04.609 
what's up guys joke central here and

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.100 
what's up guys joke central here and
this<00:00:05.609> is<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.850> first<00:00:06.180> video<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.950> the<00:00:09.110> computer

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
this is the first video of the computer

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.959 
this is the first video of the computer
I'm<00:00:10.260> building<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.830> have<00:00:11.460> all<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> parts<00:00:11.969> and

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
I'm building I have all the parts and

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.670 
I'm building I have all the parts and
this<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.120> just<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.509> simplest<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
this is just the simplest of the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.050 
this is just the simplest of the
unboxing<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.340> thought<00:00:17.550> I'd<00:00:17.670> do<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.910> one

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
unboxing so I thought I'd do this one

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.279 
unboxing so I thought I'd do this one
first

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
first

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.019 
first
and<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.160> x1<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.550> my<00:00:20.609> favorites

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
and I think this x1 of my favorites

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.820 
and I think this x1 of my favorites
because<00:00:21.240> just<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> RAM<00:00:21.960> looks<00:00:22.230> awesome

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
because just the RAM looks awesome

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.099 
because just the RAM looks awesome
this<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> g.skill<00:00:24.510> ripjaws<00:00:25.019> X<00:00:25.939> a<00:00:26.939> kings<00:00:27.840> of

this is the g.skill ripjaws X a kings of
ram<00:00:28.560> comes<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.310> two<00:00:30.109> ddr3<00:00:31.109> sticks<00:00:32.390> for<00:00:33.390> gigs

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
ram comes with two ddr3 sticks for gigs

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.819 
ram comes with two ddr3 sticks for gigs
each<00:00:34.760> as<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.329> z87<00:00:37.230> compatible

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
each as you can see is z87 compatible

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
cool I'm going off looks and I know it's

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.260 
cool I'm going off looks and I know it's
not<00:01:51.290> exactly<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.800> best<00:01:51.920> thing<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.760> do<00:01:53.000> but

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
not exactly the best thing to do but

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.469 
not exactly the best thing to do but
this<00:01:53.479> is<00:01:53.600> actually<00:01:53.869> good<00:01:53.990> Ram<00:01:54.790> so<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:56.180> guess

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
this is actually good Ram so I guess

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.290 
this is actually good Ram so I guess
it's<00:01:56.660> a<00:01:56.720> little<00:01:56.810> bonus<00:01:57.050> here<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:58.910> other<00:01:59.000> six
