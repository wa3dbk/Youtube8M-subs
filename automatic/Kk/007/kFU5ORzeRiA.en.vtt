00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 There are several tips for us to teach. 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.620
 a baby to pee in the right place and 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.809
 start knowing where to place 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.389
 certain things because they matter 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.610
 very much facilitates the work and which 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:23.010
 are these things 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:24.869
 food the water walks diaper the newspaper 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.449
 for the dog to pee 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.400
 We prefer to wear a skirt because the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.759
 fraud and absorbs much more than 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.180
 newspaper then the dog prefers is more 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.210
 easy and tidbits for us to power 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.210
 reward the dog when I peed 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.579
 This is very important, good. 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.739
 The first tip we should leave 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.070
 these three things or you can leave these 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.730
 three things together in one space in the house 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:58.590
 for example one part of the kitchen and 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.469
 skirt in the opposite corner because it is where 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.510
 the dog eats water and he sleeps 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.799
 Does not like to pee 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.520
 The PT that I'm leaving in a place 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.520
 next to simply facilitate the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.720
 lazy to reward a dog 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.030
 when he gets it right because we 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.950
 need to do this immediately then 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.650
 if you do not go for snacks at 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.290
 pocket leaves in a place near good 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.040
 in this kitchen for example I organize 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.799
 here how the thing could get right then 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.180
 first where I'll put it on the way 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.090
 I'm going to put mine in this little corner. 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.400
 because the dog likes to stay where the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.950
 people are here and here is the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.509
 where the whole family is then 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.270
 dog will spend most of the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.780
 Dedicated time here then so 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.570
 puts path here good where I go 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.780
 put the skirt to fraud then I go 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:01.409
 put on the opposite corner of the kitchen 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:06.119
 I can not put it here and snacks 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.759
 I 'll put it very close to fraud 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.300
 the dog started to pee I go 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.840
 run here get a snack talk a lot 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.990
 all well and make a caring and the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.440
 good snack to finish I should look 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.270
 if there is anything that will compete with 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.280
 the skirt is something very 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.650
 something absorbing the dog 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.500
 may find it very enjoyable to relieve 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.260
 and here I found a tapetinho tÃ¡ 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.970
 then this little rug for now 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.920
 people will withdraw and after the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.710
 Puppy learn the right people 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.750
 You can put it in good order. 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.090
 the kitchen is ready now I go 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.730
 give some very important tips on 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.660
 room puppies when they are 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.960
 tight 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.700
 they pee and will not look for a 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.920
 little place they do very fast 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.230
 usually then if we have far 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.550
 the kitchen is with the puppy and 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.450
 the will they will do in 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.530
 anywhere 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.270
 one because they can not stand to walk much 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.670
 time looking for something else they do not 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.070
 want to leave the group that they are a 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.680
 little place that used to be the most 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.680
 yummy usually the room then if 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.300
 you do not have agility patience 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.850
 be taking your dog the time 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.890
 all for a bath of his in the kitchen 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.630
 Can you put some of these bathrooms? 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.700
 It's no problem at home, then. 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.230
 people can take it according to the dog 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.970
 It gets older here for example. 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.120
 to be able to watch television 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.120
 A good one, I'll put it right here. 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.970

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.760
 you can sit here and continue 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.549
 watching my favorite show and 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.799
 then offer again and within 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.810
