 hello and welcome to www.nvidia.fr 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.600
 shopping ends points like eating 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.610
 in this video we have presented the 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.330
 new ballast quick start system 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.419
 fast ignition of sen j you can 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.230
 see here the new system ballasts 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:34.540
 quick start balas slim riding a 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.920
 bulb h7 basemetals thermal assembly 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.310
 exactly the same left on a 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.359
 quite classic ballast 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.890
 so we go in this video you 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.940
 demonstrate an ignition 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.250
 instantaneous 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.120
 thanks to our new quickstart ballast 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.879
 the cnj you see immediately slow 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.649
 to reach its full power 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.079
 while on the left with the ballast 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.390
 classic lampoon will require at least 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.179
 15 seconds of ignition before reaching 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.469
 its full power 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.600
 this is extremely important in the 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:09.280
 mounting frame on fire bulbs 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.280
 turns and many other applications 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.480
 you will be able to find 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.270
 and this ballast sold individually or as a kit 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:24.970
 climb goes hen h 1 h 3 h 4 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:29.590
 bi-xenon h 7h 8h 9h 10h pons and h 15 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.320
 this kit is so for 36 watts soft or 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.490
 24 volts 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.460
 each ignition will allow you to see 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.010
 here the snapshot of the full power 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.470
 of our chicken through our new 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.060
 ballast cnj a specific technology 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.810
 which is therefore developed for a 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.810
 instant ignition 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.860
 this palace can be coupled with our 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.230
 entire module and therefore be equipped 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.140
 in the same way as our bus kit 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.350
 4 on all new vehicles to 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.320
 know gulf if this polo the news 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.470
 bmw mercedes and other top vehicles 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.470
 range 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.560
 it is ignition and extinction repetition 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.690
 allow you to see that light bulbs 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.310
 instantly reaches its full 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.310
 power at each new ignition 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.470
 so we 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.820
 extremely important reminder in the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.050
 ignition frame fugues turn the 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.380
 cornering light requires ignition 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.600
 snapshot of lompoul is here you 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.940
 find the only kit that you 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.220
 will enable such rapid ignition 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.550
 others offers you an ignition 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.090
 quickstart in two seconds or three 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.560
 seconds 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.790
 here we are talking about an ignition 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.790
 snapshot so you see here the kit 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.580
 universal the fittings are the same 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.890
 that our other ballast you can see 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.600
 quality materials the word rental 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:24.750
 and 13 and the possible use in 9 to 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:31.170
 32 flights so 12 volts and 24 volts on 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.420
 slim balas truck two last 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.130
 technology 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.430
 he can therefore as I remind you 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.420
 to be equipped is coupled to our module 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.990
 anti errors can bus 4 and so get 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.720
 quick start technology and can bus 4 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:53.640
 gathered you will find this product 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:56.120
 deaf www.celgene.com see you soon for 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.120
