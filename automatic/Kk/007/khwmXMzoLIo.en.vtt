00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.929 
every time your watch lights up in full
brightness<00:01:32.040> that's<00:01:32.340> eating<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.790> lot<00:01:32.909> of

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
brightness that's eating up a lot of

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.760 
brightness that's eating up a lot of
battery<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.020> mute<00:01:34.229> your<00:01:34.320> watch

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
battery so if you can mute your watch

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.100 
battery so if you can mute your watch
then<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.850> will<00:01:35.970> save<00:01:36.150> battery<00:01:36.360> life<00:01:36.509> now

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
then that will save battery life now

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.690 
then that will save battery life now
this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.409> again<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> personal<00:01:38.100> preference<00:01:38.310> it's

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
this is again a personal preference it's

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.600 
this is again a personal preference it's
up<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.000> next<00:01:39.950> brightness<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> big

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
up to you next brightness this is a big

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.370 
up to you next brightness this is a big
big<00:01:41.790> thing<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.240> keep<00:01:42.540> my<00:01:42.689> brightness<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
big thing I keep my brightness at the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.710 
big thing I keep my brightness at the
bare<00:01:43.860> minimum<00:01:43.890> level<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
bare minimum level just that one and I

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.539 
bare minimum level just that one and I
can<00:01:45.899> still<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.439> watch<00:01:46.590> fine<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.189> of

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
can still see my watch fine and of

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.980 
can still see my watch fine and of
course<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.880> depends<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.509> which<00:01:48.720> watch

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
course this depends on which watch

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.780 
course this depends on which watch
you're<00:01:49.200> using<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:50.130> there's<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.579> no

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
you're using but there's really no

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.130 
you're using but there's really no
reason<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.659> maximum

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
reason to have it up to maximum

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.639 
reason to have it up to maximum
brightness<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:54.659> finally<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.350> next

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
brightness and then finally the next

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.260 
brightness and then finally the next
thing<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.909> put<00:01:57.119> your

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
thing you can do is you can put your

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.100 
thing you can do is you can put your
watch<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:58.310> theater<00:01:59.310> mode<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.689> theater

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
watch into theater mode and the theater

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.990 
watch into theater mode and the theater
mode<00:02:01.380> will<00:02:01.740> turn<00:02:02.159> off<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.520> screen<00:02:02.790> completely

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
mode will turn off the screen completely

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330 
mode will turn off the screen completely
and<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:04.409> essentially<00:02:04.829> put<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.070> into<00:02:05.310> a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
and it will essentially put it into a

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580 
and it will essentially put it into a
muted<00:02:05.759> mode<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.600> only<00:02:06.840> time<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.049> ever<00:02:07.320> actually

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
muted mode the only time I ever actually

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.680 
muted mode the only time I ever actually
use<00:02:07.920> theater<00:02:08.580> mode<00:02:08.789> except<00:02:09.239> what<00:02:09.360> am<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.539> going

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
use theater mode except what am I going

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.930 
use theater mode except what am I going
to<00:02:09.780> move<00:02:09.869> theater<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.440> meeting<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:11.640> battery
