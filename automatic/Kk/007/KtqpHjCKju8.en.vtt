number graphically and numerically now
we're<00:00:10.710> going<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.980> do<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.309> graphical<00:00:12.000> display<00:00:12.240> on

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
we're going to do a graphical display on

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.600 
we're going to do a graphical display on
how<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:12.870> will<00:00:13.110> organize<00:00:13.590> our<00:00:13.830> set<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.280> numbers

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
how we will organize our set of numbers

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.029 
how we will organize our set of numbers
into<00:00:14.880> quarters<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.049> steps<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.560> finding

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
into quarters and the steps in finding

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.750 
into quarters and the steps in finding
the<00:00:17.160> courthouse<00:00:17.640> or<00:00:18.170> creating<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.460> port<00:00:20.460> for

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the courthouse or creating a port for

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.410 
the courthouse or creating a port for
partition<00:00:21.359> list<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.900> your<00:00:23.180> unorganized<00:00:24.180> list

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
partition list in your unorganized list

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.810 
partition list in your unorganized list
will<00:00:24.720> be<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:24.960> follows<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.550> first

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
will be as follows so you have the first

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.179 
will be as follows so you have the first
step<00:00:27.269> since<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:27.810> an<00:00:27.930> or<00:00:28.080> an<00:00:28.320> organized<00:00:28.949> list

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
step since it's an or an organized list

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.339 
step since it's an or an organized list
we're<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.029> rearrange<00:00:30.390> our<00:00:30.810> numbers

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
we're going to rearrange our numbers

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.160 
we're going to rearrange our numbers
from<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.219> increasing<00:00:32.759> order<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.329> from<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
from the increasing order so from the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.920 
from the increasing order so from the
smallest<00:00:34.530> number<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.610> highest<00:00:36.239> number<00:00:36.600> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
smallest number to the highest number so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
smallest number to the highest number so
that<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> first<00:00:37.739> step<00:00:38.219> ordering<00:00:38.910> or

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that is the first step ordering or

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.729 
that is the first step ordering or
arranging<00:00:39.690> your<00:00:39.750> numbers<00:00:40.200> from<00:00:40.379> least<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
arranging your numbers from least to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
arranging your numbers from least to
greatest<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:41.610> after<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.090> arrange<00:00:42.450> your

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
greatest now after you arrange your

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.450 
greatest now after you arrange your
number<00:00:42.930> from<00:00:43.050> least<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.469> greatest<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.100> do

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
number from least to greatest you can do

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.190 
number from least to greatest you can do
step<00:00:44.760> number<00:00:44.940> two<00:00:45.300> which<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.480> finding<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
step number two which is finding the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.850 
step number two which is finding the
median<00:00:46.430> of<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:48.390> list<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.110> numbers<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
median of your list of numbers so the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.340 
median of your list of numbers so the
median<00:00:50.280> let's<00:00:51.149> say<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.780> listed<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
median let's say you have listed the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.170 
median let's say you have listed the
numbers<00:00:52.739> from<00:00:52.980> least<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.550> greatest

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
numbers from least to greatest

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.479 
numbers from least to greatest
the<00:00:54.570> median<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.110> basically<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.800> middle<00:00:55.980> value

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the median is basically the middle value

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.979 
the median is basically the middle value
of<00:00:56.520> your<00:00:56.699> number<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.239> all<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.510> need<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.870> is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
of your number so all you need to do is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.349 
of your number so all you need to do is
to<00:00:58.109> count<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.530> find<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> middle<00:00:59.969> value

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
to count and find out the middle value

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.090 
to count and find out the middle value
of<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.750> list<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.109> numbers<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:01.859> find

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
of the list of numbers and you will find

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.950 
of the list of numbers and you will find
your<00:01:02.250> median<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.149> will<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.510> your<00:01:03.690> step

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
your median that will be your step

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.590 
your median that will be your step
number<00:01:04.140> two<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:04.860> finding<00:01:05.400> your<00:01:05.549> cartel's<00:01:06.090> now

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
number two for finding your cartel's now

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840 
number two for finding your cartel's now
step<00:01:06.930> number<00:01:06.960> three<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.500> locating<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.580> first

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
step number three is locating the first

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.149 
step number three is locating the first
quartile<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> first<00:01:10.409> quartile<00:01:10.950> is

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
quartile now the first quartile is

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.609 
quartile now the first quartile is
basically<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.939> median<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.479> your<00:01:12.960> first<00:01:13.320> tab

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
basically the median of your first tab

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.800 
basically the median of your first tab
so<00:01:14.159> given<00:01:14.520> your<00:01:14.549> list<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.000> numbers<00:01:15.420> arranged

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
so given your list of numbers arranged

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.760 
so given your list of numbers arranged
from<00:01:15.990> least<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> greatest

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
from least to greatest

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.560 
from least to greatest
you<00:01:17.130> found<00:01:17.430> your<00:01:17.610> median<00:01:17.970> median<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
you found your median median in the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570 
you found your median median in the
middle<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.590> your<00:01:19.799> first<00:01:20.009> half<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
middle now you have your first half and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.810 
middle now you have your first half and
your<00:01:20.820> first<00:01:21.090> half<00:01:21.390> will<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:22.490> your<00:01:23.490> first

this<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.409> how<00:01:49.710> your<00:01:50.310> quartiles<00:01:50.970> will<00:01:51.270> look

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
this is how your quartiles will look

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.690 
this is how your quartiles will look
like<00:01:51.689> after<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.740> done<00:01:52.920> step<00:01:53.340> one

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
like after you have done step one

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.580 
like after you have done step one
through<00:01:54.000> step<00:01:54.299> number<00:01:54.509> four<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.409> have

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
through step number four so you have

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.730 
through step number four so you have
your<00:01:55.740> q1<00:01:56.219> your<00:01:56.610> median<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.270> your<00:01:57.630> q3<00:01:58.170> now

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
your q1 your median and your q3 now

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.260 
your q1 your median and your q3 now
let's<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.159> an<00:01:59.310> example<00:01:59.640> on<00:02:00.000> how<00:02:00.030> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
let's have an example on how to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.990 
let's have an example on how to
construct<00:02:00.990> our<00:02:01.259> quartiles<00:02:01.890> from<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.640> given

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
construct our quartiles from a given

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.750 
construct our quartiles from a given
list<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.420> values

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.490 

so<00:02:07.760> in<00:02:07.909> this<00:02:08.060> example<00:02:08.450> we<00:02:08.750> have<00:02:08.780> Barry<00:02:09.200> Bonds

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
so in this example we have Barry Bonds

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.680 
so in this example we have Barry Bonds
homerun<00:02:10.100> hit<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.970> list<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.300> very<00:02:11.480> band's

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
homerun hit and the list of very band's

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.960 
homerun hit and the list of very band's
homerun<00:02:12.080> hits<00:02:12.290> during<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.770> season<00:02:13.040> will<00:02:13.700> be<00:02:13.819> as

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
homerun hits during a season will be as

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.240 
homerun hits during a season will be as
follows<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:15.050> for<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.470> particular<00:02:15.709> season

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
follows so for that particular season

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.440 
follows so for that particular season
Barry<00:02:17.060> Bonds<00:02:17.390> had<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> homerun<00:02:18.500> hits<00:02:18.740> of<00:02:19.420> 1619

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
Barry Bonds had a homerun hits of 1619

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.800 
Barry Bonds had a homerun hits of 1619
up<00:02:20.690> until<00:02:21.080> 73<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.370> first<00:02:22.640> step<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.330> finding

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
up until 73 so the first step in finding

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.890 
up until 73 so the first step in finding
or<00:02:24.230> rearranging<00:02:25.010> or<00:02:25.220> organizing<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:26.330> Barry

Bonds<00:02:27.110> homerun<00:02:27.470> hits<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.160> arrange<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.670> from

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
Bonds homerun hits is to arrange it from

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.580 
Bonds homerun hits is to arrange it from
least<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.150> greatest<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.870> here's<00:02:30.410> the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
of your list of values so the middle

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.610 
of your list of values so the middle
part<00:02:55.160> of<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.430> first<00:02:56.180> half<00:02:56.450> will<00:02:56.690> be<00:02:56.720> between

our box plot by using those numbers now
for<00:05:01.310> those<00:05:01.490> numbers<00:05:01.970> we're<00:05:02.780> just<00:05:02.990> going<00:05:03.320> to

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
for those numbers we're just going to

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.089 
for those numbers we're just going to
arrange<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.720> numbers<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.289> construct<00:05:06.949> the

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
arrange the numbers and construct the

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.469 
arrange the numbers and construct the
box<00:05:07.220> but<00:05:07.460> that<00:05:07.580> I've<00:05:07.699> shown<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.000> a<00:05:08.180> while<00:05:08.449> ago

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
box but that I've shown you a while ago

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.320 
box but that I've shown you a while ago
and<00:05:09.050> after<00:05:09.860> constructing<00:05:10.400> your<00:05:10.550> box<00:05:10.880> plot<00:05:11.000> it

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
and after constructing your box plot it

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.150 
and after constructing your box plot it
will<00:05:11.570> look<00:05:11.750> something<00:05:11.990> like<00:05:12.110> this<00:05:12.470> now<00:05:13.099> you

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
will look something like this now you

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.640 
will look something like this now you
have<00:05:13.460> your<00:05:13.699> box<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.300> you<00:05:14.599> have<00:05:14.630> your<00:05:15.169> whiskers

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
have your box and you have your whiskers

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.200 
have your box and you have your whiskers
so<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.580> very<00:05:17.300> last<00:05:17.419> end<00:05:18.020> of<00:05:18.289> your<00:05:18.820> plot<00:05:19.820> will

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
so the very last end of your plot will

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.990 
so the very last end of your plot will
be<00:05:20.240> your<00:05:20.599> minimum<00:05:21.050> which<00:05:21.259> is<00:05:21.410> 16<00:05:21.830> now<00:05:22.550> in<00:05:22.789> your

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
be your minimum which is 16 now in your

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.420 
be your minimum which is 16 now in your
