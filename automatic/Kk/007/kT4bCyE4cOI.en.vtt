Germany<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.980> fraction<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.890> is

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
Germany this is the fraction and this is

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.820 
Germany this is the fraction and this is
why<00:03:15.310> they<00:03:15.489> got<00:03:15.750> streets<00:03:16.750> named<00:03:17.140> in<00:03:17.410> their<00:03:17.590> name

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
why they got streets named in their name

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.500 
why they got streets named in their name

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
people the human beings were Anders this

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.630 
people the human beings were Anders this
is<00:03:30.940> how<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.120> started<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:32.920> how<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.070> started

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
is how I started this is how I started

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.910 
is how I started this is how I started
and<00:03:33.880> then<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.420> I<00:03:34.660> started<00:03:35.050> I<00:03:35.200> wanted<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.680> write

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
and then and I started I wanted to write

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.620 
and then and I started I wanted to write
a<00:03:35.950> book<00:03:36.100> about<00:03:36.370> him<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.030> give<00:03:37.180> him<00:03:37.209> his<00:03:37.450> life

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
a book about him and give him his life

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.310 
a book about him and give him his life
back<00:03:37.980> there's<00:03:38.980> neither<00:03:39.250> villain<00:03:39.790> nor<00:03:39.940> hero<00:03:40.320> no

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
back there's neither villain nor hero no

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.300 
back there's neither villain nor hero no
he's<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:41.920> human<00:03:42.220> being<00:03:43.620> he's<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.709> human<00:03:45.010> being

he's a human being he's a human being

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.289 
he's a human being he's a human being
and<00:03:45.610> I<00:03:45.850> think<00:03:45.880> this<00:03:46.330> makes<00:03:46.900> him<00:03:47.200> even<00:03:47.769> more

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
and I think this makes him even more

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.780 
and I think this makes him even more
