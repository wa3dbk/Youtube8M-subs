00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
hey how's it going my name is Theodore

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.120 
hey how's it going my name is Theodore
you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.150> call<00:00:27.330> me<00:00:27.360> teddy<00:00:27.720> I've<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.919> received

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
you can call me teddy I've just received

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.280 
you can call me teddy I've just received
a<00:00:29.430> phone<00:00:29.669> call<00:00:29.700> from<00:00:29.939> Boeing<00:00:30.419> they<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:31.140> me

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
a phone call from Boeing they want me

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.310 
a phone call from Boeing they want me
there<00:00:32.150> but<00:00:33.150> I<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.629> to<00:00:33.780> figure<00:00:33.960> out<00:00:34.110> how<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
there but I have to figure out how to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.110 
there but I have to figure out how to
derive<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.920> Y<00:00:35.070> force<00:00:35.400> due<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.879> rolling

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
derive the Y force due to the rolling

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.390 
derive the Y force due to the rolling
rate<00:00:36.450> you'd<00:00:37.140> think<00:00:37.170> since<00:00:37.590> they're<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:37.769> smart

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
rate you'd think since they're so smart

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.400 
rate you'd think since they're so smart
they'd<00:00:38.640> already<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.239> figured<00:00:39.449> out<00:00:39.720> well

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
they'd already have it figured out well

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.950 
they'd already have it figured out well
I<00:00:40.590> guess<00:00:40.860> I'll<00:00:41.040> do<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> anyway<00:00:44.330> hello<00:00:45.330> I'll<00:00:45.720> do

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
I guess I'll do it anyway hello I'll do

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.280 
I guess I'll do it anyway hello I'll do
it<00:00:47.000> okay<00:00:48.000> calm<00:00:48.360> down<00:00:48.390> I'm<00:00:48.780> onto<00:00:49.140> something

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
it okay calm down I'm onto something

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.130 
it okay calm down I'm onto something
here<00:00:49.739> first<00:00:50.610> start<00:00:51.330> with<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> why<00:00:51.780> force

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
here first start with the why force

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.950 
here first start with the why force
equation<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.220> know<00:00:53.400> let's<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.299> this<00:00:54.750> one

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
equation you know let's see this one

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.700 
equation you know let's see this one
right<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.979> um<00:00:56.549> it's<00:00:57.330> y<00:00:57.839> equals<00:00:58.199> y<00:00:58.379> force

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
right here um it's y equals y force

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.469 
right here um it's y equals y force

times the plan film area next I've got

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.280 
times the plan film area next I've got
to<00:01:03.239> figure<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.570> what<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.080> this

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
to figure out what to do with this

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.180 
to figure out what to do with this
equation<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.760> curses<00:01:06.240> me<00:01:06.270> out<00:01:10.100> can<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
equation you this curses me out can you

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.859 
equation you this curses me out can you
help<00:01:11.310> me<00:01:11.460> figure<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.729> out<00:01:12.030> yeah<00:01:12.540> man<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> think

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
help me figure this out yeah man I think

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.020 
help me figure this out yeah man I think
so<00:01:13.200> yeah<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> figured<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.580> how<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> take<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
so yeah so I figured out how to take the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.760 
so yeah so I figured out how to take the
derivative<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.720> why<00:01:15.960> force<00:01:16.290> equation

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
derivative of this why force equation

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.130 
derivative of this why force equation
with<00:01:16.920> respect<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.430> P<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.909> got<00:01:18.060> d<00:01:18.240> y<00:01:18.390> DP<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:19.020> was

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
with respect to P and got d y DP it was

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.880 
with respect to P and got d y DP it was
DC<00:01:19.500> yd<00:01:19.710> p<00:01:20.040> times<00:01:20.340> q<00:01:20.430> s<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:21.150> sounds<00:01:21.900> good<00:01:22.049> I'm

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
DC yd p times q s right sounds good I'm

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.190 
DC yd p times q s right sounds good I'm
a<00:01:22.950> genius<00:01:23.340> yeah<00:01:23.939> whatever<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.780> don't<00:01:24.960> think

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
a genius yeah whatever you don't think

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.830 
a genius yeah whatever you don't think
so<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:26.130> only<00:01:26.250> got<00:01:26.369> one<00:01:26.429> PhD<00:01:27.000> man<00:01:27.179> but<00:01:27.719> it's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
so you only got one PhD man but it's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.230 
so you only got one PhD man but it's
from<00:01:27.929> tagged<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.219> heard<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:30.030> did<00:01:30.149> you

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
from tagged you know heard what did you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.740 
from tagged you know heard what did you
call<00:01:30.450> me<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:31.020> heard<00:01:31.170> me<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.770> least<00:01:31.950> I'm<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.159> CS

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
call me you heard me at least I'm not CS

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.279 
call me you heard me at least I'm not CS
whatever<00:01:34.280> what's<00:01:35.280> wrong<00:01:35.609> we<00:01:36.420> arranged<00:01:37.140> it

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
whatever what's wrong we arranged it

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.090 
whatever what's wrong we arranged it
it's<00:01:37.469> not<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> same<00:01:38.509> yeah<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:40.079> all<00:01:40.289> ugly<00:01:40.530> now

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it's not the same yeah it's all ugly now

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.120 
it's not the same yeah it's all ugly now
I<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.670> moved<00:01:42.149> q<00:01:42.390> us<00:01:42.539> to<00:01:42.749> the<00:01:42.840> other<00:01:42.960> side<00:01:43.320> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
I just moved q us to the other side you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.050 
I just moved q us to the other side you
can't<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.460> move<00:01:44.700> stuff<00:01:44.999> around<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.570> us<00:01:45.780> I

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
can't just move stuff around on us I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.429 
can't just move stuff around on us I
actually<00:01:48.060> calculated<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> stability

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
actually calculated the stability

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.559 
actually calculated the stability

Bobb the Cheerios he forgot to

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.099 
Bobb the Cheerios he forgot to
non-dimensionalize<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.270> derivative<00:01:57.810> but

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
non-dimensionalize the derivative but

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
you mmm thanks so now we've got to use

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.559 
you mmm thanks so now we've got to use
the<00:02:04.439> chain<00:02:04.770> rule<00:02:04.799> Roger<00:02:05.700> always<00:02:06.240> forgets

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
the chain rule Roger always forgets

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:13.150 
the chain rule Roger always forgets
about<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> chain<00:02:07.170> rule<00:02:07.499> no<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:09.679> sure

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.400 

yeah<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.270> Frankie<00:02:14.690> thinks<00:02:14.900> he<00:02:15.080> knows<00:02:15.230> how<00:02:15.380> to

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
yeah so Frankie thinks he knows how to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.780 
yeah so Frankie thinks he knows how to
properly<00:02:15.770> non-dimensionalize<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
properly non-dimensionalize the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.240 
properly non-dimensionalize the
stability<00:02:17.300> derivative<00:02:17.780> I'm<00:02:18.050> almost<00:02:18.380> done<00:02:18.620> no

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
stability derivative I'm almost done no

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.610 
stability derivative I'm almost done no
no<00:02:19.700> you're<00:02:19.850> not<00:02:19.880> but<00:02:20.660> I've<00:02:21.050> already<00:02:21.230> done<00:02:21.500> it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
no you're not but I've already done it

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.710 
no you're not but I've already done it
in<00:02:21.680> my<00:02:21.770> head<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.100> like<00:02:22.250> two<00:02:22.460> seconds<00:02:22.970> yeah<00:02:23.510> I'm

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
in my head in like two seconds yeah I'm

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.740 
in my head in like two seconds yeah I'm
like<00:02:23.840> 150th<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.650> his<00:02:24.770> age<00:02:25.120> well<00:02:26.120> I've<00:02:26.270> got<00:02:26.570> it

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
like 150th of his age well I've got it

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.560 
like 150th of his age well I've got it
except<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:27.800> wrong<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.760> forgot<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.120> flip<00:02:29.390> the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
except it's wrong you forgot to flip the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.650 
except it's wrong you forgot to flip the
PB<00:02:29.930> over<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:30.920> multiplied<00:02:31.660> shoot

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
PB over to you and you multiplied shoot

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.890 
PB over to you and you multiplied shoot
so<00:02:33.500> you're<00:02:33.890> supposed<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.280> get<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.870> take<00:02:35.870> a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
so you're supposed to get this take a

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.170 
so you're supposed to get this take a
look<00:02:36.170> at<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:37.030> earned<00:02:39.190> yeah<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:40.550> I<00:02:40.580> busted<00:02:41.060> out

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
look at that earned yeah so I busted out

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.390 
look at that earned yeah so I busted out
the<00:02:41.240> clubs<00:02:41.660> with<00:02:41.810> no<00:02:42.080> professor<00:02:42.620> today<00:02:42.770> it

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
the clubs with no professor today it

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.490 
the clubs with no professor today it
took<00:02:43.610> all<00:02:43.820> 18<00:02:44.300> holes<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.720> explain<00:02:45.080> this<00:02:45.230> next

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
took all 18 holes to explain this next

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.160 
took all 18 holes to explain this next
step<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.860> them<00:02:45.980> out<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.820> mind<00:02:47.090> on<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.330> DC<00:02:47.540> y<00:02:47.900> DP

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
step to them out of mind on the DC y DP

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.860 
step to them out of mind on the DC y DP
is<00:02:48.470> equal<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.830> dy<00:02:49.040> D<00:02:49.250> P<00:02:49.670> over<00:02:49.790> Q<00:02:49.970> s<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.630> then

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
is equal to dy D P over Q s and then

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.390 
is equal to dy D P over Q s and then
plug<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.230> into<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.530> equation<00:02:51.950> from<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.190> chain

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
plug it into the equation from the chain

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.790 
plug it into the equation from the chain
rule<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.030> solve<00:02:53.300> for<00:02:53.360> dy<00:02:53.720> DP<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.410> we<00:02:54.500> get<00:02:54.650> this

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
rule and solve for dy DP and we get this

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.940 
rule and solve for dy DP and we get this
equation<00:02:55.100> I<00:02:55.550> knew<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.360> already<00:02:56.540> it's<00:02:57.530> okay

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950
