use a USB microphone that requires
drivers<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.800> install<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.850> is<00:02:49.000> a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
drivers to install this is a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.340 
drivers to install this is a
plug-and-play<00:02:49.300> microphone<00:02:49.989> just<00:02:50.230> like<00:02:50.320> a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
plug-and-play microphone just like a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.080 
plug-and-play microphone just like a
snowball<00:02:50.800> mic<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.160> most<00:02:51.370> youtubers

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
snowball mic that most youtubers

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.610 
snowball mic that most youtubers
youtubers<00:02:52.780> commonly<00:02:53.200> use

youtubers commonly use

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.680 
youtubers commonly use
so<00:02:54.130> those<00:02:54.459> are<00:02:54.640> work<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.940> ps4<00:02:55.180> just<00:02:55.450> fine

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
so those are work on the ps4 just fine

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.180 
so those are work on the ps4 just fine
and<00:02:55.930> it'll<00:02:56.110> automatically<00:02:56.590> pick<00:02:56.890> up<00:02:57.040> that

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
and it'll automatically pick up that

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.090 
and it'll automatically pick up that
audio<00:02:57.519> from<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.120> USB<00:02:58.450> mic<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.739> if<00:02:59.799> you<00:02:59.950> have
