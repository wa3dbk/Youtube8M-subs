00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
really impressed me because it was able

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.510 
really impressed me because it was able
to<00:01:43.110> bring<00:01:43.350> things<00:01:43.619> down<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.160> simplest

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
to bring things down to the simplest

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.260 
to bring things down to the simplest
point<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:45.660> right<00:01:46.500> from<00:01:46.770> there

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
point and then right from there

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.279 
point and then right from there
complementing<00:01:48.270> more<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.869> more<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.229> more

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
complementing more and more and more

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.499 
complementing more and more and more
complicated<00:01:50.009> obviously<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.119> pretty<00:01:51.390> easy

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
complicated obviously it's pretty easy

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.020 
complicated obviously it's pretty easy
to<00:01:51.690> stand<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.740> close<00:01:53.009> range<00:01:53.460> where<00:01:53.880> you're

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
to stand in a close range where you're

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.450 
to stand in a close range where you're
essentially<00:01:54.330> in<00:01:54.690> a<00:01:54.720> tunnel<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:56.039> shoot<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
essentially in a tunnel and shoot a

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.520 
essentially in a tunnel and shoot a
target<00:01:56.820> 20<00:01:57.570> feet<00:01:57.720> away<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.320> really

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
target 20 feet away and it can really

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.219 
target 20 feet away and it can really
