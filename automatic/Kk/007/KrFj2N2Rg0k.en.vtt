00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.380
 travel somewhere or even 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.939
 By the way, I do not have a great one there

 necessarily join in there, there is a 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.540
 By the way, the radio play read by 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.950
 the german voice of carrie bradshaw 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.280
 it's not cool that will ever happen 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.930
 so new york fly or and 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.760
 now can answer a few questions 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.440
 and if you have them right then 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.700
 can you win the trip so 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.860
 definitely look at that time 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.489
 Now I'll show you some tips 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.870
 to pack the best suitcase how to do that 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.570
 Weight finds out how to do it best 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.480
 pack without what the clothes hire 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.309
 what brings with the best school of all 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.980
 When did I have these questions ? 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.660
 So stay tuned 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.559
 Of course, the first question is what 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.409
 I take everything with me 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.180
 best of all are basics that let 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.159
 combine very well with each other 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.600
 or even with unobtrusive parts 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.400
 therefore, for example, a whole 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.159
 simple skirt that suits everything or 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.080
 also a simple dress or whole 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.430
 like a denim jacket even if 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.229
 you travel in the summer or in one 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.119
 I always travel one hot country 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.920
 take a sweater or something cuddly 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.990
 in a cardigan or something 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.890
 that keeps you off the mark as well 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.890
 especially at night 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.110
 now for the shoes quite completely 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.640
 very important are sneakers 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.290
 I would absolutely recommend it 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.360
 especially manners in new york for 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.580
 example very much on the way part time 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.670
 Win makes sure not without shoes 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.140
 as a high school are too comfortable and then 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.670
 of course go away in the evening and if 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.410
 it should be a bit fancier then 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.490
 I have such a match here , by the way 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.100
 are also very comfortable 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.200
 they go well with everything and everything 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.120
 send out and intervene in such a way 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.280
 little bit of this sÃ¤ntis trend on the 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.229
 Right time is very much announced 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.030
 cool so if you already have your basics 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.950
 it's about putting outfits together 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.750
 I think that is very important and 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.130
 really see what fits together 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.470
 For example, a rock 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.940
 combination for the day with flyer 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.070
 or in the evening just with the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.630
 witches or another combination with 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.490
 a black jeans one embroidered 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.500
 top pocket and then they are 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.510
 Sneakers flashy or even in the evening 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.100
 the matches again 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.200
 Now it's time to pack right 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.830
 We start with the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.810
 shoes 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.310
 the first come my suitcase but 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.780
 not just with something like that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.630
 fancy school or a little bit 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.670
 leather or close I would have them 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.470
 first in a bag and then 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.610
 just put it in your suitcase 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.610
 slip in the corner 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.180
 no space wasted unnecessarily 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.310
 So be easy socks or 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.270
 also deliver smaller parts to the suite 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.160
 and then stuck in the corner the 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.110
 clothing in the best of roles and indeed 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.030
 keep as small as possible and then 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.880
 very tight on roll 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.320
 so it stays wrinkle free too 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.040
 you with all things do with yours 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.620
 jeans with back expensive t-shirts easy 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.820
 Keep everything as small as possible and 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.820
 then catch up 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.970
 until everything is cleaned up then start 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.629
 we with the heaviest things not that 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.629
 had a game 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:37.070
 or the sweater jeans and the skirt 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.050
 if everything is evenly distributed below 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.750
 is then we can continue above 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.440
 with the lighter parts as well as top t 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.440
 shirts 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.240
 dresses accessories like belts easy 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.520
 stuff the same in the corners 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.470
 even for underwear just there 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.470
 reinstopfen where gaps can be seen 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.010
 the cosmetic bag also fits 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.600
 on it and of course not the handbag 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.600
 forget she lives too 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.230
 Now buckle up and almost done 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.940
 How do we know now how difficult 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.180
 luggage is there's so very simple 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.270
 trick he weighs himself and afterwards 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.610
 just with your suitcase in hand 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.830
 Now take off the weight and you have 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.640
 the weight of the suitcase pendant so 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.030
 just go and have fun in new 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.030
 York
