00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
is a pretty decent photo frame I'll show

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.660 
is a pretty decent photo frame I'll show
you<00:00:15.179> close<00:00:15.719> up<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.139> just<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.410> little<00:00:16.470> bit<00:00:16.680> but

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
you close up in just a little bit but

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.910 
you close up in just a little bit but
it's<00:00:18.390> pretty<00:00:18.539> good<00:00:18.779> photo<00:00:19.020> frame<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
it's pretty good photo frame not the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.509 
it's pretty good photo frame not the
best<00:00:20.390> but<00:00:21.390> that's<00:00:21.750> probably<00:00:22.220> for<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> price

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
best but that's probably for the price

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.380 
best but that's probably for the price

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
probably looking at and like some of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.710 
probably looking at and like some of
them<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.560> look<00:01:10.799> kind<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.070> warped<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.720> don't

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
them they look kind of warped I don't

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.630 
them they look kind of warped I don't
know<00:01:12.869> why<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.310> did<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
know why I do that I think I did the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.300 
know why I do that I think I did the
wrong<00:01:14.760> setting<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> program<00:01:16.409> there's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
wrong setting on the program there's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520 
wrong setting on the program there's
actually<00:01:17.820> software<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.600> came<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
actually software that came with the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.570 
actually software that came with the
photo<00:01:20.100> frame<00:01:20.689> it<00:01:21.689> was<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.830> photo<00:01:23.070> frame<00:01:23.369> so

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
photo frame it was on the photo frame so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.330 
photo frame it was on the photo frame so
you<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.119> plug<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.200> USB<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
you have to plug it in USB to get to the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.399 
you have to plug it in USB to get to the
software<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.970> install<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.259> did

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
software to install it I think I did

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.539 
software to install it I think I did
something<00:01:28.650> wrong<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.009> that's<00:01:29.369> why<00:01:29.490> this

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
something wrong on that that's why this

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.640 
something wrong on that that's why this
one<00:01:29.880> especially<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.110> before<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.470> was

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
one especially or the one before it was

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.030 
one especially or the one before it was
really<00:01:32.340> warped<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:33.439> if<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.829> right

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
really warped but if you do that right

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.390 
really warped but if you do that right
it<00:01:35.220> does<00:01:35.630> say<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.869> prettiest<00:01:37.259> job<00:01:38.130> it
