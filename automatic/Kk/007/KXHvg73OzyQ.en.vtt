effect<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:49.629> the<00:00:49.870> edges<00:00:50.289> you<00:00:50.739> can<00:00:51.340> see<00:00:51.760> that

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:14.670 

you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.920 

all<00:01:15.580> right<00:01:15.790> so<00:01:15.970> I've<00:01:16.060> already<00:01:16.360> primed<00:01:16.690> my

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
all right so I've already primed my

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.830 
all right so I've already primed my
eyelids<00:01:17.440> with<00:01:17.680> Urban<00:01:18.460> Decay's<00:01:18.820> primer<00:01:19.270> potion

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
eyelids with Urban Decay's primer potion

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.700 
eyelids with Urban Decay's primer potion
I'm<00:01:20.440> now<00:01:21.010> taking<00:01:21.210> Mac's<00:01:22.210> Paint<00:01:22.930> Pot<00:01:23.140> in<00:01:23.170> quite

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
I'm now taking Mac's Paint Pot in quite

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.950 
I'm now taking Mac's Paint Pot in quite
natural<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:26.160> using<00:01:27.160> an<00:01:27.280> angled<00:01:27.640> brush<00:01:30.960> I'm

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
natural and using an angled brush I'm

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.710 
natural and using an angled brush I'm
just<00:01:32.380> starting<00:01:32.800> from<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.070> corner<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.520> my<00:01:33.700> eye

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.420 

and<00:01:38.810> flicking<00:01:39.620> upwards<00:01:40.100> like<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.430> this

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
and flicking upwards like so and this

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.340 
and flicking upwards like so and this
will<00:01:43.610> help<00:01:43.760> give<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.240> wing<00:01:44.540> effect<00:01:44.990> even

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
will help give that wing effect even

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.130 
will help give that wing effect even
with<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:45.920> shadow<00:01:46.190> because<00:01:46.910> this<00:01:47.450> drives<00:01:47.900> a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
with the shadow because this drives a

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.830 
with the shadow because this drives a
lot<00:01:48.410> slower<00:01:48.800> than<00:01:49.010> a<00:01:49.670> gel<00:01:50.210> liner<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:50.690> I<00:01:50.720> do

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
lot slower than a gel liner so I do

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.260 
lot slower than a gel liner so I do
recommend<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.710> for<00:01:51.740> people<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:53.440> aren't<00:01:55.270> used

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
recommend it for people that aren't used

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.620 
recommend it for people that aren't used
to<00:01:56.420> using<00:01:56.720> gel<00:01:57.170> liners<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.970> create<00:01:58.970> faces<00:01:59.420> or

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
to using gel liners to create faces or

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.910 
to using gel liners to create faces or
anything<00:01:59.840> like<00:02:00.080> that<00:02:00.140> it's<00:02:00.500> just<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:00.740> lot

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
anything like that it's just a lot

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.660 
anything like that it's just a lot
easier<00:02:01.370> to<00:02:01.670> blend<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.160> just<00:02:07.430> want<00:02:07.610> to

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
easier to blend so you just want to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.020 
easier to blend so you just want to
apply<00:02:07.790> this<00:02:08.000> all<00:02:08.360> over<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.690> eyelid<00:02:10.030> blending

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
apply this all over the eyelid blending

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.030 
apply this all over the eyelid blending
that<00:02:11.360> line<00:02:11.840> out<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.350> can't<00:02:15.590> see<00:02:15.890> it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
that line out so that you can't see it

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:35.449 
that line out so that you can't see it
but<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.400> just<00:02:16.430> creates<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.230> wing<00:02:18.230> effect

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.059 

now<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.329> taking<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.719> clean<00:02:37.019> zone<00:02:37.049> brush<00:02:37.530> I'm

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
now just shading out the edges taking

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.479 
now just shading out the edges taking
another<00:02:51.120> clean<00:02:51.629> don't<00:02:52.260> brush<00:02:52.620> i'm<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:53.280> using

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
going to apply that right onto the edge

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.589

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
dark you really go just because you will

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.970 
dark you really go just because you will
shade<00:03:08.909> that<00:03:09.500> area<00:03:10.500> out<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.470> want<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.769> keep
