and I think on Sunday and it was

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.450 
and I think on Sunday and it was
something<00:05:54.419> that<00:05:54.449> I<00:05:54.749> was<00:05:55.680> worried<00:05:56.249> about

something that I was worried about

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.519

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:58.529 
because I know that other people don't

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:00.529 
because I know that other people don't
like<00:05:58.680> sponsored<00:05:59.279> videos<00:05:59.580> but<00:05:59.909> both<00:06:00.210> of<00:06:00.389> them
