 videos an opening the opening forgiveness 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.470

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.480
 packs of stickers touched more what 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.370
 In short, it's been a long time since I 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.500
 not made video because I have a little 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.660
 less than 2 see how it's not crazy 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.850
 not so I prefer to just devote myself 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.130
 only to my homework so waiting 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.560
 I present to you and so I go to you 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.570
 will admit that have announced several things 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.630
 so first of all I have nothing to do with 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.810
 train us for a competition 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.120
 so 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.200
 so here it is but I'm cowardly does it 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.710
 not now this contest I'm waiting 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.780
 to have more subscribers because I have 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.100
 4 and thank you but I expect to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.980
 know a little more here is cons 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.530
 fast enough 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:10.590
 the presentation was on stapin if you 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.880
 so here you go so yes there is a 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.030
 contest that is getting ready because 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.469
 asked a lot of times sorry and so 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.299
 yes there is a contest what is getting ready 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:23.909
 but I'm waiting to have more subscribers 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.520
 before balls presented then we go 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.850
 wonder why it changed my voice 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.959
 jean roba of the wedding pineapple son and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.429
 why your voice changes it 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.920
 jean the first video i'm going to you 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.090
 explain I did it was it was 8am 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.759
 of dull and when I tell you it's mid 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.529
 match time was really 8am 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.029
 the second was late afternoon and there I 

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:43.560
 you show it at night at home 

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:46.469
 alas this video I did it in the beginning 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.439
 in the afternoon so as we will tell you 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.779
 know so I think my voice a 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.880
 little bit clearer and still a little bit 

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:55.109
 broken voice there but good my sail is 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.450
 so she is as compared to 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.770
 are shouted so here we are 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.729
 about the contest was done so 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.889
 you do not know if you noticed 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.340
 but I changed my name before it was 

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:08.910
 bullets age now this premium 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.039
 the sky from which call it 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.360
 you want because only he is 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:22.430
 easier to find on youtube any 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:33.450
 first and that's it to make a plan 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:35.790
 here it is here so voila and yes because 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.060
 that a novelty because I'm hungry and 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.230
 novelty is that I decided so 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.120
 as I noticed that I was not doing 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.810
 a lot of videos I decided to 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:55.579
 add new ones how to say of 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:58.079
 again again from new again 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.459
 how to say two new categories 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.349
 never tell you because that's it 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.000
 speaks that paninis paninis yes 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.400
 I buy but not every day 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.799
 that I do not have that to do between 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.269
 quotation marks but so I decided to 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.389
 to do a game so that will make a 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.500
 week panini ie it's not 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.650
 a week I will buy a lot of 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.260
 panini so I showed you I 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.940
 unwrap and so on 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.970
 then I will introduce you a week 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.099
 so over a week out of two to avoid 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.099
 stickers panini et cetera et cetera 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.109
 excuse me up and I'm prolific it's 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:43.549
 for that I zuma if the question is 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:43.549
 pose so that's if the question arises 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.139
 and that's why the brightness cbc of a 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.730
 blow there what is this pure delirium and 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.280
 cool so that's so there would be a 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.829
 panini week dedicate solely to 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.560

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:03.590

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.510
 so concerning the faq 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.389
 here I wanted to clarify it ask me 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.880

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.110
