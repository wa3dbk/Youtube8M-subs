00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.620 
grew up in the brush I was born there
and<00:00:32.149> my<00:00:32.960> first<00:00:33.920> half<00:00:34.219> of<00:00:34.250> my<00:00:34.489> life<00:00:34.520> was<00:00:34.910> very

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
and my first half of my life was very

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.940 
and my first half of my life was very
different<00:00:35.899> from<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.290> second<00:00:36.649> half<00:00:38.770> it<00:00:39.770> was

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
different from the second half it was

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.900 
different from the second half it was
based<00:00:40.640> on<00:00:40.790> fear<00:00:41.180> mostly<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:42.340> it<00:00:43.340> was<00:00:43.460> very

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
based on fear mostly and it was very

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.360 
based on fear mostly and it was very
tough<00:00:44.210> for<00:00:44.240> me<00:00:44.600> it's<00:00:44.780> it's<00:00:44.990> a<00:00:45.140> long<00:00:45.620> story<00:00:45.950> I

tough for me it's it's a long story I

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.790 
tough for me it's it's a long story I
