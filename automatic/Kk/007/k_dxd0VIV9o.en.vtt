you<00:02:24.330> know<00:02:26.150> asked<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.240> betting<00:02:27.540> but<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.810> changed

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
you know asked in betting but I changed

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.100 
you know asked in betting but I changed
to<00:02:28.320> this<00:02:28.530> while<00:02:28.770> I'm<00:02:28.920> treating<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.310> night

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
to this while I'm treating the night

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.150 
to this while I'm treating the night
there's<00:02:31.110> just<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.440> little<00:02:31.530> container<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.070> I

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
there's just a little container so I

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.560 
there's just a little container so I
recommend<00:02:32.760> putting<00:02:32.910> something<00:02:33.240> like<00:02:33.330> this

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
recommend putting something like this

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.330 
recommend putting something like this
thickness<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.930> paper<00:02:34.230> piece<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.890> paper<00:02:35.070> that

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
thickness a paper piece of paper that

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.740 
thickness a paper piece of paper that
dangles<00:02:35.760> into<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.060> dirt<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.390> then<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.540> rock

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
dangles into the dirt and then a rock

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.050 
dangles into the dirt and then a rock
holder<00:02:37.200> there<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.220> lights<00:02:38.459> can<00:02:38.640> be<00:02:38.700> easily

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
holder there so the lights can be easily

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.580 
holder there so the lights can be easily
in<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.570> out<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> dirt<00:02:40.080> container<00:02:40.260> to

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
in and out of the dirt container to

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.000 
in and out of the dirt container to
breathe<00:02:41.239> they<00:02:42.239> can<00:02:42.450> climb<00:02:42.720> glass<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.590> will

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
breathe they can climb glass so you will

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.660 
breathe they can climb glass so you will
have<00:02:44.160> mites

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
have mites

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.040 
have mites
pretty<00:02:45.000> much<00:02:45.090> all<00:02:45.270> over<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.570> room<00:02:45.690> you

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
probably won't see them this is a good

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.120 
probably won't see them this is a good
thing<00:02:48.030> now<00:02:48.330> because<00:02:48.630> snake<00:02:49.320> mites<00:02:49.590> will<00:02:49.980> be
