and a bit floppy like this the other
sort<00:01:04.390> of<00:01:04.420> side<00:01:04.780> of<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.230> problem<00:01:05.770> of<00:01:06.010> hands<00:01:06.490> if

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
you like is sometimes when it's the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.620 
you like is sometimes when it's the
opposite<00:01:09.189> of<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.340> dead<00:01:09.610> hand<00:01:09.820> is<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.180> over

opposite of the dead hand is that over
tense<00:01:11.200> hand<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.430> sometimes<00:01:13.119> our<00:01:13.299> hands<00:01:13.450> can

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
tense hand and sometimes our hands can

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.260 
tense hand and sometimes our hands can
make<00:01:13.780> funny<00:01:14.080> kinds<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.590> shapes<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.270> because

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
make funny kinds of shapes and because

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.240 
make funny kinds of shapes and because
sometimes<00:01:16.479> dancers<00:01:17.049> will<00:01:17.200> hold<00:01:17.500> tension<00:01:18.130> in

their hands sometimes this happens so
you<00:01:20.439> want<00:01:20.799> to<00:01:20.860> try<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.220> get<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.700> point

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
you want to try and get to the point

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.929 
you want to try and get to the point
where<00:01:22.329> you<00:01:22.810> have<00:01:22.960> tone<00:01:23.320> in<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.770> hands<00:01:24.250> but<00:01:24.700> not

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
over tense but not dead either so really

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.039 
over tense but not dead either so really
you<00:01:29.439> want<00:01:29.470> to<00:01:29.710> think<00:01:30.009> of<00:01:30.159> pushing<00:01:31.000> down<00:01:31.240> gently

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
you want to think of pushing down gently

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.450 
you want to think of pushing down gently
with<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.290> palm<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.680> your<00:01:32.710> hand<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.340> your

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460

with the palm of your hand and your
middle<00:01:33.610> finger<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.810> almost<00:01:35.500> as<00:01:35.590> though

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
middle finger here almost as though

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.560 
middle finger here almost as though
you're<00:01:35.860> about<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.220> stroke<00:01:36.549> a<00:01:36.579> cat<00:01:37.030> or<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.299> bird

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
you're about to stroke a cat or a bird

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.170 
you're about to stroke a cat or a bird
or<00:01:37.600> something<00:01:38.110> like<00:01:38.619> that<00:01:38.680> just<00:01:39.159> firm<00:01:39.430> sort<00:01:40.119> of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
or something like that just firm sort of

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.050 
or something like that just firm sort of
pressure<00:01:40.450> with<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.869> hands<00:01:41.320> so<00:01:42.159> I'll<00:01:42.579> just<00:01:42.790> use

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
pressure with the hands so I'll just use

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.469 
pressure with the hands so I'll just use
this<00:01:43.329> plane<00:01:43.750> frame<00:01:44.350> here<00:01:44.770> as<00:01:44.979> an<00:01:45.130> example<00:01:45.479> so

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
this plane frame here as an example so

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.899 
this plane frame here as an example so
my<00:01:46.659> hands<00:01:47.140> have<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.409> little<00:01:47.710> bit<00:01:47.799> of<00:01:47.920> tone

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
my hands have a little bit of tone

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.600 
my hands have a little bit of tone
running<00:01:49.719> through<00:01:49.990> them<00:01:50.229> so<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.040> always<00:01:51.399> want

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
running through them so you always want

the second one you need is what we call
hand<00:03:29.080> undulations<00:03:30.060> since<00:03:31.060> where<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.299> hands

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
hand undulations since where the hands

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.560 
hand undulations since where the hands
will<00:03:31.720> make<00:03:31.750> an<00:03:31.989> undulating<00:03:32.320> move<00:03:32.920> like<00:03:33.220> this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
will make an undulating move like this

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.060 
will make an undulating move like this
different<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.959> wrist<00:03:35.170> curl<00:03:35.500> which<00:03:35.830> goes

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
different to the wrist curl which goes

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.430 
different to the wrist curl which goes
like<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.540> undulate<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.200> hand

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
like that so to undulate the hand

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.740 
like that so to undulate the hand
usually<00:03:39.280> start<00:03:39.760> by<00:03:39.850> practicing<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:40.510> way

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
usually start by practicing this way

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.810 
usually start by practicing this way
around<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.290> pressing<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:42.040> palm<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.580> hand

around you pressing the palm of the hand

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.930 
around you pressing the palm of the hand
down<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:44.260> will<00:03:44.500> make<00:03:44.709> your<00:03:44.980> fingers<00:03:45.459> come

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
down this will make your fingers come

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.150 
down this will make your fingers come
slightly<00:03:46.180> further<00:03:46.510> up<00:03:47.010> everybody<00:03:48.010> is

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
slightly further up everybody is

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.320 
slightly further up everybody is
different<00:03:48.340> with<00:03:48.640> this<00:03:48.790> some<00:03:49.060> people's

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330

people have very flexible hands and they
come<00:03:52.810> further<00:03:53.049> up<00:03:53.370> depends<00:03:54.370> on<00:03:54.459> the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
fingers are there's lots of variables in

fingers are there's lots of variables in
how

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
how

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.380 
how
and<00:03:59.290> look<00:03:59.770> you<00:04:00.310> really<00:04:00.490> have<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.820> work<00:04:01.090> with

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
and look you really have to work with

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.500 
and look you really have to work with

your own type of hands so don't be

whoever<00:04:08.070> is<00:04:09.070> instructing<00:04:09.850> you<00:04:10.030> pushing<00:04:10.750> with

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
whoever is instructing you pushing with

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.110 
whoever is instructing you pushing with
the<00:04:11.020> palm<00:04:11.200> of<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.500> hand<00:04:11.790> now<00:04:12.790> you're<00:04:12.910> going<00:04:13.060> to

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
the palm of the hand now you're going to

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.340 
the palm of the hand now you're going to
feel<00:04:13.300> like<00:04:13.480> you're<00:04:13.660> pulling<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.990> palm<00:04:14.200> of

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
feel like you're pulling the palm of

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.590 
feel like you're pulling the palm of
your<00:04:14.380> hand<00:04:14.700> towards<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.760> back<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.209> your<00:04:16.360> hand

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
your hand towards the back of your hand

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.830 
your hand towards the back of your hand
see<00:04:17.470> pull<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:18.910> make<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.209> little<00:04:19.420> kind<00:04:19.750> of

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
see pull so you make a little kind of

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.380 
see pull so you make a little kind of
gap<00:04:20.830> here<00:04:21.220> under<00:04:21.670> the<00:04:21.760> hand<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.210> fingers

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
gap here under the hand and the fingers

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.840 
gap here under the hand and the fingers
will<00:04:22.660> then<00:04:22.810> move<00:04:23.020> down<00:04:23.160> so<00:04:24.160> you're<00:04:24.280> pushing

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
will then move down so you're pushing

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.970 
will then move down so you're pushing
essentially<00:04:25.390> you're<00:04:25.600> pushing<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.290> then

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
essentially you're pushing and then

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.140 
essentially you're pushing and then
pulling<00:04:27.480> like<00:04:28.480> this<00:04:29.520> but<00:04:30.520> what<00:04:30.700> we<00:04:30.820> do<00:04:30.970> to

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
pulling like this but what we do to

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.880 
pulling like this but what we do to
create<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.600> undulation<00:04:32.050> is<00:04:32.470> we<00:04:32.590> let<00:04:32.740> the

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
create the undulation is we let the

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.220 
create the undulation is we let the
fingers<00:04:33.280> follow<00:04:33.520> through<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.330> finish<00:04:34.390> off

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
fingers follow through and finish off

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.910 
fingers follow through and finish off
the<00:04:35.380> movement<00:04:35.890> like<00:04:36.100> this<00:04:36.660> push<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:38.110> then

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
the movement like this push and then

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.540 
the movement like this push and then
pull<00:04:39.270> push<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.630> then<00:04:41.170> pull<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.740> you<00:04:42.190> can<00:04:42.370> use

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
pull push and then pull and you can use

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.400 
pull push and then pull and you can use
some<00:04:42.730> visualizations<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.900> help<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.260> with

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
some visualizations to help you with

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.110 
some visualizations to help you with
this<00:04:44.590> so<00:04:44.830> sometimes<00:04:45.220> what<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.430> think<00:04:45.730> of<00:04:45.910> with

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
this so sometimes what I think of with

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.780 
this so sometimes what I think of with
this<00:04:46.720> kind<00:04:46.960> of<00:04:47.050> move<00:04:47.320> are<00:04:47.790> underwater

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
this kind of move are underwater

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.180 
this kind of move are underwater
creatures<00:04:49.750> like<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:50.110> fish's<00:04:50.530> tail<00:04:50.770> or

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
creatures like a fish's tail or

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.770 
creatures like a fish's tail or
something<00:04:51.730> being<00:04:51.940> very<00:04:53.040> fluid<00:04:54.360> this<00:04:55.360> kind<00:04:55.660> of

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
something being very fluid this kind of

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.930 
something being very fluid this kind of
movement<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.500> try<00:04:56.830> think<00:04:57.160> of<00:04:57.310> these<00:04:57.460> kinds<00:04:57.880> of

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
movement to try think of these kinds of

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.570 
movement to try think of these kinds of
moves<00:04:58.270> in<00:04:58.840> your<00:04:59.080> mind<00:04:59.350> or<00:04:59.710> something<00:04:59.740> blowing

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
moves in your mind or something blowing

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.610 
moves in your mind or something blowing
in<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.760> breeze<00:05:00.790> maybe<00:05:01.630> some<00:05:01.900> trees<00:05:02.170> or<00:05:02.470> some

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
in the breeze maybe some trees or some

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.230 
in the breeze maybe some trees or some
leaves<00:05:02.800> blowing<00:05:03.130> around<00:05:03.370> something<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.030> help

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
leaves blowing around something to help

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.480 
leaves blowing around something to help
you<00:05:04.480> visualize<00:05:05.110> and<00:05:05.680> feel<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:06.100> movement<00:05:06.430> that

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
you visualize and feel the movement that

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.950 
you visualize and feel the movement that
you're<00:05:06.640> after<00:05:06.880> so<00:05:07.390> you<00:05:07.450> can<00:05:07.570> try<00:05:07.720> with<00:05:07.870> your

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
you're after so you can try with your

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.310 
you're after so you can try with your
other<00:05:08.110> hand<00:05:08.200> pushing<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:08.950> pulling<00:05:09.130> and<00:05:10.320> then

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
other hand pushing and pulling and then

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.960 
other hand pushing and pulling and then
you<00:05:11.440> can<00:05:11.590> try<00:05:11.800> it<00:05:11.830> this<00:05:12.070> way<00:05:12.130> around<00:05:12.430> in<00:05:12.820> front

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
you can try it this way around in front

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.230 
you can try it this way around in front
of<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.210> face<00:05:13.510> and<00:05:14.490> once<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:15.669> have<00:05:15.850> your<00:05:15.970> hand

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
of the face and once you have your hand

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.970 
of the face and once you have your hand
movements<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.110> suggest<00:05:17.530> that<00:05:17.650> you<00:05:17.800> try

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
movements I suggest that you try

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.820 
movements I suggest that you try
standing<00:05:18.669> in<00:05:18.790> different<00:05:19.060> positions<00:05:19.480> so<00:05:19.830> doing

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
standing in different positions so doing

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.050 
standing in different positions so doing
the<00:05:20.919> hands<00:05:21.160> with<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.370> feet<00:05:21.580> next<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:21.940> each

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
the hands with the feet next to each

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.620 
the hands with the feet next to each
other<00:05:22.240> can<00:05:22.960> look<00:05:23.260> not<00:05:24.220> so<00:05:24.250> elegant<00:05:24.970> so<00:05:25.150> my

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
other can look not so elegant so my

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.480 
other can look not so elegant so my
advice<00:05:25.930> is<00:05:26.169> to<00:05:26.320> try<00:05:26.560> just<00:05:26.590> placing<00:05:27.280> one<00:05:27.460> foot

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
advice is to try just placing one foot

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.310 
advice is to try just placing one foot
in<00:05:27.790> front<00:05:27.820> here<00:05:28.560> test<00:05:29.560> out<00:05:29.770> your<00:05:29.800> wrist<00:05:30.190> curls

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
in front here test out your wrist curls

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.970 
in front here test out your wrist curls
in<00:05:32.320> different<00:05:33.250> patterns<00:05:33.610> you<00:05:34.410> can<00:05:35.410> try<00:05:35.620> taking

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
in different patterns you can try taking

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.280 
in different patterns you can try taking
a<00:05:36.070> step<00:05:36.310> back<00:05:37.320> going<00:05:38.320> again

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.260 

and<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:42.100> other<00:05:42.250> two<00:05:42.460> things<00:05:42.700> that<00:05:42.970> I<00:05:43.000> think

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
and the other two things that I think

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.620 
and the other two things that I think
you<00:05:43.390> should<00:05:43.540> try<00:05:43.840> are<00:05:44.400> taking<00:05:45.400> yourself<00:05:45.630> over

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
you should try are taking yourself over
