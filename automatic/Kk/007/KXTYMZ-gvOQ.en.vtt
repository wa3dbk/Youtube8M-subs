00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.000 

all<00:00:05.040> right<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:05.879> let's<00:00:06.420> draw<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.690> figure<00:00:07.020> one

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
all right so let's draw a figure one

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.950 
all right so let's draw a figure one
thing<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.309> always<00:00:08.519> start<00:00:08.970> out<00:00:09.120> with<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.570> a

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
thing I always start out with is a

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.200 
thing I always start out with is a
pencil<00:00:10.380> because<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:11.490> always<00:00:11.700> erase<00:00:11.969> it

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
pencil because you can always erase it

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.570 
pencil because you can always erase it
and<00:00:12.480> it's<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.349> good<00:00:13.500> way<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.710> just<00:00:13.830> get<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
and it's a good way to just get the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.120 
and it's a good way to just get the
basis<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.320> always<00:00:16.560> start<00:00:16.800> with<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
basis going so I always start with the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.170 
basis going so I always start with the
head

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.550 

just<00:00:25.180> think<00:00:25.390> about<00:00:25.480> proportion<00:00:26.230> as<00:00:26.380> you're

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
just think about proportion as you're

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.370 
just think about proportion as you're
doing<00:00:26.860> it<00:00:27.010> ahead<00:00:27.760> then<00:00:28.210> the<00:00:28.390> neck<00:00:28.630> we<00:00:29.200> do<00:00:29.320> a

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
doing it ahead then the neck we do a

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.370 
doing it ahead then the neck we do a
straight<00:00:29.770> line<00:00:30.070> under<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.550> neck<00:00:30.790> a<00:00:31.380> good

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
straight line under the neck a good

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.560 
straight line under the neck a good
trick<00:00:32.770> is<00:00:32.980> to<00:00:33.340> make<00:00:33.489> an<00:00:33.640> X<00:00:33.850> here<00:00:34.450> for<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.750> body

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
trick is to make an X here for the body

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.520 
trick is to make an X here for the body
and<00:00:37.570> it's<00:00:37.720> great<00:00:37.870> that<00:00:37.900> we're<00:00:38.110> doing<00:00:38.200> this<00:00:38.350> in

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
and it's great that we're doing this in

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.260 
and it's great that we're doing this in
pencil<00:00:38.830> as<00:00:38.920> I<00:00:39.070> said<00:00:39.250> before<00:00:39.400> because<00:00:39.820> all<00:00:40.239> of

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
pencil as I said before because all of

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.650 
pencil as I said before because all of
this<00:00:40.510> can<00:00:40.570> go<00:00:40.750> away<00:00:40.960> later<00:00:41.640> from<00:00:42.640> here<00:00:43.120> we<00:00:43.449> work

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
this can go away later from here we work

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.780 
this can go away later from here we work
with<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.809> lot<00:00:44.020> of<00:00:44.050> triangles<00:00:44.830> elongated

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
with a lot of triangles elongated

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.210 
with a lot of triangles elongated
triangles<00:00:46.449> so<00:00:46.870> I'm<00:00:47.350> going<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.620> have<00:00:47.769> this<00:00:47.949> girl

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
triangles so I'm going to have this girl

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.660 
triangles so I'm going to have this girl
have<00:00:48.519> her<00:00:48.550> hand<00:00:48.970> on<00:00:49.059> her<00:00:49.239> hip<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.250> I'm<00:00:51.460> doing

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
have her hand on her hip so I'm doing

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.090 
have her hand on her hip so I'm doing
these<00:00:51.790> elongated<00:00:52.210> triangles<00:00:53.050> even<00:00:53.800> a<00:00:53.860> little

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
these elongated triangles even a little

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.530 
these elongated triangles even a little
triangle<00:00:54.370> for<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.640> hand<00:00:54.940> because<00:00:55.360> you're

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
triangle for the hand because you're

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.780 
triangle for the hand because you're
going<00:00:55.660> to<00:00:55.719> smooth<00:00:56.140> it<00:00:56.260> all<00:00:56.380> out<00:00:56.410> later<00:00:56.829> we'll

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
going to smooth it all out later we'll

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.530 
going to smooth it all out later we'll
give<00:00:57.969> her<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.120> little<00:00:58.149> arm<00:00:58.600> hanging<00:00:59.110> down<00:01:00.540> it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
give her a little arm hanging down it

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.479 
give her a little arm hanging down it
even<00:01:01.780> like<00:01:01.930> cross<00:01:02.260> into<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.829> hand<00:01:03.100> as<00:01:03.219> I<00:01:03.309> just

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
even like cross into the hand as I just

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.359 
even like cross into the hand as I just
did<00:01:03.869> we'll<00:01:04.869> give<00:01:05.050> her<00:01:05.110> some<00:01:05.170> legs<00:01:05.649> and<00:01:06.250> you

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
did we'll give her some legs and you

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.609 
did we'll give her some legs and you
basically<00:01:06.880> segment<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:07.780> legs<00:01:08.020> into

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
basically segment the legs into

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.240 
basically segment the legs into
triangles<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.960> is<00:01:11.050> how<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:11.229> establish<00:01:11.410> the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
triangles this is how you establish the

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.880 
triangles this is how you establish the
kneecaps<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:13.300> do<00:01:13.450> like<00:01:13.600> little<00:01:13.890> inverted

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
kneecaps you do like little inverted

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.040 
kneecaps you do like little inverted
triangle<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.460> way

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
triangle that way

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.480 
triangle that way
evenly<00:01:17.050> a<00:01:17.200> little<00:01:17.530> inverted<00:01:17.890> triangle<00:01:18.340> for

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
evenly a little inverted triangle for

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:26.100 
evenly a little inverted triangle for
the<00:01:18.580> foot<00:01:18.820> as<00:01:19.090> well<00:01:23.039> all<00:01:24.039> right<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:25.210> we<00:01:25.690> go<00:01:25.899> in

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
the foot as well all right now we go in

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.010 
the foot as well all right now we go in
and<00:01:26.380> we<00:01:26.530> smooth<00:01:27.010> it<00:01:27.280> all<00:01:27.460> out<00:01:30.570> she<00:01:31.570> kinda<00:01:31.900> has<00:01:31.990> a

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
and we smooth it all out she kinda has a

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.810 
and we smooth it all out she kinda has a
short<00:01:32.350> neck<00:01:32.560> but<00:01:32.860> I'm<00:01:32.979> not<00:01:33.100> that<00:01:33.310> concerned<00:01:33.490> I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
short neck but I'm not that concerned I

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.730 
short neck but I'm not that concerned I
could<00:01:33.970> always<00:01:34.060> erase<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:34.720> fix<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.320> so

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
could always erase that and fix it so

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.700 
could always erase that and fix it so
whatever

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.240 

basically<00:01:40.550> drawing<00:01:40.940> her<00:01:41.660> outer<00:01:42.250> silhouette

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
basically drawing her outer silhouette

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.030 
basically drawing her outer silhouette
now<00:01:43.490> I'll<00:01:44.300> give<00:01:44.480> her<00:01:44.570> some<00:01:47.290> bust<00:01:48.290> give<00:01:48.950> her

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
now I'll give her some bust give her

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.080 
now I'll give her some bust give her
some<00:01:49.280> hips

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.850 

this<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:56.810> such<00:01:57.049> a<00:01:57.079> great<00:01:57.350> trick<00:01:57.619> because

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
this is such a great trick because

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.920 
this is such a great trick because
everybody<00:01:58.460> knows<00:01:58.610> how<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.729> draw<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.240> triangle

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
everybody knows how to draw a triangle

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.609 
everybody knows how to draw a triangle
so<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:01.340> then<00:02:01.460> you're<00:02:01.579> just<00:02:01.700> smoothing<00:02:02.299> over

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
so and then you're just smoothing over

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.850 
so and then you're just smoothing over
smoothing<00:02:03.619> over

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
smoothing over

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.639 
smoothing over
she's<00:02:06.860> turning<00:02:07.130> out<00:02:07.340> on<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.810> curvier<00:02:09.319> side

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
she's turning out on the curvier side

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.530 
she's turning out on the curvier side
but<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.190> could<00:02:10.550> always<00:02:10.670> fix<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:11.150> later<00:02:11.300> as

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
but I could always fix that later as

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.240 
but I could always fix that later as
well<00:02:12.730> give<00:02:13.730> her<00:02:13.880> her<00:02:14.090> feet<00:02:14.830> which<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:15.950> probably

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
well give her her feet which I probably

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.500 
well give her her feet which I probably
want<00:02:16.670> her<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:16.880> high<00:02:17.030> heels

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.199 

all<00:02:24.050> right<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:25.010> once<00:02:25.400> you've<00:02:25.580> gotten<00:02:26.030> this

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
all right so once you've gotten this

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.080 
all right so once you've gotten this
process<00:02:26.810> down<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.950> gotten<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.370> all<00:02:28.580> smoothed

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
process down you gotten it all smoothed

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.180 
process down you gotten it all smoothed
out<00:02:29.360> you're<00:02:29.810> happy<00:02:30.260> with<00:02:30.379> this<00:02:30.620> you're<00:02:30.890> happy

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
out you're happy with this you're happy

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.520 
out you're happy with this you're happy
with<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.360> fashion<00:02:32.780> illustration

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
with that and in fashion illustration

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.550 
with that and in fashion illustration
you<00:02:33.890> always<00:02:34.360> elongate<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.540> form<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.290> the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
you always elongate the form and the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.350 
you always elongate the form and the
reason<00:02:36.890> why<00:02:37.069> is<00:02:37.129> you<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.790> more<00:02:38.420> room<00:02:38.690> to

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
render the clothing and that is why we

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.229 
render the clothing and that is why we
make<00:02:43.970> them<00:02:44.209> so<00:02:44.510> tall<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.170> lanky<00:02:46.150> gives<00:02:47.150> us

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
make them so tall and lanky gives us

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.190 
make them so tall and lanky gives us
more<00:02:47.510> space<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.170> render<00:02:48.470> details<00:02:49.930> okay<00:02:50.930> now<00:02:51.170> I
