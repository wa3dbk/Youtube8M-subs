way<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.660> clean<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:14.280> slice<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
way to clean it is to slice it like you

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.320 
way to clean it is to slice it like you
would<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:16.080> carrot<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.740> then<00:02:17.640> what<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> like<00:02:18.180> to

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.059 
would a carrot and then what I like to
do<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.720> like<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> put<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.349> in<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.530> large<00:02:19.740> bowl

after<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:20.940> sliced<00:02:21.180> with<00:02:21.510> some<00:02:21.780> water<00:02:22.080> and

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
after it's sliced with some water and

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.229 
after it's sliced with some water and
what<00:02:22.799> happens<00:02:23.129> is<00:02:23.250> all<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.610> dirt<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
what happens is all the dirt and the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.240 
what happens is all the dirt and the
sand<00:02:24.510> will<00:02:24.840> fall<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.349> bottom<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
sand will fall to the bottom and the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.039 
sand will fall to the bottom and the
leeks<00:02:26.459> will<00:02:26.670> flow<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.030> top<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.629> they'll

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
leeks will flow to the top and they'll

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:28.460 
leeks will flow to the top and they'll
be<00:02:28.200> nice

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
be nice

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.500

and<00:02:28.560> clean<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.040> then<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.280> can<00:02:29.460> use<00:02:29.970> them<00:02:30.210> after

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
and clean so then you can use them after

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.640 
and clean so then you can use them after
their<00:02:30.630> rinse<00:02:30.840> because<00:02:31.200> they<00:02:31.320> are<00:02:31.440> pretty

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
their rinse because they are pretty

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.700 
their rinse because they are pretty
sandy<00:02:32.160> but<00:02:32.910> they<00:02:33.120> really<00:02:33.660> really<00:02:34.020> are<00:02:34.140> worth

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
sandy but they really really are worth

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.620 
sandy but they really really are worth
using<00:02:35.160> because<00:02:35.370> they<00:02:35.520> give<00:02:35.670> everything<00:02:36.150> so
