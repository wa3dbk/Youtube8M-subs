while the open g string is plucked in

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.479 
while the open g string is plucked in
between<00:00:51.830> so<00:00:52.830> what<00:00:52.949> we're<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.159> to<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.369> in

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
between so what we're going to do in

between so what we're going to do in
this<00:00:53.580> lesson<00:00:53.850> basically<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.809> give<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.080> a<00:00:55.140> few

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
this lesson basically is give you a few

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
this lesson basically is give you a few
exercises<00:00:55.799> to<00:00:56.430> get<00:00:56.519> that<00:00:56.729> technique<00:00:57.210> rolling

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
exercises to get that technique rolling

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.500 
exercises to get that technique rolling
and<00:00:58.019> then<00:00:58.650> examine<00:00:59.250> how<00:00:59.400> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.729> take<00:00:59.909> those

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
and then examine how you can take those

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.929 
and then examine how you can take those
different<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.439> note<00:01:01.680> shapes<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.400> use<00:01:02.729> them<00:01:02.909> to

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:02.939 
different to note shapes and use them to

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:05.810 
different to note shapes and use them to
imply<00:01:03.360> chords<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.229> progressions<00:01:04.860> possibly

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
imply chords in progressions possibly

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.210 
imply chords in progressions possibly
for<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> song<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.450> your<00:01:06.630> own<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:08.100> what

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
for a song of your own and see what

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.740 
for a song of your own and see what
comes<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> other<00:01:09.060> side<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.720> our

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
comes out in the other side with our

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.830 
comes out in the other side with our
final<00:01:10.350> figure<00:01:11.119> what<00:01:12.119> I'm<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.479> first

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
final figure what I'm going to do first

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.499 
final figure what I'm going to do first
here<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.380> take<00:01:14.159> out<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:15.240> you're<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
here is take out what you're going to

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.090 
here is take out what you're going to
see<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> first<00:01:16.020> figure<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.619> an<00:01:16.799> index

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
see in the first figure is an index

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.920 
see in the first figure is an index
finger<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> fifth<00:01:17.909> string<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.509> your

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
finger on the fifth string and your

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.700 
finger on the fifth string and your
pinkie<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.130> second<00:01:20.850> string<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.360> C<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.080> E

pinkie on the second string on C and E

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.889 
pinkie on the second string on C and E
and<00:01:23.009> we're<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> basically<00:01:24.150> take<00:01:24.479> these

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
and we're going to basically take these

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.169 
and we're going to basically take these
two<00:01:25.200> notes<00:01:25.469> and<00:01:25.740> move<00:01:25.950> them<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.249> the<00:01:26.729> C<00:01:26.969> major

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
two notes and move them up the C major

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:40.550 
two notes and move them up the C major
scale<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:31.789> both<00:01:32.789> strings<00:01:39.560> simultaneously

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
scale on both strings simultaneously

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.349 
scale on both strings simultaneously
while<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:40.950> pluck<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> g<00:01:41.579> string<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
while we pluck the g string in the

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.989 
while we pluck the g string in the
middle<00:01:45.770> plucking<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.859> g<00:01:47.100> string<00:01:47.369> with<00:01:47.789> the

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
middle plucking the g string with the

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.870 
middle plucking the g string with the
thumb<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.719> your<00:01:48.810> you're<00:01:49.469> plucking<00:01:49.799> hand<00:01:50.219> so

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
thumb of your you're plucking hand so

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.510 
thumb of your you're plucking hand so
you<00:01:50.909> almost<00:01:51.329> end<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.020> having<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.560> thumb

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you almost end up having a thumb

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.399 
you almost end up having a thumb
movement<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.179> this<00:01:54.259> alternating<00:01:55.259> between

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
movement like this alternating between

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.340 
movement like this alternating between
the<00:01:55.710> fifth<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.159> third<00:01:57.030> strings<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.200> whole

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the fifth and third strings as the whole

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.129 
the fifth and third strings as the whole
figure<00:01:58.619> unfolds<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.420> for<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.719> first<00:02:00.780> example

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:01.139 
figure unfolds so for this first example

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.929 
figure unfolds so for this first example
i'm<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.679> to<00:02:01.740> count<00:02:01.859> you<00:02:02.039> in<00:02:02.069> real<00:02:02.340> slow<00:02:02.700> and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
i'm going to count you in real slow and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.449 
i'm going to count you in real slow and
will<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> basically<00:02:04.139> traverse<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.979> whole<00:02:05.189> neck

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
will I basically traverse the whole neck

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.910 
will I basically traverse the whole neck
if<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.749> tricky<00:02:07.289> time<00:02:07.499> getting

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
if you if you have a tricky time getting

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.010 
if you if you have a tricky time getting
all<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> way<00:02:08.250> up<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.490> top<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:09.240> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
all the way up to the top here the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.540 
all the way up to the top here the
figure<00:02:10.200> actually<00:02:10.709> wrote<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.490> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
figure actually wrote out is going to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.120 
figure actually wrote out is going to
have<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:11.880> shift<00:02:12.300> down<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.959> these<00:02:13.140> couple<00:02:14.069> of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
have a shift down to these couple of

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.710 
have a shift down to these couple of
fretting<00:02:14.430> areas<00:02:14.850> just<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.330> don't<00:02:15.420> have<00:02:15.569> to

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
fretting areas just so you don't have to

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.300 
fretting areas just so you don't have to
end<00:02:15.990> up<00:02:16.110> doing<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.530> kind<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.830> freaky

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
end up doing this kind of freaky

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.400 
end up doing this kind of freaky
fingering<00:02:17.760> I'm<00:02:18.750> going<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.959> catch<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.350> right

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
fingering I'm going to catch in right

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.710 
fingering I'm going to catch in right
now<00:02:19.740> it's<00:02:20.010> cut<00:02:20.280> time<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.209> hear<00:02:21.420> me<00:02:21.510> count

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
now it's cut time so you hear me count

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:36.900 
now it's cut time so you hear me count
one<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.430> two<00:02:23.430> and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.820
