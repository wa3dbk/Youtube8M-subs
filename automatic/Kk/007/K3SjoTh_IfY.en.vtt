00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
 so hello dear friends and warmly 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.580
 welcome here for my first 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:17.070
 unboxing and matching it is direct 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:18.390
 a blood test many of you know her 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 probably also from other youtube 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.840
 but always explains it very briefly 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.970
 The Lucia It's such a small package 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.769
 as you can see and there is every witness 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.019
 what i refer to gaming or nerds 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.710
 may or any figures t shirt 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.029
 no idea 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.140
 if you wanted to order them too 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.059
 then, of course, also in the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.559
 description but now look natural 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.149
 first of all, there's something in there and there 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.700
 I'm also curious indeed that their 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.230
 two cameras positioned so you here 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.670
 the ideal overview so i have mine 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.860
 it now just as a 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.210
 brought small kitchen knife and then 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.559
 I want to say we just start times 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.539
 to do the whole thing I'm right 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.920
 curious what's in there is not 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.930
 be especially useful in life though 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.550
 it's definitely a funny thing 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.469
 and one time you can find that yes 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.120
 do that and that's why I like the whole thing 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.460
 Now I hope you see it is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.210

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.369
 We can not do that little book 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.960
 look into 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.430
 because there's something on it already 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.229
 and of course we want to be 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.270
 not so that puts aside first 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.159
 and then it's time to get canned 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.659
 I'm curious now I'm doing 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.500

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.960

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.640

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.259

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.340

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.950

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.259
 no clone warrior good 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:06.049
 and then I put that first too 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.849
 aside and then it goes on so cool 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.380
 this is a cd-rom my god i know 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.819
 but not maybe every 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.440
 year and I would definitely have one 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.670
 I'll get into video 1 for a short time 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.079
 It's definitely cool. I have it 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.099
 curious or I have the next 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:21.140
 will transformers figures this little one 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.120
 Cool things are also cool thing 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.610
 any case I would give anything now 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.450
 and shows where i see what a this is 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.400
 not my thing 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.109
 that is not my thing mangas or 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.340
 Generally, how do I get small 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.290
 Note in between when the from 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.340
 manga anime otherwise I always speak 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.079
 no plan at all 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.190
 So do not mind me if you 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.350
 it gets better then you write 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.639
 Just look at the comments on it 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.109
 That's not my thing we say completely 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.030
 honestly I will give it directly then 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.519
 further is not at all my thing and 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.650

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.180
 halt the just here times at camera 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.260
 of course not my thing 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.150
 it will be more likely than in 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.349
 pajamas dekra deal but it is up 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.250
 any case a nice thing for the 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.900
 people who are probably on it 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.459
 is it even ahead what you know 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.870
 I should not know it 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.190
 that's it with our lodge 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.109
 It is definitely an important thing 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.849
 and has a few childhood dreams again 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.260

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.419

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.730
 Which, of course, treat you well right away 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:12.019
 then that's it with this video 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.959
 I hope you have a little fun 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.910
 it has become the perfect chaos here 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.220
 moderate or I say or is beautiful 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.209
