 helps going over were stopping to note a 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.470
 why does be so high end work with scales 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.660
 main principle 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.210
 absolutely any thing gets better

 time teaching hours or application on 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.140
