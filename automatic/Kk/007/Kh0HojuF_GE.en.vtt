00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
treyarch and it just seems like

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.069 
treyarch and it just seems like
something<00:01:31.299> they<00:01:31.570> would<00:01:31.600> do<00:01:31.840> you<00:01:31.990> know

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
something they would do you know

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.480 
something they would do you know
sometimes<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.649> just<00:01:32.770> think<00:01:33.040> like<00:01:33.130> wow<00:01:33.280> that's

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
sometimes you just think like wow that's

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.950 
sometimes you just think like wow that's
like<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.729> treyarch<00:01:34.210> thing<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.570> know<00:01:34.689> and<00:01:34.930> you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
like a treyarch thing you know and you

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.929 
like a treyarch thing you know and you
can<00:01:35.530> really<00:01:35.829> differentiate<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.490> between<00:01:36.820> a

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
can really differentiate that between a

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.090 
can really differentiate that between a
feature<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.689> a<00:01:37.780> real<00:01:38.530> trailer<00:01:38.799> I<00:01:38.920> guess

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
feature and a real trailer I guess

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.800 
feature and a real trailer I guess
there's<00:01:39.369> not<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.549> lot<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:39.850> can<00:01:40.149> really<00:01:40.299> get<00:01:40.600> from

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
there's not a lot we can really get from

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.649 
there's not a lot we can really get from
this<00:01:40.960> um<00:01:41.229> if<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:42.070> want<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.399> like<00:01:42.549> pause<00:01:42.909> when

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
this um if you want to like pause when

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.950 
this um if you want to like pause when
you<00:01:43.810> see<00:01:44.079> those<00:01:44.259> gameplay<00:01:44.740> images<00:01:45.189> or<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:46.600> guess

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
you see those gameplay images or I guess

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.420 
you see those gameplay images or I guess
look<00:01:47.229> at<00:01:47.350> them<00:01:47.500> for<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.799> second<00:01:48.159> like<00:01:48.280> right

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
look at them for the second like right

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.389 
look at them for the second like right
there<00:01:48.579> on<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.829> unfortunate<00:01:50.829> part<00:01:50.860> about<00:01:51.219> this

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
there on the unfortunate part about this

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.209 
there on the unfortunate part about this
is<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.790> doesn't<00:01:51.820> really<00:01:52.329> look<00:01:52.719> like<00:01:52.920> black<00:01:53.920> ops

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
is it doesn't really look like black ops

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.779 
is it doesn't really look like black ops
3<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:55.289> just<00:01:56.289> reminds<00:01:56.619> me<00:01:56.799> of<00:01:56.890> like<00:01:56.979> left<00:01:57.610> for

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
3 it just reminds me of like left for

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.429 
3 it just reminds me of like left for
dead<00:01:58.000> or<00:01:58.240> something<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.810> just<00:01:58.869> reminds<00:01:59.229> me<00:01:59.320> of

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
dead or something and just reminds me of

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.230 
dead or something and just reminds me of
something<00:01:59.740> that<00:01:59.770> wouldn't<00:02:00.159> be<00:02:00.369> a<00:02:00.640> call<00:02:01.119> of

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
something that wouldn't be a call of

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.569 
something that wouldn't be a call of
duty's<00:02:01.570> type<00:02:01.869> thing<00:02:02.140> I'm<00:02:02.380> not<00:02:03.159> so<00:02:03.340> sure<00:02:03.369> if

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
duty's type thing I'm not so sure if

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.170 
duty's type thing I'm not so sure if
that's<00:02:03.759> just<00:02:03.939> me<00:02:04.119> I'm<00:02:04.360> just<00:02:05.549> being<00:02:06.549> weird<00:02:06.820> and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
that's just me I'm just being weird and

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.300 
that's just me I'm just being weird and
taking<00:02:07.689> it<00:02:07.840> off<00:02:07.960> of<00:02:08.260> past<00:02:08.710> experiences

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
taking it off of past experiences

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.550 
taking it off of past experiences
because<00:02:09.520> we<00:02:09.700> haven't<00:02:09.970> really<00:02:10.150> seen<00:02:10.900> black<00:02:11.350> ops

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
because we haven't really seen black ops

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.530 
because we haven't really seen black ops
3<00:02:11.860> gameplay<00:02:12.480> you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
3 gameplay you

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.559 
3 gameplay you
get<00:02:13.629> besides<00:02:14.290> for<00:02:14.829> multiplayer<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.610> we're

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
get besides for multiplayer and we're

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.789 
get besides for multiplayer and we're
not<00:02:16.629> really<00:02:16.840> much<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.110> don't<00:02:17.590> know<00:02:17.650> what<00:02:17.769> that

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
not really much I don't know what that

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.259 
not really much I don't know what that
I'll<00:02:18.010> water<00:02:18.280> running<00:02:18.549> stuff<00:02:18.670> was<00:02:18.879> but<00:02:19.120> we've

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
I'll water running stuff was but we've

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.819 
I'll water running stuff was but we've
seen<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.569> trailer<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:20.019> wasn't<00:02:20.379> really<00:02:20.620> like

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
seen the trailer but wasn't really like

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.959 
seen the trailer but wasn't really like
good<00:02:21.489> gameplay<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> really<00:02:22.659> on<00:02:23.189> be<00:02:24.189> sure<00:02:24.219> that

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
good gameplay to really on be sure that

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.209 
good gameplay to really on be sure that
that<00:02:25.359> was<00:02:25.659> real<00:02:25.959> or<00:02:26.230> fake<00:02:26.469> so<00:02:26.920> we<00:02:27.069> don't

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
that was real or fake so we don't

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.149 
that was real or fake so we don't
exactly<00:02:27.640> know<00:02:28.090> but<00:02:28.329> I<00:02:28.930> mean<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.769> guys<00:02:29.890> can

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
exactly know but I mean you guys can

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.179 
exactly know but I mean you guys can
tell<00:02:30.340> me<00:02:30.519> I<00:02:31.260> honestly<00:02:32.260> think<00:02:32.439> it's<00:02:32.590> fake<00:02:32.859> a<00:02:32.890> lot

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
tell me I honestly think it's fake a lot

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.240 
tell me I honestly think it's fake a lot
of<00:02:33.280> these<00:02:33.400> are<00:02:33.609> fake<00:02:33.879> but<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.870> seems<00:02:35.530> like<00:02:35.739> I

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
of these are fake but it seems like I

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.240 
of these are fake but it seems like I
don't<00:02:37.180> know<00:02:37.239> these<00:02:37.959> leaks<00:02:38.319> are<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:38.920> weird

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
don't know these leaks are so weird

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.800 
don't know these leaks are so weird
because<00:02:39.489> I<00:02:39.639> feel<00:02:40.000> like<00:02:40.030> they're<00:02:40.269> taking<00:02:40.689> it

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
because I feel like they're taking it

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.440 
because I feel like they're taking it
like<00:02:41.019> from<00:02:41.980> actual<00:02:42.519> trailers<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.239> from

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
like from actual trailers and from

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.750 
like from actual trailers and from
actual<00:02:43.780> leaks<00:02:44.139> and<00:02:44.409> then<00:02:44.739> just<00:02:44.889> adding<00:02:45.370> on<00:02:45.519> to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
actual leaks and then just adding on to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.309 
actual leaks and then just adding on to
it<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:46.090> make<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.329> like<00:02:46.689> oh<00:02:46.870> there<00:02:47.079> own<00:02:47.290> thing

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
it to make it like oh there own thing

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.190 
it to make it like oh there own thing
and<00:02:47.739> their<00:02:47.889> own<00:02:48.010> huge<00:02:48.430> thing<00:02:48.639> so<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.959> full

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
and their own huge thing so the full

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.929 
and their own huge thing so the full
trailer<00:02:50.470> might<00:02:50.889> not<00:02:50.920> be<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.370> real<00:02:51.519> thing<00:02:51.730> but

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
trailer might not be the real thing but

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.740 
trailer might not be the real thing but
I<00:02:52.030> think<00:02:52.060> part<00:02:52.629> of<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.930> definitely<00:02:53.799> are<00:02:54.750> legit

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
I think part of it definitely are legit

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.839 
I think part of it definitely are legit
parts<00:02:56.319> of<00:02:56.409> it<00:02:56.439> are<00:02:56.560> real<00:02:56.889> parts<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.459> just

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
parts of it are real parts of it just

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.179 
parts of it are real parts of it just
they<00:02:58.180> make<00:02:58.389> sense<00:02:58.750> this<00:02:59.139> has<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.349> old<00:02:59.709> same

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
they make sense this has the old same

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.520 
they make sense this has the old same
style<00:03:00.549> from<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:00.970> other<00:03:01.090> trailer<00:03:01.540> with<00:03:02.500> the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
style from the other trailer with the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.360 
style from the other trailer with the
old<00:03:02.950> style<00:03:03.780> diner<00:03:04.780> type<00:03:05.109> area<00:03:05.349> pretty<00:03:06.159> sure

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
old style diner type area pretty sure

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.890 
old style diner type area pretty sure
that's<00:03:06.549> what<00:03:06.639> that<00:03:06.790> was<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:07.269> then<00:03:07.689> the<00:03:07.870> other

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
that's what that was and then the other

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.629 
that's what that was and then the other
one<00:03:08.109> where<00:03:08.530> we<00:03:08.709> had<00:03:08.919> where<00:03:09.189> we<00:03:09.280> solve<00:03:09.489> all

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
one where we had where we solve all

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.580 
one where we had where we solve all
trade<00:03:09.939> in<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.180> old<00:03:10.510> room<00:03:11.079> with<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.349> wooden

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
trade in that old room with the wooden

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.920 
trade in that old room with the wooden
stuff<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.189> this<00:03:12.519> is<00:03:12.579> basically<00:03:13.299> like<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.750> lower

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
stuff and this is basically like a lower

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.210 
stuff and this is basically like a lower
part<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.409> a<00:03:14.560> city<00:03:14.859> I<00:03:14.950> guess<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.590> shots

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
seem like call of duty but definitely

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.980 
seem like call of duty but definitely
