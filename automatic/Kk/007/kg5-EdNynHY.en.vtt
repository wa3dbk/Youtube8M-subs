but at this point in time they are one

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.189 
but at this point in time they are one
in<00:00:26.070> four<00:00:26.400> yesterday<00:00:26.970> they<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.660> lost<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.080> the

in four yesterday they just lost to the
Buffalo<00:00:28.380> Bills<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.640> doesn't<00:00:30.150> look<00:00:30.210> like

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
Buffalo Bills and it doesn't look like

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.389 
Buffalo Bills and it doesn't look like
they<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.929> things<00:00:31.260> together<00:00:31.470> especially<00:00:31.890> on

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399

they have things together especially on
the<00:00:32.489> defense<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.090> mean<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.840> basically<00:00:34.020> run

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the defense I mean you can basically run

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080 
the defense I mean you can basically run
a<00:00:34.559> three-year-old<00:00:35.309> right<00:00:35.820> through<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
a three-year-old right through the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.670 
a three-year-old right through the
middle<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.390> their<00:00:36.510> defense<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> they<00:00:37.290> are<00:00:37.440> not

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
middle of their defense and they are not

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.410 
middle of their defense and they are not
stopping<00:00:38.070> anybody<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.820> ah<00:00:38.879> no<00:00:39.090> offense

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
stopping anybody but ah no offense

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
stopping anybody but ah no offense
they're<00:00:39.840> generally<00:00:40.350> getting<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.890> job<00:00:41.129> done

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
they're generally getting the job done

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.819 
they're generally getting the job done
give<00:00:42.000> or<00:00:42.030> take<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.629> whole<00:00:42.960> bunch<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.320> turnover

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
give or take a whole bunch of turnover

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.950 
give or take a whole bunch of turnover
so<00:00:43.980> look<00:00:44.190> simple<00:00:44.579> question<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.420> think<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
so look simple question do you think the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.990 
so look simple question do you think the
Philadelphia<00:00:46.559> Eagles<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:47.219> still<00:00:47.550> go<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
Philadelphia Eagles can still go to the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090 
Philadelphia Eagles can still go to the
playoffs<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.719> make<00:00:49.110> some<00:00:49.320> noise<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.590> maybe

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
playoffs and make some noise and maybe

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.639 
playoffs and make some noise and maybe
even<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> Super<00:00:51.239> Bowl<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.660> still<00:00:52.350> think

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
even get to the Super Bowl I still think

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.189
