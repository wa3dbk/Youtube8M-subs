 THE 10 MOST STRANGE ANIMALS OF PREHISTORY 

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:17.900
 Seeing them, one would be tempted to say that Mother Nature 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.300
 I used to be drunk in ancient times. 

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:25.200
 From chimeras to creatures with an alien appearance, 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.200
 Here are the 10 strangest prehistoric animals. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.367
 ANOMALOCARIS 

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:38.000
 Before the rise of the Tyrannosaurus and the Megalodon, 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.867
 the Anomalocaris was the largest predator in the world. 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.500
 Its name means "Abnormal shrimp", 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.833
 it reached lengths of up to 2 meters (6.5 feet), 

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:49.600
 a giant size back then. 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.933
 And even stranger taxa, called Tamisiocaris, 

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.467
 they were powered by appendix filters 

00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:57.000
 like the modern bearded cetaceans. 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.767
 CHALICOTHERE 

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.700
 Similar to a type of man-bear-horse chimera, 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.733
 the chalicotheres were huge creatures ... 

00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.767
 ... with arms that showed great and powerful claws 

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:17.833
 used to clean vegetation of trees and look for food. 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.467
 STETHACANTHUS 

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:28.000
 Stethacanthus is an ancient shark genus 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.667
 who lived about 360 million years ago. 

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:34.967
 He had a small appearance, and is better known 

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:38.567
 by its anvil-shaped dorsal fin. 

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.967
 The strange bump and head of the shark 

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.067
 they were covered with small peaks 

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:46.600
 whose role is still unclear. 

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:53.100
 PLATYBELODON 

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:57.033
 A type of elephant crossed with a platypus, 

00:01:57.033 --> 00:02:00.733
 with two huge teeth protruding from the lower jaw ... 

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:02.467
 ... this strange animal 

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:04.633
 commonly known as "spade tooth", 

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.633
 I lived between 15 and 4 million years ago. 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.067
 The huge sharp incisors were used to beat the floor 

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:14.833
 as well as to cut tree branches. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.300
 DICKSONIA 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.767
 550 million years ago, the dicksonia was one of the 

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:26.933
 first multicellular organisms 

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:28.967
 known complexes. 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.933
 This enigmatic creature is considered 

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:36.100
 as part of the animal kingdom ... 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.800
 ... even when many suggested 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.467
 who had been a member of an "extinct kingdom". 

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:48.800
 NYCTOSAURUS 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.133
 Without doubt one of the strangest species 

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:55.967
 that flew through the skies of Earth ... 

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.900
 ... the nyctosaurus was of the order pterosauria 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.600
 with a huge bone coming out over his head. 

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:06.467
 Many believe that a membrane was attached to its crest, 

00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:10.233
 as a "head sailboat". 

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:16.833
 HELICOPRION 

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.267
 The helicoprion was a shark-like fish 

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.433
 that he had a strange lower jaw 

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:24.600
 which confused scientists for centuries. 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.500
 It was thought that his teeth 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.700
 they were arranged in a "spiral-dental", 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.167
 turning into a kind of coiled saw ... 

00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:34.767
 ... but recent studies showed that in reality 

00:03:34.767 --> 00:03:39.167
 it was more similar to a circular jaw inside the mouth ... 

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:42.133
 ... rotating as the jaw closes 

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:44.967
 to crush its prey. 

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:51.233
 HALLUCIGENIA 

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:54.967
 Named for its "strange and dream quality", 

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:56.900
 the halluci 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.400
 It perplexes scientists in many ways. 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.733
 This strange creature that lived about 505 million years ago 

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:06.033
 had 7 to 8 pairs of legs equipped with claws. 

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:10.200
 Each one finished in peak of unknown function, 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.567
 and their "head" and "tail" are not yet identified. 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.867
 SHAROVIPTERYX 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.967
 The sharovipteryx was a unique genre 

00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:25.033
 of the first flying reptiles 

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:27.600
 that lived 225 million years ago. 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.967
 He had extremely long legs 

00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:32.933
 dragged by a rear wing, 

00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:35.267
 and small gliders on their forearms ... 

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:37.900
 ... that left paleontologists confused 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.233
 about how I could fly or walk. 

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:47.600
 OPABINIA 

00:04:48.467 --> 00:04:51.067
 If an alien species once inhabited the Earth, 

00:04:51.067 --> 00:04:54.233
 it must have been the opabinia ... 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.633
 With a body that showed surreal characteristics 

00:04:57.633 --> 00:05:02.133
 like 5 eyes and a tentacle equipped with a claw ... 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.100
 ... the opabinia looks so strange that everyone laughed 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.767
 in the first presentation of the species. 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.367
 It is thought that the strange limb had been used 

00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:15.967
 to feed the mouth located under the head 

00:05:15.967 --> 00:05:17.733
 looking back 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.067
