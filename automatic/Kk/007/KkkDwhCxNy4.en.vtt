can make more money by separating all

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.390 
can make more money by separating all
your<00:00:09.269> different<00:00:09.480> types<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.750> wire<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.400> what

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
your different types of wire and what

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.730 
your different types of wire and what
you<00:00:11.460> need<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.730> do<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.269> process<00:00:13.230> your<00:00:13.349> wire<00:00:13.530> to

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
you need to do to process your wire to

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.849 
you need to do to process your wire to
make<00:00:13.860> more<00:00:14.210> these<00:00:15.210> are<00:00:15.330> my<00:00:15.900> findings<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.560> this

make more these are my findings and this
is<00:00:16.980> my<00:00:17.100> opinion

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
is my opinion

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.760 
is my opinion
everybody's<00:00:19.020> scrap<00:00:19.289> yards<00:00:19.529> gonna<00:00:19.680> be

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
everybody's scrap yards gonna be

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.650 
everybody's scrap yards gonna be
different<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.460> according<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.090> my<00:00:21.180> scrap<00:00:21.390> yard

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
different but according to my scrap yard

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.060 
different but according to my scrap yard
there's<00:00:21.810> some<00:00:21.900> things<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.230> need<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.619> if

I want to make more money so I'm going
to<00:00:24.210> show<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.590> what<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:26.160> my<00:00:26.220> wiring<00:00:26.490> so

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to show you what I do for my wiring so

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.730 
to show you what I do for my wiring so
basically<00:00:27.570> there's<00:00:28.080> all<00:00:28.199> kinds<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.470> examples

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
basically there's all kinds of examples

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.800 
basically there's all kinds of examples
here<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.039> wiring<00:00:29.279> all<00:00:30.269> different<00:00:30.539> types<00:00:30.660> of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
here of wiring all different types of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.170 
here of wiring all different types of
sizes<00:00:31.170> different<00:00:31.619> plugins<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.030> just

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
sizes different plugins and this is just

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.610 
sizes different plugins and this is just
your<00:00:33.270> basic<00:00:33.329> plugs<00:00:33.809> I'd<00:00:33.989> cut<00:00:34.200> those<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.469> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
your basic plugs I'd cut those up and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.600 
your basic plugs I'd cut those up and
throw<00:00:34.710> them<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:34.920> with<00:00:35.010> my<00:00:35.100> dirty<00:00:35.309> brass

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.650 

somewhere<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.730> has<00:00:38.850> Transformers<00:00:39.420> attached

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
somewhere in has Transformers attached

like this one knows I'm gonna want to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.229 
like this one knows I'm gonna want to
cut<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.940> off<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.360> then<00:00:43.230> cut<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> end

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
cut that off and then cut off the end

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.900 
cut that off and then cut off the end
very<00:00:45.239> important<00:00:45.719> always<00:00:45.930> check<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.260> hands

there<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.520> gold<00:00:50.760> plated<00:00:51.750> pins<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.440> some<00:00:52.620> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
there is gold plated pins and some of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.119 
there is gold plated pins and some of
the<00:00:52.800> connectors<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:54.020> if<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.260> my<00:00:55.920> yard

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the connectors so if there is my yard

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.470 
the connectors so if there is my yard
pays<00:00:56.370> me<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> dollar<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.820> pound<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.329> gold

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
pays me a dollar a pound for the gold

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.869 
pays me a dollar a pound for the gold
connectors<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.350> cut<00:00:58.859> those<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
connectors so I cut those off and I

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.720 
connectors so I cut those off and I
throw<00:01:00.090> them<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:01.050> bin<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.590> okay<00:01:02.399> that's

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
throw them in this bin here okay that's

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.119 
throw them in this bin here okay that's
my<00:01:02.850> gold<00:01:03.030> connectors<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.320> dirty

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
my gold connectors this here is dirty

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.770 
my gold connectors this here is dirty
brass<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.790> male<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.150> female<00:01:06.420> plugs<00:01:06.659> that

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
brass this is male and female plugs that

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.289 
brass this is male and female plugs that
are<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:07.110> gold<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:08.460> mess<00:01:08.610> will<00:01:08.729> show<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
are not gold the mess will show you this

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.810 
are not gold the mess will show you this
is<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.510> my<00:01:10.170> wire<00:01:10.350> that's<00:01:10.619> processed<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
is just my wire that's processed all the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.000 
is just my wire that's processed all the
plugs<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.150> cut<00:01:12.270> off<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.840> then<00:01:13.650> there's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> bin

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
plugs are cut off and then there's a bin

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.800 
plugs are cut off and then there's a bin
there<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.610> transformers<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.570> okay

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
there that has transformers of it okay

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.740 
there that has transformers of it okay
that's<00:01:16.140> how<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> separate<00:01:16.770> my<00:01:17.610> wiring<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.630> I'll

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
that's how I separate my wiring so I'll

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.740 
that's how I separate my wiring so I'll
go<00:01:18.900> through<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> lot<00:01:19.439> more<00:01:19.590> examples<00:01:19.710> here

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
go through a lot more examples here

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.280 
go through a lot more examples here
here's<00:01:21.750> another<00:01:22.340> larger<00:01:23.340> transformer<00:01:24.290> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
here's another larger transformer you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.140 
here's another larger transformer you
want<00:01:25.470> unplug<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.159> cutoff<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.790> course

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
want unplug the one in cutoff of course

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.990 
want unplug the one in cutoff of course
the<00:01:27.360> dirty<00:01:27.659> brass<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.369> some<00:01:29.790> wiring

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the dirty brass and then on some wiring

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.550 
the dirty brass and then on some wiring
you've<00:01:30.180> got<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.420> careful<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.750> use

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
you've got to be careful because use

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.149 
you've got to be careful because use
your<00:01:31.740> magnet

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
your magnet

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.649 
your magnet
there's<00:01:32.939> ferrite<00:01:33.329> encased<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.650> plastic

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
there's ferrite encased in the plastic

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.069 
there's ferrite encased in the plastic
on<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> wiring<00:01:36.960> itself<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.270> want<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.540> hear

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
on the wiring itself so you want to hear

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.420 
on the wiring itself so you want to hear
some<00:01:40.200> examples<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.710> want<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> cut<00:01:41.070> these<00:01:41.189> off

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
some examples you want to cut these off

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.940 
some examples you want to cut these off
because<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.390> my<00:01:42.540> yard<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:42.930> least<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.799> give

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
because of my yard at least they give

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.469 
because of my yard at least they give
you<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.100> lesser<00:01:44.369> price<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.909> keep<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> metal

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you a lesser price if you keep the metal

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.880 
you a lesser price if you keep the metal
attached<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> wire<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.560> want<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> cut

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
attached to the wire so you want to cut

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.020 
attached to the wire so you want to cut
these<00:01:47.009> off<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.399> throw<00:01:47.579> these<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.880> with

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
these off in the throw these in with

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.310 
these off in the throw these in with
your<00:01:48.149> steel<00:01:48.390> okay<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:51.450> there's<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.899> example

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
your steel okay so there's that example

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.830 
your steel okay so there's that example
and<00:01:53.130> then<00:01:53.280> here's<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.850> transformer<00:01:54.689> that's

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
and then here's a transformer that's

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.380 
and then here's a transformer that's
processed<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.820> these<00:01:56.820> are<00:01:56.939> about<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> pound

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
processed and these are about a pound

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.179 
processed and these are about a pound
apiece<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.899> believe<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.680> I've<00:01:58.829> got<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> lot<00:01:59.159> of

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
apiece I believe and I've got a lot of

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.310 
apiece I believe and I've got a lot of
these<00:01:59.540> scrap<00:02:00.540> yards<00:02:00.750> will<00:02:00.840> pay<00:02:00.930> different

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
these scrap yards will pay different

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.620 
these scrap yards will pay different
prices<00:02:01.520> for<00:02:02.520> these<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.790> think<00:02:02.969> mine<00:02:03.240> only<00:02:03.420> pays

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
prices for these I think mine only pays

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.990 
prices for these I think mine only pays
like<00:02:03.840> nine<00:02:04.049> cents<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.350> pound<00:02:04.469> for<00:02:04.740> these<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.759> I

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
like nine cents a pound for these so I

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.490 
like nine cents a pound for these so I
mean<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.299> wanted<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.689> could<00:02:06.869> open<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.290> up

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
mean if I wanted to I could open that up

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.229 
mean if I wanted to I could open that up
with<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> hammer<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.520> pull<00:02:09.060> out<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
with a hammer and pull out the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.420 
with a hammer and pull out the
transformer<00:02:10.050> itself<00:02:10.170> then<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.190> would<00:02:11.310> get

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
transformer itself then that would get

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.510 
transformer itself then that would get
me<00:02:11.550> about<00:02:11.959> fourteen<00:02:12.959> fifteen<00:02:13.230> cents<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.500> pound

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
me about fourteen fifteen cents a pound

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.160 
me about fourteen fifteen cents a pound
is<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.880> worth<00:02:14.970> my<00:02:15.120> time<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.630> don't<00:02:15.870> know<00:02:15.960> I've

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
is it worth my time I don't know I've

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.510 
is it worth my time I don't know I've
got<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> lot<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.500> these<00:02:16.680> I'll<00:02:17.040> make<00:02:17.430> that

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
got a lot of these I'll make that

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.710 
got a lot of these I'll make that
decision<00:02:17.640> later<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.780> wasn't<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.770> again

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
decision later so that wasn't that again

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.740 
decision later so that wasn't that again
here's<00:02:21.720> another<00:02:21.900> example<00:02:22.310> computer<00:02:23.310> cords

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
here's another example computer cords

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.000 
here's another example computer cords
these<00:02:24.750> are<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> little<00:02:25.050> heavier<00:02:25.290> we<00:02:25.710> got<00:02:25.860> some

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
these are a little heavier we got some

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.040 
these are a little heavier we got some
metal<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.280> them<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:26.720> they're<00:02:27.720> still<00:02:27.750> buy<00:02:27.990> them

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
metal in them but they're still buy them

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.300 
metal in them but they're still buy them
for<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.260> dollar<00:02:28.320> pound<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:28.920> cut<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.160> off

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
for a dollar pound you just cut it off

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.060 
for a dollar pound you just cut it off
because<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.730> got<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.940> gold<00:02:30.090> pins<00:02:31.070> again

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
because it's got the gold pins again

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.620 
because it's got the gold pins again
another<00:02:32.520> example<00:02:32.910> is<00:02:33.120> all<00:02:33.300> kinds<00:02:33.570> of

want to strip some of this stuff I'm not

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.660 
want to strip some of this stuff I'm not
going<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.590> tell<00:03:34.710> you<00:03:34.830> that<00:03:34.980> it's<00:03:35.130> you<00:03:35.640> know

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
worth your time you have to determine

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.510 
worth your time you have to determine
that<00:03:36.960> yourself<00:03:37.350> some<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.190> stuff<00:03:38.370> like

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
that yourself some of this stuff like

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.550 
that yourself some of this stuff like
this<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.760> will<00:03:38.970> strip<00:03:41.240> another<00:03:42.240> core<00:03:42.510> that's<00:03:43.440> a

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
this I will strip another core that's a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.980 
this I will strip another core that's a
funky<00:03:43.920> end<00:03:44.100> but<00:03:44.340> again<00:03:44.670> that<00:03:45.450> one's<00:03:45.600> not<00:03:45.720> gold

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
funky end but again that one's not gold

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.370 
funky end but again that one's not gold
so<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.410> goes<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.680> with<00:03:46.800> my<00:03:46.890> dirty<00:03:47.010> brass

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
so that this goes in with my dirty brass

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.870 
so that this goes in with my dirty brass
phone<00:03:49.380> connectors<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:50.190> get<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.550> lot<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.730> this

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
phone connectors I get a lot of this

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.730 
phone connectors I get a lot of this
phone<00:03:51.030> line<00:03:51.240> they<00:03:52.110> have<00:03:52.200> gold<00:03:52.380> pins<00:03:52.560> in<00:03:52.680> the

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
phone line they have gold pins in the

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.630 
phone line they have gold pins in the
end<00:03:52.860> so<00:03:53.070> cut<00:03:53.220> those<00:03:53.400> off<00:03:54.950> again<00:03:55.950> some<00:03:56.520> of<00:03:56.550> this

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
end so cut those off again some of this

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.950 
end so cut those off again some of this
is<00:03:56.790> new<00:03:57.060> same<00:03:57.600> thing<00:03:57.810> old<00:03:58.080> pins<00:03:59.960> sometimes

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.230 
is new same thing old pins sometimes
this<00:04:01.410> one's<00:04:01.590> not<00:04:01.800> but<00:04:02.580> sometimes<00:04:02.760> even<00:04:03.030> these

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
this one's not but sometimes even these

this one's not but sometimes even these
type<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.570> connectors<00:04:03.930> have<00:04:04.650> gold<00:04:04.920> on<00:04:05.070> them<00:04:05.220> but

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
type of connectors have gold on them but

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.370 
type of connectors have gold on them but
a<00:04:06.000> lot<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.240> times<00:04:06.360> they<00:04:06.510> don't<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.230> got<00:04:07.350> a

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
a lot of times they don't so you got a

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.550 
a lot of times they don't so you got a

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
scrapping them sometimes the wires

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.819 
scrapping them sometimes the wires
aluminum<00:04:15.770> this<00:04:16.310> one<00:04:16.519> is<00:04:16.669> aluminum<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:18.109> this

one's<00:04:22.010> copper<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:22.850> this<00:04:23.300> type<00:04:23.510> of<00:04:23.540> wire<00:04:23.780> I

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
one's copper so this type of wire I

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.409 
one's copper so this type of wire I
always<00:04:24.139> strip<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:25.370> aluminum<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.820> do<00:04:25.880> too

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
always strip the aluminum I do too

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.300 
always strip the aluminum I do too
there's<00:04:26.960> not<00:04:27.080> much<00:04:27.230> money<00:04:27.410> in<00:04:27.560> aluminum<00:04:27.919> wire

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
there's not much money in aluminum wire

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.400 
there's not much money in aluminum wire
I<00:04:28.340> mean<00:04:28.760> strip<00:04:29.240> when<00:04:29.840> you<00:04:29.930> you<00:04:30.230> know<00:04:30.350> start

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
I mean strip when you you know start

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.600 
I mean strip when you you know start
comparing<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.980> weights<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.340> stuff<00:04:31.430> like

comparing the weights and stuff like

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.150 
comparing the weights and stuff like
that<00:04:31.820> but<00:04:32.030> it's<00:04:32.270> up<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.540> you<00:04:32.630> again<00:04:33.160> romex

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
that but it's up to you again romex

I<00:04:34.790> always<00:04:35.330> strip<00:04:35.870> romex<00:04:36.169> okay<00:04:36.770> it<00:04:37.400> can<00:04:37.550> be<00:04:37.639> a

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
I always strip romex okay it can be a

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.940 
I always strip romex okay it can be a
pain<00:04:37.940> but<00:04:38.810> there's<00:04:38.990> always<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.230> you<00:04:39.590> know<00:04:39.710> not

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
pain but there's always a you know not

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.620 
pain but there's always a you know not
always<00:04:40.160> I<00:04:40.370> guess<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:40.730> sometimes<00:04:41.330> there's

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
always I guess but sometimes there's

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.750 
always I guess but sometimes there's
like<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.810> bear<00:04:42.020> piece<00:04:42.200> already<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:43.220> then<00:04:43.430> like

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
like a bear piece already and then like

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.190 
like a bear piece already and then like
in<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:43.970> ones<00:04:44.180> case<00:04:44.419> which<00:04:44.780> is<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:44.900> smaller

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
in this ones case which is a smaller

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.170 
in this ones case which is a smaller
gauge<00:04:45.470> but<00:04:46.310> I'll<00:04:46.400> have<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.550> go<00:04:46.669> through<00:04:46.970> and

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
gauge but I'll have to go through and

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.570 
gauge but I'll have to go through and
strip<00:04:47.930> these<00:04:48.050> individually<00:04:48.560> but<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.490> gives

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
strip these individually but that gives

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.180 
strip these individually but that gives
you<00:04:49.729> a<00:04:49.760> nice<00:04:49.880> piece<00:04:50.120> of<00:04:50.180> wire<00:04:50.389> like<00:04:50.540> that<00:04:51.190> and

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
you a nice piece of wire like that and

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.060 
you a nice piece of wire like that and
in<00:04:52.460> turn<00:04:52.990> that<00:04:53.990> stuff<00:04:54.169> adds<00:04:54.350> up<00:04:56.229> because<00:04:57.229> I<00:04:57.770> can

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
in turn that stuff adds up because I can

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.190 
in turn that stuff adds up because I can
grab<00:04:58.340> it<00:04:58.370> here<00:04:58.669> for<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.090> video<00:04:59.180> end<00:05:00.020> up<00:05:00.110> of

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
grab it here for the video end up of

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
grab it here for the video end up of
this<00:05:00.669> okay<00:05:01.700> let's<00:05:02.330> weigh<00:05:02.450> it<00:05:03.010> see<00:05:04.010> how<00:05:04.100> much

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
this okay let's weigh it see how much

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.950 
this okay let's weigh it see how much
it's<00:05:04.400> worth

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
it's worth

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.360 
it's worth
so<00:05:05.960> I<00:05:05.990> can<00:05:06.229> go<00:05:06.350> from<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.800> dollar<00:05:07.040> a<00:05:07.160> pound

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
so I can go from a dollar a pound

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.330 
so I can go from a dollar a pound
unstriped<00:05:08.090> to<00:05:08.750> three<00:05:09.440> or<00:05:09.590> over<00:05:09.889> three<00:05:10.100> dollars

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
unstriped to three or over three dollars

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
unstriped to three or over three dollars
I<00:05:10.460> think<00:05:10.610> it's<00:05:10.700> a<00:05:10.760> little<00:05:10.940> over<00:05:11.090> three<00:05:11.240> dollars

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
I think it's a little over three dollars

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.469 
I think it's a little over three dollars
right<00:05:11.630> now<00:05:11.979> so<00:05:12.979> this<00:05:13.130> that<00:05:13.310> ball<00:05:13.520> is<00:05:13.850> four

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
right now so this that ball is four

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.040 
right now so this that ball is four
pounds<00:05:14.990> four<00:05:15.169> ounces<00:05:15.200> so<00:05:15.940> that's<00:05:16.940> over<00:05:17.390> let's

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
pounds four ounces so that's over let's

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.330 
pounds four ounces so that's over let's

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
see well as I say in three that's about

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.480 
see well as I say in three that's about
1213<00:05:19.970> dollars<00:05:20.270> for<00:05:20.630> this<00:05:20.720> pile<00:05:21.500> here<00:05:21.770> okay

stuff out or cut off the end I get 50

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.300 
stuff out or cut off the end I get 50
cents<00:06:39.720> a<00:06:39.780> pound<00:06:39.900> if<00:06:40.590> I<00:06:40.740> cut<00:06:40.890> everything<00:06:41.100> off

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
cents a pound if I cut everything off

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.390 
cents a pound if I cut everything off
and<00:06:41.610> it's<00:06:41.730> this<00:06:41.940> regular<00:06:42.300> cord<00:06:42.810> I<00:06:43.650> get<00:06:44.070> a

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
and it's this regular cord I get a

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.240 
and it's this regular cord I get a
dollar<00:06:44.970> pound<00:06:45.270> so<00:06:46.140> and<00:06:46.500> I<00:06:46.620> guess<00:06:46.800> there's<00:06:47.010> one

the brass out of that end because it's

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.860 
the brass out of that end because it's
fairly<00:07:16.560> heavy<00:07:16.860> and<00:07:17.100> I<00:07:17.850> will<00:07:18.240> cut<00:07:18.600> all<00:07:18.780> this

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
fairly heavy and I will cut all this

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.770 
fairly heavy and I will cut all this
open<00:07:19.230> and<00:07:19.560> this<00:07:20.040> type<00:07:20.220> of<00:07:20.250> wire<00:07:20.460> gauge<00:07:21.090> good

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 
open and this type of wire gauge good

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.440 
open and this type of wire gauge good
copper<00:07:22.170> there<00:07:22.320> so<00:07:23.100> I<00:07:23.130> will<00:07:23.430> take<00:07:23.760> the<00:07:23.910> time<00:07:24.090> to

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:24.450 
copper there so I will take the time to

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.270 
copper there so I will take the time to
strip<00:07:25.200> this<00:07:25.350> wire<00:07:27.650> and<00:07:28.650> that's<00:07:28.980> about<00:07:29.130> it

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280

some other romex and then there's bear

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.830 
some other romex and then there's bear
bright<00:07:37.440> in<00:07:37.650> here<00:07:37.680> and<00:07:38.070> a<00:07:38.940> couple<00:07:39.630> of<00:07:39.750> heat

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 
bright in here and a couple of heat

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.950 
bright in here and a couple of heat
sinks<00:07:40.340> there's<00:07:41.340> a<00:07:41.430> nice<00:07:41.580> board<00:07:41.910> of<00:07:42.090> some<00:07:42.810> nice

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 
sinks there's a nice board of some nice

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.100 
sinks there's a nice board of some nice
copper<00:07:43.770> heat<00:07:43.950> sinks<00:07:44.280> that<00:07:44.400> I've<00:07:44.490> separated

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.110 
copper heat sinks that I've separated

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.690 
copper heat sinks that I've separated
but<00:07:46.110> anyway<00:07:46.320> this<00:07:46.590> stuff<00:07:46.830> really<00:07:47.280> can<00:07:47.430> add<00:07:47.550> up

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:47.700 
but anyway this stuff really can add up

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.850 
but anyway this stuff really can add up
so<00:07:48.090> you<00:07:48.930> know<00:07:49.020> I've<00:07:49.140> got<00:07:49.260> a<00:07:49.290> lot<00:07:49.410> of<00:07:49.470> wiring<00:07:49.770> to

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 
so you know I've got a lot of wiring to

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.960 
so you know I've got a lot of wiring to
go<00:07:49.950> through<00:07:50.160> but<00:07:50.310> it's<00:07:50.520> definitely<00:07:50.610> worth<00:07:50.850> the

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:50.970 
go through but it's definitely worth the

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.540 
go through but it's definitely worth the
time<00:07:51.120> to<00:07:51.390> cut<00:07:52.050> everything<00:07:52.290> apart<00:07:52.590> and<00:07:52.800> you'll

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:53.550 
time to cut everything apart and you'll

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.210 
time to cut everything apart and you'll
make<00:07:53.700> more<00:07:53.820> money<00:07:53.880> so<00:07:54.690> I<00:07:54.900> hope<00:07:55.050> you<00:07:55.140> guys<00:07:55.230> got
