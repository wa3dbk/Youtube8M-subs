00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
to that nearest group member which which

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.980 
to that nearest group member which which
may<00:01:55.880> put<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:56.150> at<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.390> waste<00:01:56.540> Rhine<00:01:56.780> just

Dragon Knight fire staff built but you

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.300 
Dragon Knight fire staff built but you
weren't<00:05:26.910> heavy<00:05:27.120> armor<00:05:27.860> so<00:05:28.860> it's<00:05:28.980> kind<00:05:29.160> of<00:05:29.190> an

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
weren't heavy armor so it's kind of an

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.950 
weren't heavy armor so it's kind of an
unusual<00:05:29.430> combination<00:05:30.000> right<00:05:30.570> there<00:05:30.630> isn't

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
unusual combination right there isn't

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.960 
unusual combination right there isn't
really<00:05:31.080> an<00:05:31.260> archetype<00:05:31.680> that<00:05:31.710> that<00:05:32.220> fits<00:05:32.790> with

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
really an archetype that that fits with

purse a little mage it's a little battle
mage<00:05:36.170> so<00:05:37.170> and<00:05:37.470> it's<00:05:37.980> just<00:05:38.220> something<00:05:38.460> that

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
mage so and it's just something that

people<00:05:38.820> found<00:05:39.030> on<00:05:39.150> their<00:05:39.270> own<00:05:39.420> it<00:05:39.630> wasn't

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
people found on their own it wasn't

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.010 
people found on their own it wasn't
necessarily<00:05:40.500> something<00:05:40.830> we<00:05:41.480> we<00:05:42.480> built<00:05:42.900> the

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
necessarily something we we built the

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.990 
necessarily something we we built the
game<00:05:43.230> around<00:05:43.740> it<00:05:44.100> was<00:05:44.280> it<00:05:44.460> was<00:05:44.670> a<00:05:44.700> bill<00:05:44.880> that

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
game around it was it was a bill that

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.370 
game around it was it was a bill that
emerged<00:05:45.270> naturally<00:05:45.690> when<00:05:45.840> people<00:05:46.080> sort<00:05:46.290> of

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
emerged naturally when people sort of

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.250 
emerged naturally when people sort of
found<00:05:46.710> this<00:05:46.830> energy<00:05:47.190> between<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:48.630> fire<00:05:49.020> staff

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
found this energy between the fire staff

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.720 
found this energy between the fire staff
and<00:05:49.710> some<00:05:49.830> of<00:05:49.920> the<00:05:49.980> Dragon<00:05:50.250> Knight<00:05:50.280> abilities
