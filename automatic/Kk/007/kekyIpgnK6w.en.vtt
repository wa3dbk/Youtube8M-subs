when they've gone through a certificated

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270 
when they've gone through a certificated
course<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.380> learnt<00:01:07.740> all<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> elements

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
that they need to to actually be

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.680 
that they need to to actually be
qualified<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.979> then<00:01:11.580> get<00:01:11.940> what<00:01:12.300> i<00:01:12.330> call<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
icing on the cake really to learn some

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.790 
icing on the cake really to learn some
new<00:01:15.210> skills<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.869> learn<00:01:15.990> things<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.500> aren't

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
new skills to learn things that aren't

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.020 
new skills to learn things that aren't
absolutely<00:01:16.920> essential<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
absolutely essential for the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.670 
absolutely essential for the
qualification<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.869> actually<00:01:19.229> moves<00:01:19.409> them

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
qualification that actually moves them

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.170 
qualification that actually moves them
forward<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.550> just<00:01:20.729> get<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:20.940> into<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
forward and just get them into the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.690 
forward and just get them into the
pattern<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.630> further<00:01:22.229> learning<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.100> not<00:01:23.520> just

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
pattern of further learning and not just

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.910 
pattern of further learning and not just
accepting<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.450> once<00:01:24.690> they<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.200> got<00:01:25.740> their

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
accepting that once they have got their

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.710 
accepting that once they have got their
qualifications<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.000> are<00:01:27.119> classed<00:01:27.509> as

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
qualifications and they are classed as

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.570 
qualifications and they are classed as
qualified<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.440> there<00:01:28.590> isn't<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.430> learn

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
qualified that there isn't more to learn

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.060 
qualified that there isn't more to learn
I<00:01:29.640> think<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.149> really<00:01:30.500> important<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.770> they

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
I think it's really important that they

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.680 
I think it's really important that they
realize<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.550> we're<00:01:33.000> learning<00:01:33.179> all<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.660> time

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
realize that we're learning all the time

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.719 
realize that we're learning all the time
in<00:01:34.080> our<00:01:34.200> industry<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:34.950> keep<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.310> industry

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
in our industry and to keep the industry

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.609 
in our industry and to keep the industry
buoyant<00:01:36.119> that's<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.050> we<00:01:37.170> need<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.470> keep

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
buoyant that's what we need to keep

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.270 
buoyant that's what we need to keep
moving<00:01:37.800> it<00:01:38.070> forward

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.590 

now<00:01:44.760> I'm<00:01:44.909> gonna<00:01:45.030> start<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> decorative

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
now I'm gonna start with a decorative

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.520 
now I'm gonna start with a decorative
arrangement<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> would<00:01:47.760> probably<00:01:48.060> know

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
arrangement now you would probably know

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.930 
arrangement now you would probably know
decorative<00:01:49.530> arrangements<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.250> very<00:01:50.670> well

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
decorative arrangements be very well

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.730 
decorative arrangements be very well
because<00:01:51.330> they're<00:01:51.510> probably<00:01:51.750> ninety<00:01:52.560> percent

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
because they're probably ninety percent

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.550 
because they're probably ninety percent
at<00:01:53.729> least<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> arrangements<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.350> do

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
at least of the arrangements that we do

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.649 
at least of the arrangements that we do
will<00:01:56.009> fall<00:01:56.250> into<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> decorative<00:01:56.850> category

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
will fall into the decorative category

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.510 
will fall into the decorative category
when<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> first<00:01:58.350> trained<00:01:58.770> everything<00:01:59.369> was<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
when I first trained everything was a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.889 
when I first trained everything was a
little<00:01:59.820> bit<00:01:59.909> above<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.300> container<00:02:00.690> because

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
little bit above the container because

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.350 
little bit above the container because
we<00:02:01.080> were<00:02:01.140> almost<00:02:01.320> always<00:02:01.619> doing<00:02:02.220> triangles<00:02:02.850> so

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
we were almost always doing triangles so

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.300 
we were almost always doing triangles so
we're<00:02:03.509> always<00:02:03.659> having<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.050> go<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.530> at<00:02:05.130> this

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
we're always having to go in at this

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.950 
we're always having to go in at this
angle<00:02:05.369> where<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> lot<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
angle where with a lot of the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.529 
angle where with a lot of the
continental<00:02:07.649> design<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.850> about<00:02:09.270> how

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
continental design it's about how

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.690 
continental design it's about how
flowers<00:02:10.140> grow<00:02:10.500> where<00:02:10.800> they<00:02:10.950> strive<00:02:11.250> from<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
flowers grow where they strive from and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.790 
flowers grow where they strive from and
they<00:02:11.760> show<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> stems<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.569> lot<00:02:12.720> more<00:02:12.930> which<00:02:13.560> we

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
they show the stems a lot more which we

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320 
they show the stems a lot more which we

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
arrangement that I've done through the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.500 
arrangement that I've done through the
college<00:02:28.230> syllabus<00:02:28.739> we<00:02:29.250> learn<00:02:29.459> certain<00:02:29.850> styles

of decorative arrangement which are very

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.400 
of decorative arrangement which are very
much<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.550> English<00:02:32.880> style<00:02:33.150> with<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.780> poses

and the triangular arrangements and the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.420 
and the triangular arrangements and the
parallel<00:02:36.810> designs<00:02:37.290> what<00:02:38.010> I've<00:02:38.130> done<00:02:38.280> is

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
parallel designs what I've done is

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.130 
parallel designs what I've done is
brought<00:02:38.640> along<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.030> Scandinavian<00:02:39.930> design

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
brought along a Scandinavian design

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.470 
brought along a Scandinavian design
which<00:02:40.650> still<00:02:40.920> fits<00:02:41.160> into<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.670> category<00:02:41.700> but

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
which still fits into that category but

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.259 
which still fits into that category but
it's<00:02:42.900> very<00:02:43.050> alien<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.709> us<00:02:44.310> as<00:02:44.670> florists<00:02:45.060> when

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
it's very alien to us as florists when

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.030 
it's very alien to us as florists when
we've<00:02:45.420> learnt<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.200> sort<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.440> classic<00:02:46.680> English

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
we've learnt the sort of classic English

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.710 
we've learnt the sort of classic English
style<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.700> floristry<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.299> it's<00:02:48.420> been<00:02:48.570> really

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
style of floristry and it's been really

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.449 
style of floristry and it's been really
interesting<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.440> see<00:02:49.620> how<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.890> students<00:02:50.400> of

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
interesting to see how the students of

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.940 
interesting to see how the students of
Justin<00:02:50.820> grace<00:02:51.090> nap<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.720> sort<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.560> run<00:02:52.769> with

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
Justin grace nap and sort of run with

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.740 
Justin grace nap and sort of run with
the<00:02:53.070> idea<00:02:53.430> really<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.060> had<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.299> go<00:02:54.450> at<00:02:54.600> it

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the idea really and had to go at it

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.569 
the idea really and had to go at it
because<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.560> know<00:02:55.680> looking<00:02:56.040> at<00:02:56.160> their<00:02:56.340> faces

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
because you know looking at their faces

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.520 
because you know looking at their faces
as<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.000> was<00:02:57.150> presenting<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.870> they<00:02:58.019> were<00:02:58.079> kind<00:02:58.410> of

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
as I was presenting it they were kind of

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.710 
as I was presenting it they were kind of
not<00:02:58.739> sure<00:02:59.040> about<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.880> think<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.630> a

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
not sure about it and I think it's a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.090 
not sure about it and I think it's a
good<00:03:00.900> thing<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.410> show<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.739> there's

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
good thing to just show that there's

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.710 
good thing to just show that there's
something<00:03:02.310> completely<00:03:03.060> different<00:03:03.269> out<00:03:03.690> there

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
something completely different out there

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.449 
something completely different out there
that<00:03:04.079> still<00:03:04.170> fits<00:03:04.530> within<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.890> rules<00:03:05.190> that

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
that still fits within the rules that

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.000 
that still fits within the rules that
we've<00:03:05.640> learnt<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.299> we<00:03:06.420> understand<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:07.320> but

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
we've learnt and we understand that but

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.530 
we've learnt and we understand that but
that's<00:03:08.190> come<00:03:08.489> from<00:03:08.519> another<00:03:08.910> country<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.420> I'm

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
that's come from another country and I'm

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.180 
that's come from another country and I'm
really<00:03:09.720> trying<00:03:10.079> to<00:03:10.140> encourage<00:03:10.470> them<00:03:10.799> then<00:03:11.010> to

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
really trying to encourage them then to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.160 
really trying to encourage them then to
attend<00:03:11.549> demonstrations<00:03:12.360> from<00:03:12.690> other

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
attend demonstrations from other

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.080 
attend demonstrations from other
designers<00:03:13.859> coming<00:03:14.070> from<00:03:14.280> other<00:03:14.400> countries<00:03:14.670> as

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
designers coming from other countries as

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.840 
designers coming from other countries as
well<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.380> European<00:03:16.920> style<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.370> floristry

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
well and the European style of floristry

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.690 
well and the European style of floristry
it's<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.690> very<00:03:18.900> dynamic<00:03:19.170> thing<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.980> do<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.489> cross

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
it's a very dynamic thing to do to cross

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.870 
it's a very dynamic thing to do to cross
stems<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.810> opens<00:03:22.200> up<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.769> whole<00:03:23.160> new<00:03:23.459> area

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
stems so it opens up a whole new area

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.430 
stems so it opens up a whole new area
and<00:03:25.730> because<00:03:26.730> line<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.269> very<00:03:27.450> important<00:03:28.170> to

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
and because line is very important to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.690 
and because line is very important to
the<00:03:28.980> European<00:03:29.519> style<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:30.030> floristry<00:03:31.100> but<00:03:32.100> with

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
the European style of floristry but with

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.150 
the European style of floristry but with
the<00:03:32.880> stems<00:03:33.570> crossing<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.320> can<00:03:34.440> see<00:03:34.680> I've<00:03:34.920> left

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
the stems crossing you can see I've left

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.500 
the stems crossing you can see I've left
the<00:03:35.310> leaves<00:03:35.489> aren't<00:03:35.730> just<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.060> take<00:03:36.269> them<00:03:36.450> off

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
the leaves aren't just to take them off

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.190 
the leaves aren't just to take them off
to<00:03:36.720> show<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:36.989> it's<00:03:37.680> far<00:03:37.890> more<00:03:37.950> dynamic

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
to show you it's far more dynamic

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.070 
to show you it's far more dynamic
if<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:40.040> see<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.580> see<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.000> lines<00:03:41.360> crossing<00:03:41.780> if

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
if you see the see the lines crossing if

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.150 
if you see the see the lines crossing if
you've<00:03:42.230> got<00:03:42.410> something<00:03:42.650> in<00:03:42.800> there<00:03:43.010> that's

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
you've got something in there that's

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.270 
you've got something in there that's
making<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.610> fuzzy<00:03:43.940> actually<00:03:44.420> doesn't<00:03:44.720> work

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
making it fuzzy actually doesn't work

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.830 
making it fuzzy actually doesn't work
often<00:03:46.280> when<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:46.610> once<00:03:46.910> you've<00:03:47.120> left<00:03:47.360> college

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
often when you once you've left college

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.699 
often when you once you've left college
and<00:03:48.080> you<00:03:48.830> sort<00:03:49.310> of<00:03:49.430> out<00:03:49.550> in<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:49.879> workplace<00:03:50.709> to

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
and you sort of out in the workplace to

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.830 
and you sort of out in the workplace to
take<00:03:51.980> days<00:03:52.220> out<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.610> go<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.120> do<00:03:53.239> training<00:03:53.720> or

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
take days out to go and do training or

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.960 
take days out to go and do training or
weeks<00:03:54.110> out<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.620> do<00:03:54.709> training<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.550> just<00:03:55.790> can't

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
weeks out to do training you just can't

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.720 
weeks out to do training you just can't

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
and say particularly it's interesting to

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.660 
and say particularly it's interesting to
see<00:04:08.810> them<00:04:08.989> from<00:04:09.170> other<00:04:09.319> countries<00:04:09.670> because

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
see them from other countries because

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.930 
see them from other countries because
you<00:04:10.790> do<00:04:10.940> just<00:04:11.330> sort<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:11.900> see<00:04:12.489> what's<00:04:13.489> out<00:04:13.730> there

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940

thing over here I think it's important

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.080 
thing over here I think it's important
to<00:04:18.320> teach<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.739> students<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:19.280> that<00:04:20.000> you
