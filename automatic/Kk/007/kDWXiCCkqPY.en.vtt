00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
what his title would be and I called him

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.190

because<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.380> is<00:03:28.500> essentially<00:03:29.010> what<00:03:29.040> this

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
because that is essentially what this

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.979 
because that is essentially what this
person<00:03:29.640> was<00:03:29.790> was<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.989> talker<00:03:31.370> but<00:03:32.989> then
