00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
 this fine pdp gene I can't go 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.269
 too down because under ortigiana illness 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.370
 good morning 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.509
 today I wore it for the first time 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.250
 this note dc inside and notice 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.730
 to the talk that is why I want a video 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.590
 short I did an inspired eye makeup 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.019
 agile or in shades of gray or 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.460
 used this for the first time 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.220
 palette that was given to me at 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.360
 birthday and it's a little chanel 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.180
 four colors is called 208 tysse 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.399
 gabrielli and I wanted to do precisely 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.739
 a gray make-up inspired by this vest 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.570
 dark gray that's why then I'll put it 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.149
 under the black shirt I'll put those 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.469
 black pants the boots then the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.739
 around I could around the tones of the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.300
 gray and black 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.309
 this is the result you will now see later 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.239
 which products or used for 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.500
 I wanted to say just one thing to make it happen 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.850
 buy it or not buy it now 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.829
 for me it was a gift and it was a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.690
 very welcome gift I did not use 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.670
 so far because I accumulate so much stuff 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.650
 They are now in place and for a while 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.020
 but nothing however accumulated so much 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.270
 stuff that in the end I have this box of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.979
 products to be tested and this remained in 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.500
 not that I had forgotten it 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.600
 proceeds to say that I have many facets 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.610
 I do morning and hardly makeup 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.970
 very eyes in the morning here maybe 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.590
 I put more obvious lipstick but 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.150
 the most neutral eye to go to work 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.189
 so this remained a little way back to 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.860
 a doubt about this my hair 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.140
 end of the video you will see therefore not the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.210
 I would buy back to us because I am 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.520
 very expensive these chanel pallets but 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.840
 if I were you, I'd give it to you, I'd do it 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.350
 give because they are very chic anyway 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.210
 they come in short with this sachet of 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.790
 velvet with login or chanel here since 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.920
 give away are delicious should 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.720
 buy it alone and when you have it up 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.100
 bigger palettes than in short 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.930
 same price take one 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.299
 bigger but here is the result 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.460
 it is very nice and to give as a gift 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.450
 in my opinion, receiving is very much 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.989
 very very little boxes I leave you with 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.630
 tutorial to the facet of the day in the 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.100
 infobox you will also see the link for this 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.330
 you probably see the giretti name 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.270
 also in another video that I do as I do 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.190
 I would be greeting you for now I do not give 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.690
 peace this hair dried triangle 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.350
 I remain so and see you soon already c 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.390
 then the base has already been done 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.730
 start with the descend on the whole 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.459
 eyelid a neutral color I will opt for 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.650
 this because I complained in one of the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.230
 latest videos saying that once put 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.540
 the base was very difficult 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.300
 blend its pro with the name eye shadows on 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.610
 primer especially and now action 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.280
 he said put a neutral base below in 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.620
 so that the eyeshadows slip better 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.010
 who seems an honestly very idea 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.989
 smart and so I'm putting this base 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.500
 with them basically meat from the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.690
 slick 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.030
 the tram awaited all the eyelid and blackberry 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.380
 the chanel stick is called tease e 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.359
 gabrielle and from these four colors but 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.170
 probably we see already made to see 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:18.630
 in the whole here they are here beginning with the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.440
 century spread the white over the whole 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.780
 eyelid wants is not seen so much is 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.239
 lying white I go to get this choir 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.430
 in the corner that looks like a purplish and it 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.070
 I put on the outside of the eyelid 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.989
 mobile that have it towards the inside and 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.760
 a smokey that I don't want to do too much 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.859
 too obvious because yes these 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.900
 they are evening colors and I'm putting them on 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.000
 afternoon I then take the gray more 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.920
 clear day 2 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.290
 this is in use to fade and give a little 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.959
 by definition at the corner this one 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.299
 to the v of the eye we say with them 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.910
 of the gaps in supplied I take the 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.359
 I go to make a darker color 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.340
 more defined and faded into the same color 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.690
 the darker I used it below 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.880
 now I go on with pencils 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.340
 design eyes design eye pencil by 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.320
 collistar inside the eye and the 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.350
 shaun powder of the urban decay above 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.360
 a little elongated and how I wanted to say that 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.510
 I use two pencils and not just one 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.709
 because the perverse lasts a long time 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.570
 applied to the outside of the eye 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.390
 goes to mass burns to death inside 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.890
 just once I made the mistake myself 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.660
 I'm all telling the lenses I was around 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.370
 instead they burned me to death 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.070
 harshly this rich of saturated better 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.100
 inside and not outside continues 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.930
 now with the mascara I warmly urge you 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:41.590
 to have taken I had taken and it is the 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:46.840
 burden of face and eyes 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.090
 we finished having a nice makeup 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.100
 intense on the eyes I will be neutral on 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.240
 lips with a transparent gloss this e 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.240
 the one with the argan of collistar 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.970
 then we have a problem because these 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.780
 hair in my opinion are to be ticked a 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.840
 little bit because they dry me like this 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.100
 see you at dinner time are over 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.510
 as big as the hat once was 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:24.010
 attached to the gloss no expert all 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.230
 according to you, I could make you climb it 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.040
 a little bit above, however, the look is 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.080
 finished obviously you could 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.120
 step up so as to hold more more 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.730
 I like it lightly because in short it is 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.110
 late afternoon so good for 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.400
 for the evening 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.100
 I really like make-up eyes 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.680
 so with these I have to add some 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.680
 rectine juice then in the corner 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.370
 I really like make-up eyes 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:54.550
 so a little black cat over black 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.040
 inside shaded around and one is a look 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.020
 I like it anyway we won it 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.460
 let me know how you solve 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.530
 this hair problem comes my way 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.080
 dried up triangle you have to show us again 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:09.340
 to make you understand the trick today 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.050
 as I said in the whole inspired state 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.190
 from this giretti know 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:17.590
 I put you in excess I put the favorite 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.680
 to consider that those who therefore there 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:24.960
 I put the link in the info box and we will 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.960
 See you at the next trick is
