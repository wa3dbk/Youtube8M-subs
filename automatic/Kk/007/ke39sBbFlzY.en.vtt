destructive<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.770> guess<00:02:48.230> abilities<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.770> if

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
destructive I guess abilities and if

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.040 
destructive I guess abilities and if
that's<00:02:50.130> not<00:02:50.310> cool<00:02:50.640> down<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:51.120> mean<00:02:51.690> off<00:02:51.810> cooldown
