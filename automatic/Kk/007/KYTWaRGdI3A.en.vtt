00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello tankers with you suspense today 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.410
 I want to show a good fight again on 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.299
 top average British fv 4202 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.859
 the battle is interesting just because in this battle 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.609
 manage to use such advantages 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.800
 This tank as a good speaker 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.230
 excellent tool declination angles and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.230
 pretty impenetrable and ricochet 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 tower in general many confuse the dynamics and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.899
 maximum speed are different things 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.079
 maximum speed is that speed 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.600
 which tank which tank is gaining with 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.460
 slides and rides that is roughly speaking 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.170
 how fast can he move 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.160
 from point A to point B and the dynamics of it 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.770
 feature that shows 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.500
 how maneuverable he is how fast 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.730
 he picks up his cruising speed and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 how fast can he 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.170
 roll forward back left right 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.449
 change position turn like this 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.190
 once a briton is one of the most 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.880
 dynamic tanks in the game he is small 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.560
 light and the motor is pretty powerful 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.979
 Well, everything starts as standard and 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.130
 medium tanks go to the bridge heavy tank 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.380
 go into town there are also nursery rhymes 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.180
 take up positions to shoot 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.670
 the city in general, I decide not to go further 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.119
 because I see that no one climbs there 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.590
 here rolls out to 62 I have time 1 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.539
 understood shoot and go back with this 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.509
 I understand that I am rather welcome 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.679
 target for artillery 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.979
 therefore, it is very long to stand on one 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.700
 the place is not worth 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.649
 for sure they will want to come down and me 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.280
 ruff so see i'm moving on 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.170
 the other side of the bridge is not waiting for me here 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.679
 the enemy is looking where there will be only 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.729
 I had gone to that point of 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.959
 I see the light 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:03.179
 t-62 again, I quickly get lost 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:03.179
 shoot off going away from retribution 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.720
 the same thing now artillery for sure 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.489
 if she looks to the area date she 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.530
 reduced to the left of the bridge 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.530
 she will wait there will wait for me 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.349
 batchat and here again there is nobody again I 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.930
 going out see me changing side see 62 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:30.370
 firing back and again dump and that 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:34.030
 already 1150 damage dealt without any 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.980
 the consequences for yourself are whole 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.920
 not shabby see see check out again but 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.099
 already a little further that is to the position where 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.080
 the art probably hasn't sat down either 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.930
 if pt 10 level there somewhere are 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.390
 monitor too they don't expect me there 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.830
 very important at all if the tank allows 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.840
 enter here is a maneuverable battle then 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.620
 often change their position deals 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.799
 some kind of non-standard places on 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.660
 card again see 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.560
 gun down angles great 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.620
 with complete impunity I can 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.200
 nastraivat remaining just 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.769
 unattainable because here the hill I 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.870
 I have time to pass back very, very quickly 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.780
 even if someone tried me now 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.880
 there focus izard and well they just donâ€™t 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.370
 I have time to shoot off 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.069
 information zones and u have to come down 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.930
 anew therefore most likely early or 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.450
 late they just switch to more 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.450
 a convenient target will leave me alone 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.460
 I wait for crawl out again 62 again he 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.230
 very nice for me climbs out and again 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.230
 see have time rolling 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:07.209
 here i decide for good 62 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:10.379
 and in fact not very likely this 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.379
 right but here I want him 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.379
 to finish 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.140
 kindness choose on discovering 50 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.380
 Four decide to get from her but 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.140
 get out after all the hill because not 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.590
 very painful beats and there 75 and there 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:37.850
 the artillery reduced to me is very 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.880
 I successfully set fire to 2 62 that is, both of them I 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.830
 already took almost three thousand damage here 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.900
 I understand that I did not go back too much 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.170
 they will give me two artifacts 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.020
 you saw now there were two series shots 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.450
 for I also put it on the harp 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.310
 here of course I understand that too 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.130
 I did not expect so much 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:02.900
 opponents will monitor the bridge i then 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.220
 I thought there from strength there 72 and with a and t and in 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.870
 Generally the only thing here is that I can 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.390
 it's at least a little more to shoot 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.880
 I understand someone to hurt what to set foot on 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:14.180
 no fail 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.800
 here I do not get or or without punching 54-ku 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.830
 I try to move a little bit 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.960
 to shoot down the sight but 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:24.080
 recharge 54-ki faster still judging by 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.370
 everything has an alternative weapon 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.770
 which is great 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.690
 a bit more rate of fire excellent 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.670
 played on premium ammunition but 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.420
 look i warmed myself actually 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.550
 whole flank 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:42.160
 warmed up both artillery therefore 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:46.450
 my teammates successfully push through 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:50.260
 the city and in principle in principle the game is already 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.730
 won let's see it all 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.240
 end in principle can be a little bit 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.240
 speed up 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.380
 here by the way are several such files 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.510
 incomprehensible that is what to do 54 i don't 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.050
 really understand acts like pretty 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:10.800
 strangely torn between two goals 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.800
 worth at home as well as it's strange 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.010
 opponents decline 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.890
 batchat which is there I thought that I 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:27.040
 help then after the fight looked 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.800
 the player score was inexperienced 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.210
 when I rushed to pick up then 62 i 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.060
 I still think that they are behind me 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.520
 will follow something to actually complete but 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.500
 He generally see the whole entire fight he 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.910
 sat there well here laura too just 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:47.660
 extremely file crashes into a dies perish 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:49.310
 from art, that is to say, I thought that the battle 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.700
 will end in just a few seconds 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.470
 for humor to be there for a minute 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.130
 enemy artillery all the same as 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.130
 shoot back 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.460
 which is rather strange 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.800
 but no matter the outcome of the battle 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:11.960
 there is no doubt all 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:14.510
 clear deal time but soyuznichki 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.060
 get a bunch of absolutely unnecessary damage 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:20.660
 somehow here is not very tactical 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.250
 well, a well-I in the battle to come 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.320
 managed to realize generally nice when 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.150
 It turns out this is just such a literate 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.040
 the game is still being realized 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:32.720
 car advantage tank advantage 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:34.940
 according to the results of the battle tamron 3 300 first place 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:39.380
 by damage in both teams well in general fight 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:41.270
 not bad as seen on the middle tank on 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:45.020
 this before british british is very cool 

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:48.770
 so here go to the hill and shoot down 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:51.169
 because other tanks won't be able to 

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.760
 do except maybe paton masthead 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:55.310
 but he has 

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.199
 the cardboard tower british possess 

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.090
 much more ricochet tower much 

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:01.570
 more solid therefore to me he is very 

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.570
 like 

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.840
 even ride it up to at least a hundred 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.310
 up to one hundred and fifty battles and then already 

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.290
 did a detailed analysis exactly 

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.910
 characteristics of the tank well that was with you 

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.290
 pine thank you all if it was useful 

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:16.010
 subscribe to the channel 

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.010
 happily
