00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759

the<00:01:24.390> guy<00:01:24.420> painted<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.439> now<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.580> little

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the guy painted this one now this little

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.460 
the guy painted this one now this little
motor<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> compression<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> shot<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
motor here the compression is shot the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.380 
motor here the compression is shot the
guy<00:01:28.590> thinks<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.250> somebody<00:01:29.670> ran<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> motor

guy thinks that somebody ran the motor
without<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.140> impeller<00:01:31.500> working<00:01:32.100> properly<00:01:32.340> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
without the impeller working properly so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.719 
without the impeller working properly so
he<00:01:33.630> believes<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.110> overheated<00:01:34.650> when<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.520> pull

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
he believes it overheated when you pull

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.940 
he believes it overheated when you pull
it<00:01:35.850> over<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.270> hardly<00:01:36.570> feel<00:01:36.930> anything<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
it over you hardly feel anything for the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.410 
it over you hardly feel anything for the
compression<00:01:38.340> usually<00:01:38.880> you're<00:01:39.000> gonna<00:01:39.090> feel<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
compression usually you're gonna feel a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.300 
compression usually you're gonna feel a
little<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.259> even<00:01:40.829> if<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.189> have

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
little bit and even if they have

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.210 
little bit and even if they have
compression<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:41.970> low<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.299> 60<00:01:42.780> psi<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:44.070> will

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
compression as low as 60 psi they will

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.920 
compression as low as 60 psi they will
still<00:01:44.520> start<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.119> one<00:01:45.329> feels<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.720> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
still start but this one feels like it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.020 
still start but this one feels like it
has<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> lot<00:01:46.409> less<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.009> do<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
has a lot less I do have to do a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.580 
has a lot less I do have to do a
compression<00:01:48.420> test<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> confirm<00:01:49.530> that

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
compression test just to confirm that

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.920 
compression test just to confirm that
and<00:01:49.979> possibly<00:01:50.430> take<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> head<00:01:51.240> off<00:01:51.270> over<00:01:51.600> here

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and possibly take the head off over here

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.200 
and possibly take the head off over here
but<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> guy<00:01:53.100> was<00:01:53.310> wondering<00:01:53.670> how<00:01:53.759> much<00:01:53.909> these

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
but the guy was wondering how much these

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.340 
but the guy was wondering how much these
little<00:01:54.450> motors<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.869> worth<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.290> that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
little motors are worth in that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.499 
little motors are worth in that
condition<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.000> guys<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.329> any

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
condition if you guys have any

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.910 
condition if you guys have any
experience<00:01:57.600> selling<00:01:58.229> these<00:01:58.530> little<00:01:58.770> motors

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
experience selling these little motors

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.260 
experience selling these little motors
just<00:01:59.280> let<00:01:59.430> me<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.729> can<00:02:00.000> post<00:02:00.149> your

comment everybody else will appreciate
that<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.210> well<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.689> don't<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:04.140> too<00:02:04.409> much<00:02:04.590> money

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that as well I don't get too much money

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.940 
that as well I don't get too much money
if<00:02:05.100> they're<00:02:05.579> not<00:02:05.759> running<00:02:06.409> unless<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.649> get<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
if they're not running unless you get a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.100 
if they're not running unless you get a
collector<00:02:08.489> that's<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:09.420> looking<00:02:09.840> for

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
collector that's really looking for

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.680 
collector that's really looking for
specific<00:02:10.619> little<00:02:10.920> motor<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:12.420> sort<00:02:12.629> of

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
specific little motor and this sort of

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.750 
specific little motor and this sort of
motor<00:02:12.840> here<00:02:13.140> does<00:02:13.440> have

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
motor here does have

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.990 
motor here does have
compression<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:16.250> start<00:02:16.519> it<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.730> have<00:02:16.849> to

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
compression and to start it you have to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.240 
compression and to start it you have to
wrap<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.209> rope<00:02:17.569> around<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.290> pull<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.709> each<00:02:18.920> time

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
wrap a rope around and pull it each time

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.420 
wrap a rope around and pull it each time
so<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.939> doesn't<00:02:20.150> have<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:20.299> recoil<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:22.250> one

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
so it doesn't have a recoil and this one

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.920 
so it doesn't have a recoil and this one
here<00:02:22.670> seems<00:02:22.939> to<00:02:23.030> have<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.209> bit<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.510> compression

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
here seems to have a bit of compression

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.350 
here seems to have a bit of compression
so<00:02:24.409> it<00:02:24.739> could<00:02:24.980> be<00:02:25.099> promising<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.790> get<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.150> one

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
so it could be promising to get this one

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.569 
so it could be promising to get this one
going<00:02:26.569> I<00:02:26.840> haven't<00:02:27.170> even<00:02:27.260> had<00:02:27.530> time<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.860> look<00:02:28.400> at

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
going I haven't even had time to look at

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.089 
going I haven't even had time to look at
them<00:02:28.730> yet<00:02:28.939> a<00:02:29.319> question<00:02:30.319> I<00:02:30.409> got<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.739> other<00:02:30.890> day

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
them yet a question I got the other day

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.610 
them yet a question I got the other day
is<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.430> youtubers<00:02:32.060> wondering<00:02:32.569> why<00:02:32.870> his<00:02:33.110> MTD

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
is a youtubers wondering why his MTD

is a youtubers wondering why his MTD
snowblower<00:02:34.000> won't<00:02:35.000> blow<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.510> snow<00:02:35.780> as<00:02:36.049> far<00:02:36.110> as

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
snowblower won't blow the snow as far as

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.949 
snowblower won't blow the snow as far as
a<00:02:36.769> Honda<00:02:37.250> snowblower<00:02:37.519> one<00:02:38.329> of<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.569> reasons

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
a Honda snowblower one of the reasons

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.509 
a Honda snowblower one of the reasons
why<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.230> Honda<00:02:39.620> snowblower<00:02:39.859> may<00:02:40.310> blow

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
why the Honda snowblower may blow

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.360 
why the Honda snowblower may blow
further<00:02:40.909> is<00:02:41.299> because<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.230> gear<00:02:42.470> ratio<00:02:42.980> or

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
further is because of the gear ratio or

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.280 
further is because of the gear ratio or
the<00:02:43.430> way<00:02:43.879> that<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.209> impeller<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.750> built<00:02:45.049> and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
the way that the impeller is built and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.890 
the way that the impeller is built and
the<00:02:45.769> augers<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.790> can<00:02:46.970> really<00:02:47.239> affect<00:02:47.450> how

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
the augers that can really affect how

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.869 
the augers that can really affect how
far<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.379> snow<00:02:48.620> is<00:02:48.739> going<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.980> go<00:02:49.129> also<00:02:49.549> the

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
far the snow is going to go also the

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.640 
far the snow is going to go also the
size<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.510> chute<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:51.019> your<00:02:51.319> snowblower

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
size of the chute on your snowblower

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.160 
size of the chute on your snowblower
will<00:02:52.040> make<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> difference<00:02:52.700> as<00:02:52.879> well<00:02:53.090> here's<00:02:54.079> a

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
will make a difference as well here's a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.680 
will make a difference as well here's a
snow<00:02:54.409> blower<00:02:54.590> made<00:02:54.950> by<00:02:55.159> MTD<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:56.389> is<00:02:56.569> your

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
snow blower made by MTD this is your

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.149 
snow blower made by MTD this is your
typical<00:02:56.900> slumlord<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.739> you<00:02:57.799> will<00:02:57.950> see

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
typical slumlord that you will see

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.879 
typical slumlord that you will see
pretty<00:02:58.400> often<00:02:58.670> these<00:02:59.569> blow<00:02:59.870> pretty<00:03:00.290> good<00:03:00.560> I'm

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
pretty often these blow pretty good I'm

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.680 
pretty often these blow pretty good I'm
actually<00:03:01.159> pretty<00:03:01.700> happy<00:03:01.849> with<00:03:02.239> this<00:03:02.389> blower

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
actually pretty happy with this blower

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.170 
actually pretty happy with this blower
here<00:03:02.989> this<00:03:03.200> is<00:03:03.349> my<00:03:03.560> snow<00:03:03.829> blower<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.340> if<00:03:05.060> you

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
here this is my snow blower and if you

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.930 
here this is my snow blower and if you
look<00:03:05.329> at<00:03:05.480> yours<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.379> impeller<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:07.700> size

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
look at yours and the impeller the size

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.599 
look at yours and the impeller the size
of<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.209> chute<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:09.290> size<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.889> pulleys<00:03:10.310> on

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
of the chute the size of the pulleys on

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.360 
of the chute the size of the pulleys on
the<00:03:11.209> engine<00:03:11.569> and<00:03:11.750> on<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.530> shell<00:03:12.829> over<00:03:13.129> here

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the engine and on the shell over here

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.910 
the engine and on the shell over here
where<00:03:13.879> the<00:03:14.030> pulley<00:03:14.269> for<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.659> auger<00:03:14.810> is<00:03:14.989> you're

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
where the pulley for the auger is you're

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.170 
where the pulley for the auger is you're
going<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.159> see<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.549> it's<00:03:16.819> going<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.060> be

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
going to see that it's going to be

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.720 
going to see that it's going to be
different<00:03:17.690> from<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.989> Honda<00:03:18.139> snowblower<00:03:18.730> even

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
different from a Honda snowblower even

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.759 
different from a Honda snowblower even
the<00:03:19.849> way<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.180> impeller<00:03:20.540> shaped<00:03:21.049> inside<00:03:21.470> can

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
the way the impeller shaped inside can

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.680 
the way the impeller shaped inside can
all<00:03:22.010> affect<00:03:22.400> how<00:03:22.519> far<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.150> snow<00:03:23.359> is<00:03:23.419> going<00:03:23.599> to

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
all affect how far the snow is going to

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.349 
all affect how far the snow is going to
blow<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.230> that's<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:25.069> main<00:03:25.250> answer<00:03:25.489> is<00:03:25.910> it's

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
blow so that's the main answer is it's

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:27.819 
blow so that's the main answer is it's
all<00:03:26.660> in<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.900> way<00:03:27.019> it's<00:03:27.169> designed

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
all in the way it's designed

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.740 
all in the way it's designed
also<00:03:28.459> if<00:03:28.549> you<00:03:28.639> pay<00:03:28.819> a<00:03:28.849> lot<00:03:29.030> more<00:03:29.090> money<00:03:29.449> for<00:03:29.690> a

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
also if you pay a lot more money for a

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.479 
also if you pay a lot more money for a
Honda<00:03:29.989> snow<00:03:30.169> blower<00:03:30.199> you<00:03:30.650> can<00:03:30.889> expect<00:03:31.310> better

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
Honda snow blower you can expect better

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.670 
Honda snow blower you can expect better
performance<00:03:32.269> in<00:03:32.480> some<00:03:32.870> areas<00:03:33.379> of<00:03:33.410> your

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
performance in some areas of your

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.309 
performance in some areas of your
snowblower<00:03:34.190> so<00:03:35.030> basically<00:03:35.540> comes<00:03:35.870> down<00:03:36.079> that

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
snowblower so basically comes down that

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.069 
snowblower so basically comes down that
you<00:03:36.530> get<00:03:36.739> what<00:03:36.949> you<00:03:37.069> pay<00:03:37.220> for<00:03:38.079> another

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
you get what you pay for another

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.390 
you get what you pay for another

chain<00:04:58.600> breaks<00:04:58.990> usually<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.560> swings<00:04:59.919> this<00:05:00.220> way

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
chain breaks usually it swings this way

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.700 
chain breaks usually it swings this way
and<00:05:00.729> this<00:05:01.419> will<00:05:01.630> catch<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:02.110> chain<00:05:02.410> so<00:05:02.680> I

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
and this will catch the chain so I

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.200 
and this will catch the chain so I
always<00:05:03.039> make<00:05:03.220> sure<00:05:03.400> that<00:05:03.580> this<00:05:03.729> is<00:05:03.940> in<00:05:04.090> good

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
always make sure that this is in good

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.629 
always make sure that this is in good
condition<00:05:04.270> on<00:05:04.960> your<00:05:05.229> chainsaw<00:05:05.470> and<00:05:05.919> most

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
condition on your chainsaw and most

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.370 
condition on your chainsaw and most
chainsaws<00:05:07.150> no<00:05:07.419> matter<00:05:07.630> what<00:05:07.870> make<00:05:08.080> they<00:05:08.260> are

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
chainsaws no matter what make they are

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.529 
chainsaws no matter what make they are
usually<00:05:08.770> have<00:05:09.160> something<00:05:09.639> over<00:05:09.760> here<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.419> grab

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
usually have something over here to grab

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.230 
usually have something over here to grab
the<00:05:10.660> chain<00:05:11.020> if<00:05:11.199> ever<00:05:11.380> it<00:05:11.560> broke<00:05:11.850> in<00:05:12.850> my<00:05:13.030> next

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
the chain if ever it broke in my next

question<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.720> youtuber<00:05:14.110> saw<00:05:14.350> one<00:05:14.530> of<00:05:14.680> my<00:05:14.860> to

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
question a youtuber saw one of my to

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.590 
question a youtuber saw one of my to
come<00:05:15.280> sus<00:05:15.550> snow<00:05:15.760> blower<00:05:15.940> videos<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.510> other

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
come sus snow blower videos the other

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.420 
come sus snow blower videos the other
day<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:17.110> he<00:05:17.260> was<00:05:17.410> wondering<00:05:17.860> which<00:05:18.010> ones<00:05:18.280> the

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
day and he was wondering which ones the

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.430 
day and he was wondering which ones the
choke<00:05:18.699> and<00:05:18.910> which<00:05:19.270> one<00:05:19.510> is<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:19.960> throttle

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
choke and which one is the throttle

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.740 
choke and which one is the throttle
lever<00:05:20.620> so<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:21.610> think<00:05:21.729> you<00:05:22.000> saw<00:05:22.180> a<00:05:22.240> video<00:05:22.419> of<00:05:22.570> me

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
lever so I think you saw a video of me

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.330 
lever so I think you saw a video of me
tearing<00:05:23.139> down<00:05:23.289> whether<00:05:23.560> these<00:05:23.830> blown<00:05:24.190> up

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
tearing down whether these blown up

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.189 
tearing down whether these blown up
engines<00:05:24.789> just<00:05:25.330> like<00:05:25.449> this<00:05:25.660> from<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:25.990> snow

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
engines just like this from a snow

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.980 
engines just like this from a snow
blower<00:05:26.440> and<00:05:26.770> I<00:05:27.669> did<00:05:27.880> have<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.419> carburetor

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
blower and I did have the carburetor

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.650 
blower and I did have the carburetor
cover<00:05:29.289> off<00:05:29.590> in<00:05:29.949> that<00:05:30.190> video<00:05:30.490> and<00:05:30.940> I<00:05:31.389> believe

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
cover off in that video and I believe

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.600 
cover off in that video and I believe
the<00:05:31.810> knob<00:05:32.020> was<00:05:32.260> off<00:05:32.470> here<00:05:32.710> so<00:05:32.740> he<00:05:33.099> wasn't<00:05:33.310> sure

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
the knob was off here so he wasn't sure

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.969 
the knob was off here so he wasn't sure
which<00:05:33.880> was<00:05:34.120> which<00:05:34.360> so<00:05:35.260> here's<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.680> answer

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
which was which so here's the answer

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.279 
which was which so here's the answer
this<00:05:36.220> is<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.460> throttle<00:05:37.060> lever<00:05:37.210> it<00:05:37.660> can<00:05:37.900> go<00:05:38.050> up

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
this is the throttle lever it can go up

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.560 
this is the throttle lever it can go up
and<00:05:38.530> down<00:05:38.620> and<00:05:39.070> this<00:05:39.610> is<00:05:39.789> the<00:05:39.910> choke<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.360> choke

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
and down and this is the choke the choke

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.080 
and down and this is the choke the choke
is<00:05:40.750> always<00:05:41.020> on<00:05:41.200> when<00:05:41.560> it's<00:05:41.740> turned<00:05:42.010> toward<00:05:42.729> the

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
is always on when it's turned toward the

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.480 
is always on when it's turned toward the
recoil<00:05:43.570> and<00:05:43.810> you<00:05:44.500> can<00:05:44.680> see<00:05:44.889> the<00:05:45.039> rabbit<00:05:45.370> over

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
recoil and you can see the rabbit over

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.089 
recoil and you can see the rabbit over
here<00:05:45.820> and<00:05:45.970> the<00:05:46.060> turtle<00:05:46.450> and<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:47.650> symbol<00:05:48.010> over

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
here and the turtle and the symbol over

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:49.620 
here and the turtle and the symbol over
here<00:05:48.220> for<00:05:48.550> the<00:05:48.639> choke<00:05:48.849> these<00:05:49.090> are<00:05:49.240> basically

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
here for the choke these are basically

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.710 
here for the choke these are basically
Universal<00:05:50.530> symbols<00:05:51.070> and<00:05:51.550> you're<00:05:52.330> gonna<00:05:52.419> see

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
Universal symbols and you're gonna see

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.510 
Universal symbols and you're gonna see
this<00:05:52.900> on<00:05:53.110> a<00:05:53.169> lot<00:05:53.470> of<00:05:53.500> engines<00:05:54.010> and<00:05:54.220> these

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
this on a lot of engines and these

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.820 
this on a lot of engines and these
symbols<00:05:54.910> here<00:05:55.270> as<00:05:55.389> well<00:05:55.539> for<00:05:55.810> the<00:05:55.930> throttle<00:05:56.349> so

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
symbols here as well for the throttle so

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.469 
symbols here as well for the throttle so
that's<00:05:57.099> the<00:05:57.280> throttle<00:05:57.520> and<00:05:57.880> this<00:05:58.210> is<00:05:58.360> the

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
that's the throttle and this is the

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.930 
that's the throttle and this is the
choke<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:59.190> youtuber<00:06:00.190> email<00:06:00.490> me<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.669> other<00:06:00.849> day

now I do find that mixed gas has a

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:35.279 
now I do find that mixed gas has a
longer<00:06:33.970> shelf<00:06:34.330> life<00:06:34.449> that's<00:06:34.810> probably

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 
longer shelf life that's probably

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.290 
longer shelf life that's probably
because<00:06:35.500> of<00:06:35.710> the<00:06:35.919> two<00:06:36.099> cycle<00:06:36.490> engine<00:06:36.940> oil<00:06:37.120> in

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
because of the two cycle engine oil in

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.540 
because of the two cycle engine oil in
it<00:06:37.450> and<00:06:37.630> for<00:06:38.200> some<00:06:38.380> reason<00:06:38.800> it<00:06:39.010> just<00:06:39.039> helps<00:06:39.490> to

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
it and for some reason it just helps to

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.600 
it and for some reason it just helps to
preserve<00:06:39.760> your<00:06:40.090> fuel

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
preserve your fuel

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.850 
preserve your fuel
a<00:06:40.669> bit<00:06:40.909> longer<00:06:41.150> basically<00:06:42.110> I<00:06:42.139> just<00:06:42.409> had<00:06:42.560> heel

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
a bit longer basically I just had heel

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.070 
a bit longer basically I just had heel
stabilizer<00:06:43.430> to<00:06:43.939> my<00:06:44.060> straight<00:06:44.360> gas<00:06:44.599> for<00:06:44.960> my

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
stabilizer to my straight gas for my

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.080 
stabilizer to my straight gas for my
generator<00:06:45.560> after<00:06:45.889> a<00:06:46.189> while<00:06:46.310> I<00:06:46.340> recycle<00:06:47.000> the

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
generator after a while I recycle the

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.510 
generator after a while I recycle the
fuel<00:06:47.360> put<00:06:47.900> it<00:06:47.990> in<00:06:48.139> my<00:06:48.289> car<00:06:48.560> refill<00:06:49.189> the<00:06:49.219> gas

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
fuel put it in my car refill the gas

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.110 
fuel put it in my car refill the gas
cans<00:06:49.879> and<00:06:50.180> I<00:06:50.539> usually<00:06:50.750> do<00:06:51.050> this<00:06:51.199> after<00:06:51.590> 60<00:06:51.949> days

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
cans and I usually do this after 60 days

cans and I usually do this after 60 days
it<00:06:53.120> burns<00:06:53.419> really<00:06:53.629> good<00:06:53.900> in<00:06:54.020> the<00:06:54.139> car<00:06:54.349> then<00:06:54.860> I

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979

know that I've always got fresh fuel
