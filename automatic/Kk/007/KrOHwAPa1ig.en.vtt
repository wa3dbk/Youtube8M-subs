because<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:05.810> his<00:02:05.899> exploding<00:02:06.319> action<00:02:06.800> feature

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
because of his exploding action feature

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.580 
because of his exploding action feature
so<00:02:07.700> since<00:02:07.879> we<00:02:08.000> can't<00:02:08.270> pose<00:02:08.509> them<00:02:08.660> around<00:02:08.959> let's

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
so since we can't pose them around let's

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.070 
so since we can't pose them around let's
go<00:02:09.739> ahead<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.009> look<00:02:10.069> at<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.340> feature

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
go ahead and look at that feature

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.660 
go ahead and look at that feature
essentially<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:12.260> works<00:02:12.530> like<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:13.010> pop<00:02:13.430> off

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
essentially this works like a pop off

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.809 
essentially this works like a pop off
effect<00:02:14.360> is<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:15.050> spring<00:02:15.680> on<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.980> inside<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.700> is

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
effect is a spring on the inside that is

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.240 
effect is a spring on the inside that is
triggered<00:02:17.300> by<00:02:17.480> pushing<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.380> button<00:02:18.410> which

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
triggered by pushing a button which

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.670 
triggered by pushing a button which
happens<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.880> be<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.600> red<00:02:20.840> tie<00:02:21.110> on<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.410> front

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
happens to be the red tie on the front

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.790 
happens to be the red tie on the front
so<00:02:22.370> if<00:02:22.490> we<00:02:22.610> press<00:02:22.970> that<00:02:23.150> red

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
so if we press that red

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.030 
so if we press that red
I the<00:02:24.400> head<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.360> arms<00:02:25.780> go<00:02:25.990> springing<00:02:26.890> off

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
I the head and the arms go springing off

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.330 
I the head and the arms go springing off
the<00:02:27.220> figure<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.230> course<00:02:29.350> very<00:02:29.530> easy<00:02:29.950> to

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
the figure it's of course very easy to

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.100 
the figure it's of course very easy to
put<00:02:30.520> them<00:02:30.580> back<00:02:30.730> together<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.720> pop<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
put them back together you just pop the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.290 
put them back together you just pop the
head<00:02:32.320> in<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:33.040> put<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.400> arms<00:02:33.670> back<00:02:33.820> in<00:02:34.090> it

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
head in you put the arms back in it

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.360 
head in you put the arms back in it
resets<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.020> spring<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.530> he's<00:02:35.920> ready<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.250> be

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
resets the spring and he's ready to be

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.720 
resets the spring and he's ready to be
flung<00:02:36.640> apart<00:02:37.000> again<00:02:37.240> over<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.440> over<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.130> over

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
flung apart again over and over and over

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.690 
flung apart again over and over and over
it's<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.750> really<00:02:41.230> fun<00:02:41.470> effect<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.160> he's<00:02:42.670> a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
it's a really fun effect and he's a

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.700 
it's a really fun effect and he's a
great<00:02:43.180> looking<00:02:43.360> figure<00:02:43.930> but<00:02:44.380> he's<00:02:44.500> definitely

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
great looking figure but he's definitely

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.990 
great looking figure but he's definitely
not<00:02:45.070> one<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.400> you're<00:02:45.490> going<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.640> want<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.850> buy

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
not one that you're going to want to buy

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.430 
not one that you're going to want to buy
if<00:02:46.240> you're<00:02:46.330> looking<00:02:46.630> for<00:02:46.780> something<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.140> pose

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
if you're looking for something to pose

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.680 
if you're looking for something to pose
around<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:48.370> guy<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:48.670> all<00:02:49.120> about<00:02:49.510> the

around this guy is all about the

around this guy is all about the
exploding<00:02:50.110> action<00:02:50.590> feature<00:02:50.800> but<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.550> be<00:02:51.670> fair

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
exploding action feature but to be fair

exploding action feature but to be fair
the<00:02:52.300> feature<00:02:52.540> works<00:02:52.840> really<00:02:53.020> well<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.560> it's<00:02:54.010> a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
the feature works really well and it's a
