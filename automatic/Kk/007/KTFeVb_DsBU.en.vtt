00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
pocket with keys and stuff and it hasn't

really<00:01:57.810> scratched<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> device<00:01:58.590> at<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:59.090> this

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
really scratched the device at all this

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.810 
really scratched the device at all this
is<00:02:00.270> only<00:02:00.390> 116<00:02:01.259> grams<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.740> very<00:02:01.950> light<00:02:02.159> it's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
is only 116 grams it's very light it's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.490 
is only 116 grams it's very light it's
only<00:02:03.030> eight<00:02:03.270> point<00:02:03.540> five<00:02:03.719> millimeters<00:02:04.290> thin

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
only eight point five millimeters thin

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.310 
only eight point five millimeters thin
so<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.939> was<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.270> worth<00:02:06.450> world's<00:02:07.020> thinnest

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
so it was the worth world's thinnest

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.570 
so it was the worth world's thinnest

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
smartphone when it came out obviously

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.219 
smartphone when it came out obviously
now<00:02:08.759> there<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.239> been<00:02:09.270> thinner<00:02:09.720> smartphones

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
now there have been thinner smartphones

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.979 
now there have been thinner smartphones
but<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.890> still<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.190> very<00:02:11.280> thin<00:02:11.700> profile<00:02:12.180> in

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
but it's still a very thin profile in

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.250 
but it's still a very thin profile in
terms<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.379> storage<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.680> get<00:02:13.860> 60

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
taking a look at the side you can see

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.589 
taking a look at the side you can see
that<00:03:15.340> there's<00:03:15.549> a<00:03:15.989> volume<00:03:16.989> rocker<00:03:17.019> here<00:03:17.530> I

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
that there's a volume rocker here I

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.000 
that there's a volume rocker here I
think<00:03:19.599> that's<00:03:19.780> like<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.930> Kensington<00:03:20.500> lock<00:03:20.650> on

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
think that's like a Kensington lock on

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.159 
think that's like a Kensington lock on
the<00:03:21.549> bottom<00:03:21.940> there's<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.269> microUSB<00:03:22.629> and

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
the bottom there's a microUSB and

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.339 
the bottom there's a microUSB and
another<00:03:23.379> external<00:03:24.370> mic<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.810> cancel<00:03:26.169> out<00:03:26.260> the

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
another external mic to cancel out the

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.890 
another external mic to cancel out the
background<00:03:26.709> audio<00:03:26.799> I<00:03:26.980> think<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:28.569> on<00:03:28.780> this

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
background audio I think and on this

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.300 
background audio I think and on this
side<00:03:29.079> you've<00:03:29.199> got<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.560> power

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
side you've got the power

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.490 
side you've got the power
like<00:03:30.459> sleep/wake<00:03:30.879> button<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:32.079> on<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.319> back

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
like sleep/wake button and on the back

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.259 
like sleep/wake button and on the back
you've<00:03:32.680> got<00:03:32.709> an<00:03:32.919> 8<00:03:33.069> megapixel<00:03:33.340> camera<00:03:33.669> this

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
you've got an 8 megapixel camera this

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.990 
you've got an 8 megapixel camera this
has<00:03:34.449> an<00:03:34.569> LED<00:03:34.750> flash<00:03:35.169> autofocus<00:03:35.549> all<00:03:36.549> that<00:03:36.819> good

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
has an LED flash autofocus all that good

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.509 
has an LED flash autofocus all that good
stuff<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.239> can<00:03:37.510> video<00:03:37.780> record<00:03:38.109> up<00:03:38.230> 1080p<00:03:38.799> 30

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
stuff you can video record up 1080p 30

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.210 
stuff you can video record up 1080p 30
frames<00:03:39.760> per<00:03:39.910> second<00:03:40.299> it's<00:03:40.419> not<00:03:40.540> an<00:03:40.629> issue<00:03:40.750> and

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
frames per second it's not an issue and

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.650 
frames per second it's not an issue and
the<00:03:42.220> quality<00:03:42.669> of<00:03:42.790> shots<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.239> this<00:03:43.329> have<00:03:43.510> been

just swipe it down and they go so let's

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.930 
just swipe it down and they go so let's
get<00:03:52.720> into<00:03:52.870> applications<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.949> we<00:03:54.609> want<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:54.849> go

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
get into applications and we want to go

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.140 
get into applications and we want to go
in<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.120> gallery<00:03:55.829> camera<00:03:56.829> ok<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:57.819> this<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.120> a

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
in the gallery camera ok so this is a

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.699 
in the gallery camera ok so this is a
photo<00:03:58.389> of<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.569> coke<00:03:58.780> ball<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.079> took<00:03:59.349> and<00:03:59.560> just

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
photo of a coke ball I took and just

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.020 
photo of a coke ball I took and just
look<00:03:59.859> at<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.099> level<00:04:00.340> of<00:04:00.400> detail<00:04:00.609> when<00:04:00.940> I'm

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
look at the level of detail when I'm

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.879 
look at the level of detail when I'm
zooming<00:04:01.359> and<00:04:01.569> let's<00:04:02.139> bring<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.440> closer<00:04:02.650> to

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
zooming and let's bring that closer to

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.390 
zooming and let's bring that closer to
the<00:04:02.980> camera<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:04.269> can<00:04:04.359> really<00:04:05.190> see<00:04:06.190> how

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
the camera so you can really see how

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.330 
the camera so you can really see how
clear<00:04:06.669> that<00:04:06.699> is<00:04:07.109> but<00:04:08.109> anything<00:04:08.919> else<00:04:09.129> to

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
clear that is but anything else to

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.420 
clear that is but anything else to
mention<00:04:09.699> ok<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.060> UI<00:04:10.239> on<00:04:10.329> this<00:04:10.629> is<00:04:10.750> TouchWiz<00:04:11.139> UI

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
mention ok the UI on this is TouchWiz UI

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.159 
mention ok the UI on this is TouchWiz UI
which<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.549> Samsung's<00:04:12.940> on<00:04:13.090> UI<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.599> like<00:04:13.810> in<00:04:14.019> my

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
which is Samsung's on UI and like in my

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.719 
which is Samsung's on UI and like in my
experience<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:14.650> far<00:04:14.709> it's<00:04:15.010> been<00:04:15.040> really<00:04:15.159> good

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:15.729 
experience so far it's been really good

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.240 
experience so far it's been really good
the<00:04:16.209> only<00:04:16.510> bad<00:04:17.260> point<00:04:17.530> is<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.919> it<00:04:17.979> doesn't

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
the only bad point is that it doesn't

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.189 
the only bad point is that it doesn't
have<00:04:18.400> nearly<00:04:18.669> enough<00:04:18.940> as<00:04:19.090> widgets<00:04:19.479> as<00:04:19.810> many
