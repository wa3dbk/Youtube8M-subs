concealer<00:04:53.220> shape<00:04:53.520> palette<00:04:54.030> I<00:04:54.270> love<00:04:54.870> the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
concealer shape palette I love the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.040 
concealer shape palette I love the
packaging<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:56.070> looks<00:04:56.820> like<00:04:57.030> this<00:04:57.360> so<00:04:57.870> as<00:04:57.960> you

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
packaging so looks like this so as you

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.780 
packaging so looks like this so as you
can<00:04:58.170> see<00:04:58.230> if<00:04:58.410> these<00:04:58.620> are<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.890> little<00:04:59.160> bit<00:04:59.370> bigger

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
can see if these are a little bit bigger

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.150 
can see if these are a little bit bigger
but<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:00.750> don't<00:05:01.020> get<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.410> corrective<00:05:01.860> shades

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
but you don't get the corrective shades

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.950 
but you don't get the corrective shades
so<00:05:02.430> you'll<00:05:02.580> only<00:05:02.850> get<00:05:03.090> 10<00:05:03.330> shades<00:05:03.540> instead<00:05:03.810> of

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
so you'll only get 10 shades instead of

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.380 
so you'll only get 10 shades instead of
15<00:05:04.320> but<00:05:04.500> they<00:05:04.680> are<00:05:04.800> larger<00:05:05.760> so<00:05:05.790> if<00:05:06.210> you're

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
15 but they are larger so if you're

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.510 
15 but they are larger so if you're
doing<00:05:06.810> makeup<00:05:07.200> on<00:05:07.350> a<00:05:07.380> lot<00:05:07.590> of<00:05:07.710> people<00:05:08.130> or<00:05:08.370> you
