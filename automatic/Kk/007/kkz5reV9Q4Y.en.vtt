00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:02.830
 hello everyone guys 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.400
 in this video we are going to try a very nice program graphically 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.049
 which will allow us to 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.019
 and make best use of the windows on our computer 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.289
 ultrasound in question is called 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.529
 but equipped 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.529
 but let's look in the search engine 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.789
 we found on this well-known site 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.220
 will allow us to minimize windows 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
 it was on our 3d shitty pc 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.980
 exploit every pixel todesco descktop better facilitates the indication ends 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.710
 inactive 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.710
 and here all conducted a little lamborghini dealership 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.150
 a good starting point to call a screenshot in a completely different way 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.200
 simple 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.490
 intuitive 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.490
 then let's go and download it 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400
 I do all the steps 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.900
 don't lokk the current year 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.220
 save the file 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.760
 downloaded file 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.600
 we go to you they called them 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 from the desktop 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.770
 here it is 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.690
 bisignano 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.160
 but equipped 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.290
 see guys i have 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.420
 a truly remarkable graphic interface 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.150
 we accept 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
 I remove the check from the tour bar 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.690
 here is installation started 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.519
 here we can 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.399
 we click twice 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.739
 the icon but equipped 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.109
 let us see this 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:35.299
 symbols now 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.789
 we are going to click 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:39.669
 as you can see 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:40.669
 exploit 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.669
 the whole surface. 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.459
 of the page 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.459
 clicking water, page 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.169
 tarzan 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.360
 perfect 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.590
 therefore also noteworthy to put the upper part to open galvanizing 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.409
 the internet pages 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.639
 gugol 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.639
 equals with the belly 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.909
 effect a lot 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.909

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.219
 we always click 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.219
 nemo on my youtube channel 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.989
 yamaha hears about 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.719
 sim comments 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.429
 location 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:55.479
 here we have the program here 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:57.579
 we'll just have to ski 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.170
 Different people setting up war eliminate these symbols 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.729
 and then show us 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:10.059
 but equipped 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.499
 then let's try another internet bronser 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:16.889
 safari 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.889
 still present the symbolino 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.319
 here we have all our pages 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:29.110
 minimized manner 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 very beautiful 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.129
 here they are 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.900
 I pushed 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.279
 on the 2g 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:47.199
 back to the 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.199
 trading 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:56.360
 let's take high setting ce 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.360
 if you put it I like it 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.319
 will show us the pages 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.949
 without 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.449
 the small icon 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.110
 ala boys this 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.240
 program is called 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.999
 but equipped 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:17.229
 3d 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.749
 cai 

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:22.990
 It's a great pearl program 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.870
 the display with gauss or 3d pages here I don't know if it can 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.319
 proving useful maps is nice as an effect 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.550
 and I think but if you want to download it you can find it where the fact is 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:37.909
 see the video 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.959
 you can find it easily albi quoting 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.529
 madotate 3d in the 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:47.759
 in the spinel in any 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.759
