00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.309
 Hello everyone, you are watching a review from the outlet 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.530
 You are with you good maxim today me in 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.309
 galaxy nout 2 hands with color 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.469
 display 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.269
 I will try to find out why but 2 became 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.789
 so popular why is it now 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.910
 good purchase also look at the chips 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.519
 android 4 1 202 and find out the cons of this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.050
 charming shovels but 2 entered in 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.390
 sale two and a half months ago and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.240
 cost 30 thousand rubles now version on 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.730
 16 gigabytes costs about 22 thousand rubles 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.100
 the expected decline occurred and related 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.649
 polarized product and let's find out 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.629
 why but 2 became so popular during 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.610
 first notes has a cool design he 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.680
 thin and corner he has a beveled due 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.420
 this is not nice to hold in my hand 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.850
 By the way nice and specifically told 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.620
 uncomfortable otherwise angle x by 2 all by 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 standard volume buttons 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.719
 enable micro usb connector under the stylus and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.070
 the stylus itself s-pen speaker too 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.530
 by the way the power button is located 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.109
 very well so click on it 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.539
 even with one hand, the phone is comfortable 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.339
 HD 5-inch display is 5 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.930
 really huge display on 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.909
 which is convenient to watch movies on 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.070
 which is very convenient to sit in the browser 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.750
 which is extremely convenient to play 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.330
 games as fingers do not block 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.070
 a large area of ​​the game zone and me personally 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.259
 This phone resembles the times when 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.270
 people had communicators on windows 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.759
 mobile and they wore my stylus there 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.020
 I think different information but 2 is excellent 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.970
 suitable for business where you need a lot 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.500
 writings in your free time you can 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.509
 use his multimedia 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.460
 bundled capabilities to it goes 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.799
 updated s pen pen she has 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.210
 just one button the button is not convenient and not 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.740
 convenient in the sense that it 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.840
 using the pen you need to keep 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.150
 reason and sometimes you want to keep it 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.950
 on top I would have made samsung 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.750
 button is two and a half times longer from 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.000
 two sides to press it was possible 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.799
 anywhere nevertheless the gizmos is very 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.869
 cool functional justifies that noise 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.759
 what samsung did first phone 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.770
 recognizes s pen if it is not even 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.409
 touches it on the screen you can see a little 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.880
 point and it works like a cursor if 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.829
 point and on some element she 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.369
 will tell you what this function is not 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.590
 odd 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.390
 and informative by the way taking out the stylus 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.899
 opens a special menu in the new 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.759
 window 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.220
 here you can create notes of different 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.560
 kind but we were not on the different 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.300
 we need at least the usual, you can choose 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.150
 brush can choose converter 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.590
 straight lines it works so you can 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.780
 it is enough in principle to choose a paintbrush 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.640
 by the way if you didn't notice the lines 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.680
 drawn without square corners and thickness 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.230
 totally different it depends on the strength 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.270
 pressing a and spin more than a thousand 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.550
 gradations of pressing and all because it 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.290
 pen made under license wac for those 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.740
 who are familiar with Wac tablets will understand about 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.780
 than me 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.820
 If you hold down the button and tap on the screen 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.920
 two times a quick note will open 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.410
 convenient for example when talking 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.360
 draw a route or write the address with 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.580
 using s pen you can make and instant 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.410
 screenshots just hold the button and 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.640
 hold the stylus on the screen then on 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.650
 This screenshot can be anything 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.209
 draw send by mail to chat he 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.790
 or any other program that is 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.530
 lists besides if not to hold the stylus 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.810
 in one place and select some 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.310
 The screenshot area will be truncated think 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.380
 The thing is very useful and convenient in 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.090
 work on any presentations by the way 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.070
 screenshots can be done in the old fashioned way 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.140
 key combinations or swiping 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.760
 Well, the last feature of the pen is 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.890
 gestures for this you need to open 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.100
 separate window clamping button seeing 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.530
 bottom-up stylus is a very awkward thing 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.150
 I did not find this implementation 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.519
 by the way paid for it 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.560
 let's break away from s pen and move on but 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.010
 2 is rich in the same features as i'm galaxy 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.320
 s3 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.510
 review of which we have already done here is 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.000
 s beam smart alert stay stay 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.739
 directives and intelligent auto-rotation of the screen and in the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 all of these features can be learned from 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.920
 galaxy s3 reviews 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.320
 the only thing not told in this 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.780
 Multiwindow function overview is very 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.970
 useful available only with 3 and node2 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.340
 if you hold the back button appears here 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.410
 such a thing on the side we pull it out and 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.600
 select the two applications you need 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.980
 work immediately in two whether it be mail or 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.840
 youtube app for example 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.640
 not all but most are supported 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.080
 still supported thing 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.360
 really very cool on such 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.590
 the big screen is quite appropriate and galaxy 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.680
 but two runs on quad base 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.180
 exynos processor he has two gigabytes 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.790
 RAM and he really 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.860
 powerful besides update arrived 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.690
 android 4 1 2 for a second note 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.040
 Among the new chips, I would single out my 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.959
 keyboard which is to everyone else 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.140
 users android fly only in 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.650
 version 42 piece peculiar but comfortable and 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.910
 Besides 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.370
 u had the opportunity to completely 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.410
 disable multi windowing is done 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.690
 it is in the notification window and by the way among 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.180
 other new editing features 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.340
 windows with toggle switches admit it not 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.259
 missing also appeared so beautiful 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.240
 the chip is called ink 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.130
 unlocking if finger together is 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.039
 looks like a little stylus 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.840
 differently beautiful but from the discharge like this 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.669
 we are able but in general the phone has become 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.190
 faster animation somewhat improved 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.039
 if for example to bring the folder s pen we 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.830
 see the following such android 4 1 2 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.680
 Is it a good buy now? 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.570
 galaxy laptop 2 sold for two months 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.340
 the price fell 10,000 rubles from 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.410
 original when new 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.419
 colors in addition old white gray 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.340
 red and brown when it came out 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.010
 update android 4 1 with many 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.289
 functions yes right now it's good 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.120
 buying but 2 is incredibly popular and i 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.310
 I understand why he is popular in him 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.380
 some ball he looks beautiful he 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.099
 very powerful and i have unique 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.410
 functions 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.120
 surely he is very huge and when 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.910
 man and especially girl to call with 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.370
 it looks ridiculous to him but it is this one 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.169
 the phone can please the user I 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.660
 I would take myself a laptop 2 as a second 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.820
 phone in addition to your iphone 4s 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.650
 would take him as a communicator for work 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.289
 but use it as the main phone 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.630
 I definitely would not dare too big 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.000
 very big but i'm sure it is 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.860
