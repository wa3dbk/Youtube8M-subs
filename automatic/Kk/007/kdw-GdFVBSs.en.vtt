internet and pretty much what I found

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.759 
internet and pretty much what I found
was<00:00:29.429> either<00:00:29.909> the<00:00:30.210> vendors<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.749> sold<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.289> kind

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
was either the vendors that sold it kind

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.910

of<00:00:31.829> demonstrating<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:34.020> Kuryakyn

themselves showing it off so I figured I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.590

you're riding two up on a long trip
maybe<00:04:43.000> you<00:04:43.150> take<00:04:43.300> that<00:04:43.420> extra<00:04:43.540> bag
