00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.580 
worry about that anyway once you finish
that<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.780> time<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.110> lift<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> lid

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.810 
that up then it's time to lift the lid
up<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.860> here's<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> most<00:01:11.400> crucial<00:01:11.790> part

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
up and here's the most crucial part

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
up and here's the most crucial part
because<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.299> want<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> eggs

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
because you want to get it so the eggs

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.830 
because you want to get it so the eggs
are<00:01:13.380> still<00:01:13.590> saw<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.700> yolks<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.390> still<00:01:15.600> soft

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
are still saw the yolks are still soft

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.469 
are still saw the yolks are still soft
you<00:01:16.590> want<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> whites<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.280> cooked<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
you want the whites to be cooked so the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.850 
you want the whites to be cooked so the
one<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:18.780> them<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> right<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.680> see

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
one all them in the right as you can see

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.350 
one all them in the right as you can see
is<00:01:20.100> really<00:01:20.520> well<00:01:20.670> cooked<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
is really well cooked the one on the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.910 
is really well cooked the one on the
left<00:01:21.600> isn't<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.080> cooked<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:22.560> that's<00:01:22.710> probably

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
left isn't so cooked but that's probably

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.530 
left isn't so cooked but that's probably
because<00:01:23.040> that's<00:01:23.369> not<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> heat<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
because that's not on the heat as you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
because that's not on the heat as you
can<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> pans<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.200> little<00:01:25.350> off<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.100> this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
can see the pans a little off so this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
can see the pans a little off so this
parts<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:26.700> difficult<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.180> guys<00:01:27.330> just

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
parts a little difficult you guys just
