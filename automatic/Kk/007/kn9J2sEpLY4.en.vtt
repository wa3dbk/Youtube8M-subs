00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 all right 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.910
 and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.710
 hello youtube friends told them about 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.529
 176 today with a special guide of the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.669
 engineer trampolines we start those 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.669
 first 2 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:42.580
 the first of another in which we are going to put 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.490
 only two rpg ammo the others 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.340
 they are from the repairman for people who 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.700
 Walk on land in air and use more 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.960
 often the vehicles the other I use it 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:59.930
 to transport me 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:02.210
 on the mount m a very apache helicopter 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.330
 necessary the engineer that does not have anti 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.880
 vehicle is again in danger 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.270
 because mostly the vehicle that we 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.270
 attack are mostly tank and 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.550
 and anti-tank or can be vehicles of 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.180
 transport 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:30.920
 the other train that I do not advise that they put 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.920
 are the suits of the shuttle nothing x 25 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:41.190
 mostly it's a trip of three in vain 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.540
 it should not necessarily be put to be 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.680
 a good engineer 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.390
 the other part is we have another one in stop 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:55.550
 to have more time display 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.550
 that has it attacking with anything 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.780
 the other is to improve the fall of 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.570
 to get out of a building or when 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.940
 go open the parachute 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.310
 the other to have greater balance and 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.520
 faster when uploading a 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.700
 stairs 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.440
 it's all so this stand serves to 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.800
 higher 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.240
 sprint 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.890
 biggest jump as they call you for older 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.650
 pri this to recharge life more 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.220
 fast because the time will be very necessary 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.710
 that we do not stay with little life and 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.740
 present a vehicle to a person 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:43.060
 not attacking you on the map and the other 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.060
 to see the vehicles 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:51.540
 to see when when it has little damage and 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.180
 when he has a lot of life 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.680
 the vehicle only works for 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.049
 land vehicle does not work for 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.639
 aerial vehicle is very necessary I 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.840
 I use the other principle for the anti 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.050
 we think it serves to 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.940
 saves sometimes does not 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.050
 we put a son in the rough 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.150
 one side of the map and we 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.769
 with a clamor and not cheap the play 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:24.219
 whole or eyes we lose 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:27.579
 the death points for a simple 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:30.710
 we believe that mostly people 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.500
 uncomfortable to its climate 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.350
 the other is 200 life is very 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.230
 necessary because mostly the majority 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.030
 of the soldiers we should have so 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.750
 minus 110 of life to have a 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.250
 percentage of surviving in the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.250
 Map 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.610
 the other suit is the one of martÃ­n at the time 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.980
 of his death 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.020
 that the enemy stays in that area and 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.290
 we have a greater possibility of destroying 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:04.709
 also vehicles 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:08.800
 pulling antivehicles before dying and 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:11.560
 if we have the clear opportunity 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.600
 when it appears in the grenade that is 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.549
 thematic we have more intensity to the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.220
 hour of 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:27.590
 I destroy an enemy as this 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:31.910
 moment and since the enemy was from the rite 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.820
 well this only bring it that the one that 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.170
 I recommend 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:42.289
 these are the ones that I use as well as 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:46.249
 as the repairman I have it in the last 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:49.279
 the gluteus thigh to have faster 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:51.529
 at the time of moving forward vehicle what 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:54.639
 I use a lot because they give me a lot 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:58.279
 advantage because when there is a die shot 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:01.249
 anti-vehicle neighborhood and the person who 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:04.539
 stay in the place where I died 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:07.520
 causes a big bang because they are 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:11.030
 explosives for good vehicles 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.490
 that's another one that I advise against 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.819
 forget to subscribe to the channel and 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:21.020
 in like favor and dl that favorites 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:24.470
 the video I hope you like to warn 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.729
 to 176 and see you until the next video 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.729
 pass good
