00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
that they finally have done this I have

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.750 
that they finally have done this I have
had<00:00:23.820> NBA<00:00:24.570> live<00:00:24.720> 14<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.680> 15<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.370> they<00:00:26.460> did<00:00:26.610> not

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
had NBA live 14 and 15 and they did not

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.960 
had NBA live 14 and 15 and they did not
have<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.360> there<00:00:27.600> and<00:00:28.130> it<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.310> kind<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
have on there and it was kind of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720 
have on there and it was kind of
disappointing<00:00:30.630> not<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:30.900> 14<00:00:31.350> but<00:00:31.620> for<00:00:32.009> 15<00:00:32.550> I

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
disappointing not for 14 but for 15 I

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.849 
disappointing not for 14 but for 15 I
thought<00:00:33.030> they<00:00:33.210> would<00:00:33.239> change<00:00:33.629> that<00:00:33.989> when<00:00:34.710> it

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859 
thought they would change that when it

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.239 
thought they would change that when it
was<00:00:35.059> heavily<00:00:36.059> complained<00:00:36.929> about<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.730> 14<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:40.249 
was heavily complained about and 14 and

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.880 
was heavily complained about and 14 and
adding<00:00:41.249> this<00:00:41.370> feature<00:00:41.699> is<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.749> step<00:00:42.989> up

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
adding this feature is just one step up

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.880 
adding this feature is just one step up
above<00:00:45.739> improving<00:00:46.739> from<00:00:46.980> 15<00:00:47.699> I<00:00:48.769> think<00:00:49.769> this

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
above improving from 15 I think this

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.020 
above improving from 15 I think this
would<00:00:50.069> be<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.219> great<00:00:50.489> addition<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.179> the<00:00:51.300> game

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
would be a great addition to the game

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.380 
would be a great addition to the game
and<00:00:54.319> I<00:00:55.319> hope<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.280> don't<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.819> like<00:00:56.999> NBA

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and I hope they don't have it like NBA

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.629 
and I hope they don't have it like NBA
