00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.400
 Hello sir 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.520
 Modest Tastes from the video recipes section 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.520
 we have a catering recipe in this section 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.040
 We will learn the construction of "Pencil Pie" 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.040
 But let's take a look at the necessary materials before you choose 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.200
 3 pieces of yufka 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.920
 1 cup yogurt 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.640
 half water cup oil 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.120
 1 egg white 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.240
 for inside; 2 cups collapsing cheese 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.680
 For the above; 1 egg yolk 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.720
 and 1 tablespoon of poppy seeds 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.520
 now we can proceed to the construction of pen pastry 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 Let's first prepare the liquid material 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.800
 We use 1 piece into the influx of eggs 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.560
 1 cup yogurt 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.040
 and add half a cup of sunflower oil 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.040
 we flap beautifully 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.760
 so much 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.000
 If you remember we have 3 pieces of yufk 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 spread 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 cut 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.400
 Let's think like a big cigarette pie 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.680
 top-up 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.120
 in this way 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.280
 now we take our first big triangle 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:17.800
 we pour a couple of spoons from the liquid mixture 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.800
 and brushing 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:36.200
 the surface of the cottage cheese 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.440
 we make rolls after folding their sides 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.720
 greasy paper 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.280
 we also shaped our last pie 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.240
 if you remember there was an egg yolk 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.480
 gnash her 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.800
 and our pastries 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.160
 we are now sprinkling poppy seed 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.320
 sesame 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.760
 Recently the favorite recipe of the simit palaces ... 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.200
 puff pastry is prepared in this way, we also sprinkle poppy seeds 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.080
 in the meantime we started heating our oven at 185 degrees 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.840
 now we can give the pie to the oven 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.840
 After half an hour 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.360
 Our pastry came out of the oven 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.360
 Now is the service time 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.440
 from the tray and hot hot loved ones 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.800
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.560

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.880

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.080

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.160
