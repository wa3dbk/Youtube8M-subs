00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 others welcome to kienast 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.200
 today it's about the movie the blue one 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.179
 tiger he tells the story of 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.400
 johanna and matthias collaborate with 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.290
 next to her parents in the botanical garden 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.670
 This botanical garden is in danger 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.470
 because the mayor wants him 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.630
 demolish because he is the whole city new 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.830
 wants to build respectively 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.180
 The two want to be modernized 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.609
 of course, just like theirs 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.590
 Parents is about because it is so to speak 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.680
 their existence they lead this 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.920
 botanical garden and you can do it 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.719
 also to save them but it happen 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.300
 So some things you might get 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.129
 can not imagine that 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.520
 a small excerpt to see we 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.230
 here 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.820
 mum if the things are me 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.480
 maybe someday, too 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.700
 times to get warm do you mean that well that 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.570
 they really happen at once 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.570
 Vienna a dream 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.929
 I've got it I was together with johanna 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.210
 my mother in the old botanical 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:06.540
 garden just like an island in the middle of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.409
 loud city â€‹â€‹of matthias looks like one 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.979
 turtle 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.700
 he will also be here in the garden together with 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.100
 one day 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.619
 he is a gardener that is a public one 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.330
 Parking clear we have to go immediately with the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.610
 demolition of the botanical garden begin 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.000
 this is our mayor he is 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.580
 quite strange and magical 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.010
 garden in the way he will demolish everything and 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.750
 to destroy 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.250
 and what should we do now 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.660
 leave that to you at all 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.950
 case 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.950
 Mayor Kramer 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.200
 luckily i have a team a blue one 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.120
 tiger and what happens when in one 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.220
 city â€‹â€‹appears on blue tiger 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.750
 I ask you at the laura thiede the child 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.750
 but rather after a flourishing fantasy 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.860
 wondered aloud 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:12.820
 some places like the expensive tiger something 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.820
 makes a lot of nonsense 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.920
 there is no reason to worry 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.920
 everything runs like clockwork 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.130
 I am now 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.130
 come 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:40.690
 earlier this is adventure 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.060
 Coming soon in the cinema is the blue tiger 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.860
 all very colorful movie and power 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.010
 fun 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.860
 so it's not too cheesy made it 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.140
 are only parts animated by him 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.820
 children but he is not a pure one 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.870
 childrens movie he is really a movie for 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.260
 the whole family 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.710
 You can see that he is in 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.270
 quotes I 'll say something 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.100
 is held simpler than many 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.560
 blockbuster movie but that's easy 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.090
 because unknown film studios are 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.400
 who just do not have that much coal 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.440
 and some special effects 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.730
 or otherwise the pop 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.540
 special features in the film are just 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.700
 really these little petite ones 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.290
 not necessarily hidden animations 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.400
 such as a small crane of 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.050
 but just taken out of the picture 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.150
 and in johannas hans 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.590
 But more is compressed 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.600
 you can not say as well because otherwise 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.930
 you would at one or the other 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.480
 Spoil some spoilers but to the core 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.180
 It's a family movie you look at 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.930
 quietly also together in the cinema view 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.120
 could 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.810
 it's nice with wrapped history 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.060
 a pretty nice nuclear statement the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.280
 it would be real at the moment 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.380
 worth fighting for what you love 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.450
 and that's always so the 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.220
 key statement which also many films 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.500
 try to implement today 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.660
 because it kind of like that 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.280
 film industry with one of the topics is 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.470
 at least with all this 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.490
 romantic stuff and this movie 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.420
 somehow mirrors the money on one 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:16.660
 but not so childish way 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.489
 dramatically pushed there and that comes 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.320
 So you come over and look closely 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.430
 but that's just a small one 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.370
 hidden grave goods equal time would be the 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.250
 I really liked the film 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.170
 that a family movie was synonymous for 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.420
 grown-ups but it's really him 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:39.640
 so many children designed by me 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:45.249
 the blue tiger in the summer 75 15 points 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:49.039
 and as a film altogether only 65 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:54.770
 because I do not have that one then 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:58.389
 a little more so because it's just him 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.159
 nice but that was it 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.379
 that was in my opinion of the blue 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.749
 tiger i would like it if you like me 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.129
 say how you found him is if he is him 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.229
 ever seen if you have it to you 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.969
 will look at it or maybe 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.719
 again a movie comes into the cinema and you 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:17.449
 say next time 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:20.979
 and that was it here on cinema fans and 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.979
 bye bye
