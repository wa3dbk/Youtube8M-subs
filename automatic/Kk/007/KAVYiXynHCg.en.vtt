 hello in this opportunity I will teach you 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.680
 how to activate windows 7 view and server 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.830
 any version whether they are 32 or 64 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.840
 bits the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.719
 enter the link that I have left in the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.029
 description of the video we expect five 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.029
 seconds and we give you jump advertising 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.800
 then we download the file and what 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.800
 keep where you want 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.680

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.000

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.000

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.500
 the system 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.480

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.310

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.200

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.830

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.830

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.790
