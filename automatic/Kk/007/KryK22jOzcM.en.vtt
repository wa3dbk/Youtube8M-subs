00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
patterns as a matter of fact I gotta

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.499 
patterns as a matter of fact I gotta
admit<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.460> much<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.970> love<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> aesthetic

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and the idea at least in the first game

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.310 
and the idea at least in the first game
I<00:01:35.610> don't<00:01:36.210> feel<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.630> much<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> game<00:01:37.170> at

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
I don't feel like it's much of a game at

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.130 
I don't feel like it's much of a game at
all<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.579> what<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.900> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
all but I like what it's going for and I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.319 
all but I like what it's going for and I
would<00:01:40.320> love<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.799> see<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.090> except<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
would love to see that except for the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.260 
would love to see that except for the
fact<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.829> video<00:01:43.829> game<00:01:44.070> movies<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.759> never

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
fact that video game movies just never

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.889 
fact that video game movies just never
seem<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.140> get<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.500> right<00:01:47.329> because<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.780> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
seem to get it right because you have to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.280 
seem to get it right because you have to
add<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.530> much<00:01:49.710> more<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:51.000> something<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.049> make<00:01:52.259> it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
add so much more to something to make it

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.830 
add so much more to something to make it
a<00:01:52.500> movie<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:53.970> what<00:01:54.119> five<00:01:54.390> nights<00:01:54.630> at

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
a movie and I think what five nights at

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.300 
a movie and I think what five nights at
Freddy's<00:01:55.320> really<00:01:57.409> where<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> really<00:01:58.649> benefits

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
Freddy's really where it really benefits

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490 
Freddy's really where it really benefits

in<00:03:41.819> terms<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.510> execution<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.049> only

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
in terms of execution but the only

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.539 
in terms of execution but the only
reason<00:03:43.319> that<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.739> could<00:03:44.160> have<00:03:44.250> been<00:03:44.340> maze

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
reason that it could have been maze

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.400 
reason that it could have been maze
because<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:45.000> was<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.150> popular<00:03:45.540> franchise<00:03:45.989> right

movies and rights purchasing that that

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.449 
movies and rights purchasing that that
does<00:04:03.750> not<00:04:03.900> mean<00:04:04.139> a<00:04:04.170> movie<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.709> getting<00:04:04.859> no<00:04:05.160> this

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.970 
highly doubt that this will ever get

who cares you can't sell it that this is

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.080 
who cares you can't sell it that this is
a<00:04:15.900> via<00:04:16.049> game<00:04:16.200> to<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.410> mainstream<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:17.070> would<00:04:17.820> and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
a via game to the mainstream I would and

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.599 
a via game to the mainstream I would and
I<00:04:18.329> wanted<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.720> say<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:19.109> though<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.609> would

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
I wanted to say that though I would

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.399 
I wanted to say that though I would
almost<00:04:20.789> bank<00:04:21.209> on<00:04:21.419> that<00:04:21.599> being<00:04:21.870> it's<00:04:22.109> one

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
almost bank on that being it's one

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.100 
almost bank on that being it's one
strong<00:04:22.800> point<00:04:23.099> is<00:04:23.370> that<00:04:23.669> if<00:04:24.210> they<00:04:24.690> did<00:04:24.900> make<00:04:24.930> a

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
strong point is that if they did make a

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.530 
strong point is that if they did make a
movie<00:04:25.500> about<00:04:25.560> it

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
movie about it

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.480 
movie about it
almost<00:04:27.440> no<00:04:27.620> one<00:04:27.650> in<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:27.950> mainstream<00:04:28.160> would

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
almost no one in the mainstream would

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.050 
almost no one in the mainstream would
know<00:04:28.670> that<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:29.060> was<00:04:29.270> based<00:04:30.080> on<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.320> video<00:04:30.620> game

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
know that it was based on a video game

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.910 
know that it was based on a video game
so<00:04:32.060> if<00:04:32.420> they<00:04:32.720> did<00:04:32.930> happen<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.500> have<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.680> good

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
so if they did happen to have a good

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.910 
so if they did happen to have a good
script<00:04:34.600> they<00:04:35.600> think<00:04:36.230> if<00:04:36.320> they<00:04:36.530> can<00:04:36.590> get<00:04:36.830> away

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
script they think if they can get away

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.770 
script they think if they can get away
with<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.370> even<00:04:37.760> though<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.210> might<00:04:38.330> piss<00:04:38.600> off

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
with it even though it might piss off

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.440

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760
