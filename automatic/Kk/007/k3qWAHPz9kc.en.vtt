00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
here's a smiley face that I did and I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.120 
here's a smiley face that I did and I
was<00:00:26.369> just<00:00:26.550> playing<00:00:27.510> around<00:00:27.630> with<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> fences

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.200 

you<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:32.279> see<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.730> looks<00:00:32.790> pretty<00:00:33.059> cool

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you can see that it looks pretty cool

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.600 
you can see that it looks pretty cool
and<00:00:34.140> i'll<00:00:34.290> show<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:34.980> beyond<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> back

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and i'll show you just beyond the back

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.600 
and i'll show you just beyond the back
of<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.940> how<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.300> all<00:00:36.420> works<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:38.010> basically<00:00:38.460> I've

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
of it how it all works so basically I've

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.639 
of it how it all works so basically I've
got<00:00:38.760> all<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.120> Redstone<00:00:39.540> white<00:00:39.870> under<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:40.500> it

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
got all the Redstone white under here it

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.490 
got all the Redstone white under here it
comes<00:00:40.860> up<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.780> then<00:00:42.780> there's<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
comes up here and then there's all the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.850 
comes up here and then there's all the
repeaters<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.579> always<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.270> each<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.860> I

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
repeaters and it always up to each one I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.130 
repeaters and it always up to each one I
don't<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.910> why<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.090> one<00:00:48.390> isn't<00:00:48.600> wired<00:00:48.870> up

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
don't know why that one isn't wired up

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
don't know why that one isn't wired up
but<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.379> seems<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> still<00:00:49.980> work<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:52.879> when<00:00:53.879> you

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
but it seems to still work and when you

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.209 
but it seems to still work and when you
click<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.690> activates<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
click it it activates all of it and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.490 
click it it activates all of it and
pushes<00:00:57.000> everything<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:59.930> as<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.230> can<00:01:01.289> see

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
pushes everything out as you can see

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.920 
pushes everything out as you can see
everything's<00:01:02.340> highlighted<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.120> i<00:01:03.390> just

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
everything's highlighted now i just

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.170 
everything's highlighted now i just
realized<00:01:04.439> these<00:01:04.920> ain't<00:01:05.280> nothing<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:06.030> with

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
realized these ain't nothing to do with

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.020 
realized these ain't nothing to do with
it<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:06.479> why<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:06.869> ain't<00:01:06.990> letter<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.549> yeah

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it that's why they ain't letter so yeah

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.840 
it that's why they ain't letter so yeah
that's<00:01:09.630> how<00:01:09.840> they<00:01:10.049> work<00:01:10.400> that's<00:01:11.400> for<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.640> rock

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
that's how they work that's for the rock

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.510 
that's how they work that's for the rock
and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.200> one's<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.950> different<00:01:14.400> way<00:01:14.490> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and then this one's a different way of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.460 
and then this one's a different way of
doing<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> one's<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.600> slightly<00:01:16.080> more

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
doing it this one's like slightly more

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.550 
doing it this one's like slightly more
harder<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.450> layer<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
harder so you have to layer it up and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.230 
harder so you have to layer it up and
you<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> redstone<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
you have to get the redstone you have to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.300 
you have to get the redstone you have to
put<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.390> repeat<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.290> loses<00:01:22.409> power<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
put the repeat as if it loses power and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
put the repeat as if it loses power and
you<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.450> get<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.659> all<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
you just get it all the way up to the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.800 
you just get it all the way up to the
top<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.159> I've<00:01:26.520> done<00:01:26.580> double<00:01:27.360> repeaters

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
top and then I've done double repeaters

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.140 
top and then I've done double repeaters
there<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> didn't<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.520> use<00:01:29.759> loads

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
there just so I didn't have to use loads

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.219 
there just so I didn't have to use loads
redstone<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.909> yeah<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.930> does<00:01:34.200> look

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
redstone and yeah as you it does look

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.289 
redstone and yeah as you it does look
pretty<00:01:34.560> cool<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.070> there's<00:01:35.909> another<00:01:36.000> thing

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
pretty cool and there's another thing

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.649 
pretty cool and there's another thing
you<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.369> piston<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.150> I've<00:01:39.450> been

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
you can do with the piston so I've been

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.870 
you can do with the piston so I've been
working<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.409> haven't<00:01:41.250> got<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.490> fully

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
working on I haven't got it fully
