00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.399
 recorded with a cell phone 

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.240
 collects the conversation held on the ramp 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.770
 between the group of employees and josé luis vinas division general manager 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.770
 of airport services of america 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.909
 borja 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.909
 Today at 21 in Urdu- avenge 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.019
 it will be good for us 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.140
 the warning of piñazo 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.690
 for a long time to materialize 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.690
 but the site seemed like the intention was another 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.500
 going back to the volcano 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.610
 winter 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.960
 after selling 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.590
 of wolves 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.590
 well I would not have asked for an audit 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.980
 on the other hand 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.980
 newfound 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.240
 about forum meetings 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.400
 debrecen from hungary once 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.240
 I understand that they go hand in hand from one to one to one year 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.870
 he died in a rural area 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.250
 derived from the mother 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.320
 but when I'm not interested anymore 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.030
 I say government of Spain a great job as a dying venancio but not 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.030
 for vanity 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.660
 the same neighborhood alberdi babín dwells for each one 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.360
 a work value for the wedding 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.730
 but the novelty of Bergamo morality in large numbers 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.660
 when the group of employees 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.690
 to join their jobs and their positions are busy 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.670
 it had already happened more or less two hours 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.030
 when we arrived at the operation thing the flights to work the good had already 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.470
 other staff working on flights and did not allow access to 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.760
 aircraft 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.650
 then they told us to retire back to the offices 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.100
 there we retired and spent several hours 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.549
 almost until 7 o'clock at night 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.430
 and at about 7 at night they told us simply and simply that everything was 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.449
 well that it was no longer our homes and that we arrived the next day 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.049
 usual work schedule 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.489
 and that our request was going to make the past passes to the superiors tomorrow and where 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.579
 there is the matrix 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.330
 the next day on January 22, the entire group was dismissed 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.330
 each employee as he arrived at the americas airport 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.339
 even unemployed in those who were not on duty 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.739
 in the time when the species occurred 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.799
 but that adds 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.099
 habemus as they explain their 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.179
 But we were not even there 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:51.549
 the spokesman of the popular group work not even work group 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.049
 I was to know what the issue was that they allow me to 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.259
 it benefited 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:00.039
 José Luis Díaz had five years and nine months working in the company 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.529
 At the time of the dismissal, he was in charge of charge accounting 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:09.389
 says he regrets that at the time of the massive dismissal there was no 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.519
 contemplation some items were not observed 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.269
 to almost a month of the laws of the country after receiving this letter 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.929
 and know that I am no longer part of the row of america in atlanta 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.309
 I felt very sad because at the time of that dismissal I was already pregnant 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.549
 I had a high-risk pregnancy a triplet pregnancy 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.689
 Rodriguez then lost the pregnancy 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.779
 the so many of article 2 32 of the labor code establishes that it is null 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:40.090
 the eviction exercised by the employer during the gestation period of the 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.979
 worker 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:46.149
 and up to three months after the due date these moments the break 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:47.299
 labor 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.299
 alleging that he removed the one from Article 88 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.769
 percent 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.170
 no way 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.699
 incurring this one in a fairy 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:00.299
 that could indicate an ethical violation 88 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.679
 the report efe 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:04.859
 it is seen that more expenses 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:05.979
 laria libia 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.399
 initially they told us that the conflict had nothing to do with the 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:10.329
 drink 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.249
 then he narrated banana his son 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:14.409
 I would go back to their 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.509
 interested in talking about 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.279
 we are still waiting for an answer 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.629
 The truth is that the writer 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:23.449
 I ask you for the American home 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.900
 division of services 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.610
 before the first courtroom of work of the province santo domingo 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.620
 the lawyers representing the company 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.740
 state that the plaintiffs were dismissed by the exponent every time 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.680
 on January 22, 2008, they refused to perform the tasks 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.440
 for which they were contracted, negatively affecting the 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.650
 operations 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.110
 these were the same words expressed in the signed dismissal letter 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.190
 by josé luis briñas the general manager of the ana services division 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.830
 porters the canceled maintains although they did not break any mike law 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.830
 against them a great abuse was committed when firing them 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:06.599
 we do not want that 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.370
 first of all we grow 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.550
 Pallero experts praise that they were not denied illegally 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.919
 and abusive 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.280
 in addition to work benefits 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.940
 ask for the payment of one million pesos each under the allegation that America 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.440
 in which relax 'nole' was inscribed in the social security system and in the 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.440
 insurance of occupational risks and occupational diseases 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.999
 the parade 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.999
 it was a very unpleasant surprise 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.860
 the next hearing of the case is scheduled for February in the court of 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.159
 work of the province santo domingo 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:46.610
 the situation is unfortunate for both the company and employees 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.610
 We hope that the measures that Americans have taken and a way to coerce 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.979
 the right of an employee of pec and better benefits 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.439
 In an easy way 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.719
 so we say goodbye on this night as always thanks for joining us
