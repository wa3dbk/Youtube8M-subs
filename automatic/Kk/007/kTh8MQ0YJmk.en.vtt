Sentinel<00:00:05.130> runtime<00:00:05.670> drivers<00:00:06.600> now<00:00:06.990> the

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
Sentinel runtime drivers now the

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.049 
Sentinel runtime drivers now the
Sentinel<00:00:07.500> runtime<00:00:07.919> drivers<00:00:08.309> were<00:00:08.550> installed

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
Sentinel runtime drivers were installed

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.690 
Sentinel runtime drivers were installed
on<00:00:09.330> my<00:00:09.540> system<00:00:09.599> when<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.110> installed<00:00:10.590> avid<00:00:11.219> media

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
how I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and got

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.780 
how I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and got
rid<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.869> Sentinel<00:00:31.439> runtime<00:00:31.800> drivers<00:00:32.279> so

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
rid of the Sentinel runtime drivers so

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.040 
rid of the Sentinel runtime drivers so
first<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.180> course<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.480> might<00:00:33.630> think<00:00:33.870> you'll

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
first of course you might think you'll

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.170 
first of course you might think you'll
simply<00:00:34.290> come<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.739> your<00:00:35.309> control<00:00:35.670> panel<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
simply come to your control panel and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.030 
simply come to your control panel and
uninstall<00:00:37.050> from<00:00:37.350> programs<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.950> features

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
uninstall from programs and features

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.670 
uninstall from programs and features
well<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> did<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.540> Windows<00:00:39.809> 8.1<00:00:39.989> still

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
well I did that but Windows 8.1 still

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.500 
well I did that but Windows 8.1 still
was<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:40.950> satisfied<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.730> needed<00:00:42.030> these<00:00:42.239> in

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
was not satisfied it needed these in

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.690 
was not satisfied it needed these in
total<00:00:42.719> runtime<00:00:42.870> drivers<00:00:43.469> uninstalled<00:00:44.280> so

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
total runtime drivers uninstalled so

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.549 
total runtime drivers uninstalled so
after<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> bit<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.210> research<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:46.140> found<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
after a bit of research I found the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.830 
after a bit of research I found the
solution<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.640> would<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.539> come<00:00:48.719> to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
solution and that would be to come to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.930 
solution and that would be to come to
the<00:00:48.989> Sentinel<00:00:49.469> website<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.100> download<00:00:50.789> this

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the Sentinel website and download this

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.450 
the Sentinel website and download this
link<00:00:51.270> right<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:52.170> command-line<00:00:52.710> runtime

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
link right here the command-line runtime

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.850 
link right here the command-line runtime
installer<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.840> after<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.140> download<00:00:55.620> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
installer so after you download and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.220 
installer so after you download and
unzip<00:00:55.980> you'll<00:00:56.610> get<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.969> package<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.840> now

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
unzip you'll get this package here now

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.510 
unzip you'll get this package here now
it<00:00:58.320> looks<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:58.829> simply<00:00:59.160> run<00:00:59.340> this

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it looks like you can simply run this

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.130 
it looks like you can simply run this
but<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.850> actually<00:01:00.210> run<00:01:00.420> from<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> command

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
but it's actually run from the command

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.750 
but it's actually run from the command
of<00:01:01.199> mine<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:01.859> I'm<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.430> go<00:01:02.550> into

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
of mine now I'm not going to go into

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.429 
of mine now I'm not going to go into
great<00:01:02.789> detail<00:01:03.090> because<00:01:03.780> there's<00:01:03.930> already<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
great detail because there's already a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.130 
great detail because there's already a
video<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:05.040> YouTube<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:06.240> goes<00:01:06.659> into<00:01:06.930> great

video on YouTube that goes into great
detail<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.159> I'll<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.549> sure<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
detail for this and I'll be sure to the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.820

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
website in the video description but a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800 
website in the video description but a
basic<00:01:13.770> overview<00:01:13.890> would<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.909> you'd<00:01:15.450> need<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
basic overview would be you'd need to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.620 
basic overview would be you'd need to
come<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.290> start<00:01:16.770> page<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.220> open<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.420> a

come to your start page and open up a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.289 
come to your start page and open up a
command<00:01:19.049> prompt<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.860> we'll<00:01:20.070> simply<00:01:20.220> type<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.850> C

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
command prompt so we'll simply type in C

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.090 
command prompt so we'll simply type in C
a.m.<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.049> don't<00:01:22.200> even<00:01:22.350> need<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.650> hit<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> D

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
a.m. and I don't even need to hit the D

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.969 
a.m. and I don't even need to hit the D
but<00:01:23.759> I'll<00:01:23.880> hit<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> D<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.509> CMD<00:01:24.990> open<00:01:25.710> up<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
but I'll hit the D so CMD open up a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.010 
but I'll hit the D so CMD open up a
command<00:01:26.340> prompt<00:01:26.729> then<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.180> need<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> change

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
command prompt then we need to change

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.840 
command prompt then we need to change
the<00:01:28.409> directory<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.159> first<00:01:29.369> I'm<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.700> to
