00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.470 
in this situation I'm up against a good
heavy<00:03:00.860> assault<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:01.459> what<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.700> decide<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.060> do<00:03:02.300> is

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
heavy assault so what I decide to do is

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.589 
heavy assault so what I decide to do is
double<00:03:02.780> back<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.140> pre<00:03:03.739> fire<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.190> guy

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
double back and pre fire the guy

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.990 
double back and pre fire the guy
negating<00:03:05.599> his<00:03:05.750> advantage<00:03:06.459> but<00:03:07.459> a<00:03:07.489> very<00:03:07.760> simple

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
negating his advantage but a very simple

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.670 
negating his advantage but a very simple
thing<00:03:08.269> can<00:03:08.450> do<00:03:08.629> is<00:03:08.780> just<00:03:08.959> use<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.409> environment

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
thing can do is just use the environment

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.960 
thing can do is just use the environment
as<00:03:10.040> your<00:03:10.219> shield

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
as your shield

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.180 
as your shield
partial<00:03:11.420> cover<00:03:11.600> works<00:03:11.900> it's<00:03:12.500> as<00:03:12.710> simple<00:03:12.890> as

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
partial cover works it's as simple as

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.470 
partial cover works it's as simple as
that<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:15.500> another<00:03:16.070> very<00:03:16.160> popular<00:03:16.610> argument<00:03:17.000> is

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
that so another very popular argument is

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.420 
that so another very popular argument is
the<00:03:17.630> fact<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:17.990> people<00:03:18.530> would<00:03:18.650> attack<00:03:19.160> heavy

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
the fact that people would attack heavy

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.650 
the fact that people would attack heavy
assaults<00:03:19.790> from<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.030> back<00:03:20.210> and<00:03:20.390> they<00:03:20.510> would

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
assaults from the back and they would

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.600 
assaults from the back and they would
just<00:03:20.900> you<00:03:21.380> know<00:03:21.440> flip<00:03:21.800> around<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.400> kill
