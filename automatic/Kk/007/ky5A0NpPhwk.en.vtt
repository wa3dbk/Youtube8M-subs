00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.629 

so<00:00:00.269> corporal<00:00:00.719> update<00:00:01.319> I<00:00:01.350> took<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:02.100> logs<00:00:02.340> off

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
so corporal update I took the logs off

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.360 
so corporal update I took the logs off
of<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.030> 13-inch<00:00:03.589> put<00:00:04.589> them<00:00:04.680> on<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.830> 14<00:00:05.190> inch

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
of the 13-inch put them on the 14 inch

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.410 
of the 13-inch put them on the 14 inch
it<00:00:06.089> was<00:00:06.210> still<00:00:06.390> missing<00:00:06.569> too<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.560> went<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> my

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
it was still missing too so I went to my

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.160 
it was still missing too so I went to my
random<00:00:09.420> part<00:00:09.840> scrap<00:00:11.269> took<00:00:12.269> these<00:00:12.480> two<00:00:12.660> logs<00:00:12.870> so

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
random part scrap took these two logs so

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.400 
random part scrap took these two logs so
I<00:00:13.200> got<00:00:13.380> one<00:00:13.590> here<00:00:13.799> toe<00:00:14.190> they're<00:00:14.639> different<00:00:15.509> but

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
I got one here toe they're different but

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.750 
I got one here toe they're different but
I<00:00:16.440> got<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.650> same<00:00:16.800> whole<00:00:16.980> pattern<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.490> they<00:00:17.580> fit

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
I got the same whole pattern so they fit

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.260 
I got the same whole pattern so they fit
in<00:00:18.230> got<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> other<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.710> other<00:00:19.770> side

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
in got the other one on the other side

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.140 
in got the other one on the other side
so<00:00:21.270> now<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> somewhat<00:00:22.140> complete<00:00:22.500> drum

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
so now we have a somewhat complete drum

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.300 
so now we have a somewhat complete drum
the<00:00:24.150> only<00:00:24.539> problem<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.080> these<00:00:25.619> tension<00:00:26.039> rods<00:00:26.189> I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
the only problem is these tension rods I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.939 
the only problem is these tension rods I
have<00:00:26.840> which<00:00:27.840> are<00:00:27.960> from<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> group<00:00:28.529> percussion

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
have which are from a group percussion

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.189 
have which are from a group percussion
said<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> think<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:30.269> don't<00:00:30.570> fit<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.080> these

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
said I think they don't fit in these

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.400 
said I think they don't fit in these
lugs<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.030> I<00:00:33.030> might<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.750> replace<00:00:34.050> these

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
lugs so I might have to replace these

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.040 
lugs so I might have to replace these
lugs<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:36.210> rest<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.570> these<00:00:36.660> screw

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
lugs with the rest of these screw

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.850 
lugs with the rest of these screw
percussion<00:00:37.469> lugs<00:00:39.170> which<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.500> mean<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:40.800> not

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
percussion lugs which I mean it's not

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
percussion lugs which I mean it's not
the<00:00:40.980> biggest<00:00:41.250> deal<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.899> it's<00:00:42.899> kind<00:00:43.079> of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the biggest deal but it's kind of

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.080 
the biggest deal but it's kind of
annoying<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.100> I'll<00:00:44.489> probably<00:00:44.670> end<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:44.969> doing

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
annoying so I'll probably end up doing

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.319 
annoying so I'll probably end up doing
that<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:46.219> yeah<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> thing<00:00:48.000> that's<00:00:48.030> keeping

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that so yeah so the thing that's keeping

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.060 
that so yeah so the thing that's keeping
this<00:00:48.510> project<00:00:48.930> alive<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> fact<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:49.980> I

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
this project alive is the fact that I

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:02.840 
this project alive is the fact that I
have<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.520> old<00:00:50.820> group<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.449> cousin<00:00:52.370> snare<00:01:01.850> all

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
have this old group of cousin snare all

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.020 
have this old group of cousin snare all
the<00:01:03.090> actual<00:01:03.870> snare<00:01:04.080> hardware<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:05.220> what<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> use

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the actual snare hardware is what I use

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.630 
the actual snare hardware is what I use
for<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.390> snare<00:01:06.810> drum<00:01:07.080> project<00:01:07.590> right<00:01:08.430> there

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
for that snare drum project right there

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.160 
for that snare drum project right there
where<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.090> turned<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> Tama<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> us<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.020> there

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
where I turned the Tama to us in there

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.179 
where I turned the Tama to us in there
but<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.900> shell<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> hoops<00:01:13.680> these

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
but I have the shell and the hoops these

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740 
but I have the shell and the hoops these
hoops<00:01:14.400> will<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.150> drum<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
hoops will go to that drum in the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.840 
hoops will go to that drum in the
trigger<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.799> slow<00:01:17.040> starting<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.729> look

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
trigger so it's a slow starting to look

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.789 
trigger so it's a slow starting to look
like<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> floor<00:01:18.299> tom<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.930> don't<00:01:19.380> know<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.590> show

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
like a floor tom I don't know if I show

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.440 
like a floor tom I don't know if I show
this<00:01:19.950> yet<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.340> changed<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> logs<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
this yet but I changed all the logs to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.929 
this yet but I changed all the logs to
some<00:01:22.170> old<00:01:22.380> lugs<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.770> had<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.580> now<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> have

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
some old lugs that I had so now I have

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.030 
some old lugs that I had so now I have
these<00:01:24.060> old<00:01:24.270> floor<00:01:24.509> tom<00:01:24.720> leg<00:01:25.049> mounts<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.710> I

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
these old floor tom leg mounts and I

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.810 
these old floor tom leg mounts and I
have<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.520> flags<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.180> my<00:01:27.740> storage<00:01:28.740> attic<00:01:29.369> thing

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
have the flags in my storage attic thing

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.030 
have the flags in my storage attic thing
in<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.900> I'll<00:01:31.049> grab<00:01:31.259> those<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.920> them

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
in there so I'll grab those one of them

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.090 
in there so I'll grab those one of them
is<00:01:32.130> bent<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.810> unbend<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.290> then<00:01:34.829> we'll

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
is bent so unbend that and then we'll

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:57.180 
is bent so unbend that and then we'll
install<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.030> we'll<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.570> good<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.750> go

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.750 

all<00:01:57.910> right<00:01:58.120> so<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.330> got<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.720> mounts<00:01:59.110> on<00:01:59.320> I<00:01:59.830> was

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
all right so I got the mounts on I was

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.510 
all right so I got the mounts on I was
missing<00:02:01.120> two<00:02:01.330> of<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.510> big<00:02:01.750> washers<00:02:02.230> so<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.920> have

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
missing two of the big washers so I have

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.760 
missing two of the big washers so I have
to<00:02:03.610> use<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:04.240> small<00:02:04.750> one<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:06.690> for<00:02:07.690> tool<00:02:07.870> so<00:02:08.710> I'll

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
to use a small one for for tool so I'll

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.740 
to use a small one for for tool so I'll
replace<00:02:09.040> that<00:02:09.220> eventually<00:02:09.760> but<00:02:10.119> nothing<00:02:10.630> too

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
replace that eventually but nothing too

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.640 
replace that eventually but nothing too
crazy<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:12.190> one's<00:02:12.400> kind<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.670> misaligned<00:02:13.650> this

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
crazy this one's kind of misaligned this

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.650 
crazy this one's kind of misaligned this
one's<00:02:14.890> pretty<00:02:15.400> straight<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:17.230> one's

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
one's pretty straight and that one's

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.150 
one's pretty straight and that one's
pretty<00:02:19.660> straight<00:02:19.840> also<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.470> also<00:02:20.650> strained<00:02:21.010> out

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
pretty straight also I also strained out

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.950 
pretty straight also I also strained out
the<00:02:21.280> leg<00:02:21.460> this<00:02:21.640> was<00:02:21.790> kind<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.000> still<00:02:22.210> walky<00:02:22.660> but

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
the leg this was kind of still walky but

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.990 
the leg this was kind of still walky but
it's<00:02:23.800> good<00:02:23.950> enough<00:02:24.100> for<00:02:24.280> me<00:02:24.490> so<00:02:24.790> we'll<00:02:24.880> get

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
it's good enough for me so we'll get
