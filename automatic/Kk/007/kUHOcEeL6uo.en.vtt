00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.660
 It is composing a retreading system 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.969
 Recall is to the truck tire in 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.820
 this case already finished his first life 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.760
 useful is to reinstall it back to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.610
 put a new band to have a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.710
 second or third life the different 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.440
 large stages of receiving the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.539
 Pneumatic cleaning and preparation 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.930
 that tire for later its later 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.470
 verification in that initial verification 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.660
 the operator in ocular form reviews the 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.820
 tire so that it is persie has 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.220
 some damage that leaves it out of 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.790
 circuit and in that same inspection 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.460
 a review is also done 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.899
 electronics where it tries to detect 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.540
 microperforations which can 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.489
 influence if they are not seen in the future 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.489
 good recovery performance 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.850
 Once the tire was verified, we could 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.159
 see how this tire loses the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.310
 rubber remnant with which he entered the 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.680
 workshop is the scraping part once 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.150
 scraped that he put it at the level of 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.790
 according to the technical specifications 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.090
 of our technical notebooks that 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.190
 tire is passed a segmented to 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.090
 can do the link with this new 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.549
 band 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.460
 once segmented the tire receives 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.190
 this new band which through a 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.710
 machine that is called aceta is put 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.830
 that band with distributed voltage and 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.319
 homogeneous and we would say that tire 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.569
 with the preparation of what is called the 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:45.229
 mbe lopez would be ready to be put 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:47.569
 in those ovens called autoclaves where 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.300
 which there are for three hours and a 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:53.659
 average of 110 degrees that tire is 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.640
 vulcanized and that band returns to form 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.770
 part of that casing so that the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.100
 tire is ready for your second 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.100
 lifetime 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.700
 the recasting itself we can say that 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.830
 has a global benefit and a 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.600
 individual benefit the benefit 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.470
 individual is that the carrier 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.590
 allows you to reduce your costs because what 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.060
 we are selling today the paradigm in the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.290
 transport has changed and the user 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.180
 you need are kilometers no 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.460
 tires then in this way 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.250
 when the tire finishes its first 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.620
 life is added a second or third of 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.650
 This way you can lower costs 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.110
 operational and that would be your benefit 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.180
 individual and the collective benefit is 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.670
 what we say we can take advantage of all 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.590
 which is to work with the care of the environment 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.140
 environment every time we can 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.210
 make them perform more those tires are 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.030
 less tires that are discarded and for 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.440
 so they bring the benefit of care 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.620
 of the environment that we can all 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.620
 enjoy
