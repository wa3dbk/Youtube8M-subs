in depth so this is a brand new golf
ball<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.469> put<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.160> year<00:00:47.219> i<00:00:47.489> put<00:00:47.789> in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
ball that I put in this year i put in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.369 
ball that I put in this year i put in
actually<00:00:48.300> straight<00:00:48.660> away<00:00:48.870> as<00:00:48.989> soon<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.260> they

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
could soon as the USGA cleared this and

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.459 
could soon as the USGA cleared this and
see<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> irish<00:00:54.149> elderly<00:00:54.510> no<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> won<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
see one the irish elderly no I won the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.580 
see one the irish elderly no I won the
Irish<00:00:55.559> open<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.340> 20<00:00:56.910> x<00:00:57.120> ì<00:00:57.360> óù<00:00:57.390> very<00:00:58.289> him<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
Irish open with a 20 x ì óù very him to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.920 
Irish open with a 20 x ì óù very him to
it's<00:00:58.710> called<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> 20x<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.520> pie<00:00:59.789> okay<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.719> little

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it's called the 20x I pie okay a little

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.250 
it's called the 20x I pie okay a little
spinny<00:01:01.530> aversion<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> 20x<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:03.080> named<00:01:04.080> after

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
spinny aversion of the 20x I named after

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.539 
spinny aversion of the 20x I named after
my<00:01:04.470> cap<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:05.880> somewhere<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:07.680> resin

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
my cap I was in here somewhere the resin

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.740 
my cap I was in here somewhere the resin
platinum<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:10.290> slight<00:01:11.040> tweak<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.210> resin

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
platinum is a slight tweak on the resin

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.190 
platinum is a slight tweak on the resin
core<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.860> new<00:01:14.509> formula<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.750> resin

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
core so it's a new formula of resin

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.899 
core so it's a new formula of resin
hidden<00:01:16.530> inside<00:01:16.650> there<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> main<00:01:17.880> thing

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
hidden inside there but the main thing

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.170 
hidden inside there but the main thing
is<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:19.009> rocky<00:01:20.009> she<00:01:20.070> talks<00:01:20.340> about<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.790> in

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
is this rocky she talks about this is in

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.480 
is this rocky she talks about this is in
course<00:01:21.509> speed<00:01:21.869> lock<00:01:22.110> core<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.830> core

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
course speed lock core and the core

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.200 
course speed lock core and the core
actually<00:01:23.939> has<00:01:24.350> like<00:01:25.610> grooves<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> it's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
actually has like grooves on it it's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.120 
actually has like grooves on it it's
it's<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.659> 3d<00:01:28.200> cause<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.770> best<00:01:28.890> way<00:01:29.100> of

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
it's a 3d cause the best way of

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.360 
it's a 3d cause the best way of
explaining<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:29.970> that

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
explaining it and that

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.140 
explaining it and that
locks<00:01:30.730> together<00:01:31.060> with<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.660> next<00:01:31.990> layer<00:01:32.230> and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
locks together with the next layer and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.630 
locks together with the next layer and
what<00:01:34.150> it<00:01:34.270> does<00:01:34.510> is<00:01:34.870> it<00:01:34.900> it<00:01:35.860> doesn't<00:01:36.220> lose

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
what it does is it it doesn't lose

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.530 
what it does is it it doesn't lose
energy<00:01:37.060> like<00:01:37.750> previous<00:01:38.670> cause<00:01:39.670> half<00:01:40.060> that's

the golf ball can worry either

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.210 
the golf ball can worry either

don't know how higher moi and things
like<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.370> but<00:02:03.730> very<00:02:04.270> simple<00:02:04.690> for<00:02:04.720> me<00:02:05.160> I

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
picked up yardage a couple of yards on

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.290 
picked up yardage a couple of yards on
the<00:02:08.770> drive<00:02:08.980> which<00:02:09.190> doesn't<00:02:09.520> sound<00:02:09.700> like<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:09.970> lot

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
the drive which doesn't sound like a lot

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.840 
the drive which doesn't sound like a lot
but<00:02:10.360> in<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:10.929> day<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.170> age<00:02:11.350> that's<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.710> big<00:02:11.950> oh

my<00:02:15.370> point<00:02:15.760> exactly<00:02:16.120> we<00:02:16.810> love<00:02:17.020> group<00:02:17.230> button<00:02:17.680> up

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
my point exactly we love group button up

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.360 
my point exactly we love group button up
against<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:19.630> USGA<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.440> RNA<00:02:20.770> always<00:02:21.010> said

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
against the USGA in the RNA always said

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.400 
against the USGA in the RNA always said
you<00:02:21.610> know<00:02:21.670> rules<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.570> we<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.990> know<00:02:23.080> we<00:02:23.200> can't

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
you know rules that we you know we can't

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.720 
you know rules that we you know we can't
break<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.920> walls<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:26.290> we've<00:02:26.950> got<00:02:27.220> more

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
break the walls and we've got more

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.060 
break the walls and we've got more
control<00:02:28.240> around<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.600> greens<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.010> a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
control around the greens so it's a

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.620 
control around the greens so it's a
perfect<00:02:30.250> scenario<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.090> very<00:02:31.390> rarely

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
perfect scenario and that very rarely

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.580 
perfect scenario and that very rarely
happens<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.530> I'm<00:02:33.240> really<00:02:34.240> excited<00:02:34.590> about

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
happens and and I'm really excited about

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.860 
happens and and I'm really excited about
all<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.700> excited<00:02:37.180> about<00:02:37.239> new<00:02:37.480> product

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
all this excited about new product

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.840 
all this excited about new product
because<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.320> rarely<00:02:38.530> see<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:39.190> jump<00:02:39.670> in

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
because we rarely see a jump in

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.699 
because we rarely see a jump in
performance<00:02:40.000> usually<00:02:40.600> it's<00:02:40.959> very<00:02:41.290> small

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
performance usually it's very small

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.340 
performance usually it's very small
incremental<00:02:42.370> usually<00:02:43.209> ask<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.780> which<00:02:44.050> balls

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
incremental usually ask you which balls

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.860 
incremental usually ask you which balls
right<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:45.100> know<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.550> lot<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.760> not<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> lot<00:02:46.690> but

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
right I know a lot of not a lot but

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.140 
right I know a lot of not a lot but
somewheres<00:02:47.350> resist<00:02:47.980> from<00:02:48.640> switching<00:02:48.820> walls

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
somewheres resist from switching walls

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.310 
somewheres resist from switching walls
because<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.630> guys<00:02:49.720> are<00:02:49.900> creatures<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.260> habit

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
because you guys are creatures of habit

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.449 
because you guys are creatures of habit
and<00:02:50.860> we<00:02:51.459> are<00:02:51.580> so<00:02:52.300> I<00:02:52.330> understand<00:02:52.900> but<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:54.010> what

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
made you choose the platinum over the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.530 
made you choose the platinum over the
black<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:57.160> mean<00:02:57.370> obviously<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:58.180> just<00:02:58.360> worked

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
black I mean obviously it just worked

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.510 
black I mean obviously it just worked

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
and gave me he's he's sitting right here

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.240 
and gave me he's he's sitting right here
we<00:03:07.060> should<00:03:07.120> grill<00:03:07.480> him<00:03:07.660> but<00:03:07.959> yeah<00:03:08.170> he<00:03:08.830> turns<00:03:09.070> up

using<00:03:17.739> right<00:03:17.950> he's<00:03:18.610> got<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> little<00:03:19.180> higher

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
using right he's got a little higher

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.520 
using right he's got a little higher
club<00:03:20.050> head<00:03:20.260> speed

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
club head speed

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.220 
club head speed
a<00:03:21.680> little<00:03:22.550> higher<00:03:22.700> spin-off<00:03:23.240> his<00:03:23.420> driver<00:03:23.930> I

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
a little higher spin-off his driver I

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.250 
a little higher spin-off his driver I
needed<00:03:24.680> any<00:03:25.010> help<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.600> platinums<00:03:27.050> got<00:03:27.230> a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
needed any help so the platinums got a

needed any help so the platinums got a
little<00:03:27.440> bit<00:03:27.680> more<00:03:27.800> spin<00:03:28.100> off<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.250> driver<00:03:28.959> and

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
little bit more spin off the driver and

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.380 
little bit more spin off the driver and
rock<00:03:30.650> knows<00:03:30.920> why<00:03:31.370> he's<00:03:31.850> talking<00:03:32.120> about<00:03:32.209> he

something that does if i miss get the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.570 
something that does if i miss get the
driver<00:04:30.560> because<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:30.860> fall<00:04:31.040> out<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.370> sky

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
driver because it fall out of the sky

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.409 
driver because it fall out of the sky
does<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:32.479> vary<00:04:32.690> off<00:04:32.890> sideways<00:04:33.890> and<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:34.880> and

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
does it vary off sideways and so and

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:36.640 
does it vary off sideways and so and
it's<00:04:35.540> trying<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.840> find<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.080> good<00:04:36.229> balance<00:04:36.290> as

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
well because I I like that balance in

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.770 
well because I I like that balance in
gulf<00:04:40.280> between<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.940> science<00:04:41.390> and<00:04:41.660> what<00:04:42.370> so<00:04:43.780> we

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
gulf between the science and what so we

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.029 
gulf between the science and what so we
can<00:04:44.960> get<00:04:45.050> all<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.200> science<00:04:45.620> we<00:04:45.650> want<00:04:45.919> and

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
can get all the science we want and

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.260 
can get all the science we want and
that's<00:04:46.160> getting<00:04:46.310> cooler<00:04:46.550> and<00:04:46.640> cooler<00:04:46.850> people

a<00:05:03.500> little<00:05:03.560> bit<00:05:03.740> about<00:05:03.950> frame<00:05:04.450> ultimately

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
a little bit about frame ultimately

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.690 
a little bit about frame ultimately
though<00:05:05.840> I<00:05:06.110> gotta<00:05:06.380> pick<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:06.620> arm<00:05:06.950> high<00:05:07.220> side<00:05:07.550> of

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
though I gotta pick the arm high side of

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.950 
though I gotta pick the arm high side of
place<00:05:07.910> you<00:05:08.390> know<00:05:08.479> it's<00:05:08.600> like<00:05:08.660> somebody

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
place you know it's like somebody

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.870 
place you know it's like somebody
thinking<00:05:09.440> about<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.770> swing<00:05:09.919> let's<00:05:10.669> the

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
thinking about the swing let's the

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.670 
thinking about the swing let's the
lesson<00:05:11.240> again<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:11.870> gotta<00:05:12.050> forget<00:05:12.380> about<00:05:12.440> that

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
lesson again you gotta forget about that

lesson again you gotta forget about that
yeah<00:05:13.220> go<00:05:13.550> play<00:05:13.580> golf<00:05:13.940> but<00:05:14.240> we<00:05:14.390> need<00:05:14.570> to<00:05:14.660> utilize

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
yeah go play golf but we need to utilize

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.600 
yeah go play golf but we need to utilize
both<00:05:15.260> and<00:05:15.500> I<00:05:15.560> think<00:05:15.770> it's<00:05:15.890> important<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.430> do

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
both and I think it's important to do

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.290 
both and I think it's important to do
that<00:05:16.789> to<00:05:17.050> perfect<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.229> equipment<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:18.919> under

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
that to perfect the equipment and under

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.930 
that to perfect the equipment and under
and<00:05:19.419> whites<00:05:20.229> good<00:05:20.530> or<00:05:20.650> bad<00:05:20.800> you<00:05:21.009> and<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.819> how

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
and whites good or bad you and and how

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.240 
and whites good or bad you and and how
many<00:05:22.000> are<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.419> drive<00:05:23.229> when<00:05:23.560> you<00:05:23.889> said<00:05:24.069> it<00:05:24.159> was

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
many are to drive when you said it was

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.490 
many are to drive when you said it was
nothing<00:05:24.789> I<00:05:24.970> thought<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.449> was<00:05:25.539> more<00:05:25.900> rock<00:05:26.229> scene

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
nothing I thought it was more rock scene

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.640 
nothing I thought it was more rock scene
it's<00:05:26.710> like<00:05:26.830> 122<00:05:27.310> yards<00:05:28.229> something<00:05:29.229> off<00:05:29.590> a

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
it's like 122 yards something off a

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.119 
it's like 122 yards something off a
driver<00:05:30.039> he<00:05:30.430> says<00:05:31.319> averaging<00:05:32.319> out<00:05:32.440> about<00:05:32.590> 3d

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
driver he says averaging out about 3d

driver he says averaging out about 3d
three<00:05:33.550> yards<00:05:34.020> extra<00:05:35.020> on<00:05:35.139> shorter<00:05:35.889> eyes<00:05:36.009> like

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
three yards extra on shorter eyes like

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.790 
three yards extra on shorter eyes like
99<00:05:36.580> which<00:05:37.270> is<00:05:37.389> up<00:05:37.509> to<00:05:37.659> life<00:05:37.840> which<00:05:38.349> is<00:05:38.379> a<00:05:38.500> huge

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
99 which is up to life which is a huge

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.020 
99 which is up to life which is a huge
amount<00:05:39.449> that's<00:05:40.449> a<00:05:40.569> massive<00:05:40.810> jump<00:05:41.849> what's<00:05:42.849> nice

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
amount that's a massive jump what's nice

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.300 
amount that's a massive jump what's nice
about<00:05:43.060> that<00:05:43.389> is<00:05:43.599> I<00:05:43.840> don't<00:05:43.900> have<00:05:44.110> to<00:05:44.379> utilize

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
about that is I don't have to utilize

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.369 
about that is I don't have to utilize
that<00:05:45.490> extra<00:05:46.060> yardage<00:05:46.360> but<00:05:46.900> I<00:05:46.930> know<00:05:47.020> it's<00:05:47.229> in

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:47.379 
that extra yardage but I know it's in

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.529 
that extra yardage but I know it's in
there<00:05:47.409> if<00:05:47.680> I<00:05:47.830> need<00:05:48.250> it<00:05:48.280> yeah<00:05:48.639> and<00:05:49.030> so<00:05:49.300> now<00:05:49.330> you

can play within yourself swing a little
easier<00:05:52.719> right<00:05:53.289> and<00:05:53.580> still<00:05:54.580> be<00:05:54.699> right<00:05:54.849> where<00:05:55.000> I

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
easier right and still be right where I

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.320 
easier right and still be right where I
was<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.240> for<00:05:55.919> as<00:05:56.919> I<00:05:57.099> get<00:05:57.250> older<00:05:57.280> I<00:05:57.610> need<00:05:57.909> that<00:05:58.120> I
