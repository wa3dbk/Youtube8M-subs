00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 Looks good, I'm going today. 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.059
 make a recipe that I tried there 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.050
 in Bethlehem which is the risotto of filet 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.450
 competitors 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.219
 I just tried this recipe at all 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.460
 How much is the place on the internet? I did not find it. 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.050
 no recipe that looks like a 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.810
 ingredient I wanted so I 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.570
 I decided to create something and try 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.390
 get as close to the taste as possible 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.130
 of what I experienced there in Bethlehem then 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.940
 I'll show you how step by step 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.010
 a graduating steak risotto go there 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.480
 good then to get the ingredients 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.960
 are 300 grams of minced rice tar 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.489
 of other two cups 300 grams 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.920
 different with a tablespoon of butter or 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.860
 margarine seasoning to taste 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.500
 2 cloves garlic and half chopped onion 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.899
 so to start a pot we'll go 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.350
 add a spoonful of margarine 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:03.409
 Let's add half chopped onion and 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.510
 two to three cloves of garlic squeezed 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.740
 applied later we will leave 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.770
 to gild 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.470
 Let's add about 300 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.799
 grams of rump each you can 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.250
 add another here in your preference 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.340
 now we'll get it right and leave the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.530
 beef cooking 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.900
 good then you can temper the tablet 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.939
 meat or with a seasoning 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.040
 you like specific 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.189
 I used yesterday, Felipe the landlord that I 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.960
 I have meat but you can use broth 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.180
 good common meat there, just fiddle with me 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.829
 I'm going to work and let the meat cook. 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.659
 for a while and after the meat has already 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.500
 had cooked we will add 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.509
 the rice 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.979
 I used a one and a half cup of rice 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.899
 so you can use both rice 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.579
 risotto as the common rice and olive oil 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.409
 with 10 18 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.490
 the taste is the same will only change the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.600
 looks right 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.640
 so I came back, now the water is 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.160
 proportional then a support cup for 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.560
 2 thay I used a half cup of rice 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.390
 so I used three glasses of water 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.640
 there is only we will also leave 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.860
 rice cooking as soon as haiti goes 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.230
 cooked water all and co 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.959
 We'll add Corinthians with 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.870
 300 grams of customers 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.760
 Just mix it with the fire, very small. 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.260
 frequent staying warm is just like 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.720
 all our risotto and then you can 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.540
 leave it in two ways to leave it but 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.489
 this is the most consistent right 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.830
 or you can add a bit of 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.810
 milk or a little cream 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.180
 I presented a little more seasoning is 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.590
 only you are kidding and if you 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.720
 add a little milk the cream of 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.850
 milk it will get more wet and 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.370
 more slacker with risotto face 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.860
 you have both options leave him like this 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.790
 but consistent or add a 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.769
 a little milk and leave him more 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.769
 you put on the plate 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.560
 bottom and it gets really good both ways 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.120
 It's going to be tasty, just consistency. 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.370
 his that will be different 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.930
 I let it last a little harder and 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.329
 more consistent to mount the dish 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.790
 cute for you but I tried 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.390
 both ways people look really good 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.970
 just as it is warm and then I memorized the 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.760
 plate with a little bit of spring onion and then 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.370
 Are you ready to serve a delicious? 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.180
 good so that's was much like the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.850
 flavor 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.680
 I loved it, it's a recipe like ours. 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.290
 and he says he thinks it's a 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.430
 sophisticated thing and it's super time to 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.069
 So I hope that you guys 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.540
 try at home and like to leave 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.200
 here in the comments 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.200
 A kiss, bye.
