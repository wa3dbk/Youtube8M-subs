they've<00:02:09.670> hard-coded<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.390> new<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:14.730> new<00:02:15.730> um

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
they've hard-coded a new a new um

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
they've hard-coded a new a new um
texture<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.260> because<00:02:19.440> they<00:02:19.739> have

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
