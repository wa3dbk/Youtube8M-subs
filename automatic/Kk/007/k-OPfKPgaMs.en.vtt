00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.220
 hello guys i'm back here with a video 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.050
 different from the usual because in the last one 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.730
 period you've never seen me do 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.029
 video of the genre but this is the first one 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.610
 so we're at the first unboxing video for 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.930
 you for me and this comes from the fact that 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.689
 many of you have contacted me in 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.329
 last days to ask me braker what 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 according to you the best motherboard 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.559
 precisely for the price I can 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.750
 go buy and here we have one 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.030
 answer I tell you that even today the first 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.070
 video we will see a motherboard 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.449
 compatible with amd la processors 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.129
 next week we will see that 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.079
 compatible for the intel so from 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.640
 try to please everyone 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.910
 the motherboard I want to talk about 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.309
 today it is precisely a card 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.309
 compatible for amd processors on 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.239
 socket am3 said this the name 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.909
 of the card and 970 gaming is a card 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.860
 msi and I must say that I found it a lot 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.620
 performing for the cost is around 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.440
 100 euros in theory I don't remember with 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.600
 precision but offers a lot of advantages 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.340
 among which we can go and see 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.430
 which supports all the processors of the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.800
 fx series support for overclocking of 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.920
 board processors and two pci slots 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.620
 express 2.0 to allow you to connect 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.320
 more than one amd video card on the road 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.620
 this mother scale offers us four slots 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.480
 dedicated to the ddr3 ram and the la 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.330
 function to withstand ram frequencies 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.720
 up to 2133 if in overclocking 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.760
 otherwise up to 1.866 if not having 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.760
 rigged therefore allows to install 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:53.310
 up to 32 GB of ram up to six SATA ports 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.230
 3 supports 4 usb 3.0 and 14 usb 2.0 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.570
 he also provided killer technology 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.310
 and 2,200 game networking which there 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.740
 will allow us to improve ours 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.840
 network performance without forgetting 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.540
 who also provided 8- inch HD audio 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.340
 channels 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.229
 inside the box we can also 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.000
 find various objects that can 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.580
 therefore be useful for the little ones 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.080
 accessories such as a body 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.200
 for the various outputs that the company provides us with 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:24.530
 motherboard itself a cable perloz there 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:34.190
 some connecting cables some 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:38.150
 stickers the drivers disk the guide 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.480
 user a mega sticker this time 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.400
 always of m6 and finally questop reports 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.320
 which also allows us to let people know 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.970
 to the surrounding people who run around it 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.980
 around and we have to do we are 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.250
 playing PC and alerting you how 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.250
 never 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.160
 we therefore had the opportunity a 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.400
 all together to see through this 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.060
 video what is the motherboard 970 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.130
 msi gaming is a sphere but I repeat it is 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.070
 compatible with all amd processors 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.590
 on socket am3 more and more on all 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.630
 fx series processors 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.150
 having said that I remind you that the next one 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.530
 another video will always be released 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.750
 to recommend another motherboard 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.660
 which is a great product for the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.180
 quality and price, however, that offers this 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.709
 time on intel systems 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.060
 for all information as always vi 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.590
 however, I invite you to look at the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.600
 description in the channel because you will find 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.940
 all the useful links that will be able to you 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.580
 drive not just to the page of 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.700
 msi but also to the store from which I have 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.350
 purchased these two motherboards 19 70 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.540
 and one that I will reveal to you next 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.430
 week because precisely I am 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.920
 found very well and I don't see why not 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.080
 advise you already that we are boys 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.730
 let me also know what you think of 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.019
 this type of video would do you 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.049
 pleasure if inside my channel 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.970
 insert videos related to the video 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.340
 play PCs that maybe they can 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.840
 include unboxing or directly 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.120
 show you what I buy 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.310
 promptly you need to know directly 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.840
 in the comments and remember that for 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.190
 any questions to them 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.190
 curiosity though
