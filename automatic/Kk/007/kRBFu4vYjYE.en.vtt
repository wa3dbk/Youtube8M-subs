00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:04.670 
okay now we have reassembled the order

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.130 
okay now we have reassembled the order
assembly<00:00:05.359> for<00:00:05.720> the<00:00:05.899> Toro<00:00:06.109> 421<00:00:06.859> snow<00:00:07.099> blower

there's a few things to note you want to
leave<00:00:11.780> these<00:00:12.470> bearing<00:00:13.460> mount<00:00:13.670> bolts<00:00:14.180> and<00:00:14.530> here

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
leave these bearing mount bolts and here

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.950 
leave these bearing mount bolts and here
is<00:00:16.160> just<00:00:16.430> slightly<00:00:16.700> loose<00:00:17.090> while<00:00:17.420> you<00:00:17.570> install

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
is just slightly loose while you install

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.689 
is just slightly loose while you install
the<00:00:18.610> complete<00:00:19.610> auger<00:00:19.850> assembly<00:00:21.190> and<00:00:22.190> back

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
the complete auger assembly and back

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.150 
the complete auger assembly and back
into<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.060> housing<00:00:23.619> that<00:00:24.619> will<00:00:24.740> help<00:00:24.830> it<00:00:24.980> line

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
into the housing that will help it line

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.010 
into the housing that will help it line
up<00:00:25.190> better<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:26.510> can<00:00:26.630> just<00:00:26.810> snug<00:00:26.990> them

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
up better and you can just snug them

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.840 
up better and you can just snug them
down<00:00:27.140> their<00:00:28.039> carriage<00:00:28.340> bolts<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.600> if<00:00:29.779> you

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
down their carriage bolts so if you

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.689 
down their carriage bolts so if you
don't<00:00:31.850> try<00:00:32.119> to<00:00:32.149> put<00:00:32.390> them<00:00:32.509> in<00:00:32.659> until<00:00:33.609> after<00:00:34.609> you

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
don't try to put them in until after you

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:35.979 
don't try to put them in until after you
have<00:00:34.819> the<00:00:34.940> auger<00:00:35.089> assembly<00:00:35.269> and<00:00:35.749> you'll<00:00:35.839> have

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
have the auger assembly and you'll have

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.290 
have the auger assembly and you'll have
a<00:00:36.019> pretty<00:00:36.440> hard<00:00:36.710> time<00:00:36.949> being<00:00:37.850> able<00:00:37.969> to<00:00:38.120> tighten

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
a pretty hard time being able to tighten

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.799 
a pretty hard time being able to tighten
them<00:00:38.510> down<00:00:38.539> so<00:00:39.109> I'd<00:00:39.829> suggest<00:00:40.010> in<00:00:40.399> that<00:00:40.809> the

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
them down so I'd suggest in that the

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.860 
them down so I'd suggest in that the
other<00:00:41.960> thing<00:00:42.229> there's<00:00:42.769> a<00:00:42.889> washer<00:00:43.489> between<00:00:44.359> the

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
other thing there's a washer between the

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.399 
other thing there's a washer between the
pulley<00:00:45.079> and<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:46.269> bearing<00:00:47.269> so<00:00:47.600> just<00:00:48.109> make<00:00:48.229> sure

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
pulley and the bearing so just make sure

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.439 
pulley and the bearing so just make sure
you<00:00:48.499> get<00:00:48.589> that<00:00:48.769> in<00:00:48.829> there<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:50.120> gotta<00:00:50.269> put<00:00:50.389> the

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
you get that in there you gotta put the

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.629 
you get that in there you gotta put the
key<00:00:50.569> way<00:00:50.719> back<00:00:50.960> in<00:00:51.229> then<00:00:52.159> you<00:00:52.219> put<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.459> pulley

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:52.639 
key way back in then you put the pulley

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:54.279 
key way back in then you put the pulley
on<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.209> you<00:00:53.420> want<00:00:53.539> it<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.780> look<00:00:53.870> like<00:00:54.049> that<00:00:54.229> and

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
on and you want it to look like that and

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.389 
on and you want it to look like that and
it's<00:00:54.649> done<00:00:54.709> basically<00:00:55.429> flush<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:57.620> then<00:00:58.039> you

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
it's done basically flush and then you

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.000 
it's done basically flush and then you
have<00:00:58.549> to<00:00:58.670> tighten<00:00:58.879> these<00:00:59.559> nuts<00:01:00.559> I<00:01:02.920> have<00:01:03.920> the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
have to tighten these nuts I have the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.280 
have to tighten these nuts I have the
squareheads<00:01:04.520> on<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.850> pulley<00:01:05.110> which<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:06.200> had

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
squareheads on the pulley which you had

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.360 
squareheads on the pulley which you had
to<00:01:06.380> take<00:01:06.530> off

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
to take off

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.120 
to take off
I<00:01:07.600> didn't<00:01:08.600> demonstrate<00:01:08.810> taking<00:01:09.470> them<00:01:09.560> off<00:01:09.710> but

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
I didn't demonstrate taking them off but

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.780 
I didn't demonstrate taking them off but
you<00:01:10.580> use<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.730> 5/16<00:01:11.540> wrench<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.580> some<00:01:13.580> chain

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
you use a 5/16 wrench and some chain

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.840 
you use a 5/16 wrench and some chain
locks<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.480> can<00:01:14.660> usually<00:01:14.840> get<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.320> eat

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
locks and you can usually get it eat

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.250 
locks and you can usually get it eat
they<00:01:16.850> do<00:01:16.910> make<00:01:17.120> sockets<00:01:17.600> for<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:17.900> I<00:01:17.930> just

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
they do make sockets for that I just

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.550 
they do make sockets for that I just
don't<00:01:18.440> have<00:01:18.590> one<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.670> anyway<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:20.690> now<00:01:20.840> we're

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
don't have one so anyway so now we're

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.690 
don't have one so anyway so now we're
back<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:22.300> what<00:01:23.300> it<00:01:23.420> should<00:01:23.450> work<00:01:24.380> like<00:01:24.710> which

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
back to what it should work like which

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.260 
back to what it should work like which
is<00:01:25.730> spins<00:01:26.510> nicely<00:01:27.970> just<00:01:28.970> like<00:01:29.120> that<00:01:29.330> so<00:01:31.270> anyway

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
is spins nicely just like that so anyway

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.440 
is spins nicely just like that so anyway
I<00:01:32.540> think<00:01:32.810> this<00:01:33.110> concludes<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.590> series<00:01:34.010> I<00:01:34.790> don't

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
I think this concludes a series I don't

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.360 
I think this concludes a series I don't
think<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.230> need<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:36.590> show<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:36.800> how<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.100> put

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
think that I need to show you how to put

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.670 
think that I need to show you how to put
your<00:01:37.490> snow<00:01:37.750> put<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.900> snowblower<00:01:39.380> back

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
your snow put the snowblower back

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.250 
your snow put the snowblower back
together<00:01:39.920> for<00:01:40.490> being<00:01:41.150> split<00:01:41.510> because<00:01:41.900> it's

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
together for being split because it's

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.470 
together for being split because it's
very<00:01:42.440> straightforward<00:01:42.800> on<00:01:43.430> this<00:01:43.970> particular

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
very straightforward on this particular

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.410 
very straightforward on this particular
model<00:01:44.630> it's<00:01:45.190> three<00:01:46.190> bolts<00:01:46.460> on<00:01:46.580> each<00:01:46.670> side<00:01:46.700> and

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
model it's three bolts on each side and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.110 
model it's three bolts on each side and
then<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.780> bottom<00:01:48.050> cover<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:48.980> belt<00:01:49.880> cover

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
then the bottom cover and the belt cover

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.480 
then the bottom cover and the belt cover
now<00:01:50.840> would<00:01:51.080> be<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.230> great<00:01:51.500> time<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.800> make<00:01:52.370> sure

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
now would be a great time to make sure

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.770 
now would be a great time to make sure
your<00:01:52.610> belts<00:01:52.850> are<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.030> good<00:01:53.120> condition<00:01:53.600> and

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
your belts are in good condition and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.940 
your belts are in good condition and
that<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.080> don't<00:01:54.170> have<00:01:54.290> any<00:01:54.440> other<00:01:54.590> bearings

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
that you don't have any other bearings

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.000 
that you don't have any other bearings
that<00:01:55.010> are<00:01:55.130> bad<00:01:55.870> especially<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:57.170> auger

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
that are bad especially the auger

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.950 
that are bad especially the auger
bearings<00:01:58.520> on<00:01:58.729> each<00:01:58.880> side<00:01:59.150> of<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.479> auger<00:01:59.810> in

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
bearings on each side of the auger in

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.770 
bearings on each side of the auger in
the<00:02:00.050> front<00:02:00.320> mine<00:02:00.979> we're<00:02:01.190> fine<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:01.820> we're<00:02:02.659> gonna

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
the front mine we're fine so we're gonna

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
the front mine we're fine so we're gonna
have<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.020> mess<00:02:03.800> with<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:03.979> today<00:02:05.800> anyway

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
have to mess with that today anyway

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.550 
have to mess with that today anyway
