00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.350
 a product 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.290
 pop 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.540
 Of course 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.460
 altogether the main window of mega who bonus x 2 is formed by three 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.219
 different parts the area on the left is the one destined for the ticket 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:15.889
 week 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.980
 and the space to fill our forecast on the right we find the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.160
 area of ​​the conditions how holy a series of filters to lower our 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.400
 combinations and more to the right though the space meant for the calculations of 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.830
 the bets and the statistics also in the upper part we find 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.260
 some drop-down menus to access advanced options among them is 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.000
 whole all 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.800
 through which we can update the program database in a way 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.870
 manual joao tomás rica if you are connected to the internet this serves 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.150
 example to load the ticket each week 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.990
 there are also two boxes to choose the day because by default we are 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.650
 open the last day we use and a series of buttons to open files 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.060
 new or that we already have in the computer and to keep them 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.770
 but the best way to learn how to use the program is with an example for it 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.510
 let's fill in with ticket 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.750
 we can do it manually by clicking on each of the signs we want 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.390
 we can also use the three buttons on the bottom 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.570
 the step places a sign every time the most logical at least 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.060
 the least eliminates them in the reverse order and the filled center button was remove 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.900
 the 42 ignacio placing in each box or on the less we can remove the 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.650
 points to 1 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.670
 for our people we are going to use this combination with three signs 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.960
 physical day 11 triples and we also select a fixed for the match 15 p 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.450
 to the right with the test calculation button we can check the price 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.409
 of the forecast the next step is to eliminate bets that do not meet the 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.680
 conditions that we are going to establish 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.460
 in this case we enter groups the window opens explaining about the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.590
 matches condition we tell you that six or seven are variants of 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.580
 which three or four are docile we calculate that the number of 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.799
 bets has dropped a lot 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:17.159
 but since it's still expensive we're going to use the column filter the seventh is 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.010
 condition serves to ask the program for a series of successes on the signs 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.469
 that we forecast for example these estimated beds 5 6 hits in three 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.739
 casinos 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.780
 thus the combinations that do not fulfill the condition are eliminated now the price 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.560
 it has been lowered even more but it is not enough so let's use the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.049
 reduction and is further injured for example reduction to twelve 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.169
 with this the program only keeps the necessary combinations for 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:49.529
 guarantee us the 12 we re-calculate tivemos the price differences to the 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:53.649
 direct with the conditions that with the reduction now we only have left 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:57.679
 record the attractive bet to link it through quini list targeted camps 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.249
 ap but only three minutes for the rest how easy it is to make a combination 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:08.789
 now it's just a matter of getting tested the rector a little good 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.629
 imagination price 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.579
 anyway, remember that you have more videos to see more 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.920
 detail the different forecasting conditions wording conditions
