Oh along with the roadbed will be using
the<00:00:42.310> Ross<00:00:42.640> custom<00:00:43.540> switches<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:46.390> we've<00:00:46.630> got<00:00:46.810> a

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
the Ross custom switches and we've got a

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.600 
the Ross custom switches and we've got a
pretty<00:00:47.050> big<00:00:47.260> project<00:00:47.829> obviously<00:00:48.010> this<00:00:48.430> will

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
pretty big project obviously this will

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.950 
pretty big project obviously this will
all<00:00:48.760> be<00:00:48.940> dcs<00:00:49.510> as<00:00:49.810> it<00:00:50.500> is<00:00:50.620> right<00:00:50.800> now<00:00:50.860> currently

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
all be dcs as it is right now currently

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.380 
all be dcs as it is right now currently
but<00:00:52.960> we're<00:00:53.140> kind<00:00:53.350> of<00:00:53.410> using<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:54.060> MTH<00:00:55.060> track

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
but we're kind of using the MTH track

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.970 
but we're kind of using the MTH track
here<00:00:55.660> as<00:00:55.810> a<00:00:55.840> template<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.770> kind<00:00:59.950> of

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
here as a template and just to kind of

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.360 
here as a template and just to kind of
figure<00:01:00.160> out<00:01:00.399> what<00:01:00.610> we<00:01:01.290> want<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.410> do<00:01:02.530> it's<00:01:03.340> going

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
figure out what we want to do it's going

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.569 
figure out what we want to do it's going
to<00:01:03.520> be<00:01:03.610> a<00:01:03.640> pretty<00:01:03.820> big<00:01:04.030> layout<00:01:05.340> it's<00:01:06.340> probably

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
to be a pretty big layout it's probably

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:13.080 
to be a pretty big layout it's probably
a<00:01:06.640> good<00:01:06.759> 60<00:01:07.149> foot<00:01:07.829> from<00:01:08.829> end<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.130> end<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.820> just

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
a good 60 foot from end to end but just

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.420 
a good 60 foot from end to end but just
give<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.330> an<00:01:13.420> idea<00:01:13.510> of<00:01:13.750> what<00:01:13.990> we're<00:01:14.430> what

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
give you an idea of what we're what

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.870 
give you an idea of what we're what
we're<00:01:15.580> doing<00:01:17.010> so<00:01:18.010> we've<00:01:18.130> got<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.430> main<00:01:18.610> line

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
we're doing so we've got the main line

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.960 
we're doing so we've got the main line
here<00:01:19.150> that<00:01:19.299> I<00:01:19.330> just<00:01:19.690> took<00:01:20.520> there's<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.640> small

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
here that I just took there's a small

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.060 
here that I just took there's a small
yard<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.850> over<00:01:25.270> here<00:01:25.440> this<00:01:26.440> is<00:01:26.650> going<00:01:26.950> to

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
yard and then over here this is going to

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.590 
yard and then over here this is going to
be<00:01:27.159> completely<00:01:27.580> changed<00:01:28.180> this<00:01:28.299> will<00:01:28.479> be

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
be completely changed this will be

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.880 
be completely changed this will be
raised<00:01:28.869> up<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:30.580> meet<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.790> layout<00:01:31.240> and<00:01:31.890> not

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
raised up to meet the layout and not

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.260 
raised up to meet the layout and not
exactly<00:01:33.430> sure<00:01:33.520> what<00:01:33.820> we're<00:01:33.940> going<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.119> do<00:01:34.240> here

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
exactly sure what we're going to do here

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:56.450 
exactly sure what we're going to do here

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.200 

and<00:01:57.460> here's<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.570> other<00:01:58.750> end<00:02:00.210> looking
