00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
if I were gonna wear this myself I would

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.569 
if I were gonna wear this myself I would
not<00:00:41.399> starch<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.980> gonna<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> call

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
not starch it so I'm gonna do the call

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.900 
not starch it so I'm gonna do the call
are<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> same<00:00:45.800> though<00:00:46.800> when<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.129> get<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
are the same though when we get to the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.900 
are the same though when we get to the
front<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> collar<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> would<00:00:49.289> do<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
front of the collar what I would do is

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.630 
front of the collar what I would do is
cover<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> thin<00:00:52.590> tea<00:00:53.190> towel<00:00:53.430> or

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
cover this with like a thin tea towel or

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.080 
cover this with like a thin tea towel or
a<00:00:53.670> pressing<00:00:54.120> cloth<00:00:54.949> dampen<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:55.980> spray<00:00:56.850> that

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
a pressing cloth dampen that spray that

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.660 
a pressing cloth dampen that spray that
and<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.260> iron<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.219> collar

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and then iron the collar

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.930 
and then iron the collar
I<00:00:59.760> really<00:01:00.270> would<00:01:00.480> avoid<00:01:01.160> ironing<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
I really would avoid ironing the the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.020 
I really would avoid ironing the the
front<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.680> side<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.920> any<00:01:05.220> part<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.790> shirt

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
front of side of any part of this shirt

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.340 
front of side of any part of this shirt
that<00:01:06.510> has<00:01:06.750> embroidery<00:01:07.790> I'm<00:01:09.140> probably<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
that has embroidery I'm probably the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.160 
that has embroidery I'm probably the
embroidery<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.010> 100%<00:01:11.369> cotton<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.659> maybe<00:01:12.869> not

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
embroidery is 100% cotton but maybe not

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.960 
embroidery is 100% cotton but maybe not
my<00:01:13.530> feeling<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.220> probably<00:01:14.549> has<00:01:14.700> some

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
my feeling is it probably has some

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.850 
my feeling is it probably has some
synthetic<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.350> same<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.590> this

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
synthetic in it the same for this

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.789 
synthetic in it the same for this
braided<00:01:17.340> trim<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.930> would<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.200> afraid<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
braided trim and I would be afraid of it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.850 
braided trim and I would be afraid of it
melting<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:21.229> I'm<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.619> show<00:01:22.830> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
melting so I'm just going to show you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.450 
melting so I'm just going to show you
real<00:01:23.100> quickly<00:01:23.340> how<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.670> would<00:01:23.909> approach<00:01:24.869> this

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
real quickly how I would approach this

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.420 
real quickly how I would approach this
just<00:01:26.460> turn<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.790> inside<00:01:27.180> out<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:31.250> spray<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
just turn it inside out and spray it a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.350 
just turn it inside out and spray it a
little<00:01:32.460> bit<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:34.670> might<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.850> need<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> spray

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
little bit I might not need to spray

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.990 
little bit I might not need to spray
because<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.840> iron<00:01:37.110> has<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.920> lot<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.369> steam<00:01:38.759> but

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
because this iron has a lot of steam but

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.850 
because this iron has a lot of steam but
for<00:01:39.270> those<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.930> there<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.829> not

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
for those of you out there that do not

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.940 
for those of you out there that do not
have<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> lot<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.579> steam<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:43.020> might<00:01:43.649> want<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
have a lot of steam you might want to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.170 
have a lot of steam you might want to
you<00:01:44.220> might<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> spray<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.090> I

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
you might want to spray it so and I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.760 
you might want to spray it so and I
would<00:01:48.299> also<00:01:48.420> make<00:01:49.020> sure<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.350> leave<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
would also make sure that I leave the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.929 
would also make sure that I leave the
iron<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.490> fabric<00:01:52.549> shortest<00:01:53.549> time<00:01:53.729> as

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
iron on the fabric shortest time as

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.510 
iron on the fabric shortest time as
possible<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.869> case<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.920> embroidery

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
possible just in case this embroidery

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.330 
possible just in case this embroidery
does<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.479> some<00:01:57.750> synthetic<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
does have some synthetic in it so it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.730 
does have some synthetic in it so it
doesn't<00:01:59.579> melt<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.390> you're<00:02:04.320> going<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.560> get

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
doesn't melt and so you're going to get

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.789 
doesn't melt and so you're going to get
a<00:02:05.479> fabric<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.229> definitely<00:02:07.439> not

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
a fabric that is it's definitely not

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.490 
a fabric that is it's definitely not
