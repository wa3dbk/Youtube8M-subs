00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 I am in the fact that the price unfortunately is also not 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.779
 plays the role of a big bread 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.820
 bought in supermarkets where they cook and 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.630
 very quickly because they have no time to do 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.480
 these mixes 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.150
 stand to make leaven there comes 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.580
 bread mixtures i.e. bread rye bread 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.100
 Wheat drunkards mix it all there and 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.050
 there jerks off let's talk about friends and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.939
 feed industry use not 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.939
 old leaven from how did ours 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.340
 ancestors of leaven found to speed up 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.980
 process use yeast and and yeast 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.360
 started using us back in thirty 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.880
 the fifth year for the first time 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.660
 got them based on the cheapest 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.860
 raw garbage onions corncobs 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.300
 old and cellulose and knocked out such a grade 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.969
 thermophilic yeast 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.660
 which is not destroyed by thermal 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.940
 processing 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.090
 they get inside the body being introduced 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.370
 the biosphere of the intestine clog up all the villi 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.980
 intestines you remember we did like 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.949
 experiment with a brush up so that the dirt doesn't 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.619
 give bacteria full of dimensional digest 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.479
 protein and it splits well on them 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.270
 acids so here the same thing happens and 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.240
 in the intestines and even fancy in 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.490
 Germany before the First World War 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.770
 tested this yeast as a biological 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.250
 weapons they had such a project which 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.890
 was called 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.930
 little death more than that was such 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.060
 French scientist with a German last name 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.250
 wolf who conducted the experiment he 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 put the cancer tumor in a test tube with such 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.720
 friends she became a game with a huge 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.549
 Soon everything will grow as soon as this yeast and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.799
 tumor growth was removed from this tube 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.630
 stopped the prize to understand how it is 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.970
 harmful and the most interesting thing is that it comes in 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.490
 at the guest so the bread baked graveyards 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.550
 he has the right to keep himself such 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.770
 yeast 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.140
 rules for those who lose weight good bread 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.430
 unlike the bad does not crumble under 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.100
 a knife 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.550
 second Achilles heel modern 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.600
 bread is gluten free gluten here it is 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.370
 and it gives such a shine on the button, yes it is 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.650
 substance that promotes bonding 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.850
 bread that is spike it is not at all with you 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.700
 fell apart 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.290
 creates brilliance and creates a feeling of such 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.209
 beautiful loaf of white bread and 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.580
 gluten has a property too 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.459
 clog the intestines to form stones in 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.290
 gall bladder and pieces of bread stick 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.470
 intestinal walls cause intoxication 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.930
 and stick always on bends and in these 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.700
 places are formed oncology and proven 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.980
 that colon cancer always forms 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.110
 bowel bends mostly but what 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.480
 white bread still causes a sharp 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.640
 the rise of blood sugar I already told you 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.770
 many times this is what endocrinologists measure 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.320
 insulin precisely in bread units and about 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.540
 this too must be remembered but as we always 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.910
 we speak there are no bad products 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.030
 sometimes unworthy producers therefore 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.400
 now there is bread baked from 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.799
 whole grains where bran is present 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.380
 fiber which stimulates the work 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.970
 intestines prevent him from sticking bread 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.799
 which is cooked natural 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.640
 yeast is written so cook 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.209
 natural sourdough rule for those who 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.730
 losing weight 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.220
 yeast promotes the growth of bacteria and 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.870
 clog our intestines wholegrain 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.600
 bread know it bread which is not only 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.250
 from above we sprinkle whole grains here on 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.590
 cut and you see that he really 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.290
 made from whole grains but in composition 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.209
 when you read the amount of dietary fiber 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.340
 not less than 12 percent 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.290
 all this bread can be safely 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.080
 use while you're on 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.910
 methodology you use those assignments 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.920
 which I give you, we temporarily expelled 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.920
 bread from your diet refers to 4 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.110
 banned product because it all 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.970
 group b mines all you need 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.700
 trace elements contained in bread 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.950
 you get from these dietary fibers from 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.260
 bran and by the way these same fibers 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.030
 contained for example loaf these 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.790
 the loaves contain the same amount 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.530
 dietary fiber like bran very soon 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.230
 you can go instead of the pipe here 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.340
 on such leps like coffee songs or 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.590
 tea and maybe not even sometimes 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.069
 the world smear them with a thin layer of butter 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.360
 or you can already put backs of eyes 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.269
 a piece of cheese 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.810
 they even need two or three flash 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.980
 filter can not remember as a rule 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.310
 for those who lose weight 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.850
 the most wholesome whole grain bread and on 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.850
 leaven
