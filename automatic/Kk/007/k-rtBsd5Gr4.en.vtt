00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
pop that into the fridge for about 15

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.950 
pop that into the fridge for about 15
minutes<00:01:41.880> until<00:01:42.120> that<00:01:42.480> first<00:01:42.720> coat<00:01:42.900> of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
minutes until that first coat of

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.560 
minutes until that first coat of
chocolate<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> completely<00:01:43.620> set<00:01:44.430> now<00:01:45.390> when

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
chocolate is completely set now when

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.790 
chocolate is completely set now when
that<00:01:45.690> one<00:01:45.840> comes<00:01:45.870> out<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> fridge<00:01:46.560> we're

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
that one comes out of the fridge we're

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.440 
that one comes out of the fridge we're
going<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.010> go<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.250> another<00:01:47.460> half<00:01:47.760> teaspoon<00:01:48.300> or

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
going to go in another half teaspoon or

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.820 
going to go in another half teaspoon or
maybe<00:01:48.570> even<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.870> little<00:01:48.960> less<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.230> quarter<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
maybe even a little less a quarter of a

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.590 
maybe even a little less a quarter of a
teaspoon<00:01:49.980> of<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.760> white<00:01:51.090> chocolate<00:01:51.300> and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
teaspoon of that white chocolate and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.090 
teaspoon of that white chocolate and
we're<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:51.930> repeat<00:01:52.260> that<00:01:52.320> process<00:01:52.620> so

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
we're going to repeat that process so

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.770 
we're going to repeat that process so
that<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.460> effectively<00:01:54.120> a<00:01:54.150> double<00:01:54.570> coat

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that we get effectively a double coat

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.060 
that we get effectively a double coat
this<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.470> going<00:01:55.620> to<00:01:55.680> make<00:01:55.800> sure<00:01:55.920> we've<00:01:56.040> got

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
this is going to make sure we've got

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.040 
this is going to make sure we've got
really<00:01:56.400> nice<00:01:56.580> strong<00:01:57.120> candy<00:01:57.570> bombs<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
really nice strong candy bombs and

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.750 
really nice strong candy bombs and
they're<00:01:58.470> not<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.800> to<00:01:58.950> fall<00:01:59.250> apart<00:01:59.400> and

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
they're not going to fall apart and

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
they're not going to fall apart and
you're<00:01:59.880> not<00:01:59.970> going<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.150> have<00:02:00.240> any<00:02:00.390> little<00:02:00.570> gaps

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
you're not going to have any little gaps

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.150 
you're not going to have any little gaps
and<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> jello<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.620> going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.980> seep

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
and then the jello is going to seep

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.180 
and then the jello is going to seep
through<00:02:02.900> once<00:02:03.900> your<00:02:04.140> candy<00:02:04.500> bombs<00:02:04.740> come<00:02:04.980> out

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
through once your candy bombs come out

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.830 
through once your candy bombs come out
of<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.490> fridge<00:02:05.760> they<00:02:06.210> should<00:02:06.480> be<00:02:06.600> looking

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
of the fridge they should be looking

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.869 
of the fridge they should be looking
something<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.230> this<00:02:07.380> now<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.160> remove<00:02:08.640> them

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
something like this now to remove them

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.089 
something like this now to remove them
from<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.179> silicone<00:02:09.629> cake<00:02:09.899> pop<00:02:10.110> mold<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.890> want

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.140 
in some of that jello and you want to
make<00:03:05.230> sure<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.530> your<00:03:05.680> jello<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.190> completely

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
make sure that your jello is completely

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.059 
make sure that your jello is completely
cooled<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:07.900> added<00:03:08.379> a<00:03:08.440> little<00:03:08.560> bit<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:08.829> ice

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
cooled so I added a little bit of ice

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.949 
cooled so I added a little bit of ice
into<00:03:09.519> mine<00:03:09.700> while<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.060> was<00:03:10.209> cooling<00:03:10.450> down<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:10.900> I

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
into mine while it was cooling down so I

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.780 
into mine while it was cooling down so I
didn't<00:03:11.170> have<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.379> wait<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:11.829> long<00:03:11.859> you<00:03:12.609> don't

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
didn't have to wait so long you don't

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.550 
didn't have to wait so long you don't
want<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.090> be<00:03:13.180> set<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.019> definitely

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
want it to be set but you definitely

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.930 
want it to be set but you definitely
don't<00:03:14.680> want<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.129> be<00:03:15.250> even<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.640> little<00:03:15.790> bit

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
don't want it to be even a little bit

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.039 
don't want it to be even a little bit
warm<00:03:16.150> because<00:03:16.359> we're<00:03:16.629> working<00:03:16.780> with

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
warm because we're working with

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.839 
warm because we're working with
chocolate<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.950> definitely<00:03:18.370> don't<00:03:18.519> want

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
chocolate and you definitely don't want

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.369 
chocolate and you definitely don't want
the<00:03:19.030> warm<00:03:19.239> jello<00:03:19.540> melting<00:03:20.109> through<00:03:20.200> your

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
the warm jello melting through your

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.110 
the warm jello melting through your
chocolate<00:03:20.739> so<00:03:21.489> you<00:03:21.519> should<00:03:21.790> have<00:03:21.910> something

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
chocolate so you should have something

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.699 
chocolate so you should have something
that<00:03:22.239> looks<00:03:22.359> like<00:03:22.599> this<00:03:22.810> now<00:03:23.349> they're<00:03:23.560> going

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
that looks like this now they're going

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.229 
that looks like this now they're going
to<00:03:23.799> go<00:03:23.919> off<00:03:23.950> into<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.489> fridge<00:03:24.730> until<00:03:24.910> that

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
to go off into the fridge until that

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.360 
to go off into the fridge until that
jello<00:03:25.480> is<00:03:25.599> fully<00:03:25.870> set<00:03:26.139> could<00:03:26.650> be<00:03:26.680> an<00:03:26.859> hour<00:03:27.010> so

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
jello is fully set could be an hour so

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.530 
jello is fully set could be an hour so
it<00:03:27.430> could<00:03:27.609> be<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:27.760> little<00:03:28.000> bit<00:03:28.090> more<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.450> you

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
it could be a little bit more and you

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.240 
it could be a little bit more and you
can<00:03:28.810> do<00:03:28.989> all<00:03:29.139> this<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.500> day<00:03:29.680> before<00:03:29.859> you<00:03:30.069> want

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250
