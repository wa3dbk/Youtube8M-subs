it<00:02:35.150> should<00:02:35.480> read<00:02:35.810> between<00:02:36.140> 100<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.250> 125<00:02:38.060> psi

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
it should read between 100 and 125 psi

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.150 
it should read between 100 and 125 psi
now<00:02:40.510> once<00:02:41.510> this<00:02:41.690> alarm<00:02:42.110> goes<00:02:42.410> off<00:02:42.680> we're<00:02:43.040> going

right there that is letting us know that
our<00:04:50.620> parking<00:04:51.130> brakes<00:04:51.460> are<00:04:52.120> holding<00:04:52.720> so<00:04:53.500> now

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
our parking brakes are holding so now

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.720 
our parking brakes are holding so now
but<00:04:54.040> it<00:04:54.160> in<00:04:54.310> neutral

into a gear all right now depress the
other<00:05:14.220> button<00:05:14.640> that<00:05:15.240> way<00:05:15.420> hold<00:05:16.050> both<00:05:16.260> them<00:05:16.470> put

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
other button that way hold both them put

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.150 
other button that way hold both them put
your<00:05:16.980> whole<00:05:17.100> hand<00:05:17.870> that<00:05:18.870> way<00:05:19.080> both<00:05:19.470> valves<00:05:19.860> are

your whole hand that way both valves are

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.150 
your whole hand that way both valves are
in<00:05:20.420> we<00:05:21.420> left<00:05:21.660> it<00:05:21.810> in<00:05:21.960> gear<00:05:22.200> so<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.680> truck<00:05:22.920> won't

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
in we left it in gear so the truck won't

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.100 
in we left it in gear so the truck won't
roll<00:05:23.660> so<00:05:24.660> now<00:05:24.870> turn<00:05:25.410> your<00:05:25.590> ignition<00:05:25.680> on<00:05:27.110> both

roll so now turn your ignition on both

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.290 
roll so now turn your ignition on both
buttons<00:05:28.440> being<00:05:28.770> in<00:05:28.980> is<00:05:29.220> crucial<00:05:29.790> because<00:05:30.030> if

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
buttons being in is crucial because if

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.700 
buttons being in is crucial because if
you<00:05:30.360> don't<00:05:30.540> have<00:05:30.690> both<00:05:30.870> buttons<00:05:31.170> in<00:05:31.410> you<00:05:31.560> will

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
you don't have both buttons in you will

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.040 
you don't have both buttons in you will
fail<00:05:31.890> your<00:05:32.070> brake<00:05:32.310> test<00:05:32.610> and<00:05:32.880> that<00:05:33.480> fails<00:05:33.840> the

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
fail your brake test and that fails the

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.240 
fail your brake test and that fails the
entire<00:05:34.140> pre<00:05:34.680> trip<00:05:35.000> buzz<00:05:36.000> buttons<00:05:36.480> in<00:05:36.660> okay<00:05:37.530> now

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
entire pre trip buzz buttons in okay now

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.370 
entire pre trip buzz buttons in okay now
you<00:05:38.310> can<00:05:38.610> read<00:05:38.790> all<00:05:38.970> your<00:05:39.150> gauges<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:40.020> first

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
you can read all your gauges the first

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.550 
you can read all your gauges the first
step<00:05:40.710> of<00:05:40.920> the<00:05:41.430> LAV<00:05:41.910> test<00:05:42.510> is<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:43.110> leak<00:05:43.320> down

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
step of the LAV test is the leak down

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.620 
step of the LAV test is the leak down
the<00:05:44.070> engines<00:05:44.550> off<00:05:44.730> so<00:05:44.940> we<00:05:45.030> can<00:05:45.180> listen<00:05:45.330> for

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
the engines off so we can listen for

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.810 
the engines off so we can listen for
leaks<00:05:45.810> now<00:05:46.590> slightly<00:05:46.920> put<00:05:47.280> pressure<00:05:47.550> on<00:05:47.730> the

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
leaks now slightly put pressure on the

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.590 
leaks now slightly put pressure on the
brake<00:05:48.000> pedal<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:49.790> hold<00:05:50.790> it<00:05:50.940> you're<00:05:51.510> gonna

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
brake pedal and hold it you're gonna

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.570 
brake pedal and hold it you're gonna
hold<00:05:51.900> it<00:05:52.050> for<00:05:52.260> one<00:05:52.470> minute<00:05:52.680> you<00:05:53.250> should<00:05:53.310> not

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
hold it for one minute you should not

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.480 
hold it for one minute you should not
lose<00:05:53.820> more<00:05:54.060> than<00:05:54.300> four<00:05:54.570> psi<00:05:55.380> after<00:05:56.340> the

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
lose more than four psi after the

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.720 
lose more than four psi after the
initial<00:05:56.760> drop<00:05:57.180> okay<00:05:58.430> minutes<00:05:59.430> up<00:06:01.100> now<00:06:02.100> the

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
initial drop okay minutes up now the

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.980 
initial drop okay minutes up now the
next<00:06:03.120> step<00:06:03.890> lab2<00:06:04.890> a<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.790> alarm<00:06:06.120> he's<00:06:06.810> gonna

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
next step lab2 a the alarm he's gonna

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.230 
next step lab2 a the alarm he's gonna
start<00:06:07.500> bleeding<00:06:08.010> the<00:06:08.190> brakes<00:06:08.310> by<00:06:08.640> pumping<00:06:09.120> it

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
start bleeding the brakes by pumping it

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.780 
start bleeding the brakes by pumping it
and<00:06:09.390> just<00:06:09.990> prior<00:06:10.230> to<00:06:10.260> 60<00:06:10.800> psi<00:06:11.010> we'll<00:06:11.550> get<00:06:11.670> our

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
and just prior to 60 psi we'll get our

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.100 
and just prior to 60 psi we'll get our
warning<00:06:12.150> lights<00:06:12.330> so<00:06:12.570> go<00:06:12.660> ahead<00:06:12.810> and<00:06:12.900> start

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
warning lights so go ahead and start

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:27.140 
warning lights so go ahead and start
finding<00:06:13.290> the<00:06:13.500> brakes<00:06:25.250> now<00:06:26.250> you<00:06:26.310> point<00:06:26.910> out<00:06:27.000> to

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
finding the brakes now you point out to

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.270 
finding the brakes now you point out to
the<00:06:27.240> examiner<00:06:27.660> I<00:06:27.780> now<00:06:28.200> have<00:06:28.440> my<00:06:28.650> alarms<00:06:29.130> that

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
the examiner I now have my alarms that

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.710 
the examiner I now have my alarms that

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
say stop came on prior to 60 psi now for

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.200 
say stop came on prior to 60 psi now for
the<00:06:33.840> B<00:06:34.020> part<00:06:34.350> of<00:06:34.560> the<00:06:34.650> L<00:06:34.830> a<00:06:35.010> B<00:06:35.250> that's<00:06:35.910> the

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
the B part of the L a B that's the

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.940 
the B part of the L a B that's the
buttons<00:06:36.570> are<00:06:36.630> going<00:06:36.690> to<00:06:36.810> pop<00:06:37.050> out<00:06:37.290> so<00:06:37.830> we're

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
buttons are going to pop out so we're

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.090 
buttons are going to pop out so we're
gonna<00:06:38.040> fan<00:06:38.490> it<00:06:38.640> in<00:06:38.790> between<00:06:39.690> 40<00:06:40.170> and<00:06:40.350> 20<00:06:40.800> psi

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
gonna fan it in between 40 and 20 psi

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.430 
gonna fan it in between 40 and 20 psi
both<00:06:41.880> buttons<00:06:42.240> will<00:06:42.480> pop<00:06:42.660> out<00:06:42.870> so<00:06:43.170> go<00:06:43.320> ahead

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
both buttons will pop out so go ahead

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.650 
both buttons will pop out so go ahead
and<00:06:43.530> continue<00:06:43.650> fast<00:06:44.100> the<00:06:45.060> whole<00:06:45.240> time<00:06:45.510> you're

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
and continue fast the whole time you're

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.300 
and continue fast the whole time you're
gonna<00:06:45.780> watch<00:06:46.050> these<00:06:46.380> buttons<00:06:46.830> for<00:06:46.890> when<00:06:47.190> they

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
gonna watch these buttons for when they

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.000 
gonna watch these buttons for when they
pop
