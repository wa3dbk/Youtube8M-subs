00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.799
 After a few break months, there are now 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.180
 actually a video too 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.460
 a pretty suitable for everyday use 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.660
 tinkering and we are building this time 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.480
 this beautiful light and small 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.219
 spirit cooker the evaporated spirit 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.080
 in its outer wall and because the so thin 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.550
 it also incorporates the capillary forces 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.710
 reasonably usable gas pressure on 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.789
 actually only one is installed here 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.890
 empty gas cartridge 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.470
 in that case we do that with one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.240
 small 190 gram sting cartouche like 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.590
 Not only in gas cookers but to 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.810
 Example even in the blowtorch empty 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.160
 is made in a nutshell 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.469
 the tool becomes the swiss knife 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.059
 and a pipe wrench completely out there me 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.440
 but do not like to show how to 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.090
 as easy as possible in the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.040
 finger cuts it for the video 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.379
 for once reasonably made 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.210
 So grab a pen a book 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.070
 a piece of wood still a piece of wood the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.350
 pipe wrench a trainer in sanding 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 backstrom goggles a nail 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.160
 sandpaper a tape measure one 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.309
 caliper a hammer a blowtorch 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.930
 or whatever comes to mind 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.449
 we with a mark in 35 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.559
 millimeter height from the ground on there 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.729
 Let's do a second one right now 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.470
 over it this time in 47 mm height of these 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.610
 We must now mark the markings 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.040
 to paint the cartouche 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.290
 the book is our pencil holder 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.880
 finely adjustable height is the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.869
 too inaccurate it can happen that the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.500
 Buyer after not properly 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.060
 works on the 35 mm will now 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.549
 still every ten millimeters one 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.380
 Mark made on the top 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.350
 we only need a relatively rough one 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.170
 circle now we build a suitable one 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.610
 tool the remaining machining 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.009
 The nail gets a thin 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.540
 had missed the sample with lace 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.310
 form i do a rough 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.880
 Grinding wheel further processed and 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.100
 sharpened for your enemies 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.320
 the pin should then be about 1 millimeter 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.079
 be thick who can enjoy it 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.210
 whole story still needs realities 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.090
 then the gas can on the 35 mm 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.920
 line holes punched at the markings 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.170
 I then align something upwards 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.060
 depending on how good your tool is now 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.729
 The tin box has turned 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.710
 as little as possible now could 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.220
 Trainer to use and I cut the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.990
 Cartridge at the 47 meter line on the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.580
 should also happen relatively neat 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.530
 otherwise the helping ones will fit later 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.810
 with each other or kinking in the next but one 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.400
 step unfavorable so that the suitcase 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.769
 There is not reasonably tight 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.840
 the top is still a chest yet 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.310
 made exceptionally that one must 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.099
 not be neat at all 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.599
 it follows the boring task in 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.640
 loop late cut edges nice 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.840
 clean to protect 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.090
 now comes the real trick of 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.590
 thing I set the top wrong 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.819
 around and push the halves with you 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.950
 is hammer and wood pieces extent 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.440
 each other will be flush with edges 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.120
 complete and still get holes 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.530
 purely so that, in the folk 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.060
 spirit collects and also the last 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.560
 rest nice flow into the intermediate wall 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.519
 can 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.250
 they do not have to be too tight 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.590
 be side by side with the pipe wrench 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.640
 I then tried the upper sheet knew 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.829
 to bundle inwards 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.269
 The stove is theoretically without the 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.889
 but you could contact the 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.900
 cutting edges or at least the 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.880
 Break the backpack 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.889
 At least we are finished now 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.359
 suitcase is filled with spirit but so 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.730
 that nothing out of the small holes 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.250
 flows lit he cooks easy 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.780
 in the middle the gas starts from the 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.880
 holes do not top up 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.590
 be put and the whole fun plans 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.989
 anyway, if not more 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.549
 quite as visible a comparison with 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.720
 a gas cooker brings my opinion 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.359
 after not too much 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.310
 depending on wind temperature topform or what 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.870
 whatever is the cooking time for the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.700
 typical liter of water is not 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.139
 really suitable for comparison so 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.579
 tried it out best and 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.579
 have a lot of fun when neighbors
