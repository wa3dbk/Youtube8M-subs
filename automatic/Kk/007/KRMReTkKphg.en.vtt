00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:05.049
 Köppen Ahmed welcome to the weather today what is really spring 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.620
 in the southwest against winter cold in the northeast is still one 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.240
 Air mass limit over us 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.030
 right across Germany northeast of it 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.460
 could cool cold air but also pretty dry air to us 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.390
 from the southwest slightly humid but rather mild air 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.960
 Accordingly, the temperatures were different at noon today 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.130
 and afternoon in Vorpommern Temperatures on the Main - four to zero 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.380
 Degree at 13 o'clock 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.630
 over wide parts of Germany one to five degrees and the further one to the west 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.440
 and wine southwest can get warmer all the way up it was almost spring 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.289
 to 15 degrees Immoeast first southwest 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.570
 There, too, this one also gave us this temperature distribution 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:47.330
 is also preserved 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.610
 in which the values ​​will adjust a little more, above all always remains 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.060
 it's in the cold air to the northeast and they're now seeing here on the radar 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.150
 the West has brought in new infotainment systems and 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.139
 that brings widespread rain but not everywhere 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:03.600
 because where the cold air is, the whole will first fall as snow 

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:07.520
 later than sleet it can sometimes even freezing rain 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.969
 and freezing wetness and that is perceive extreme north that is 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.450
 for the next few hours so at night and also morning morning al-kuds 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.429
 edited danger the colleagues of the storm center were already for 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.959
 Schleswig-Holstein down Hamburg across the old country Lüneburg Heath 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.439
 until the Harz she can just snow first then give sleet 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.100
 freezing rain and freezing wet 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.110
 because really dangerous values 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.890
 they are still normal on the night Kate otherwise it is out of this region 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.180
 always mostly dense clouds with rain the hair will be drawn right on 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.180
 The edge of the Alps is often even as bright as the Danube in the Alps 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.770
 along fog will rise the temperatures to the east 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.050
 Minus 2 to minus 2 6 degrees 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.300
 otherwise to the west morning early mostly falls its six degrees plus 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.770
 Tomorrow morning the question remains more or less fixed 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.329
 High pressure area just not that of us 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.939
 it does not really stop them from doing so 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.249
 But that also means that it is in the regions where it is in the after part 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:05.039
 snow or sleet has continued to be smooth due to density 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.609
 Cloud fields by snow DFL by sleet 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.420
 her husband from the schleswig-holstein region down to Hamburg 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.359
 about Seitel Aline Burgerheide Bass in the Harz 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.180
 otherwise the cloud range to the Black Forest in the south will be talked about 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.730
 the rock and ice are not of it 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.970
 mostly sunny sections behind the front of Lokals also from 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.540
 North Rhine-Westphalia back on and on the edge of the Alps is then relatively tough 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.159
 the fog during the afternoon 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.480
 But should there be some sunshine in the Alps everywhere? 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.260
 wonderfully bright sunshine 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.770
 otherwise still compact cloud fields means against the front remains men-wg 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.519
 stationary 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.760
 and from the west there are still a few dense clouds 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.229
 with something wet after 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.799
 the temperatures every morning afternoon are still in very different 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.320
 Areas but they are southwest 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.130
 will not be quite as warm Na has outside areas at peak levels between 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.200
 Minus and plus two degrees to the west and southwest then milder 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.830
 6 to 9 degrees in the morning afternoon 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.530
 and where else does not mean that you also give strong wind 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.060
 determined 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.180
 Wind force 5 to 6 so fresh to strong wind 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.930
 On the contrary, even storms give that applies especially to the northeast of Japan 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.780
 still significantly colder 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.640
 as the thermometer waiting list actually changes the temperature 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.439
 reads 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.779
 after seven usually only weak wind 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.550
 in the next few days relatively calm weather a few drops 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.190
 or flakes fall on Wednesday in the far north 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.750
 otherwise sometimes the sun and temperatures are usually at three to 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.820
 eleven degrees remains at these temperatures different two to nine 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.610
 Degree then on Thursday to dry everywhere we come but again and again 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.020
 the sun out in the nights than then but spread everywhere again 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.740
 be frosty Ing still have a nice evening in the first
