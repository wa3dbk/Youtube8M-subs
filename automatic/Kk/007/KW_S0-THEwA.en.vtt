makes it a lot quicker and it's a lot

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.680 
makes it a lot quicker and it's a lot
better<00:00:49.680> tool<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.280> use<00:00:50.489> when<00:00:51.090> you're<00:00:51.270> using<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
better tool to use when you're using the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.950

you know the proper equipment and if you

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.220 
you know the proper equipment and if you
build<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.680> good<00:00:55.800> speed<00:00:56.100> bag<00:00:56.309> backboard<00:00:57.230> you'll

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
build a good speed bag backboard you'll

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
build a good speed bag backboard you'll
find<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.859> would<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> lot<00:00:59.489> better<00:00:59.520> for

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
find that it would be a lot better for

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.340 
find that it would be a lot better for

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.679 
remember you want to make a defensive
move<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:35.159> vice<00:01:35.400> versa<00:01:36.060> because<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
move and vice versa because you have to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.840 
move and vice versa because you have to
remember<00:01:36.960> whoever<00:01:37.860> you're<00:01:38.189> fighting<00:01:38.610> wants

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
remember whoever you're fighting wants

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.749 
remember whoever you're fighting wants
to<00:01:38.970> punch<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.280> easier

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
to punch you so you have to it's easier

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.910 
to punch you so you have to it's easier
to<00:01:41.939> fight<00:01:42.150> looking<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.020> his<00:01:43.229> punches<00:01:43.740> in

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
to fight looking for his punches in

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.490 
to fight looking for his punches in
there<00:01:44.070> he<00:01:44.310> throws<00:01:44.579> his<00:01:44.759> punches<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.350> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
there he throws his punches it's it's a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.130 
there he throws his punches it's it's a
lot<00:01:46.890> easier<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:48.060> lot<00:01:48.240> safer<00:01:48.509> way<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.810> fight

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
lot easier and a lot safer way to fight

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
lot easier and a lot safer way to fight
at<00:01:49.320> least<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.710> think<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.220> being<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> counter

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
at least I think so being a counter

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.990 
at least I think so being a counter
puncher<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:53.369> again<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.729> we're

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
puncher like I was but again it we're

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.749 
puncher like I was but again it we're
just<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> go<00:01:54.600> through<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.250> simple<00:01:56.250> three

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
just going to go through a simple three

00:01:56.759 --> 00:05:05.969 
just going to go through a simple three
minute<00:01:57.060> drill<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.600> I'll<00:01:57.719> put

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.399 

so<00:05:06.219> that's<00:05:06.400> it<00:05:06.580> just<00:05:06.759> a<00:05:06.879> simple<00:05:07.060> drill<00:05:07.389> if<00:05:08.259> you

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
so that's it just a simple drill if you

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.350 
so that's it just a simple drill if you
notice<00:05:08.710> I<00:05:08.830> was<00:05:09.009> trying<00:05:09.669> to<00:05:09.729> keep<00:05:09.819> my<00:05:09.939> hands<00:05:10.240> up

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
notice I was trying to keep my hands up

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.320 
notice I was trying to keep my hands up
you<00:05:11.259> know<00:05:11.409> what<00:05:11.620> it's<00:05:11.740> moving<00:05:12.159> in<00:05:12.400> giving<00:05:13.180> some

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
you know what it's moving in giving some

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.570 
you know what it's moving in giving some
angles<00:05:13.689> coming<00:05:13.960> out<00:05:14.110> of<00:05:14.289> the<00:05:14.979> punches<00:05:15.400> and

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
angles coming out of the punches and

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.860 
angles coming out of the punches and
then<00:05:15.669> coming<00:05:15.909> back<00:05:16.090> in<00:05:16.270> with<00:05:16.389> some<00:05:16.509> angles

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
then coming back in with some angles

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.950 
then coming back in with some angles
that's<00:05:17.800> always<00:05:18.009> good<00:05:18.219> to<00:05:18.310> practice<00:05:18.490> -<00:05:18.960> that

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
that's always good to practice - that

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.010 
that's always good to practice - that
was<00:05:20.080> like<00:05:20.229> my<00:05:20.409> fourth<00:05:20.680> mount<00:05:21.779> but<00:05:22.779> it's<00:05:22.930> a

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
was like my fourth mount but it's a

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.379 
was like my fourth mount but it's a
simple<00:05:23.439> drill<00:05:23.819> you<00:05:24.819> don't<00:05:24.969> really<00:05:25.090> need<00:05:25.330> a

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
simple drill you don't really need a

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.809 
simple drill you don't really need a
good<00:05:25.719> backboard<00:05:26.259> or<00:05:26.529> good<00:05:27.039> feedback<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:27.580> do<00:05:27.699> it

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
good backboard or good feedback to do it

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.140 
good backboard or good feedback to do it
and<00:05:28.659> it's<00:05:28.900> effective<00:05:29.319> I<00:05:29.439> mean<00:05:29.789> it's<00:05:30.789> hard<00:05:31.029> to

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
and it's effective I mean it's hard to

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.399 
and it's effective I mean it's hard to
hit<00:05:31.270> that<00:05:31.419> bad<00:05:31.659> when<00:05:31.900> it's<00:05:31.990> bouncing<00:05:32.349> around

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
hit that bad when it's bouncing around

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.259 
hit that bad when it's bouncing around
like<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:33.000> but<00:05:34.000> until<00:05:34.689> the<00:05:34.779> next<00:05:34.930> we'll<00:05:35.110> take
