 it is a little more that is a fabric 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.660
 little different and that he wanted to something 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.499

 on the other side on the date will not be the southern cajias in the case the beginning at 10 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.539
 I was very wise 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.539
 a camera 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.769

 though 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.109
 You both did not show anything, I do not know. 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.829

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.049
 Support 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.049
 here at the beginning of this month with card entry 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.909
 in the beginning ideas are a lot to do with the card and what 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.909
 to open the battery compartment 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.060
 finish of the two 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.060
 has 800 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.110
 basically poetic 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.349
 use a chrome accent and basically political quinzinho 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.849
 sensitive turino 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.629
 basically the metal 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:39.099
 that's why even being the smallest in a few hundred heavyweight almost did not 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.849
 realize the difference 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.490
 a lot of sense 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.480
 the engines are all here on the screen since it does not start there. 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.199
 basically of time 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.830
 I already luiza 11 10 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.479
 a reduction of only two buttons here 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:54.629
 but the rest 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.559
 he found himself with a bar that hit the keyboard 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:00.960
 and as such goal mix of less 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.300
 In the case of sending these common goods, the camera is in the 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.719
 lateral-left pressure to lead 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:09.420
 I count on you all 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.529
 already in the year to 15 10 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:13.330
 only the layer that in front 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.680
 more with account with 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.050
 Too much light here is a little sub-20 lesante 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.120
 another detail that 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.550
 noemi huth santos 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.990
 ah 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.290
 or is any further information is 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.419
 the first when you decided to do this again 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:35.950
 in the case of these two 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.389
 This place is here and so 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.199
 has mother said consulting 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.909
 by differences 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.909
 inside him 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.909
 omnipresence opening is easier here 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.330
 I did not want 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.080
 is the one who gets to the studio here a lot of pain for a second card of moraes sÃ£o 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.439
 point very in favor of the innocent 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.909
 thing that limits the networks 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.800
 I do not present 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.550
 pq has been more than a little bit but complicated of audiences nothing difficult 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:06.800
 have here 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.470
 Atelier compartment but does not count with entrance that the second card he already 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.669
 comes with a land of 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:12.969
 two days 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:16.659
 it is interesting to open the card but its price increase profile 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.149
 the option of inep without if you put with the cards with about two 

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:23.149
 cards with varying fears 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.430
 This is what I hope you liked. 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.409
 the first is a bit done by the 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:33.379
 no bpn possibilities 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:36.419
 and that now that comes with the n900 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.330
 what a pleasure 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.479
 so other hands on it make a good standout too 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.789
 it's a residence in her mouth
