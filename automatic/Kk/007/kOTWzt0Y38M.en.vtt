00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.470 

so<00:00:10.530> how<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:10.980> drill<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.520> ball<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:12.210> really

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
so how you drill the ball is really

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.940 
so how you drill the ball is really
gonna<00:00:12.570> be<00:00:12.780> dependent<00:00:13.200> on<00:00:13.260> how<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.500> throw<00:00:13.800> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
gonna be dependent on how you throw the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.950 
gonna be dependent on how you throw the
ball<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.430> that<00:00:14.610> does<00:00:15.060> that<00:00:15.120> make<00:00:15.300> sense<00:00:15.690> okay

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
ball is that does that make sense okay

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.370 
ball is that does that make sense okay
so<00:00:16.470> if<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.040> bring<00:00:17.430> my<00:00:17.580> ball<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.720> know<00:00:18.840> do

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
so if I bring my ball in and you know do

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.230 
so if I bring my ball in and you know do
you<00:00:19.439> try<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.650> find<00:00:19.890> my<00:00:19.980> track<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.580> watch<00:00:21.060> me

really do it but their track is going to
tell<00:00:31.619> me<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.770> whole<00:00:31.950> lot<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.850> ball<00:00:33.060> you<00:00:33.180> can

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
tell me a whole lot in this ball you can

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.750 
tell me a whole lot in this ball you can
see<00:00:33.510> there's<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> track<00:00:34.079> right<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.530> here<00:00:34.980> that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
see there's a track right in here that

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.729 
see there's a track right in here that
tells<00:00:36.030> me<00:00:36.270> they're<00:00:36.690> they're<00:00:37.110> staying<00:00:37.590> behind

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
tells me they're they're staying behind

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.979 
tells me they're they're staying behind
it<00:00:38.070> fairly<00:00:38.430> decent<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.359> sometimes<00:00:39.809> we're

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
it fairly decent but sometimes we're

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.479 
it fairly decent but sometimes we're
going<00:00:40.019> to<00:00:40.170> find<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.440> little<00:00:40.590> tiny<00:00:40.890> track<00:00:41.280> down

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
going to find a little tiny track down

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.920 
going to find a little tiny track down
here<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.910> tells<00:00:42.120> me<00:00:42.269> those<00:00:42.449> spinning<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
here that tells me those spinning the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
here that tells me those spinning the
ball<00:00:43.109> down<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> lane<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.070> now<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.609> do

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
ball down the lane so now I have to do

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.849 
ball down the lane so now I have to do
something<00:00:45.120> different<00:00:45.510> another<00:00:46.230> track<00:00:46.649> would

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
something different another track would

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.590 
something different another track would
be<00:00:46.890> coming<00:00:47.699> through<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> thumb<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
be coming through the thumb and the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.180 
be coming through the thumb and the
fingers<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.440> what<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.649> call<00:00:49.859> a<00:00:49.890> full

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
fingers this is what we call a full

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.069 
fingers this is what we call a full
roller<00:00:50.429> they<00:00:51.000> kick<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.929> last

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
roller they kick out of it the last

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
roller they kick out of it the last
minute<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.739> tracks<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.250> whole<00:00:53.399> ball<00:00:53.609> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
minute and it tracks the whole ball the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.299 
minute and it tracks the whole ball the
size<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> track<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.230> telling<00:00:55.559> me<00:00:55.649> how<00:00:55.949> much

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
size of the track is telling me how much

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.919 
size of the track is telling me how much
of<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> ball<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.359> surface<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
of the ball is on the surface of the

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.529 
of the ball is on the surface of the
lane<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.489> high<00:00:59.730> we're<00:01:00.120> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> get

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
lane so if it's high we're going to get

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.720 
lane so if it's high we're going to get
more<00:01:00.839> if<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.559> down<00:01:01.769> here<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> be

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
more if it's down here it's going to be

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.950 
more if it's down here it's going to be
less<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:02.999> of<00:01:03.269> course<00:01:03.480> down<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.780> bottom

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
less and of course down at the bottom

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.440 
less and of course down at the bottom
we're<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:04.980> a<00:01:05.040> smaller<00:01:05.489> track<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.060> I

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
we're going to get a smaller track if I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.090 
we're going to get a smaller track if I
can't<00:01:06.750> watch<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:06.960> bow<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.320> actually<00:01:07.890> see

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
can't watch you bow and actually see

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.890 
can't watch you bow and actually see
that<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.790> truck<00:01:09.090> tracks<00:01:09.420> going<00:01:09.480> to<00:01:09.659> tell<00:01:09.810> me

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that that truck tracks going to tell me

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.740 
that that truck tracks going to tell me
a<00:01:09.930> whole<00:01:10.170> lot<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.650> from<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.490> track<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.540> how<00:01:12.720> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
a whole lot and from that track is how I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.450 
a whole lot and from that track is how I
determine<00:01:13.230> the<00:01:13.470> positive<00:01:13.860> access<00:01:14.220> point

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
determine the positive access point

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.430 
determine the positive access point
because<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> come<00:01:15.600> over<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.230> and

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
because you have to come over and up and

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.690 
because you have to come over and up and
all<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.620> other<00:01:16.650> stuff<00:01:16.980> but<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.310> gives<00:01:17.520> me<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
all the other stuff but that gives me a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
all the other stuff but that gives me a
better<00:01:17.940> idea<00:01:18.150> how<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> ball<00:01:19.080> needs<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> be

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
better idea how the ball needs to be

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.470 
better idea how the ball needs to be
drilled<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> type<00:01:20.550> of<00:01:20.580> ball<00:01:20.940> you're

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
drilled for the type of ball you're

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.260 
drilled for the type of ball you're
doing<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.680> look<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> spec<00:01:23.370> sheet<00:01:23.640> that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
doing if you look at a spec sheet that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.090 
doing if you look at a spec sheet that
isn't<00:01:24.690> always<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> way<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.410> want<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:26.010> it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
isn't always the way you want to do it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.040 
isn't always the way you want to do it
it<00:01:26.280> looks<00:01:26.460> good<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.390> may<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
it looks good but that may not be the

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.200 
it looks good but that may not be the
way<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.380> throw<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> ball<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.640> says<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> four

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
way you throw the ball if it says a four

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.670 
way you throw the ball if it says a four
and<00:01:30.300> a<00:01:30.330> half<00:01:30.390> inch<00:01:30.690> pin<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.080> need<00:01:31.230> to<00:01:31.320> put<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and a half inch pin we need to put the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.560 
and a half inch pin we need to put the
pin<00:01:31.890> four<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.370> a<00:01:32.400> half<00:01:32.430> inches<00:01:32.820> from<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.060> but

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
pin four and a half inches from that but

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.940 
pin four and a half inches from that but
we<00:01:33.660> can't<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.050> it<00:01:34.110> without<00:01:34.230> a<00:01:34.410> track<00:01:34.740> because

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
we can't do it without a track because

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.800 
we can't do it without a track because
the<00:01:35.070> track<00:01:35.310> gives<00:01:35.640> us<00:01:35.760> the<00:01:36.060> positive<00:01:36.270> access

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the track gives us the positive access

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.420 
the track gives us the positive access
point<00:01:37.080> so<00:01:37.230> almost<00:01:37.530> always<00:01:37.680> I'm<00:01:37.950> sure<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.250> get

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
point so almost always I'm sure you get

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.130 
point so almost always I'm sure you get
lots<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.820> bowlers<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.540> come<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.050> they

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
lots of bowlers that come in and they

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
lots of bowlers that come in and they
say<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.500> want<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.860> ball<00:01:41.010> to<00:01:41.040> go<00:01:41.250> long<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.700> hook

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
say I want the ball to go long and hook

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.030 
say I want the ball to go long and hook
and<00:01:42.200> obviously<00:01:43.200> knowing<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.620> track<00:01:43.800> is<00:01:43.950> going

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
and obviously knowing the track is going

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.620 
and obviously knowing the track is going
to<00:01:44.100> tell<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.460> where<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.120> place<00:01:45.360> the

to tell you where you want to place the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.150 
to tell you where you want to place the
pin<00:01:45.870> where<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.230> want<00:01:46.440> you<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:46.980> all<00:01:47.040> the

pin where you want you know all the

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.100 
pin where you want you know all the
dynamics<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:47.850> ball<00:01:48.000> it'll<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.900> different

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
dynamics of the ball it'll be different

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.870 
dynamics of the ball it'll be different
from<00:01:49.380> bowler<00:01:49.620> table<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.010> based<00:01:50.190> on<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> size

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
from bowler table or based on the size

from bowler table or based on the size
isn't<00:01:51.420> always<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:51.990> match<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.470> pet<00:01:52.680> the

isn't always going to match the pet the
picture<00:01:53.280> that's<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:53.850> spec<00:01:54.090> sheet<00:01:54.300> that's

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
picture that's on the spec sheet that's

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.210 
picture that's on the spec sheet that's
in<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> box<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.230> ball<00:01:55.380> where<00:01:55.830> everybody

in the box of the ball where everybody

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.860 
in the box of the ball where everybody
looks<00:01:56.370> and<00:01:56.580> says<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.850> want<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.300> like<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.480> and
