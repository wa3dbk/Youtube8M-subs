factory a few Leo here you will notice
that<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.620> factory<00:01:42.620> is<00:01:42.890> not<00:01:42.940> impressively

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
that the factory is not impressively

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.600 
that the factory is not impressively
I<00:01:44.560> okay<00:01:45.560> take<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.890> look<00:01:46.130> at<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.340> glass

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
structures that are on the roof there

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.830 
structures that are on the roof there
are<00:01:48.890> two<00:01:49.070> different<00:01:49.460> types<00:01:49.730> of<00:01:50.180> skylights

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
letting natural light into the factory

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.770

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.660 
overhead electric blinds just or not now
that's<00:01:59.930> important<00:02:00.590> for<00:02:00.860> saves<00:02:01.250> money<00:02:01.550> and

that's important for saves money and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.750 
that's important for saves money and
energy<00:02:02.300> but<00:02:02.600> again<00:02:03.260> you're<00:02:03.710> also<00:02:03.950> providing

you<00:02:45.470> get<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:45.830> water<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.400> those<00:02:46.580> ponds<00:02:46.940> and

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
you get that water in those ponds and

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.440 
you get that water in those ponds and
hold<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.709> allow<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.040> plants<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.850> purify

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
hold it you allow the plants to purify

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.420 
hold it you allow the plants to purify
the<00:02:50.510> water<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:51.230> you're<00:02:51.380> holding<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.890> there<00:02:52.160> a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
the water so you're holding it there a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.250 
the water so you're holding it there a
little<00:02:52.850> over<00:02:53.060> two<00:02:53.300> days<00:02:53.510> before<00:02:54.140> it's

little over two days before it's

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.520 
little over two days before it's
released<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.700> natural<00:02:56.030> system<00:02:56.630> so

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
released so it's a natural system so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.300 
released so it's a natural system so
port<00:02:58.070> does<00:02:58.280> not<00:02:58.520> use<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.790> chemical<00:02:59.060> system<00:02:59.570> here

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
