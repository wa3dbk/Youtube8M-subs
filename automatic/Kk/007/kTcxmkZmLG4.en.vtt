00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:01.020> seven<00:00:01.410> marks<00:00:01.709> of<00:00:01.829> the<00:00:01.890> false<00:00:02.159> prophet

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
I think seven marks of the false prophet

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.260 
I think seven marks of the false prophet
in<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.750> Bible<00:00:04.400> Deuteronomy<00:00:05.400> 13<00:00:05.879> you<00:00:06.000> have<00:00:06.150> the

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
in the Bible Deuteronomy 13 you have the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.190 
in the Bible Deuteronomy 13 you have the
first<00:00:06.509> one<00:00:07.099> it<00:00:08.099> says<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.900> prophet<00:00:09.900> or<00:00:10.139> a

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
first one it says of a prophet or a

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.910 
first one it says of a prophet or a
dreamer<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.980> dreams<00:00:11.690> gives<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> sign<00:00:13.410> and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
dreamer of dreams gives you a sign and

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.939 
dreamer of dreams gives you a sign and
it<00:00:14.190> comes<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.639> pass<00:00:15.859> so<00:00:17.029> even<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> false<00:00:18.300> prophet

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
it comes to pass so even a false prophet

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.660 
it comes to pass so even a false prophet
can't<00:00:19.949> say<00:00:20.189> things<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.640> happen<00:00:22.460> but<00:00:23.460> he

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
can't say things that happen but he

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.200 
can't say things that happen but he
leads<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.180> astray<00:00:24.210> after<00:00:24.869> other<00:00:25.230> gods<00:00:26.210> that's

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
leads you astray after other gods that's

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.380 
leads you astray after other gods that's
the<00:00:27.480> number<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.900> mark<00:00:28.550> what<00:00:29.550> he<00:00:29.760> says<00:00:30.060> does

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
