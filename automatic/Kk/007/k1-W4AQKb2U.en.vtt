00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.390
 sanchez 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.649
 and remained the same 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.649
 the big question was whether I could do it 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.270
 both at the time 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.270

 burn a vestige of yours and signal 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.830
 of what awaited him if he were 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.570
 almost all the wishes to follow 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.350
 there he received security protection 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.850
 the queen gave her a pension so she could continue with a 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 translation of the bible 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.730
 but the persecution 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.410
 in 1563 a frenzy 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.640
 they made moral accusations 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.530
 what they came back 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.900

 After twelve years of intense work in travel books 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.620
 endless 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.930
 and all kinds of setbacks 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.940
 in 1569 in basel switzerland 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.040

 it is impossible to get copies 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.279
 I decided the revision to update it because there had been some 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:38.980
 changes regarding the use of the language especially and some principles that 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.489
