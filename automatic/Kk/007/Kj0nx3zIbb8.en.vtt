00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.900 
gonna be running now you want to make
sure<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.560> use<00:03:14.739> a<00:03:14.769> baking<00:03:15.280> dish<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.670> can<00:03:15.790> go

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910

sure you use a baking dish that can go
in<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.150> oven<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.690> chose<00:03:16.959> this<00:03:17.200> one<00:03:17.260> because

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
in the oven so I chose this one because

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.129 
in the oven so I chose this one because
it's<00:03:18.280> plenty<00:03:18.579> big<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:19.510> way<00:03:19.660> it's<00:03:19.840> not<00:03:19.989> gonna

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
it's plenty big that way it's not gonna

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.319 
it's plenty big that way it's not gonna
bubble<00:03:20.410> over<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:20.950> oven<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.430> may<00:03:21.850> not<00:03:22.030> serve

bubble over in the oven I may not serve

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.569 
bubble over in the oven I may not serve
it<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:22.569> this<00:03:22.750> I'll<00:03:23.260> probably<00:03:23.560> use<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.010> dish<00:03:24.340> like

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.190 
it in this I'll probably use a dish like
this<00:03:24.639> instead<00:03:25.480> which<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.870> little<00:03:26.109> bit
