first on the right on the right II so
I'll<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:34.480> start<00:02:34.720> on<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.870> right<00:02:35.050> or<00:02:35.350> if<00:02:35.500> your

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
I'll we start on the right or if your

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.710 
I'll we start on the right or if your
lefty<00:02:35.980> used<00:02:36.130> on<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.490> left<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.630> you

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
lefty used on the left up to you so you

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.980 
lefty used on the left up to you so you
want<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.930> go<00:02:38.050> bend<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.890> right<00:02:39.070> knee<00:02:39.130> for<00:02:39.640> more

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
want to go bend the right knee for more

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.470 
want to go bend the right knee for more
straw<00:02:40.990> straightening<00:02:41.500> left<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.730> it's<00:02:43.240> been

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
straw straightening left and it's been

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.940 
straw straightening left and it's been
then<00:02:44.760> alternating<00:02:45.760> each<00:02:46.000> need<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.420> bend

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
then alternating each need to bend

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.500 
then alternating each need to bend
letting<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.100> hips<00:02:48.370> go<00:02:48.700> along<00:02:49.770> for<00:02:50.770> this<00:02:50.890> ride

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
letting the hips go along for this ride

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.080 
letting the hips go along for this ride
so<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.570> wanna<00:02:52.720> then<00:02:52.960> then<00:02:53.560> then<00:02:54.100> bend<00:02:54.880> and

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
so you wanna then then then bend and

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.250 
so you wanna then then then bend and
straighten<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.450> knees<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.170> a

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
straighten the knees and this is a

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.310 
straighten the knees and this is a
slight<00:02:56.560> movement<00:02:56.830> at<00:02:57.250> first<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:59.110> way<00:02:59.260> you

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
slight movement at first and the way you

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.340 
slight movement at first and the way you
make<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.770> shimmy<00:03:00.010> from<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.400> knees<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.930> comes

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
make the shimmy from the knees it comes

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.060 
make the shimmy from the knees it comes
up<00:03:02.650> into<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.820> hips<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.150> faster<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:05.830> move<00:03:05.860> the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
up into the hips the faster you move the

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.040 
up into the hips the faster you move the
knees<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:07.150> smaller<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.750> make<00:03:07.810> the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
knees and the smaller you make the

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.530 
knees and the smaller you make the
movement<00:03:08.530> so<00:03:08.980> that<00:03:09.100> means<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.520> big<00:03:10.270> movement

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
movement so that means a big movement

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.920 
movement so that means a big movement
would<00:03:10.780> be<00:03:10.960> like<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.390> will<00:03:13.390> be<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.540> big

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
would be like that that will be a big

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.010 
would be like that that will be a big
version<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.800> what<00:03:15.520> I'm<00:03:15.640> asking<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.300> do<00:03:16.600> on<00:03:16.900> the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
version of what I'm asking you do on the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.430 
version of what I'm asking you do on the
side<00:03:17.640> these<00:03:18.640> going<00:03:18.910> forward<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:19.960> back<00:03:20.170> the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
side these going forward and back the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.020 
side these going forward and back the
path<00:03:20.650> forward<00:03:21.490> and<00:03:21.880> back<00:03:23.250> when<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.400> comes<00:03:24.640> mall

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
path forward and back when it comes mall

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.550 
path forward and back when it comes mall
or<00:03:25.240> you're<00:03:25.360> not<00:03:25.480> going<00:03:25.780> as<00:03:26.170> wide<00:03:27.010> okay<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.780> like

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
or you're not going as wide okay so like

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.410 
or you're not going as wide okay so like
if<00:03:29.680> someone<00:03:29.950> tells<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.250> step<00:03:30.580> back<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:31.120> wide

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
if someone tells you to step back a wide

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.720 
if someone tells you to step back a wide
step<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:32.110> will<00:03:32.260> be<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.380> wide<00:03:32.620> step<00:03:32.950> until<00:03:33.640> you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
step that will be a wide step until you

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.630 
step that will be a wide step until you
take<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.910> small<00:03:34.270> step<00:03:34.300> back<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:36.340> could<00:03:36.520> be<00:03:36.610> a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
take a small step back that could be a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.930 
take a small step back that could be a
small<00:03:37.000> one<00:03:37.300> not<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.170> smaller<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:39.610> could<00:03:39.820> be

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
small one not a smaller that could be

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.930 
small one not a smaller that could be
small<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:41.020> that<00:03:41.320> concept<00:03:41.980> making<00:03:42.850> the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
small so that concept making the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.890 
small so that concept making the
movement<00:03:43.180> smaller

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
movement smaller

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.930 
movement smaller
okay<00:03:44.650> so<00:03:45.190> again<00:03:46.020> posture<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:48.990> then<00:03:49.990> then

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
okay so again posture and then then

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.670 
okay so again posture and then then
finish<00:03:51.940> straighten<00:03:52.360> very<00:03:52.780> small<00:03:53.140> movements

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
finish straighten very small movements

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.770 
finish straighten very small movements
then<00:03:54.490> smaller<00:03:55.240> and<00:03:56.220> becomes<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.370> shimmy<00:03:57.700> as<00:03:58.030> it

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
then smaller and becomes a shimmy as it

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.590 
then smaller and becomes a shimmy as it
comes<00:03:59.080> faster<00:03:59.710> so<00:03:59.980> he<00:04:00.220> could<00:04:00.880> just<00:04:01.090> lift<00:04:01.330> it

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
comes faster so he could just lift it

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.960 
comes faster so he could just lift it
