00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
space but there was a bike in the way so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.660 
space but there was a bike in the way so
I<00:01:16.290> didn't<00:01:16.560> need<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> move<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:17.130> car<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.640> little

together you're going to want to take a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.160 
together you're going to want to take a
screwdriver<00:02:28.200> most<00:02:28.830> likely<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.190> flathead<00:02:29.760> and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
screwdriver most likely a flathead and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.740 
screwdriver most likely a flathead and
disengage<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.710> take<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:31.980> out<00:02:32.570> now<00:02:33.570> it

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
disengage that and take it out now it

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.390 
disengage that and take it out now it
does<00:02:34.020> take<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> little<00:02:34.560> bit<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.980> trial<00:02:35.250> error

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
does take a little bit of trial error

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.760 
does take a little bit of trial error
and<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> little<00:02:36.330> hard<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.660> do<00:02:36.840> as<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.590> can

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
and is a little hard to do as you can

and is a little hard to do as you can
probably<00:02:38.160> see<00:02:38.430> right<00:02:38.970> here<00:02:39.210> but<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.450> got<00:02:39.660> it

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
probably see right here but I got it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.610 
probably see right here but I got it
done<00:02:39.990> easily<00:02:40.380> now<00:02:41.220> once<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.520> take<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:42.030> out

done easily now once you take that out
we<00:02:43.620> will<00:02:43.800> get<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.220> next<00:02:44.520> step<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.940> will

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
we will get to the next step you will

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.330 
we will get to the next step you will
have<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.320> though<00:02:46.620> probably<00:02:47.220> twice

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
have to do that though probably twice

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.970 
have to do that though probably twice
varying<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.520> car<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.540> car<00:02:51.810> as<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.350> can<00:02:52.500> see<00:02:52.740> it

varying on car to car as you can see it

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.340 
varying on car to car as you can see it

is now out and I have to repeat the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.400 
is now out and I have to repeat the
process<00:02:55.530> again

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
process again

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.860

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
first and this will take some trial

um oh em light now this it is a little

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.910 
um oh em light now this it is a little
hard<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.390> do<00:03:27.630> because<00:03:28.050> they<00:03:28.350> are<00:03:28.530> built<00:03:28.800> to

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
hard to do because they are built to

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.290 
hard to do because they are built to
stay<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.700> there<00:03:30.060> but<00:03:30.840> if<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.500> get<00:03:31.760> one<00:03:32.760> side

stay on there but if you get one side

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.370 
stay on there but if you get one side
off<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.930> easy<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:35.010> get<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.370> other<00:03:35.580> side<00:03:35.880> off

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
off it is easy to get the other side off

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.470 
off it is easy to get the other side off
so<00:03:37.380> as<00:03:37.800> you<00:03:38.250> can<00:03:38.430> see<00:03:38.670> I'm<00:03:38.880> trying<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.209> get<00:03:39.330> it

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
so as you can see I'm trying to get it

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.720 
so as you can see I'm trying to get it
off<00:03:39.600> I've<00:03:40.170> gotten<00:03:40.560> off<00:03:40.709> successfully<00:03:41.130> and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
off I've gotten off successfully and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.350 
off I've gotten off successfully and

a white side which is negative anyway so

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.930 
a white side which is negative anyway so
you<00:04:18.150> will<00:04:19.019> I'm<00:04:19.560> going<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.100> be<00:04:20.190> connecting<00:04:20.820> it

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
you will I'm going to be connecting it

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.620 
you will I'm going to be connecting it
to<00:04:20.970> one<00:04:21.600> of<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.840> original<00:04:22.640> OEM<00:04:23.640> light<00:04:24.180> power

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
to one of the original OEM light power

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.540 
to one of the original OEM light power
sources<00:04:25.169> no<00:04:25.680> I'm<00:04:26.039> only<00:04:26.340> using<00:04:26.580> one

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
sources no I'm only using one

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.340 
sources no I'm only using one
so<00:04:28.550> after<00:04:28.940> you've<00:04:29.240> gotten<00:04:29.630> your<00:04:29.810> LED<00:04:30.320> strip

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
so after you've gotten your LED strip

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.920 
so after you've gotten your LED strip
the<00:04:30.830> next<00:04:31.100> step<00:04:31.280> is<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.760> choose<00:04:32.000> which<00:04:32.450> of<00:04:32.690> the

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
the next step is to choose which of the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.690 
the next step is to choose which of the
terminal<00:04:33.410> connector<00:04:33.830> things<00:04:34.070> you<00:04:34.250> will<00:04:34.460> want

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
terminal connector things you will want

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.100 
terminal connector things you will want
to<00:04:34.760> use<00:04:35.000> now<00:04:35.210> if<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.450> want<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.810> make<00:04:35.960> this

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
to use now if you want to make this

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.410 
to use now if you want to make this
permanent<00:04:36.440> mod<00:04:36.860> you<00:04:37.460> can<00:04:37.490> take<00:04:38.120> a<00:04:38.150> wire

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
permanent mod you can take a wire

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.450 
permanent mod you can take a wire
stripper<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:38.960> cut<00:04:39.170> off<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.590> but<00:04:39.950> just<00:04:40.220> in

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
stripper and cut off that but just in

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.020 
stripper and cut off that but just in
case<00:04:41.080> it<00:04:42.080> isn't<00:04:42.350> legal<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:43.190> would<00:04:43.550> advise<00:04:44.000> you

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
case it isn't legal I would advise you

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.940 
case it isn't legal I would advise you
to<00:04:44.630> just<00:04:45.170> use<00:04:45.740> that<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.940> keep<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.950> original

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
to just use that and keep the original

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.320 
to just use that and keep the original
OEM<00:04:49.240> stuff<00:04:50.240> still<00:04:50.870> in<00:04:51.110> there<00:04:51.380> because<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:52.340> don't

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
OEM stuff still in there because I don't

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.280 
OEM stuff still in there because I don't
know<00:04:53.450> if<00:04:53.540> it<00:04:53.660> is<00:04:53.690> legal<00:04:54.050> in<00:04:54.350> your<00:04:54.380> state<00:04:54.500> but<00:04:55.400> um

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
know if it is legal in your state but um

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.440 
know if it is legal in your state but um
yeah<00:04:57.290> I<00:04:57.320> would<00:04:57.590> advise<00:04:58.010> to<00:04:58.220> keep<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.670> original

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
yeah I would advise to keep the original

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.110 
yeah I would advise to keep the original
things<00:05:00.100> so<00:05:01.100> next<00:05:02.000> step<00:05:02.180> is<00:05:02.390> to<00:05:02.960> connect<00:05:03.560> it<00:05:03.770> as

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
things so next step is to connect it as

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.630 
things so next step is to connect it as
you<00:05:05.120> can<00:05:05.360> see<00:05:05.750> I'm<00:05:05.930> about<00:05:06.140> to<00:05:06.350> do<00:05:06.500> so<00:05:07.340> as<00:05:07.490> you

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
you can see I'm about to do so as you

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.060 
you can see I'm about to do so as you
see<00:05:07.850> I've<00:05:08.000> already<00:05:08.360> connected<00:05:08.930> it<00:05:09.110> and<00:05:09.320> the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
see I've already connected it and the

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.400 
see I've already connected it and the
next<00:05:10.430> step<00:05:10.700> or<00:05:11.090> another<00:05:11.510> thing<00:05:11.750> to<00:05:11.870> do<00:05:12.020> is<00:05:12.230> you

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
next step or another thing to do is you

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.240 
next step or another thing to do is you
I'm<00:05:13.000> fastening<00:05:14.000> it<00:05:14.120> down<00:05:14.420> with<00:05:15.250> electrical

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
I'm fastening it down with electrical

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.090 
I'm fastening it down with electrical
tape<00:05:16.310> so<00:05:16.970> if<00:05:17.240> I<00:05:17.360> need<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.720> take<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:18.080> off<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.560> can

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
tape so if I need to take it off I can

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.320 
tape so if I need to take it off I can
easily<00:05:19.520> just<00:05:19.760> take<00:05:20.000> it<00:05:20.270> off<00:05:20.420> and<00:05:21.730> after<00:05:22.730> you<00:05:23.120> do

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
easily just take it off and after you do

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.710 
easily just take it off and after you do
this<00:05:23.710> you<00:05:24.710> are<00:05:25.010> most<00:05:25.340> definitely<00:05:25.630> going<00:05:26.630> to

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
this you are most definitely going to

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.450 
this you are most definitely going to
want<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:27.020> test<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.710> to<00:05:27.920> make<00:05:27.950> sure<00:05:28.100> you've

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
want to test it to make sure you've

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.560 
want to test it to make sure you've
wired<00:05:28.730> it<00:05:29.000> properly<00:05:29.420> now<00:05:30.290> I<00:05:30.860> did<00:05:31.550> while<00:05:31.790> I<00:05:31.820> are

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
wired it properly now I did while I are

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.410 
wired it properly now I did while I are
it<00:05:32.840> wrong<00:05:33.050> so<00:05:33.650> I'm<00:05:34.190> going<00:05:34.610> to<00:05:34.730> undo<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.150> and

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
it wrong so I'm going to undo it and

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.890 
it wrong so I'm going to undo it and
rewrite<00:05:36.070> so<00:05:37.070> you<00:05:37.190> should<00:05:37.460> always<00:05:37.670> test<00:05:38.270> what

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
rewrite so you should always test what

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.720 
rewrite so you should always test what
you've<00:05:39.080> just<00:05:39.110> done<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:40.100> make<00:05:40.220> sure<00:05:40.430> it's<00:05:40.580> been

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
you've just done to make sure it's been

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.710 
you've just done to make sure it's been
wired<00:05:41.030> properly

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
wired properly

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.220 
wired properly
now<00:05:42.260> that<00:05:42.500> you've<00:05:42.650> wired<00:05:42.980> it<00:05:43.280> you<00:05:43.720> want<00:05:44.720> to<00:05:44.960> put

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
now that you've wired it you want to put

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.750 
now that you've wired it you want to put
it<00:05:45.410> in<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.710> same<00:05:45.920> place<00:05:46.220> where<00:05:46.460> your<00:05:46.610> OEM
