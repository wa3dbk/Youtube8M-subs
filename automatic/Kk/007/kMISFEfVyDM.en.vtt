00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.630
 Hello dear friends said 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:15.769
 today I want but to show you how 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.830
 you disassemble the starter of the kitchen 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.900
 builds when something like that happened 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.230
 This is often the case 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.930
 here fray through the goal of 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.070
 starter then be someday 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.070
 can happen 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:01:00.160
 the Irish are they ahead of who is from the 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.160
 unscrewed darkly 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.030
 3 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:44.060
 announced here plays first removed 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.060
 become 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.630
 any decrease disk 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:19.590
 then take this wheel out 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:25.130
 here the two screws go 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.130
 to take the starter motors 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.560
 except 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.010
 then you solve here 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.010
 these many 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:07.510
 this ring comes out of here above 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.510
 the knot solved 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:34.670
 she should seem like that out and about 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.870
 Here you have to be careful that you can 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.060
 Carefully this makes the mistake 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.640
 He is relaxed when these mistakes 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.640
 the one out jumps a huge problem 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.269
 only these two ball bearings here 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:04:00.440
 on the side and on the other side 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:04:09.310
 is a header goal from the one against 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:13.090
 On the other hand, it also turned out strictly 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.090
 the express 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:23.500
 we are only introduced to that 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:26.600
 okay so now we have the start 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.550
 disassembled and in another video 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.550
 I'll show you together then
