00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
use and a great when you're on paper

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.799 
use and a great when you're on paper
because<00:00:45.680> this<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.860> paper<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.120> very<00:00:48.510> thin

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
because this is paper is very very thin

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.900 
because this is paper is very very thin
and<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.170> hugs<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.559> surface<00:00:50.039> helps<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and it hugs your surface helps you get a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.840 
and it hugs your surface helps you get a
cleaner<00:00:51.300> line<00:00:51.949> now<00:00:52.949> first<00:00:53.250> thing<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.520> did<00:00:53.670> was

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
cleaner line now first thing I did was

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.689 
cleaner line now first thing I did was
after<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> printed<00:00:54.570> my<00:00:54.780> stencil<00:00:55.710> was<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.280> covered

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
after I printed my stencil was I covered

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.170 
after I printed my stencil was I covered
it<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:56.940> some<00:00:57.270> clear<00:00:57.870> shelf<00:00:58.230> liner<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it with some clear shelf liner and the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
it with some clear shelf liner and the
reason<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> did<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:00.960> now<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.680> have

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
reason I did that is because now I have

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.850 
reason I did that is because now I have
a<00:01:02.340> permanent<00:01:02.699> stencil<00:01:03.619> actually<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> lot<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
a permanent stencil actually a lot of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.350 
a permanent stencil actually a lot of
times<00:01:04.949> when<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.369> finish<00:01:05.640> painting<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.180> these

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
times when I finish painting with these

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.830 
times when I finish painting with these
I<00:01:06.750> take<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> damp<00:01:07.500> damp<00:01:08.220> El<00:01:08.490> Rey<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.119> don't<00:01:09.720> wipe

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
I take a damp damp El Rey I don't wipe

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.800 
I take a damp damp El Rey I don't wipe
them<00:01:09.990> down<00:01:10.110> use<00:01:10.860> them<00:01:11.040> again<00:01:11.220> later<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.150> your

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
them down use them again later so your

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
them down use them again later so your
paper<00:01:13.020> stencils<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.770> used<00:01:13.950> again<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
paper stencils can be used again and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.320 
paper stencils can be used again and
again<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.580> other<00:01:14.700> thing<00:01:14.909> about<00:01:14.939> paper

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
again the other thing about paper

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.390 
again the other thing about paper
stencils<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.560> change<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.100> size

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
stencils is that you can change the size

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.160 
stencils is that you can change the size
of<00:01:17.790> them<00:01:18.439> if<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:20.570> print<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.659> essentially<00:01:21.990> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
of them if you print you essentially you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.570 
of them if you print you essentially you
can<00:01:22.290> take<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> cup<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.979> machine<00:01:23.220> change

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
can take it to a cup of machine change

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.719 
can take it to a cup of machine change
the<00:01:23.670> size<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.030> way<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.590> can<00:01:25.729> sometimes

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the size that way or you can sometimes

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.999 
the size that way or you can sometimes
get<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.390> printer<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.020> change<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> size<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
get your printer to change the size and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.719 
get your printer to change the size and
or<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.570> an<00:01:30.780> image<00:01:31.189> software<00:01:32.189> that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
or if you have an image software that

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.160 
or if you have an image software that
you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:32.880> work<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.240> change<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> size<00:01:33.930> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
you can work with change the size so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.539 
you can work with change the size so
it's<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.350> sense<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> several<00:01:34.979> ways<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> do<00:01:35.369> that

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it's a sense of several ways to do that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.940 
it's a sense of several ways to do that
anyway<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.810> painting<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.530> today<00:01:37.799> we're

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
anyway what I'm painting on today we're

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.710 
anyway what I'm painting on today we're
going<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> keep<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.430> simple<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.299> just

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
going to keep it simple so it's just

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.080 
going to keep it simple so it's just
basic<00:01:40.229> I'm<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.890> using<00:01:41.040> some<00:01:41.189> stress<00:01:41.820> more

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
basic I'm just using some stress more

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.230 
basic I'm just using some stress more
wind<00:01:42.840> power<00:01:42.899> smooth<00:01:43.649> paper<00:01:44.189> which<00:01:44.850> kind<00:01:45.149> of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
wind power smooth paper which kind of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.340 
wind power smooth paper which kind of
thick<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:46.770> paint<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.610> not<00:01:47.640> going<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
thick so the paint is not going to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.240 
thick so the paint is not going to
wrinkle<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.880> and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
wrinkle it and

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.060 
wrinkle it and
let's<00:01:51.610> get<00:01:51.790> started<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:53.380> paint's<00:01:53.710> I'm<00:01:53.830> using

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
let's get started the paint's I'm using

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.320 
let's get started the paint's I'm using
are<00:01:54.480> yellow<00:01:55.480> and<00:01:55.660> right<00:01:55.840> orange<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.650> Daisy<00:01:57.330> the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
are yellow and right orange to Daisy the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.540 
are yellow and right orange to Daisy the
brushes<00:01:58.720> I'm<00:01:58.900> using<00:01:59.140> are<00:01:59.470> just<00:01:59.950> stenciling

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
brushes I'm using are just stenciling

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.890 
brushes I'm using are just stenciling
brushes<00:02:00.940> they<00:02:01.150> have<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.530> round<00:02:02.530> head<00:02:03.190> tool<00:02:03.900> and

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
brushes they have a round head tool and

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.600 
brushes they have a round head tool and
very<00:02:05.560> short<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.930> very<00:02:07.930> stiff<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:09.340> want<00:02:09.550> a

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
very short and very stiff you want a

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.990 
very short and very stiff you want a
very<00:02:09.790> stiff<00:02:10.179> brush<00:02:10.540> because<00:02:11.550> thin<00:02:12.550> brush<00:02:12.790> is

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
very stiff brush because thin brush is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.690 
very stiff brush because thin brush is
going<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.300> be<00:02:13.630> more<00:02:13.960> likely<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.590> push<00:02:15.370> paint

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
going to be more likely to push paint

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.030 
going to be more likely to push paint
underneath<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.870> stencil<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.440> it's<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.980> to

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
underneath the stencil and it's going to

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.390 
underneath the stencil and it's going to
be<00:02:18.160> more<00:02:18.340> likely<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.760> hold<00:02:19.750> too<00:02:19.960> much<00:02:20.050> paint

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
be more likely to hold too much paint

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.390 
be more likely to hold too much paint
since<00:02:21.400> then<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.700> dry<00:02:22.030> brush<00:02:22.300> technique<00:02:23.400> so

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
since then is a dry brush technique so

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.840 
since then is a dry brush technique so
you<00:02:24.490> want<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:24.940> get<00:02:25.090> your<00:02:25.330> paint<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.850> very

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
you want to get your paint to be very

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.230 
you want to get your paint to be very
just<00:02:28.209> kind<00:02:28.570> of<00:02:28.630> powdery<00:02:29.080> on<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.040> brush<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:31.060> you

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
just kind of powdery on the brush so you

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.300 
just kind of powdery on the brush so you
can<00:02:31.570> use<00:02:31.750> something<00:02:32.470> else<00:02:32.709> -<00:02:32.920> like<00:02:32.950> this

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
can use something else - like this

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.660 
can use something else - like this
sponge<00:02:33.640> brush<00:02:34.380> okay<00:02:35.380> let's<00:02:35.770> get<00:02:35.920> started

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
sponge brush okay let's get started

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.010 
sponge brush okay let's get started
let's<00:02:38.210> start<00:02:38.450> with<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.630> inside<00:02:38.930> okay<00:02:41.020> circle

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
let's start with the inside okay circle

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.510 
let's start with the inside okay circle
and<00:02:42.170> as<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:42.500> see<00:02:42.680> I'm<00:02:42.800> kind<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.100> dabbing<00:02:43.430> it

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
and as you see I'm kind of dabbing it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.270 
and as you see I'm kind of dabbing it
out<00:02:43.640> getting<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.450> real<00:02:44.630> within<00:02:47.710> then<00:02:48.710> piling

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
out getting the real within then piling

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.760 
out getting the real within then piling
on<00:02:49.430> rush<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.530> always<00:02:51.530> an<00:02:51.650> up<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:51.950> down<00:02:52.040> motion

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.300 

up<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.520> down<00:02:57.670> over<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.120> edges<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:59.190> like<00:03:00.190> to

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
up and down over the edges I like to

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.030 
up and down over the edges I like to
start<00:03:00.520> with<00:03:00.640> over<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.000> edges<00:03:01.470> up<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.740> down<00:03:02.860> is

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
start with over the edges up and down is

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.490 
start with over the edges up and down is
pushing<00:03:03.490> your<00:03:04.300> pattern<00:03:04.720> down<00:03:04.930> close<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.260> your

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
pushing your pattern down close to your

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.550 
pushing your pattern down close to your
surface<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.720> keep<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.050> from<00:03:08.410> going

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
surface and keep it from going

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.140 
surface and keep it from going
underneath<00:03:08.860> that's<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.580> idea<00:03:10.030> with

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
underneath that's the idea with

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.400 
underneath that's the idea with
something<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.600> want<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.810> keep<00:03:10.960> paint<00:03:11.260> from

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
something you want to keep paint from

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.900 
something you want to keep paint from
underneath<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.370> stencil<00:03:14.730> okay<00:03:17.520> up<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:18.790> down

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
underneath the stencil okay up and down

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.550 
underneath the stencil okay up and down
all<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.210> way<00:03:19.330> back<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:19.960> forth<00:03:20.050> it's<00:03:20.350> going<00:03:20.500> to

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
all the way back and forth it's going to

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.680 
all the way back and forth it's going to
push<00:03:20.740> paint<00:03:21.010> underneath<00:03:21.460> so<00:03:22.270> you<00:03:22.390> want<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.600> do

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
push paint underneath so you want to do

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.040 
push paint underneath so you want to do
that<00:03:22.950> okay<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:24.460> use<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.180> different<00:03:25.480> brush<00:03:25.780> for

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
that okay I use a different brush for

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:33.690 
that okay I use a different brush for
each<00:03:26.170> color<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:27.930> again<00:03:28.930> you<00:03:29.200> want<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.620> um<00:03:32.700> you

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
each color and again you want you um you

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.400 
each color and again you want you um you
want<00:03:33.880> your<00:03:34.030> brush<00:03:34.240> to<00:03:34.480> be<00:03:34.600> very<00:03:34.990> thinly

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
want your brush to be very thinly

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.110 
want your brush to be very thinly
applicated<00:03:38.410> with<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.650> paint<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:42.370> you

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
applicated with the paint so you

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.110 
applicated with the paint so you
wouldn't<00:03:43.450> want<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.750> clean<00:03:44.530> rush<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.280> then<00:03:45.880> use

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
wouldn't want to clean rush and then use

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.110 
wouldn't want to clean rush and then use
it<00:03:46.360> again<00:03:47.230> because<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.520> would<00:03:48.640> have<00:03:48.730> water<00:03:48.970> on

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
it again because it would have water on

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.790 
it again because it would have water on
it<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.870> would<00:03:49.960> thin<00:03:50.170> down<00:03:50.320> your<00:03:50.530> paints

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
it and that would thin down your paints

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.640 
it and that would thin down your paints
you<00:03:50.920> want<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.130> use<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.280> thicker<00:03:51.610> paint

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
you want to use a thicker paint

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
you want to use a thicker paint
something<00:03:53.650> that's<00:03:53.920> not<00:03:54.070> going<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.280> get<00:03:54.430> pushed

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
something that's not going to get pushed

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.510 
something that's not going to get pushed
pushed<00:03:55.390> under<00:03:55.960> the<00:03:56.380> stencil<00:03:56.770> or<00:03:56.920> run<00:03:57.220> under

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
pushed under the stencil or run under

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.770 
pushed under the stencil or run under
the<00:03:57.640> stamps<00:03:57.910> especially<00:03:58.300> if<00:03:58.360> you're<00:03:58.450> working

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
the stamps especially if you're working

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.550 
the stamps especially if you're working
on<00:03:58.990> a<00:03:59.740> horizontal<00:04:01.380> surface<00:04:02.380> like<00:04:02.740> like<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.280> wall

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
on a horizontal surface like like a wall

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.320 
on a horizontal surface like like a wall
anyway<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:06.010> get<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.190> idea<00:04:06.280> this<00:04:06.670> is<00:04:06.730> basic

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
anyway you get the idea this is basic

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.050 
anyway you get the idea this is basic
stenciling<00:04:07.930> and<00:04:08.250> that's<00:04:09.250> how<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:09.760> work<00:04:10.030> with

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
stenciling and that's how you work with

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.960 
stenciling and that's how you work with
the<00:04:10.270> stencil<00:04:10.510> now<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.500> want<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.459> show<00:04:12.640> you<00:04:12.700> wrong

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
the stencil now I want to show you wrong

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.180 
the stencil now I want to show you wrong
on<00:04:13.120> here<00:04:13.360> is<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:15.430> roll<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.760> stencil<00:04:16.480> off<00:04:17.190> you

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
on here is to roll the stencil off you

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.860 
on here is to roll the stencil off you
don't<00:04:18.310> want<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.520> drag<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:18.760> off<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.330> smear<00:04:19.720> your

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870
