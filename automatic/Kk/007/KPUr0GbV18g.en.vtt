another different special strange that's

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.850 
another different special strange that's
how<00:05:05.340> we<00:05:05.400> got<00:05:05.669> exactly<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:06.780> same<00:05:07.080> special

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
how we got exactly the same special

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.230 
how we got exactly the same special
twice<00:05:08.250> on<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:09.270> very<00:05:09.660> first<00:05:10.140> two<00:05:10.380> packs<00:05:10.680> a

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
twice on the very first two packs a

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.900 
twice on the very first two packs a
little<00:05:12.240> bit<00:05:12.360> some<00:05:12.510> lucky<00:05:12.750> that<00:05:12.960> was<00:05:13.789> all<00:05:14.789> the

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
little bit some lucky that was all the

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.469 
little bit some lucky that was all the
specials<00:05:15.330> we<00:05:15.479> all<00:05:15.539> getting<00:05:15.750> names<00:05:16.370> are

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
specials we all getting names are

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.670 
specials we all getting names are
different<00:05:18.479> ones<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:18.990> again<00:05:19.110> another

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
different ones and again another

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:28.190 
different ones and again another

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
different one vulture and another half

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.510 
different one vulture and another half

he's<00:05:30.880> forgetting<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.419> lot<00:05:31.630> of<00:05:31.840> those<00:05:32.050> and<00:05:32.770> off

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
he's forgetting a lot of those and off

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.020 
he's forgetting a lot of those and off
the<00:05:33.789> same<00:05:34.060> two<00:05:34.300> sets<00:05:34.630> as<00:05:34.810> well<00:05:35.729> so<00:05:36.729> well<00:05:36.910> there

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
the same two sets as well so well there

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.870 
the same two sets as well so well there
is<00:05:37.120> another<00:05:37.590> holographic<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:38.979> again<00:05:39.250> another

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
is another holographic and again another

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.850 
is another holographic and again another
different<00:05:40.300> one

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
different one

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.529 
different one
there<00:05:41.860> is<00:05:42.009> cragger's<00:05:42.550> of<00:05:42.729> boats<00:05:42.970> I<00:05:43.180> think<00:05:43.449> it

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
there is cragger's of boats I think it

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.460 
there is cragger's of boats I think it
is<00:05:45.000> do<00:05:46.000> remember<00:05:46.389> reviewing<00:05:46.990> that<00:05:47.110> one<00:05:47.289> who's

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
is do remember reviewing that one who's

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.390 
is do remember reviewing that one who's
an<00:05:47.590> awesome<00:05:48.009> set<00:05:49.530> so<00:05:50.530> we<00:05:50.680> have<00:05:50.830> to<00:05:51.039> go<00:05:51.220> pack

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
an awesome set so we have to go pack

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.529 
an awesome set so we have to go pack
safe<00:05:51.669> guys<00:05:55.080> and<00:05:56.080> again<00:05:56.289> another<00:05:57.150> you<00:05:58.150> for<00:05:58.360> mom

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
safe guys and again another you for mom

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:06.719 
safe guys and again another you for mom
we<00:05:58.660> have<00:05:58.810> some<00:05:59.050> Chi<00:05:59.319> there<00:06:05.190> and<00:06:06.190> another<00:06:06.639> one

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
we have some Chi there and another one

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.129 
we have some Chi there and another one
have<00:06:07.030> cragger's<00:06:07.800> votes<00:06:09.389> both<00:06:10.389> apartment

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
have cragger's votes both apartment

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.620 
have cragger's votes both apartment
blocks<00:06:11.289> it's<00:06:11.590> called<00:06:11.860> nail<00:06:12.630> cragger's

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
blocks it's called nail cragger's

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:20.730 
blocks it's called nail cragger's
command<00:06:13.990> ship<00:06:14.229> is<00:06:14.349> I<00:06:14.740> think<00:06:14.860> it<00:06:15.039> might<00:06:15.190> be<00:06:19.740> and

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
command ship is I think it might be and

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.439 
command ship is I think it might be and
there<00:06:20.949> we<00:06:21.070> go<00:06:21.190> our<00:06:21.639> last<00:06:22.000> one

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
there we go our last one

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.899 
there we go our last one
holographic<00:06:23.320> again<00:06:23.949> another<00:06:24.340> different<00:06:24.759> one

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
holographic again another different one

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:29.580 
holographic again another different one
so<00:06:28.020> there<00:06:29.020> you<00:06:29.199> go

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
so there you go

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.490 
so there you go
so<00:06:30.430> let's<00:06:30.639> just<00:06:30.819> recap<00:06:31.030> at<00:06:31.389> those<00:06:31.569> holographic

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
so let's just recap at those holographic

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.279 
so let's just recap at those holographic
ones<00:06:32.680> one<00:06:32.979> per<00:06:33.190> pack<00:06:33.490> guaranteed<00:06:34.270> and<00:06:35.139> I<00:06:35.229> do

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 
ones one per pack guaranteed and I do

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.399 
ones one per pack guaranteed and I do
love<00:06:35.770> the<00:06:36.130> holographic<00:06:36.550> design<00:06:37.000> on<00:06:37.210> this<00:06:37.409> and

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
love the holographic design on this and

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:39.930 
love the holographic design on this and
look<00:06:38.620> awesome<00:06:38.830> when<00:06:39.159> the<00:06:39.310> light<00:06:39.490> hits<00:06:39.729> them

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
look awesome when the light hits them

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
look awesome when the light hits them
all<00:06:40.930> word<00:06:41.349> different<00:06:41.889> pictures<00:06:42.690> except<00:06:43.690> for
