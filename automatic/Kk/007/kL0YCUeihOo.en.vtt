00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.870 
this morning the weed is not going just
yet<00:00:06.750> because<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.770> need<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.340> due<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.730> come

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
yet because we need to the due to come

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.900 
yet because we need to the due to come
off<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.150> leaves<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.809> barley<00:00:10.490> if<00:00:11.490> we<00:00:11.610> go

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
off the leaves of the barley if we go

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.450 
off the leaves of the barley if we go

when the Jews on the ballot tenser so

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.660 
when the Jews on the ballot tenser so
it'll<00:00:14.610> pluck<00:00:14.820> out<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> bit<00:00:15.179> more<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.320> crop

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
it'll pluck out a bit more of the crop

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.840 
it'll pluck out a bit more of the crop
also<00:00:17.779> because<00:00:18.779> we're<00:00:18.960> doing<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.320> where<00:00:19.529> we

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
also because we're doing it where we

until there's some sort of trash on the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.130 
until there's some sort of trash on the
surface<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.369> trash<00:00:23.640> tends<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.630> ball<00:00:24.869> up

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
surface and the trash tends to ball up

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.009 
surface and the trash tends to ball up
in<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.670> weed<00:00:26.670> if<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.269> don't<00:00:27.480> wait<00:00:27.660> until<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
in the weed if we don't wait until the

in the weed if we don't wait until the
the<00:00:28.680> Jews<00:00:29.460> gone<00:00:29.670> off<00:00:29.820> or<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> other<00:00:30.960> thing

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the Jews gone off or the other thing

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.990 
the Jews gone off or the other thing
we've<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.560> managed<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.250> our<00:00:32.430> second<00:00:32.940> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
we've we managed to get our second to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
we've we managed to get our second to
last<00:00:33.030> bit<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.540> beans<00:00:33.899> drilled<00:00:34.790> yesterday<00:00:36.020> but

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
last bit of beans drilled yesterday but

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.310 
last bit of beans drilled yesterday but
we've<00:00:37.170> still<00:00:37.440> got<00:00:37.730> one<00:00:38.730> more<00:00:38.989> field<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.140> drill

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
we've still got one more field to drill

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.130 
we've still got one more field to drill
on<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.620> our<00:00:40.770> contract<00:00:41.219> farms<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
on one of our contract farms and the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.779 
on one of our contract farms and the
reason<00:00:43.410> why<00:00:43.530> we're<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:43.829> there<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.340> because

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
reason why we're not there is because

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.680 
reason why we're not there is because
we've<00:00:45.059> got<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> bearing<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.820> well<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
we've got a bearing that is well it's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.010 
we've got a bearing that is well it's
either<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.230> seal<00:00:49.500> has<00:00:49.710> gone<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> bearing

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
either the seal has gone in the bearing

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.380 
either the seal has gone in the bearing
in<00:00:52.020> housing<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.059> bearings

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
in housing and so all the bearings

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.529 
in housing and so all the bearings
starting<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:57.329> oil

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
starting to go and you can see the oil

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.170 
starting to go and you can see the oil
in<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.809> bottom<00:00:58.399> there<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> track

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
in the bottom there and on the track

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.959 
in the bottom there and on the track
last<00:01:01.020> night<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.949> see<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> was<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.489> bearing<00:01:02.850> or

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
last night to see if it was a bearing or

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.910 
last night to see if it was a bearing or
a<00:01:03.000> seal<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.960> slacken<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> track<00:01:05.070> off<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
a seal we slacken the track off and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.410 
a seal we slacken the track off and
there's<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.100> little<00:01:08.369> movement<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.330> we

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
there's very little movement there so we

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.910 
there's very little movement there so we
think<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.750> probably<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.229> seal<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:12.920> we

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
think it's probably just the seal so we

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.289 
think it's probably just the seal so we
just<00:01:14.070> topped<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.369> off<00:01:14.430> with<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> oil<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:15.180> only

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
just topped it off with the oil we only

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.060 
just topped it off with the oil we only
got<00:01:15.420> about<00:01:15.479> five<00:01:15.869> hours<00:01:16.140> drilling<00:01:16.470> left<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> do

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
got about five hours drilling left to do

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.830 
got about five hours drilling left to do
but<00:01:17.310> about<00:01:17.460> seven<00:01:17.700> miles<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.210> down<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
but about seven miles to go down the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.100 
but about seven miles to go down the
road<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.320> still<00:01:19.830> get<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> risk<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.810> reason

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
road I still get a risk that the reason

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.539 
road I still get a risk that the reason
why<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.350> not<00:01:22.439> going<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.100> because

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
why it's not going now is because

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.300 
why it's not going now is because
there's<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> little<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> hole

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
there's a little if you can see the hole

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.130 
there's a little if you can see the hole
in<00:01:26.340> there<00:01:26.670> there's<00:01:27.210> supposed<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.479> be<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.780> bung

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
in there there's supposed to be a bung

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.310 
in there there's supposed to be a bung
that<00:01:28.350> goes<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:28.799> screws<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.369> there<00:01:29.549> and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
that goes in there screws in there and

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.749 
that goes in there screws in there and
pray<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.500> Bend<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.890> last<00:01:32.189> night<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:32.640> we

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
pray we Bend that last night when we

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.740 
pray we Bend that last night when we
were<00:01:32.880> trying<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.150> release<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.570> pressure

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
were trying to release the pressure

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.050 
were trying to release the pressure
because<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> little<00:01:34.680> pressure<00:01:35.579> valve<00:01:35.880> that

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
because the little pressure valve that

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.550 
because the little pressure valve that
got<00:01:36.210> stuck<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:36.930> had<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> hit<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.380> with

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
got stuck so we had to hit it with

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.130 
got stuck so we had to hit it with
something<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.909> parts<00:01:39.299> coming<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.750> from

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
something and that parts coming in from

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.069 
something and that parts coming in from
Italy<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.640> should<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.659> didn't<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:42.990> one

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
Italy and it should be didn't have one

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.749 
Italy and it should be didn't have one
in<00:01:43.140> France<00:01:43.380> apparently<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.280> hasn't<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:44.670> one

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
in France apparently it hasn't got one

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.450 
in France apparently it hasn't got one
in<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> UK<00:01:45.619> but<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.920> got<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.280> Italy

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
in the UK but they have got one in Italy

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.789 
in the UK but they have got one in Italy
and<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:47.790> coming<00:01:48.320> hopefully<00:01:49.320> by<00:01:49.470> lunchtime

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and that's coming hopefully by lunchtime

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.429 
and that's coming hopefully by lunchtime
today<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:52.729> fingers<00:01:53.729> crossed<00:01:54.079> we<00:01:55.079> should<00:01:55.259> get

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
today so fingers crossed we should get
