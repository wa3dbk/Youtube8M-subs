 Loin pork can use steak that 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.980
 has less fat and we are going to marinate the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.689

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.280
 not for half an hour we put it to rest 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.869
 marinate and in that we can go preparing 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.180

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.710

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.140
 We are going to prepare 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.800
 one side for when we need it 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.800
 they are two tablespoons oyster sauce 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.470
 almost all supermarkets or stores 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.310
 of oriental food they do not have is very 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.510

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.090
 soy sauce also a spoonful of water 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.180
 and that's not going to mix well and we're going 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.220
 to reserve for when he spent half 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.830
 Now we marinate meat well now 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.090
 We put the pan here and heat the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.180
 We have it at medium high heat and 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.220
 let's put it already hot in zÃ¡rate you 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.260
 let's put a third cup of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.119
 vegetable oil equal all 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.009
 quantities will be found in the 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.880
 descriptions boxes of the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:07.030
 descriptions of the video and the oil is 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.280
 hot here we already have the meat and like 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.350
 is thin is going to cook fast 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.180
 so we're going to put it that is not 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.700
 we will see that it is not 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.530
 stick for about let's say 5 minutes or until 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.290
 that is in the meat well cooked because 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.550
 how to be a pig if we need to 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.140
 be well 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.140
 to the sides 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.120
 5 minutes 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.670
 approximately 7 minutes we have to 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.709
 climb a little more from the fire can 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.489
 control the fire for the case is that 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:47.780
 be like this laughing well and here it is good 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.909
 fried we're going to take the meat and go 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.069
 to prepare broccoli quickly 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.580
 we lower the temperature now yes to 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.530
 medium 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.770
 in what we put the oil we're going 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.860
 to put 2 teaspoons of oil sorry 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.220
 tablespoons of oil because we are going to 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.930
 stew broccoli 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.760
 Once the oil is hot, we can 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.670
 climb a little bit more the fire I put it 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.100
 two houses are controlled because we are going to 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:20.420
 stew the broccoli first which is a 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:24.400
 pound of broccoli flower broccoli without 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.350
 the trunk the part into small pieces 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.780
 the more manageable too and so they go 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.810
 not so big adjoining that we should 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.850
 each produced by talents this what 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.280
 let's cook it roughly as a 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:42.400
 minute first for the oil we're going to 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:45.400
 put the salt that was a teaspoon of 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.400
 sugar 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.990
 a quarter teaspoon of salt and what 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.250
 let's go give and leave 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:01.050
 one minute we put the water 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.050
 and with the same water vapor 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.400
 we're going to leave about another 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.060
 minute and that boils and that with the same 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.099
 steam is finished sewing a little that 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.680
 we also want it very soft very 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.440
 cooked just so that it is a bit 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.750
 crunchy plus one minute like that with the 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.000
 water and we will remove it in a minute and 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.800
 is sufficiently known but not 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.620
 too possible still inter 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.110
 Crunchy we will take turn off the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.300
 stove we take the broccoli clean 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.970
 our athletes to the pan drained the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.669
 broccoli we put it aside too and 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.270
 Now what we are going to do is offer the 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:43.030
 Garlic onion and ginger first 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.500
 let's put a tablespoon of oil 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.500
 sap the already hot 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.099
 we are going to put 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.099
 the onion first here 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.199
 ginger soy is half onion 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:04.240
 cut in the chin squares of 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.240
 ginger we have a teaspoon 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:13.950
 and a teaspoon of chopped garlic also 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.950
 I have verified the garlic that we are going to 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.620
 again almost two minutes and one minute 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.800
 as you can see the garlic is ready and is 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.270
 back luciente that is at medium fire 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.000
 high you have to control that the fire what 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.420
 we go down a little Adriano and we put the 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.420
 sauce 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:44.259
 immediately after the sauce 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.259
 because the meat 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.460
 we are good with the plant 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.930
 and we put the broccoli this takes more is 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:05.220
 so that fuss and now we're going to 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:08.900
 put we have already diluted 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.900
 cornstarch with water 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.889
 and we're going to put it to nothing else 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.370
 the cornstarch with the water we already have 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:21.910
 diluted we put them 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.090
 and nothing else we mix well we work the 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.900
 medium fire mix well and we will 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.960
 cook for a minute and a half minutes 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.360
 so that he does not know cornstarch and will enter 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.789
 well spent 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.900
 and in two minutes it's ready, it's going 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:42.789
 the taste of cornstarch and here in this already 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.430
 to medium low heat to be able 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.259
 control is not going to burn if you 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.629
 It dries you can put a little more 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.699
 water in what is elusive to the last 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:54.370
 the recommend you can recommend this 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.379
 is to taste a little bit with a spoonful 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.650
 with a teaspoon of oil 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:01.960
 sesame seeds that give it a lot of flavor 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.449
 that's to taste and a little bit of sesame 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.040
 also either here or when it does not work 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:11.180
 this we are going to serve 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.160
 the a2 white deer fried as you 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.890
 like let's serve them we serve them 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.770
 that you can appreciate it a little more 

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:22.340
 the ones with white rice equal and 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:25.050
 you can use more broccoli less 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.690
 meat or more meat less I came back but 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.090
 I recommend it is delicious is used 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:33.090
 a larger amount then adjust the 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.710
 sauce can put a little more of the 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:38.520
 ingredients in the sauce so you do not 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:41.550
 come out very dry I hope you like this
