00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
Mazda's new smart brake support system

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.040 
Mazda's new smart brake support system
uses<00:00:27.040> a<00:00:27.070> radar<00:00:27.520> located<00:00:28.000> behind<00:00:28.329> the<00:00:28.689> Mazda

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
uses a radar located behind the Mazda

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.350 
uses a radar located behind the Mazda
badge<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.590> detect<00:00:30.340> obstacles<00:00:30.550> ahead<00:00:31.029> and

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
badge to detect obstacles ahead and

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.870 
badge to detect obstacles ahead and
automatically<00:00:32.259> apply<00:00:32.649> the<00:00:32.710> brakes<00:00:33.130> if<00:00:33.399> it

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
automatically apply the brakes if it

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.090 
automatically apply the brakes if it
thinks<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.329> collision<00:00:34.810> is<00:00:34.899> imminent<00:00:35.260> now<00:00:36.040> the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
thinks the collision is imminent now the

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.490 
thinks the collision is imminent now the
system<00:00:36.579> isn't<00:00:37.090> necessarily<00:00:37.630> going<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:38.170> stop

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
system isn't necessarily going to stop

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.130 
system isn't necessarily going to stop
an<00:00:38.649> impact<00:00:39.040> but<00:00:39.579> it's<00:00:39.760> designed<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.420> lessen<00:00:40.809> it

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
an impact but it's designed to lessen it

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.610 
an impact but it's designed to lessen it
should<00:00:41.680> one<00:00:41.890> occur<00:00:42.250> and<00:00:42.550> rather<00:00:43.360> me<00:00:43.810> tell<00:00:44.470> you

should one occur and rather me tell you

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.210 
should one occur and rather me tell you
about<00:00:44.740> it<00:00:45.540> today<00:00:46.830> we<00:00:47.830> thought<00:00:48.070> we'd

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
about it today we thought we'd

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:57.560 
about it today we thought we'd
demonstrate<00:00:48.820> it<00:00:54.480> well<00:00:55.500> I'm<00:00:56.500> about<00:00:56.680> to<00:00:56.890> drive

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
demonstrate it well I'm about to drive

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.670 
demonstrate it well I'm about to drive
at<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.630> wall<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:01.120> technicians<00:01:01.930> at<00:01:02.079> Mazda<00:01:02.440> say

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
at a wall the technicians at Mazda say

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.590 
at a wall the technicians at Mazda say
that<00:01:02.950> smart<00:01:03.310> brake<00:01:03.610> support<00:01:03.820> will<00:01:04.239> kick<00:01:04.420> in

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
that smart brake support will kick in

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.730 
that smart brake support will kick in
before<00:01:05.049> I<00:01:05.079> hit<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.500> wall<00:01:06.450> now<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:08.320> wall<00:01:08.560> could

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
before I hit the wall now the wall could

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.499 
before I hit the wall now the wall could
just<00:01:08.950> as<00:01:09.070> easily<00:01:09.220> be<00:01:09.490> another<00:01:09.850> road<00:01:10.090> user<00:01:10.119> a

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
just as easily be another road user a

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.889 
just as easily be another road user a
car<00:01:10.840> or<00:01:11.259> a<00:01:11.320> truck<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.150> what<00:01:13.329> I'll<00:01:13.450> do<00:01:13.600> is<00:01:13.630> is

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
car or a truck so what I'll do is is

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.929 
car or a truck so what I'll do is is
I'll<00:01:14.049> accelerate<00:01:14.409> up<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.770> speed<00:01:15.249> and<00:01:15.460> then<00:01:15.819> I'm

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
I'll accelerate up to speed and then I'm

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.609 
I'll accelerate up to speed and then I'm
going<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.179> set<00:01:16.450> cruise<00:01:16.929> control<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:17.530> I<00:01:17.590> can

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
going to set cruise control so I can

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.440 
going to set cruise control so I can
lift<00:01:18.009> my<00:01:18.100> legs<00:01:18.490> out<00:01:18.640> of<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.850> way<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.299> way

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
lift my legs out of the way that way

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.809 
lift my legs out of the way that way
you'll<00:01:19.719> know<00:01:19.929> that<00:01:20.229> I'm<00:01:20.979> not<00:01:21.159> pressing<00:01:21.460> any<00:01:21.729> of

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:21.819 
you'll know that I'm not pressing any of

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.450 
you'll know that I'm not pressing any of
the<00:01:21.909> pedals

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the pedals

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.300 
the pedals
it<00:01:24.460> feels<00:01:25.119> very<00:01:25.539> weird<00:01:25.810> saying<00:01:26.229> that<00:01:26.530> I'm

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
it feels very weird saying that I'm

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.989 
it feels very weird saying that I'm
about<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.939> drive<00:01:28.149> at<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.359> wall<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:29.590> we<00:01:29.679> go

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
about to drive at a wall here we go

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:32.510 
about to drive at a wall here we go
let's<00:01:30.999> see<00:01:31.119> what<00:01:31.149> happens

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
let's see what happens

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.590 
let's see what happens
so<00:01:33.520> accelerate<00:01:34.030> up<00:01:34.179> to<00:01:34.359> speed

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
and smart brake support is kicked in and

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.970 
and smart brake support is kicked in and
we<00:01:52.880> didn't<00:01:53.420> hit<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.720> wall<00:01:53.930> that<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.350> amazing

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
went but as you can see the smart brake

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.710 
went but as you can see the smart brake
support<00:02:12.050> system<00:02:12.709> has<00:02:13.490> detected<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.180> obstacle

support system has detected the obstacle

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.560 
support system has detected the obstacle
in<00:02:14.840> front<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.350> stopped<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.340> Mazda<00:02:16.730> 6<00:02:16.940> just

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
in front and stopped the Mazda 6 just

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.410 
in front and stopped the Mazda 6 just
short<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.020> wall<00:02:18.280> now<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.580> don't<00:02:19.730> recommend

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
short of the wall now I don't recommend

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.930 
short of the wall now I don't recommend
you<00:02:20.990> intentionally<00:02:21.380> try<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.160> or<00:02:22.400> test<00:02:22.730> it

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
you intentionally try this or test it

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.630 
you intentionally try this or test it
out<00:02:23.060> yourself<00:02:23.570> it's<00:02:23.870> an<00:02:24.590> emergency<00:02:25.160> braking

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
out yourself it's an emergency braking

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.790 
out yourself it's an emergency braking
feature<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.510> its<00:02:26.780> effectiveness<00:02:27.530> will

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
feature and its effectiveness will

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.290 
feature and its effectiveness will
ultimately<00:02:28.250> depend<00:02:28.490> on<00:02:28.820> several<00:02:29.120> factors

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
ultimately depend on several factors

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.140 
ultimately depend on several factors
such<00:02:29.900> as<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.530> obstacle<00:02:31.130> ahead<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.610> things

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
such as the obstacle ahead and things

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.600 
such as the obstacle ahead and things
like<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.570> road<00:02:32.780> condition<00:02:33.380> smart<00:02:34.340> brake

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
like the road condition smart brake

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.670 
like the road condition smart brake
support<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.270> not<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.720> replacement<00:02:36.140> for

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
support is not a replacement for
