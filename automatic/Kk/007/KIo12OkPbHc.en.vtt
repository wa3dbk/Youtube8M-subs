00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.940 

what's<00:00:48.090> an<00:00:48.210> interesting<00:00:48.660> mix<00:00:48.900> because<00:00:49.680> it's

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
what's an interesting mix because it's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.330 
what's an interesting mix because it's
serious<00:00:50.430> cyclists<00:00:51.060> plus<00:00:51.989> casual<00:00:52.830> riders<00:00:53.010> were

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
serious cyclists plus casual riders were

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
serious cyclists plus casual riders were
normally<00:00:53.640> only<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:53.970> of<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.150> weekends<00:00:54.680> all

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
normally only out of the weekends all

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.260 
normally only out of the weekends all
combined<00:00:56.160> enjoying<00:00:56.910> each<00:00:57.000> other's<00:00:57.239> company

having a good time together

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.060 
having a good time together
now<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.580> think<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> rain<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:01.260> an<00:01:01.559> additional

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
now I think the rain was an additional

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.939 
now I think the rain was an additional
bonus<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:03.809> small<00:01:04.050> obstacle<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.890> we

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
bonus this very small obstacle that we

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
bonus this very small obstacle that we
had<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.369> overcome<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.510> cemented<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
had to overcome so just cemented the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:25.410 
had to overcome so just cemented the
bonding

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.670 

I<00:01:29.100> loved<00:01:30.100> when<00:01:30.340> we<00:01:30.400> went<00:01:30.810> kind<00:01:31.810> of<00:01:31.930> I'll<00:01:32.140> enfant

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
I loved when we went kind of I'll enfant

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.560 
I loved when we went kind of I'll enfant
plaza<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:33.220> then<00:01:33.369> we<00:01:33.490> came<00:01:33.729> down<00:01:33.939> by<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.299> Maine

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
plaza and then we came down by the Maine

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.359 
plaza and then we came down by the Maine
Avenue<00:01:34.600> fish<00:01:35.020> market<00:01:35.259> and<00:01:35.950> then<00:01:36.100> we<00:01:36.189> were

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
Avenue fish market and then we were

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.639
