00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello here's how to make a 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.339
 delicious cake with lemon and walnut 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.160
 coconut 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:13.620
 to start you need 250 g of 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.410
 flour 3rd the juice and zest of a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.480
 untreated lemon 1 sachet of sugar 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:25.260
 vanilla 1 packet of baking powder 150 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.369
 g of fine sugar a hint of nuts aromas 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.700
 coconut could also taste 100 g of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.370
 grated coconut and 150 g of butter 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.760
 that I cut into small pieces and that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.530
 I melt in the microwave 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:50.579
 in a salad bowl I start by putting 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:56.690
 flour then powdered sugar on 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.690
 vanilla sugar and baking powder 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.909
 as well as grated coconut 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.330
 I mix with a whip 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.180
 I add the zest of my lemon so 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.210
 thanks to a little rapin 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.150
 I miss the whole outline of my lemon 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.150
 to harvest Toulouse is possible 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:50.200
 then I cut my lemon in half and 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.200
 I add the juice of the whole lemon 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.979
 if you do not like lemon you 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.890
 can replace it with vanilla 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.290
 but the lemon coconut mix is 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.560
 excellent two aromas that unite with 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.310
 wonder I will add in my 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.100
 preparation 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.640
 the three whole eggs and I start to 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.640
 mix 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:38.290
 and then I add the butter that I made 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:38.290
 melt in the microwave and I mix 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:55.060
 then I will strengthen the taste of the 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:03:00.730
 coconut by adding a little bit 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.409
 of food flavorings once your 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.019
 dough and smooth and homogeneous 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.579
 your preparation is over he does not 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.000
 you are left with more than butter and flour 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:13.540
 a mold and then preheat your oven 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.109
 thermostat 6 180 degrees minimum 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.090
 five minutes 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:21.519
 once your oven and preheat 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.349

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.349
 koko for 30 minutes 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.269
 and here is the result after 30 minutes of 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:38.169
 cooking game mussels my cake and I 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:41.139
 cover it with icing sugar and it's ready 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:43.870

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.639
