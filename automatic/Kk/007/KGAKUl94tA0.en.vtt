we start with 10,000 coins and we can do

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.980 
we start with 10,000 coins and we can do
at<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> least<00:01:20.549> amount<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.970> 1000<00:01:21.600> coin<00:01:21.750> wager

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
this after me scoring that go i think we

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.520 
this after me scoring that go i think we
were<00:03:35.360> almost<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.750> half<00:03:35.900> year<00:03:36.080> I<00:03:36.230> was<00:03:36.380> at<00:03:36.470> the

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
were almost a half year I was at the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.920 
were almost a half year I was at the
45th<00:03:36.830> minute<00:03:36.920> probably<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:38.060> game<00:03:38.270> freezes

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
45th minute probably the game freezes

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.060 
45th minute probably the game freezes
and<00:03:39.170> it's<00:03:39.350> because<00:03:39.560> we<00:03:39.650> were<00:03:39.740> having<00:03:39.920> some

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
and it's because we were having some

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.940 
and it's because we were having some
connection<00:03:40.640> issues<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:42.380> was<00:03:42.500> going<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:42.800> and

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
connection issues it was going in and

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.500 
connection issues it was going in and
now<00:03:43.010> we<00:03:43.280> had<00:03:43.400> yellow<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.850> red<00:03:43.940> bars<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.390> don't

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
start only play one half because we

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.140 
start only play one half because we
already<00:03:51.380> played<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.830> first<00:03:52.100> half<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.610> of

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
already played the first half and of

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.850 
already played the first half and of
course<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.660> was<00:03:53.900> winning<00:03:54.080> on<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.380> one<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:54.710> it's

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
course I was winning on that one so it's

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.070 
course I was winning on that one so it's
pretty<00:03:54.950> much<00:03:55.070> I'm<00:03:55.340> up<00:03:55.550> one<00:03:55.850> nil<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.300> then<00:03:56.690> if

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
pretty much I'm up one nil and then if

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.420 
pretty much I'm up one nil and then if
he<00:03:57.200> scores<00:03:57.440> any<00:03:57.560> goes<00:03:57.710> from<00:03:57.830> there<00:03:58.010> it'll<00:03:58.280> be

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
he scores any goes from there it'll be

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.040 
he scores any goes from there it'll be
on<00:03:58.520> top<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.820> that<00:03:58.940> if<00:03:59.120> I<00:03:59.210> score<00:03:59.450> any<00:03:59.630> goals<00:03:59.660> in

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
on top of that if I score any goals in

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.840 
on top of that if I score any goals in
this<00:04:00.140> half<00:04:00.320> and<00:04:00.710> of<00:04:00.890> course<00:04:01.070> we'll<00:04:01.370> just<00:04:01.550> put

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
this half and of course we'll just put

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.890 
this half and of course we'll just put
the<00:04:01.940> aggregate<00:04:02.300> together<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.660> that'll<00:04:02.840> be

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
the aggregate together and that'll be

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.570 
the aggregate together and that'll be
the<00:04:02.930> score<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.260> game<00:04:03.350> so<00:04:04.040> he<00:04:04.220> comes<00:04:04.400> back

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
the score of the game so he comes back

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.340 
the score of the game so he comes back
with<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.850> same<00:04:04.970> team<00:04:05.210> which<00:04:05.450> is<00:04:05.630> good<00:04:05.930> every

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
with the same team which is good every

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.570 
with the same team which is good every
now<00:04:06.470> that<00:04:06.650> I've<00:04:06.740> played<00:04:06.920> people<00:04:07.220> in<00:04:07.310> wagers

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
now that I've played people in wagers

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.680 
now that I've played people in wagers
they<00:04:07.700> come<00:04:07.880> back<00:04:08.000> with<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.209> different<00:04:08.330> team<00:04:08.660> I

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
they come back with a different team I

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.790 
they come back with a different team I
don't<00:04:09.080> think<00:04:09.260> they're<00:04:09.380> allowed<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.530> do<00:04:09.680> that

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
don't think they're allowed to do that

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.960 
don't think they're allowed to do that
in<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.920> series<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:10.340> I'm<00:04:10.459> glad<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.820> didn't

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
in a series so I'm glad that didn't

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.210 
in a series so I'm glad that didn't
happen<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.390> he<00:04:11.750> was<00:04:11.870> unable<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.590> score<00:04:12.920> so<00:04:13.190> I

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
happen and he was unable to score so I

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.280

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
I've already played the other match

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.890 
I've already played the other match
whenever<00:04:21.169> I

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
whenever I

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.420 
whenever I
accepted<00:04:22.229> this<00:04:22.350> so<00:04:22.620> it's<00:04:22.800> going<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:22.949> show<00:04:23.130> my

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
accepted this so it's going to show my

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.520 
accepted this so it's going to show my
metrics<00:04:23.910> I<00:04:24.030> do<00:04:24.090> have<00:04:24.360> an<00:04:24.600> extra<00:04:25.020> loss<00:04:25.169> here<00:04:25.380> and

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
metrics I do have an extra loss here and

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.890 
metrics I do have an extra loss here and
that's<00:04:25.680> because<00:04:25.830> after<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.970> played<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:27.720> first

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
that's because after I played the first

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.659 
that's because after I played the first
half<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.229> pretty<00:04:28.560> much<00:04:28.620> one<00:04:29.009> in<00:04:29.310> this<00:04:29.460> other

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
half and pretty much one in this other

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.520 
half and pretty much one in this other
game<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:29.880> just<00:04:30.210> left<00:04:30.419> i<00:04:30.570> put<00:04:30.780> out<00:04:30.810> because<00:04:31.229> it

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
game I just left i put out because it

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.749 
game I just left i put out because it
means<00:04:31.710> everyone<00:04:32.009> we<00:04:32.130> already<00:04:32.400> played<00:04:32.580> one

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
means everyone we already played one

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.010 
means everyone we already played one
half<00:04:32.940> so<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.150> was<00:04:33.330> kind<00:04:33.539> of<00:04:33.600> considered<00:04:33.930> the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
half so that was kind of considered the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.689 
half so that was kind of considered the
second<00:04:34.259> half<00:04:34.380> but<00:04:34.949> i<00:04:35.009> went<00:04:35.160> ahead<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.370> i<00:04:35.550> got

that<00:04:59.580> show<00:04:59.729> he<00:05:00.210> had<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.389> same<00:05:00.539> badges<00:05:00.840> me

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
that show he had the same badges me

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.480 
that show he had the same badges me
that's<00:05:01.470> kind<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.740> weird<00:05:01.800> maybe<00:05:02.160> we<00:05:02.340> both

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
that's kind of weird maybe we both

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.770 
that's kind of weird maybe we both
started<00:05:02.760> our<00:05:02.850> club<00:05:03.030> at<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.210> same<00:05:03.360> time<00:05:03.539> but<00:05:03.720> I
