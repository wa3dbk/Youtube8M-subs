00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.800 
through and that's really going to
create<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.710> flex<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.220> your<00:01:32.369> stick<00:01:32.810> compared

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
create that flex on your stick compared

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.569 
create that flex on your stick compared
to<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.049> using<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.500> bottom<00:01:34.890> hand<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.189> my<00:01:35.340> top

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
to just using that bottom hand if my top

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.249 
to just using that bottom hand if my top
hands<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.479> I'm<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:36.960> using<00:01:37.110> that

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
hands in here and I'm just using that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.710 
hands in here and I'm just using that
bottom<00:01:37.710> hand<00:01:37.939> I'm<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.240> getting<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.600> much

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720

power<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.439> where<00:01:40.590> you're<00:01:40.710> generating

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
power this is where you're generating

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.249 
power this is where you're generating
your<00:01:41.549> power<00:01:41.820> from<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:42.720> how<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.990> generate

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
your power from that's how you generate

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.399 
your power from that's how you generate
that<00:01:43.680> quick<00:01:44.040> release<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.909> NHL<00:01:45.689> shot<00:01:46.020> the
