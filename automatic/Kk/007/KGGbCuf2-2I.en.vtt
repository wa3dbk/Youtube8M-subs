big ol cookie sheet and some dry ice
that's<00:00:17.880> been<00:00:18.090> knocked<00:00:18.540> into<00:00:18.900> little<00:00:19.290> pieces

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
that's been knocked into little pieces

sheet<00:00:46.170> black<00:00:49.610> did<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:50.820> couple<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.239> weeks

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
sheet black did that a couple of weeks

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:05.170 
sheet black did that a couple of weeks
ago<00:00:51.630> so<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.290> thoroughly<00:00:52.680> dry<00:00:56.090> dry<00:00:57.090> ice<00:00:57.300> chips

normally<00:01:07.170> sinks<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.710> water<00:01:07.820> but<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> gas

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
normally sinks in water but the gas

normally sinks in water but the gas
layer<00:01:09.450> around<00:01:09.690> small<00:01:10.229> chips<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> make<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
layer around small chips of it make it

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.430 
layer around small chips of it make it
float<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.030> top

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.100 

it<00:01:16.440> also<00:01:16.590> gives<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.130> good<00:01:17.310> picture<00:01:17.789> of<00:01:18.110> early

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it also gives a good picture of early

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.199 
it also gives a good picture of early
primordial<00:01:19.649> solar<00:01:20.069> system<00:01:20.550> with<00:01:20.729> comets

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:21.209 
primordial solar system with comets

primordial solar system with comets
because<00:01:22.020> each<00:01:22.289> chunk<00:01:22.679> has<00:01:23.250> little<00:01:23.580> Jets<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
because each chunk has little Jets that

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.230 
because each chunk has little Jets that
drive<00:01:24.539> it<00:01:24.690> into<00:01:24.990> rotation<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.729> Jets<00:01:26.970> make

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
drive it into rotation and the Jets make

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
drive it into rotation and the Jets make
all<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.630> dry<00:01:27.810> ice<00:01:28.050> chips<00:01:28.440> repel<00:01:28.860> each

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
all of the dry ice chips repel each

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:39.160 
all of the dry ice chips repel each
other

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.950 

if<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:39.920> blow<00:01:40.220> gently<00:01:40.550> on<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.060> whole<00:01:41.240> tray<00:01:41.630> you

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
if you blow gently on the whole tray you

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.770 
if you blow gently on the whole tray you
can<00:01:42.110> make<00:01:42.350> some<00:01:42.560> solar<00:01:42.860> wind<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.640> blows<00:01:44.420> the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
can make some solar wind that blows the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.580 
can make some solar wind that blows the
the<00:01:45.190> surrounding<00:01:46.190> vapor<00:01:47.030> off<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.350> side

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
the surrounding vapor off to the side

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.790 
the surrounding vapor off to the side
here<00:01:52.210> we<00:01:53.210> have<00:01:53.240> two<00:01:53.540> common<00:01:53.990> nuclei<00:01:54.380> with

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
here we have two common nuclei with

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.160 
here we have two common nuclei with
asymmetrical<00:01:55.580> jets<00:01:55.880> got<00:01:56.570> a<00:01:56.600> little<00:01:56.869> too<00:01:56.960> close

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
asymmetrical jets got a little too close

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:11.460 
asymmetrical jets got a little too close
and<00:01:57.560> stuck<00:01:58.009> together

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:19.960 

I<00:02:11.560> could<00:02:12.160> knock<00:02:12.400> them<00:02:12.550> together

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.180 

you<00:02:20.480> can<00:02:20.630> really<00:02:20.900> see<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.350> Jets<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.800> this<00:02:21.980> one

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
you can really see the Jets on this one

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.830 
you can really see the Jets on this one
that<00:02:22.400> are<00:02:22.430> propelling<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.090> rotation

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840
