I don't know about the 13 but I think it
is<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.769> same<00:00:10.950> part<00:00:11.280> number<00:00:11.340> haven't<00:00:11.820> had<00:00:11.910> a

later on when I get a driveshaft in and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.980 
later on when I get a driveshaft in and
see<00:00:22.859> if<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.039> can't<00:00:23.250> figure<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.990> question

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
is laying flat on the table so we have

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.779 
is laying flat on the table so we have
one<00:00:50.460> axis<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.539> u-joint

that's<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> way<00:01:31.710> Polaris<00:01:32.159> decided<00:01:32.670> they

that's the way Polaris decided they

that's the way Polaris decided they

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
wanted it done for whatever technical

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.170 
wanted it done for whatever technical
reasons<00:01:35.100> let's<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.549> go<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:36.030> they

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
reasons let's just go with what they

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.270 
reasons let's just go with what they
have<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.540> say

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
have to say

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.580 
have to say
now<00:01:38.360> there's<00:01:39.360> only<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:39.600> zerk<00:01:40.020> fitting<00:01:40.409> on

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
now there's only one zerk fitting on

now there's only one zerk fitting on
your<00:01:41.040> drive<00:01:41.310> shaft<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.780> reach<00:01:43.049> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
your drive shaft you can reach it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.830 
your drive shaft you can reach it
through<00:01:43.979> an<00:01:44.220> access<00:01:44.729> port<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> bottom<00:01:45.540> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
through an access port on the bottom of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.219 
through an access port on the bottom of
your<00:01:45.930> skid<00:01:46.829> plate<00:01:47.570> easiest<00:01:48.570> way<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.049> my

your skid plate easiest way in my

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.710 
your skid plate easiest way in my
opinion<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.920> when<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.640> are<00:01:50.820> doing<00:01:51.149> an<00:01:51.360> engine

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
opinion is when you are doing an engine

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.139 
opinion is when you are doing an engine
oil<00:01:51.840> check<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:52.470> change<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:54.000> the

working from the passenger side with the
roll<00:03:56.700> pin<00:03:56.970> on<00:03:57.389> about<00:03:59.090> about<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.269> angle<00:04:00.510> there

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
roll pin on about about that angle there

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.099 
roll pin on about about that angle there
I<00:04:00.840> guess<00:04:01.109> that<00:04:01.290> would<00:04:01.410> be<00:04:01.530> about<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:02.989> 120<00:04:03.989> degree

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
I guess that would be about a 120 degree

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.670 
I guess that would be about a 120 degree
angle<00:04:04.709> off<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.760> north<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.209> south<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:07.500> could

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
angle off of north and south and I could

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.590 
angle off of north and south and I could
put<00:04:07.829> my<00:04:08.010> air<00:04:08.250> chisel<00:04:08.489> right<00:04:08.850> on<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.180> end<00:04:09.359> with
