00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.879
 hi girls I'm too much 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.529
 happy to find you I apologize 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.490
 a thousand times for the time that genia 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.940
 redo a video 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.750
 I had movement fields in my life 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.609
 finally the upheavals 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.290
 let's say that I have passed exams 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.490
 year-end I found right away 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.180
 in the influential mayor of meaux work 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.110
 etc. 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.020
 so there are a lot of things going on 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.700
 accelerated suddenly and suddenly bah 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.140
 I have not found the time to do 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.419
 two videos it's a bit complicated 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.610
 for me level canning but that's it 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.050
 now everything is back in order 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.370
 we say I get a little better 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.530
 organize me so now I'm going 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.289
 try to redo you more videos 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.030
 regularly hoping that my job 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.339
 time allow me but I'm going 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.719
 make a big big effort because that 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.550
 missed me a lot I saw all your 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.109

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.309

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.409
 little messages that you send me that 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.299
 whether on facebook or on youtube I 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.139
 read them all even if I have no time to 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.789
 reply to all 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:01.489
 but I told him all in any case 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.229
 here I see them all without exception 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.470
 so I thank you already for sam 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.719
 a thousand times and many today we get 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.180
 found with a video that will talk about 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.860
 my make-up that I'm doing was so in 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.710
 summer we want to wear less 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.939
 makeup that go cases I had 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 want to make a video about you 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.600
 of that since on some pictures on 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.490
 instagram so we made movies have 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.079

 doors how were I going etc 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.000
 so I thought it could be 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.520
 Nice to show you what I'm doing 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.759

 really super simple because we were 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.040
 it stops 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.660
 is surprising so here I hope this 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.950

 happy to find me to her is

 rather and I prepare you for the 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.080
 next time I think a tutorial on my 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.460
 favorite products of the moment because in 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.040
 this moment there are plenty of small products 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.210
 the rare one I typically steal a 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.560
 little bit but the arrangement I 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.760
 really flagship products that I love 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.740
 and that I put every day that 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.480
 I regularly use the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.040
 next video it will be about that 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.630
 here I do the fangs kisses and we get 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.570
 found immediately in wood in the 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.950
 videos 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.210
 so we were personally I did not 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.920
 do not want too much in vain I just hurt 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.380
 landser even hides hen but redness 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.610
 by the way talking about rodents do not 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.720
 do not be afraid I come from 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.459
 trades because I was coming home from work 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.840
 and my skin she does not like it too much when 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.480
 never said but who is I really 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.730
 am a little red so here's for 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.440
 the state of my skin when I film the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.940
 video so here I put a little bit 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.320
 of dark circles the habit that under the 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.930
 eyes there I had little buttons so 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.209
 never hidden all that and I come from goat 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.770
 fade everything with my the useful sends 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.290
 who is judged nian must find it at 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.910
 sephora is the real one so we have 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.290
 the brand youtube blender and that is 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.160
 really tip top of the top 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.300
 and to better use it, you have to unify 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.950
 well mega sponge care of this fact 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.810
 unique though that which allows for 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.209
 much better to display the ancient soul 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.070
 then I use my sephora powder for 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.290
 which I cracked who is called the friend 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.840
 krosmoz so I took a tone any media 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.430
 number 30 for neither proud a little bit my 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.860
 face because we do not tan the 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.660
 everything from the face I intrude you from the body 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.489
 but not at all from the face of the neck 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.870
 I'm trying to make sure that there is no 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.510
 not too much difference between the two 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.620
 who is not against demarcation 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.600
 unfortunately I'm not part of 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.430
 girls 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.200
 who are pretty tanned in the summer for 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.410
 can not put anything on their 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.410
 course 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.680
 then for the eyes I use crillon 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.420
 waterproof which is a black grape so 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.769
 I love him to end the summer I put all 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.349
 the players I put it every day in 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.180
 this moment because it's dark but 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.859
 he has a touch of blue you see 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.319
 maybe not good the camera but that 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.609
 is a bit of a black and suddenly 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.079
 to heat it still illuminates a little 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.909
 little more that look when red eye liner 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.400
 totally black and so for the summer I 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.280
 think it's really great it gives 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.629
 a small side a little colorful side to his 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.900
 unhurried look takes care of me too much 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.849
 are not turquoise blue what 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.919
 then I apply waterproof mascara 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.780
 this one is the ultra tech from kiko 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.519
 why waterproof because I have the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.049
 eyes very sensitive and caen was with the 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.489
 sun are the eyes crying so 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.739
 I lived my sunglasses or what 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.659
 and low waterproof shot that avoids me 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.669
 to have small marks of height 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.720
 since they are hens here so I have 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.849
 the eyes that cry 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.500
 so you see I'm spreading 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.389
 eye everywhere I forgot to 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.000
 remove it in the video but so here 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.660
 remove the top when you m when you 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.610
 put some marks 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.560
 Then I will do my eyebrows with 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.180
 still a rotting pencil I like 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.159
 way too much so that's the hue 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.240
 number 4 and eyebrow pencil you 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.470
 could really be very nice and a 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.349
 little brush for the former president of 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.030
 side and the pencil of the other and suddenly 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.440
 here I do everyday my 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.479
 eyebrows with salt a dish that 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.390
 almost exactly matches the 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.850
 color of 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.200
 of my hair and my worries there so 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.090
 here I think I 'll make you a 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.150
 video of how I do my eyebrows 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.070
 really only devoted to his voice 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.630
 the gym accelerates since it is not 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.330
 very interesting either I think 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.330
 that a video apart will be more practical 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.090
 then to warm up a little bit my 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.700
 dyed girls who do not tan 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.560
 I use a looser did not see it like 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.510
 that we are losing sunshine to pessac men have 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.540
 played a little bit of a hollow devote 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.720
 to make 1 micron touring mimi 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.890
 warming up of faces we're going to say that's it 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.810
 so never a little bit about the bombs 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.970
 and my face a little bit on the 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.770
 blow and you madam then assesses for 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.500
 finish I use bompard at you from home 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.590
 nyx that I find super that seems hyper 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.900
 pink like that but if we stoned so 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.760
 light he really has pretty colors have 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.350
 makes a viral effect on me 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.030
 cheeks and really does very very good 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.530
 mine and play it golden must all 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.700
 the days right now though he 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.500
 must be blurred because the breakdowns 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.990
 colorful enough so be careful when 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.610
 you apply if you have the same and 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.350
 to finish not want to wear a red 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.580
 well well been thick in and 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.680
 excuse me I had no battery y 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.000
 is I put a little bit of baby 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.410

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.210
 this one I have mine vote it has a 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.070
 color a little bit pink fuchsia so 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.180
 I find it pretty for the summer ago 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.750
 quantity that we can afford a 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.400
 little bit of its colors so that's it 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.140
 it's my flow lips of the moment we're going 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.420
 to say and that's my look is completely 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.310

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.780

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.640
 little bit of mascara my powder a 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.920
 little color on the lips 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.480
 and here it is finished a little zoom 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.950

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.030
 line and do not forget to take it away
