water changes only thing I do is add
supplements<00:02:48.489> I<00:02:49.260> keep<00:02:50.260> those<00:02:50.500> supplements

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
supplements I keep those supplements

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.560 
supplements I keep those supplements
down<00:02:52.959> here<00:02:53.620> at<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.280> bottom<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.850> tank<00:02:55.269> and

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
down here at the bottom of the tank and

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.250 
down here at the bottom of the tank and
then<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.350> mix<00:02:56.739> them<00:02:56.950> as<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.730> need<00:02:57.970> them<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.660> 1

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
then I mix them as I need them in a 1

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.870 
then I mix them as I need them in a 1
gallon<00:03:00.209> milk<00:03:01.209> jug<00:03:02.489> I'm<00:03:03.489> only<00:03:03.790> using<00:03:05.880> 3

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
gallon milk jug I'm only using 3

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.160 
gallon milk jug I'm only using 3
supplements<00:03:07.350> basically<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.380> use<00:03:09.299> this<00:03:11.130> Kent

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
supplements basically I use this Kent

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.819 
supplements basically I use this Kent
reefa<00:03:14.170> central's<00:03:14.739> or<00:03:15.400> essential<00:03:15.940> elements

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
reefa central's or essential elements

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.520 
reefa central's or essential elements
it's<00:03:17.829> Kent<00:03:18.160> marine<00:03:18.519> and<00:03:19.350> then<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.380> use<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:22.530> Cal

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
it's Kent marine and then I use this Cal

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.699 
it's Kent marine and then I use this Cal
sy<00:03:24.359> ion<00:03:25.359> made<00:03:26.260> by<00:03:26.500> Brightwell<00:03:27.340> aquatics<00:03:28.150> and

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
sy ion made by Brightwell aquatics and

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.729 
sy ion made by Brightwell aquatics and
that's<00:03:29.709> for<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.449> concentrated<00:03:31.449> calcium<00:03:32.290> and

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
that's for the concentrated calcium and

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:41.300 
that's for the concentrated calcium and
then<00:03:33.699> I<00:03:33.729> also<00:03:34.299> mix<00:03:34.780> my<00:03:35.139> own<00:03:38.910> magnesium<00:03:40.019> with<00:03:41.019> a

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
then I also mix my own magnesium with a

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.770 
then I also mix my own magnesium with a
at<00:03:42.310> reef<00:03:43.030> advantage<00:03:43.660> magnesium<00:03:45.329> by<00:03:46.329> seach

at reef advantage magnesium by seach

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.300 
at reef advantage magnesium by seach
them<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:49.329> that's<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:50.049> don't<00:03:50.590> have<00:03:50.859> anything

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
them and that's it I don't have anything

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.949 
them and that's it I don't have anything
else<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:54.130> I<00:03:54.400> mixed<00:03:54.940> those<00:03:55.120> like<00:03:55.449> I<00:03:55.479> said<00:03:55.810> in

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
else and I mixed those like I said in

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.840 
else and I mixed those like I said in
the<00:03:56.049> milk<00:03:56.260> jug<00:03:58.500> which<00:03:59.500> I<00:03:59.709> create<00:04:00.070> a<00:04:00.100> siphon

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
the milk jug which I create a siphon

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.920 
the milk jug which I create a siphon
with<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.570> rubber<00:04:01.870> tube<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.880> then<00:04:04.269> I<00:04:04.299> drip<00:04:04.750> that

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
with a rubber tube and then I drip that

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.879 
with a rubber tube and then I drip that
into<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.440> system<00:04:06.930> now<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:07.989> do<00:04:08.109> that<00:04:08.470> about

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:17.400 

probably<00:04:11.889> three<00:04:13.199> to<00:04:14.199> four<00:04:14.889> times<00:04:16.169> during<00:04:17.169> the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
probably three to four times during the

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.150 
probably three to four times during the
week<00:04:18.660> but<00:04:19.660> that's<00:04:19.900> for<00:04:20.139> that<00:04:20.229> entire<00:04:20.680> jug

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
week but that's for that entire jug

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.620 
week but that's for that entire jug
after<00:04:21.639> I've<00:04:21.729> mixed<00:04:22.030> up<00:04:23.550> 15<00:04:24.550> milliliters<00:04:25.419> of

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
after I've mixed up 15 milliliters of

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.840 
after I've mixed up 15 milliliters of
each<00:04:25.810> in<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.290> bottle<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.070> then<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.400> mix<00:04:27.669> them

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
each in that bottle and then I mix them

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.060 
each in that bottle and then I mix them
together<00:04:27.970> with<00:04:28.449> my<00:04:28.690> regular<00:04:29.080> water<00:04:29.410> which<00:04:29.860> by

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
together with my regular water which by

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.060 
together with my regular water which by
the<00:04:30.130> way<00:04:30.280> is<00:04:30.520> Hanford<00:04:31.240> tap<00:04:31.780> water<00:04:32.169> city<00:04:32.830> where

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
the way is Hanford tap water city where

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.159 
the way is Hanford tap water city where
I<00:04:33.100> live<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.639> don't<00:04:33.699> do<00:04:34.000> anything<00:04:34.479> special<00:04:34.780> on

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
I live I don't do anything special on

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:43.290 
I live I don't do anything special on
that<00:04:35.830> I<00:04:37.050> keep<00:04:38.050> very<00:04:38.440> close<00:04:41.460> range<00:04:42.460> of<00:04:43.120> the

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
that I keep very close range of the

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.499 
that I keep very close range of the
salinity<00:04:43.750> I've<00:04:44.590> watched<00:04:44.889> that<00:04:45.330> daily<00:04:46.330> that's

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
salinity I've watched that daily that's

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.450 
salinity I've watched that daily that's
the<00:04:46.690> only<00:04:46.930> thing<00:04:47.139> I<00:04:47.290> do<00:04:47.350> daily<00:04:47.919> on<00:04:48.040> this<00:04:48.250> day

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
the only thing I do daily on this day

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.920 
the only thing I do daily on this day
and<00:04:48.759> then<00:04:49.449> I<00:04:49.750> adjust<00:04:50.440> my<00:04:50.530> top<00:04:51.190> off<00:04:51.430> water<00:04:51.930> with

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
and then I adjust my top off water with

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.969 
and then I adjust my top off water with
either<00:04:53.250> premix<00:04:54.250> salt<00:04:54.520> water<00:04:54.790> or<00:04:54.940> fresh<00:04:55.870> water

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
either premix salt water or fresh water

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.860 
either premix salt water or fresh water
depending<00:04:56.979> on<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.220> salinity<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:58.300> it<00:04:58.660> hangs

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
depending on the salinity and it hangs

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.540 
depending on the salinity and it hangs
in<00:04:59.080> there<00:04:59.199> pretty<00:04:59.440> good<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:03.009> hope<00:05:03.490> that

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
in there pretty good so I hope that

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.640 
in there pretty good so I hope that
