00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
variety of other gestures which I

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.960 
variety of other gestures which I
covered<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.740> my<00:03:02.860> full<00:03:03.130> review<00:03:03.310> now<00:03:03.850> this

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
covered in my full review now this

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.400 
covered in my full review now this
keyboard<00:03:04.150> feels<00:03:04.480> very<00:03:04.810> similar<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.320> the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
keyboard feels very similar to the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.690 
keyboard feels very similar to the
previous<00:03:05.560> generation<00:03:06.310> but<00:03:06.340> they've<00:03:06.610> added

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
previous generation but they've added

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.460 
previous generation but they've added
some<00:03:06.910> space<00:03:07.270> below<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.020> I<00:03:08.080> find<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.320> it's

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
some space below it so I find that it's

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
some space below it so I find that it's
actually<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.709> lot<00:03:08.890> more<00:03:09.010> comfortable<00:03:09.250> to

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
actually a lot more comfortable to

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.280 
actually a lot more comfortable to
handle<00:03:09.640> than<00:03:10.209> before<00:03:10.690> but<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:10.930> does<00:03:11.080> make<00:03:11.230> the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
handle than before but it does make the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.290 
handle than before but it does make the
phone<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.770> little<00:03:11.920> taller<00:03:12.310> toward<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.940> top<00:03:13.150> we

back we also have some new materials a
smaller<00:05:17.680> access<00:05:18.310> panel<00:05:18.760> so<00:05:18.940> it's<00:05:19.060> not<00:05:19.150> quite

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
smaller access panel so it's not quite

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.090 
smaller access panel so it's not quite
as<00:05:19.540> big<00:05:19.690> as<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:19.990> previous<00:05:20.290> generation<00:05:20.320> we

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
as big as the previous generation we

top of the display doesn't look quite as
slick<00:05:27.790> as<00:05:27.970> the<00:05:28.120> previous<00:05:28.480> generation<00:05:28.540> with

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
accessories so we have a leather flip

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.510 
accessories so we have a leather flip
case<00:05:38.230> which<00:05:38.590> is<00:05:38.740> pretty<00:05:38.950> slick<00:05:39.190> here<00:05:39.400> and

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520

snaps<00:05:39.730> onto<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.120> back<00:05:40.270> provides<00:05:40.630> a<00:05:40.720> lot<00:05:40.900> of

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
snaps onto the back provides a lot of

snaps onto the back provides a lot of
protection<00:05:41.110> along<00:05:41.919> the<00:05:42.100> back<00:05:42.280> while<00:05:42.520> still

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
protection along the back while still

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.820 
protection along the back while still
preserving<00:05:42.940> NFC<00:05:43.750> capability<00:05:44.320> on<00:05:44.470> the<00:05:44.590> phone

so we have a leather flip shell that

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.380 
so we have a leather flip shell that
when<00:05:47.290> closed<00:05:47.680> puts<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:48.550> device<00:05:48.820> to<00:05:49.000> sleep<00:05:49.210> or

when closed puts the device to sleep or

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.909 
when closed puts the device to sleep or
wakes<00:05:49.600> it<00:05:49.780> up<00:05:49.900> when<00:05:50.020> you<00:05:50.080> flip<00:05:50.320> it<00:05:50.350> open<00:05:50.560> and

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
wakes it up when you flip it open and
