00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.730
 while aggressive as a cast abengoa 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.410
 mounted on a good hammer a mini now 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.349
 dream of my life and drive a 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.849
 lamborghini surrounds hello that such guys in 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.380
 this video I come to show you a way 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.849
 very very simple with which you are going to 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.530
 to be able to do the pp all of you who are 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.019
 beginners because you already know that these 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.759
 tricks with missions and such are not tricks 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.880
 bringing people with level 80 100 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.019
 can really benefit the only thing 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.119
 that this trick has a true 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.349
 benefit for everyone what 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.359
 you will have to do is go online 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.090
 activities to be the host of a 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.859
 activity created by rockstar us 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.320
 we will go to the races and to one that 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.000
 call under the center to note that down 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.769
 there is one that puts another center not 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.079
 wrong because if not, it's not going to 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.730
 to leave is not that the career is under the 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.890
 center once we have located it 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.449
 we will enter the race and once 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.180
 we are in the race the only thing 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.130
 what shall we do? 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.080
 is to follow the route that you see I'm going to 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.730
 follow me now we do not have to 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.560
 worry about the race I os 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.510
 I recommend with metais to do them only with 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.430
 Some friend who also wants to do the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.410
 pp or want to unlock the jumps 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.600
 acrobatic because the advantage of this 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.430
 trick is that at the same time we're going to go 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.229
 getting 100 drp every time 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.140
 hit a little jump will give us time to give 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.300
 about 23 each minute depends on what 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.010
 fast that we are each one is to say that 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.470
 every minute we are going to take over 200 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.790
 or 300 reputation points is a trick 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.290
 quickie for people who are 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.700
 starting you can go up well level and 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.680
 what I tell you every time you see a 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.210
 jump and get rpp you will be 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.220
 unlocking one of the jumps 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.050
 acrobatic because that is the trick we 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.610
 gives the rpp option because with this this 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.560
 trick we unlock the jumps 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.090
 then at the same time you go 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.590
 raising the first levels that both 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.450
 it costs to raise the to unlock the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.710
 first weapons and all that at the same time 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.000
 I would be unlocking the jumps 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.740
 acrobatic to unlock 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.270
 paintings and little things in the cars just 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.800
 so nothing guys I hope what 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.990
 enjoy what you share with your 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.869
 friends like you always appreciate a 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.730
 goodbye and until the next one happens 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.680
 next to aunts in a bikini 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.050
 the good life with a vodka and a chemistry 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.150
 leave if I come with my band you 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.520
 escapes can not be compared to my 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.920
 hydrate style shot with my aka 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.200
 in a suit with a hangover he threw me non-stop 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.900
 I'm sorry it's your plate license plate cars 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.730
 high traffic with aircraft brands by 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.550
 the map just try to give me home 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.470
 illegal racing and auctions I am this 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.750
 zombie that you meet on the street by 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.550
 the all- gas face with the rap put all 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.500
 they want me dead is franklin that we 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.480
 they like escaping in the desert I want 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.430
 everything as a hobby behind called by the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.690
 mobile only heard the sirens when 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.560
 escaped from the cop 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.530
 in this animal and be better 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.190
 disengaging easier to win is what 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.190
 that explains more
