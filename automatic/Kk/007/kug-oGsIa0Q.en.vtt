00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
I thought it was just gonna be like a

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.920 
I thought it was just gonna be like a
hard<00:02:14.590> plastic<00:02:14.800> but<00:02:15.220> no<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.730> metal<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.720> they

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
hard plastic but no is a metal and they

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.960 
hard plastic but no is a metal and they
have<00:02:17.019> isolation<00:02:17.769> pads<00:02:18.010> on<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.430> bottom<00:02:18.580> I

have isolation pads on the bottom I

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.780 
have isolation pads on the bottom I
recommend<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.870> do<00:02:20.140> get<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.769> stands<00:02:21.459> if

recommend that you do get the stands if

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.880 
recommend that you do get the stands if
you<00:02:22.450> don't<00:02:22.629> like<00:02:22.780> your<00:02:22.930> desk<00:02:23.200> vibrating<00:02:23.739> I

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.130 
a USB power power is on the back now
instead<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.849> right<00:02:40.090> here<00:02:40.299> which<00:02:40.750> makes<00:02:40.989> it

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
instead of right here which makes it

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.660 
instead of right here which makes it
look<00:02:41.260> even<00:02:41.440> more<00:02:41.620> cut<00:02:42.040> because<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.370> can<00:02:42.580> hide

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
look even more cut because you can hide

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.309 
look even more cut because you can hide
the<00:02:42.849> wire<00:02:43.000> right<00:02:43.299> here<00:02:43.569> and<00:02:43.750> everything<00:02:44.110> looks

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319
