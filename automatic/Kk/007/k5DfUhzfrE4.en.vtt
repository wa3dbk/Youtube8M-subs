other day the spawns are actually fine I
find<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.340> when<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.640> play<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> party<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
find that when you play with a party you

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.240 
find that when you play with a party you
have<00:00:42.750> better<00:00:42.989> results<00:00:43.200> than<00:00:43.710> playing<00:00:44.070> by

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
have better results than playing by

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.500 
have better results than playing by
yourself<00:00:44.370> because<00:00:44.879> when<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.239> play<00:00:45.270> by

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
yourself because when you play by

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.389 
yourself because when you play by
yourself<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.110> game<00:00:46.320> which<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.250> would

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
yourself in this game which I would

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.400 
yourself in this game which I would
HIGHLY<00:00:47.700> not<00:00:48.300> advise<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.170> because

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
HIGHLY not advise you to do because

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.080 
HIGHLY not advise you to do because
playing<00:00:49.800> by<00:00:49.920> yourself<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.700> death<00:00:50.850> trap

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
playing by yourself is just a death trap

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.549 
playing by yourself is just a death trap
you're<00:00:51.329> not<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.780> well<00:00:51.930> at<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you're not going to do well at all and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.110 
you're not going to do well at all and
when<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.280> play<00:00:53.399> with<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> party<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> don't

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
when you play with a party you don't

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.910 
when you play with a party you don't
have<00:00:54.300> randoms<00:00:54.719> rushing<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.260> flipping<00:00:55.620> spawns

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
have randoms rushing in flipping spawns

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
have randoms rushing in flipping spawns
and<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.730> causing<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.180> kinds<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.539> chaos<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and for causing all kinds of chaos and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.299 
and for causing all kinds of chaos and
having<00:00:58.199> people<00:00:58.289> spawn<00:00:58.620> behind<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.100> stuff

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309

do<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.389> think<00:02:54.659> is<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.989> most<00:02:55.019> annoying<00:02:55.560> thing

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
do you think is the most annoying thing

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.670 
do you think is the most annoying thing
and<00:02:56.340> black<00:02:56.579> ops<00:02:56.819> 2<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.420> i<00:02:58.260> would<00:02:58.409> give<00:02:58.650> this

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and black ops 2 and i would give this

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.949 
and black ops 2 and i would give this
the<00:02:59.040> number<00:02:59.280> one<00:02:59.430> spot<00:02:59.609> because<00:03:00.000> i<00:03:00.209> really

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
the number one spot because i really

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.509 
the number one spot because i really
wish<00:03:01.109> there<00:03:01.319> would<00:03:01.409> be<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.560> three-second<00:03:02.430> i

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
wish there would be a three-second i

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.949 
wish there would be a three-second i
think<00:03:02.760> three<00:03:03.000> seconds<00:03:03.329> spawn<00:03:03.510> protection

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
think three seconds spawn protection

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.360 
think three seconds spawn protection
would<00:03:04.049> be<00:03:04.200> fair<00:03:04.439> that<00:03:04.470> way<00:03:04.769> when<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.040> spawn

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
would be fair that way when you spawn

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.729 
would be fair that way when you spawn
don't<00:03:05.970> even<00:03:06.180> get<00:03:06.299> time<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.510> move<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.319> won't

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
don't even get time to move you won't

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.490 
don't even get time to move you won't
die<00:03:07.859> instantly<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:09.659> if<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.959> don't<00:03:10.139> move<00:03:10.349> you

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
die instantly but if you don't move you

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.440 
die instantly but if you don't move you
know<00:03:10.590> you're<00:03:10.769> going<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:10.920> die<00:03:11.099> so<00:03:11.549> i<00:03:11.819> think<00:03:12.060> that

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
know you're going to die so i think that

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.940 
know you're going to die so i think that
