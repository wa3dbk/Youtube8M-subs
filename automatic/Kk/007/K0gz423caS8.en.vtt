another 120 bucks on a silencer just to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.479 
another 120 bucks on a silencer just to
have<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> spark<00:00:34.230> arrestor<00:00:34.649> I'm<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.370> when

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
have the spark arrestor I'm this is when

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.869 
have the spark arrestor I'm this is when
I<00:00:35.520> threw<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.000> burgh<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.450> while<00:00:36.660> ago<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.950> want

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
I threw on the burgh a while ago I want

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
I threw on the burgh a while ago I want
the<00:00:39.000> FMF<00:00:39.360> shorty<00:00:39.809> pipe<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.620> added<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the FMF shorty pipe and I added the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.880 
the FMF shorty pipe and I added the
spark<00:00:41.190> arrestor<00:00:41.899> there<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.200> right<00:00:43.379> there

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
spark arrestor there it is right there

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.660 
spark arrestor there it is right there
so<00:00:44.610> what<00:00:44.730> I'll<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.940> doing<00:00:45.059> today<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.559> a

so what I'll be doing today is this is a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:54.380 
so what I'll be doing today is this is a
2000<00:00:47.989> susukino<00:00:50.090> 50<00:00:52.250> this<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.399> has<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.850> FMF

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
2000 susukino 50 this one has the FMF

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.299 
2000 susukino 50 this one has the FMF
power<00:00:54.809> core<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.899> no<00:00:57.899> silent<00:00:58.559> no<00:00:58.829> spark

power core and no silent no spark
arrestor<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> I'll<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.670> putting<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.329> that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
arrestor so I'll be putting one in that

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.550 
arrestor so I'll be putting one in that
in<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.439> today<00:01:05.270> this<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.560> 2002

there measure cut it up and then jb weld
at<00:02:07.680> hand<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:08.670> also<00:02:08.789> good<00:02:09.060> ideas<00:02:09.420> while

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
at hand it's also good ideas while

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.809 
at hand it's also good ideas while
you're<00:02:09.929> adding<00:02:10.379> spark<00:02:11.099> arrestor<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.700> your

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
you're adding spark arrestor to your

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.850 
you're adding spark arrestor to your
pipe

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
pipe

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.070 
pipe
I<00:02:12.890> mean<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.430> might<00:02:13.580> as<00:02:13.700> well<00:02:14.050> repack<00:02:15.050> your

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
I mean you might as well repack your

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.770 
I mean you might as well repack your
silencer<00:02:15.590> as<00:02:15.710> well<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.370> always<00:02:16.550> make<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.660> as<00:02:17.750> a

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
silencer as well so always make it as a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.600 
silencer as well so always make it as a
rule<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.050> thumb<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.620> think<00:02:18.980> new<00:02:19.070> spark<00:02:19.340> arrestor

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
rule of thumb I think new spark arrestor

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.320 
rule of thumb I think new spark arrestor
might<00:02:19.730> as<00:02:19.820> well<00:02:20.000> repack<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.420> with<00:02:22.120> with<00:02:23.120> some

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
might as well repack it with with some

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.950 
might as well repack it with with some
filter<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.190> pretty<00:02:25.190> easy<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.490> do<00:02:25.670> using<00:02:26.660> most

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
filter so pretty easy to do using most

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.280 
filter so pretty easy to do using most
pipes<00:02:27.200> have<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.640> bolts<00:02:28.640> here<00:02:29.110> unloosen<00:02:30.110> those

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
pipes have the bolts here unloosen those

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.750 
pipes have the bolts here unloosen those
I<00:02:30.320> just<00:02:30.590> take<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> razor<00:02:31.160> blade

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
I just take a razor blade

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.480 
I just take a razor blade
and<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:32.780> cut<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.530> bead<00:02:33.740> that's<00:02:33.920> already<00:02:34.220> there

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
and I cut the bead that's already there

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.840 
and I cut the bead that's already there
just<00:02:35.590> like<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.070> hit<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.340> with<00:02:37.460> a<00:02:37.490> mallet

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
just like that and hit it with a mallet

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.990 
just like that and hit it with a mallet
and<00:02:38.030> just<00:02:38.300> come<00:02:38.480> right<00:02:38.660> off<00:02:38.690> no<00:02:38.840> problem<00:02:39.350> so

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
and just come right off no problem so

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.910 
and just come right off no problem so
all<00:02:41.000> right<00:02:41.240> I<00:02:41.270> got<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.600> silencer<00:02:42.470> all<00:02:42.590> torn

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
all right I got the silencer all torn

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.820 
all right I got the silencer all torn
down<00:02:43.690> kai<00:02:44.690> took<00:02:44.990> some<00:02:45.140> contact<00:02:45.620> cleaner

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
down kai took some contact cleaner

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.560 
down kai took some contact cleaner
sprayed<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.460> in<00:02:46.550> here<00:02:46.700> got<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.090> all<00:02:47.270> cleaned

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
sprayed it in here got this all cleaned

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.449 
sprayed it in here got this all cleaned
up<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:48.230> nice<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.820> raw<00:02:49.820> metal<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.370> the

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
up so it's nice and raw metal so the

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.310 
up so it's nice and raw metal so the
next<00:02:52.640> thing<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.820> do<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.180> take<00:02:53.330> your<00:02:53.390> Pro

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
next thing you do is you take your Pro

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.270 
next thing you do is you take your Pro
Circuit<00:02:54.530> cone<00:02:55.750> spark<00:02:56.750> arrestor<00:02:57.280> it's

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
Circuit cone spark arrestor it's

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.650 
Circuit cone spark arrestor it's
basically<00:02:58.580> slide<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.030> in<00:02:59.150> there<00:02:59.300> too<00:02:59.540> it's

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
basically slide it in there too it's

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.440 
basically slide it in there too it's
nice<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.110> snug<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:01.370> then<00:03:01.400> what<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.060> usually<00:03:02.209> do

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
nice and snug and then what I usually do

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.580 
nice and snug and then what I usually do
is<00:03:02.810> take<00:03:03.080> my<00:03:03.230> sharpie<00:03:04.330> mark<00:03:05.330> all<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.500> way

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
is take my sharpie mark all the way

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.860 
is take my sharpie mark all the way
around<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:08.750> then<00:03:09.440> after<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.750> just<00:03:11.750> take

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
around and then after that I just take

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.470 
around and then after that I just take
my<00:03:11.990> Dremel<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.590> then<00:03:13.459> I'll<00:03:13.580> take<00:03:14.030> this<00:03:14.240> off

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
my Dremel and then I'll take this off

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.480 
my Dremel and then I'll take this off
and<00:03:14.750> then<00:03:14.810> put<00:03:15.020> my<00:03:15.110> dremel<00:03:15.470> or<00:03:15.650> this<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.430> the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
and then put my dremel or this in the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.640 
and then put my dremel or this in the
clamp<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.000> then<00:03:17.180> take<00:03:17.780> my<00:03:17.900> dremel<00:03:18.230> cut<00:03:18.470> right

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
clamp and then take my dremel cut right

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.960 
clamp and then take my dremel cut right
around<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:19.070> just<00:03:19.750> like<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:21.550> all<00:03:22.550> right<00:03:22.760> so

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
around it just like that all right so

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.870 
around it just like that all right so
then<00:03:23.300> got<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.930> screen<00:03:24.260> all<00:03:24.560> cut<00:03:24.860> up<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.790> then

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
then got the screen all cut up and then

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.070 
then got the screen all cut up and then
pretty<00:03:26.090> much<00:03:26.209> all<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:26.360> do<00:03:26.540> is<00:03:26.600> you<00:03:26.690> stick<00:03:26.930> this

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
pretty much all you do is you stick this

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.620 
pretty much all you do is you stick this
in<00:03:27.260> here<00:03:27.640> stick<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.760> screen<00:03:29.030> in<00:03:29.150> there<00:03:29.300> too

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
in here stick the screen in there too

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.060 
in here stick the screen in there too
it's<00:03:29.780> nice<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.260> snug<00:03:31.300> kind<00:03:32.300> of<00:03:32.420> like<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:33.070> and

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
it's nice and snug kind of like that and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.280 
it's nice and snug kind of like that and
then<00:03:34.340> what<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:34.489> do<00:03:34.610> is<00:03:35.060> from<00:03:35.510> there<00:03:35.750> is<00:03:35.870> take<00:03:36.140> my

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
then what I do is from there is take my

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.949 
then what I do is from there is take my
JB<00:03:36.650> will<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.300> jb<00:03:38.300> weld<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.630> all<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.900> way

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
JB will and jb weld it all the way

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.750 
JB will and jb weld it all the way
around<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.320> edge<00:03:42.280> but<00:03:43.280> that's<00:03:43.430> kind<00:03:43.610> of<00:03:43.640> how

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
around the edge but that's kind of how

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.479 
around the edge but that's kind of how
you<00:03:43.820> want<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.150> fit<00:03:45.040> it's<00:03:46.040> just<00:03:46.250> like<00:03:46.400> that

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
you want it to fit it's just like that

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.800 
you want it to fit it's just like that
and<00:03:49.489> then<00:03:49.670> jb<00:03:50.030> weld<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.420> or<00:03:50.510> if<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.720> actually

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
and then jb weld it or if you actually

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.290 
and then jb weld it or if you actually
have<00:03:51.050> a<00:03:51.110> world<00:03:51.350> or<00:03:51.580> take<00:03:52.580> a<00:03:52.610> welder<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.060> walled

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
have a world or take a welder and walled

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.680 
have a world or take a welder and walled
it<00:03:53.480> as<00:03:53.810> well<00:03:55.209> that's<00:03:56.209> kind<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.450> what<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:56.660> looks

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
it as well that's kind of what it looks

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.210 
it as well that's kind of what it looks
like<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:58.130> got<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.820> first<00:03:59.209> set<00:03:59.450> of<00:03:59.630> a<00:04:00.040> jb<00:04:01.040> weld

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
like so got the first set of a jb weld

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.180 
like so got the first set of a jb weld
sitting<00:04:01.700> in<00:04:01.820> there<00:04:02.030> i<00:04:02.470> do<00:04:03.470> like<00:04:03.680> half<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.100> the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
sitting in there i do like half of the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.670 
sitting in there i do like half of the
circle<00:04:04.450> i'll<00:04:05.450> usually<00:04:06.019> let<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.380> sit

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
circle i'll usually let that sit

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.920 
circle i'll usually let that sit
overnight<00:04:06.920> under<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.730> other<00:04:07.850> half<00:04:08.120> tomorrow

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
overnight under the other half tomorrow

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.530 
overnight under the other half tomorrow
morning<00:04:10.060> that's<00:04:11.060> kind<00:04:11.299> of<00:04:11.330> what<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.510> looks

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
morning that's kind of what it looks

packing<00:04:15.530> out<00:04:15.860> of<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.310> silencer

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.220 

pretty<00:04:21.010> worn<00:04:21.280> pretty<00:04:21.519> bad<00:04:21.760> but<00:04:22.600> I<00:04:22.840> mean<00:04:23.050> I've

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
pretty worn pretty bad but I mean I've

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.390 
pretty worn pretty bad but I mean I've
seen<00:04:23.410> worse<00:04:23.910> but<00:04:24.910> uh<00:04:25.620> is<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.889> old<00:04:27.010> packing

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
seen worse but uh is it the old packing

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.330 
seen worse but uh is it the old packing
looks<00:04:27.580> like<00:04:27.790> I<00:04:28.620> know<00:04:29.620> once<00:04:29.889> I'm<00:04:29.980> done<00:04:30.100> I'll<00:04:30.250> go

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
looks like I know once I'm done I'll go

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.670 
looks like I know once I'm done I'll go
ahead<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.639> restart<00:04:31.570> with<00:04:31.870> fresh<00:04:32.080> packing<00:04:32.530> as

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
ahead and restart with fresh packing as

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.710 
ahead and restart with fresh packing as
well<00:04:32.860> so<00:04:33.280> this<00:04:34.150> will<00:04:34.419> affect<00:04:34.870> your

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
well so this will affect your

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.820 
well so this will affect your
effectiveness<00:04:37.720> of<00:04:37.870> your<00:04:38.020> silencer<00:04:38.470> as<00:04:38.560> well

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
effectiveness of your silencer as well

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.030 
effectiveness of your silencer as well
so<00:04:39.450> I've<00:04:40.450> seen<00:04:40.690> worse<00:04:40.900> but<00:04:40.930> not<00:04:41.230> super<00:04:41.830> all

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
so I've seen worse but not super all

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.700 
so I've seen worse but not super all
right<00:04:42.160> got<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:46.600> screen<00:04:46.930> set<00:04:47.380> overnight

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
right got the the screen set overnight

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.190 
right got the the screen set overnight
so<00:04:48.520> that<00:04:48.550> it's<00:04:48.940> all<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.389> way<00:04:49.480> dry<00:04:49.660> completely

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
so that it's all the way dry completely

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.020 
so that it's all the way dry completely
I<00:04:50.470> went<00:04:51.370> ahead<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:51.550> repacked<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.540> silencer

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
I went ahead and repacked the silencer

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.909 
I went ahead and repacked the silencer
some<00:04:55.030> two-stroke<00:04:56.280> fresh<00:04:57.280> packing<00:04:57.760> in<00:04:57.910> their

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
some two-stroke fresh packing in their

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.110 
some two-stroke fresh packing in their
stead<00:04:59.919> the<00:05:00.040> cover<00:05:00.280> on<00:05:00.490> tightened<00:05:00.910> it<00:05:01.000> down

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
stead the cover on tightened it down

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.409 
stead the cover on tightened it down
already<00:05:01.450> and<00:05:01.780> uh<00:05:02.490> only<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.669> last<00:05:03.910> thing<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.210> do

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
is put a bead of silicone here should be

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.830 
is put a bead of silicone here should be
good<00:05:06.760> to<00:05:06.820> go<00:05:06.880> all<00:05:07.210> right

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
good to go all right

good to go all right
added<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:08.730> bead<00:05:09.730> of<00:05:09.760> silicone<00:05:11.669> actually<00:05:12.669> is

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
added the bead of silicone actually is

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.630 
added the bead of silicone actually is
our<00:05:12.850> RTV<00:05:13.690> gasket<00:05:14.500> because<00:05:14.680> I<00:05:14.800> I<00:05:15.130> said<00:05:15.430> look

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
our RTV gasket because I I said look

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.760 
our RTV gasket because I I said look
gonna<00:05:15.760> dry<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.060> out<00:05:16.240> but<00:05:17.110> it's<00:05:17.260> a<00:05:17.320> quick<00:05:17.500> bead

gonna dry it out but it's a quick bead

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.379 
gonna dry it out but it's a quick bead
around<00:05:18.280> it<00:05:18.400> kind<00:05:18.580> of<00:05:18.610> seals<00:05:18.850> it<00:05:19.030> up<00:05:19.150> pretty

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
around it kind of seals it up pretty

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.400 
around it kind of seals it up pretty
nice<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:21.340> that's<00:05:22.330> using<00:05:22.600> the<00:05:22.720> last<00:05:22.930> part<00:05:23.229> the

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
spark arrestor jb welded in there not

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.540 
spark arrestor jb welded in there not
going<00:05:57.820> to<00:05:57.880> go<00:05:58.000> anywhere<00:05:59.070> but<00:06:00.070> doing<00:06:00.280> this<00:06:00.370> for

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
going to go anywhere but doing this for

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.010 
going to go anywhere but doing this for
a<00:06:00.580> while<00:06:00.729> I've<00:06:00.850> never<00:06:01.030> really<00:06:01.270> had<00:06:01.419> one<00:06:01.450> come

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
a while I've never really had one come

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.670 
a while I've never really had one come
off<00:06:03.510> actually<00:06:04.510> I<00:06:04.660> take<00:06:04.750> that<00:06:04.810> back<00:06:04.930> out<00:06:05.260> of<00:06:05.289> a

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
off actually I take that back out of a

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.469 
off actually I take that back out of a
couple<00:06:05.950> years<00:06:06.160> I've<00:06:06.280> had<00:06:06.370> one<00:06:06.700> come<00:06:06.970> off<00:06:07.180> we

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
couple years I've had one come off we

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:08.990 
couple years I've had one come off we
had<00:06:07.570> to<00:06:07.660> go<00:06:07.750> back<00:06:07.900> and<00:06:08.110> put<00:06:08.229> it<00:06:08.320> back<00:06:08.440> in<00:06:08.650> but

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
had to go back and put it back in but

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.110 
had to go back and put it back in but
pretty<00:06:10.000> easy

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.760 

so<00:06:16.120> it's<00:06:16.750> a<00:06:16.780> cheap<00:06:16.990> way<00:06:17.310> to<00:06:18.310> kind<00:06:18.550> of<00:06:19.530> add<00:06:20.530> the

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
so it's a cheap way to kind of add the

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.230 
so it's a cheap way to kind of add the
spark<00:06:21.069> arrestor<00:06:21.430> without<00:06:21.699> dropping<00:06:22.060> another

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
spark arrestor without dropping another

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.330 
spark arrestor without dropping another

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
if you do add the spark arrestor in you

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.600 
if you do add the spark arrestor in you
are<00:06:31.180> kind<00:06:31.539> of<00:06:31.599> altering<00:06:32.199> your<00:06:32.500> your<00:06:33.190> exhaust

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.469 
are kind of altering your your exhaust
so<00:06:35.340> every<00:06:36.340> time<00:06:36.460> I<00:06:36.520> usually<00:06:36.849> add<00:06:37.000> a<00:06:37.030> spark

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 
so every time I usually add a spark

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:38.879 
so every time I usually add a spark
arrestor<00:06:37.780> on<00:06:37.870> any<00:06:37.990> of<00:06:38.050> my<00:06:38.139> bikes<00:06:38.380> I<00:06:38.620> usually

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
arrestor on any of my bikes I usually

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.330 
arrestor on any of my bikes I usually
have<00:06:38.979> to<00:06:39.099> reach<00:06:39.310> it<00:06:40.740> because<00:06:41.740> it<00:06:41.949> is<00:06:42.039> kind<00:06:42.280> of

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
have to reach it because it is kind of

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.430 
have to reach it because it is kind of
restricting<00:06:43.060> airflow<00:06:43.690> coming<00:06:44.050> out<00:06:44.169> of<00:06:44.319> the

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
restricting airflow coming out of the

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.760 
restricting airflow coming out of the
silencer<00:06:45.220> so<00:06:45.909> usually<00:06:46.210> I<00:06:46.270> have<00:06:46.449> to<00:06:46.630> go<00:06:46.780> maybe

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
silencer so usually I have to go maybe

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.730 
silencer so usually I have to go maybe
half<00:06:48.190> a<00:06:48.370> size<00:06:48.610> down<00:06:49.000> on<00:06:49.270> my<00:06:49.389> jet<00:06:49.720> or<00:06:50.259> just

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
half a size down on my jet or just

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.559 
half a size down on my jet or just
adjust<00:06:51.069> my<00:06:51.190> air<00:06:51.400> screw<00:06:51.729> because<00:06:51.940> you<00:06:52.210> will<00:06:52.389> get

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:52.569 
adjust my air screw because you will get

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.930 
adjust my air screw because you will get
some<00:06:52.810> runs<00:06:53.050> over<00:06:53.440> here<00:06:53.590> so<00:06:54.400> just<00:06:54.580> remember

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
some runs over here so just remember

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.839 
some runs over here so just remember
it's<00:06:55.240> a<00:06:55.300> good<00:06:55.449> idea<00:06:55.539> to<00:06:55.750> reach<00:06:56.020> it<00:06:56.259> if<00:06:56.409> you're

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:56.849 
it's a good idea to reach it if you're

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.490 
it's a good idea to reach it if you're
putting<00:06:57.849> a<00:06:57.970> spark<00:06:58.240> arrestor<00:06:58.630> in<00:06:58.780> other<00:06:59.289> knot

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
putting a spark arrestor in other knot

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.730 
putting a spark arrestor in other knot
that's<00:06:59.650> it<00:06:59.919> 19<00:07:00.909> bucks<00:07:01.150> takes<00:07:01.539> about<00:07:01.740> 20

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
that's it 19 bucks takes about 20

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.040 
that's it 19 bucks takes about 20
minutes<00:07:02.770> to<00:07:03.069> do<00:07:03.220> a<00:07:03.460> day<00:07:04.150> to<00:07:04.210> dry<00:07:04.419> that's<00:07:04.840> about

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 
minutes to do a day to dry that's about

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.289 
minutes to do a day to dry that's about
it
