00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
it looks like it was only run for that

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.379 
it looks like it was only run for that

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
long so I'm going to steal the throttle

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
gasket for it and then apparently to

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.710 
gasket for it and then apparently to
make<00:03:41.509> that<00:03:41.720> work<00:03:42.729> when<00:03:43.729> the<00:03:43.909> intake<00:03:44.569> is

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720

sitting on the engine here you have to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.830 
sitting on the engine here you have to
take<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.430> rubber<00:03:46.699> mallet<00:03:46.909> and<00:03:47.180> whack<00:03:47.449> this

position a little bit take it from
something<00:03:54.049> like<00:03:54.199> this<00:03:54.379> to<00:03:54.590> something<00:03:54.769> more

going to flip the exhaust manifolds and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.759 
going to flip the exhaust manifolds and
face<00:04:05.479> them<00:04:05.689> forward<00:04:06.139> I'm<00:04:06.290> just<00:04:06.319> going<00:04:06.590> use<00:04:06.680> the

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
face them forward I'm just going use the

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.580 
face them forward I'm just going use the
stock<00:04:07.009> manifold<00:04:07.519> and<00:04:07.989> then<00:04:08.989> make<00:04:09.169> up<00:04:09.199> the<00:04:09.439> hot

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
stock manifold and then make up the hot

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.589 
stock manifold and then make up the hot
side<00:04:09.799> of<00:04:09.859> the<00:04:09.979> turbo<00:04:10.310> as<00:04:10.540> far<00:04:11.540> as<00:04:11.689> the<00:04:11.959> ECU<00:04:12.709> the

ms1 box is already built that was

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.580 
ms1 box is already built that was
probably<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.690> first<00:04:17.810> thing<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.139> ordered<00:04:18.320> for

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
probably the first thing I ordered for

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
to go I need an MSD 6010 box to control

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.010 
to go I need an MSD 6010 box to control
the<00:04:26.389> ignition<00:04:26.719> coil

5-speed 88 with 373 s going to probably

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.020 
5-speed 88 with 373 s going to probably
put<00:05:04.310> in<00:05:04.550> another<00:05:05.330> 88<00:05:05.660> with<00:05:06.169> 273<00:05:07.130> s<00:05:07.190> something

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
put in another 88 with 273 s something

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.469 
put in another 88 with 273 s something
for<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.419> turbo<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.750> lean<00:05:08.960> up<00:05:08.990> on<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:11.240> should

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
for the turbo to lean up on that should

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.210 
for the turbo to lean up on that should
work<00:05:11.660> nicely<00:05:11.870> with<00:05:12.289> the<00:05:12.410> stall<00:05:12.620> converter<00:05:12.830> and

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
work nicely with the stall converter and

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.370 
work nicely with the stall converter and
the<00:05:13.310> flash<00:05:13.490> point<00:05:13.759> of<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.910> turbo<00:05:14.300> is<00:05:14.509> going<00:05:15.320> to

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
the flash point of the turbo is going to

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.469 
the flash point of the turbo is going to
be<00:05:15.470> right<00:05:15.620> around<00:05:15.770> 3<00:05:16.550> grand<00:05:16.810> 3200<00:05:18.820> so<00:05:19.820> this<00:05:20.300> is

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
be right around 3 grand 3200 so this is

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.510 
be right around 3 grand 3200 so this is
a<00:05:20.509> pretty<00:05:20.750> common<00:05:21.020> setup<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:21.770> pretty<00:05:22.220> common

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
a pretty common setup a pretty common

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.100 
a pretty common setup a pretty common
swap<00:05:23.500> it's<00:05:24.500> going<00:05:24.830> to<00:05:24.889> make<00:05:25.069> on<00:05:25.819> motor<00:05:26.360> alone<00:05:26.690> I

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
swap it's going to make on motor alone I

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.100 
swap it's going to make on motor alone I
would<00:05:27.680> say<00:05:27.889> it's<00:05:28.069> going<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.280> be<00:05:28.430> in<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.669> 550<00:05:29.360> to

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
would say it's going to be in the 550 to

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.399 
would say it's going to be in the 550 to
600<00:05:30.710> horse<00:05:30.889> range<00:05:31.190> to<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.699> wheels<00:05:31.909> and<00:05:32.409> then

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
600 horse range to the wheels and then

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.310 
600 horse range to the wheels and then
if<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.650> want<00:05:33.830> to<00:05:33.889> add<00:05:33.979> spray<00:05:34.310> I<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:34.580> hide<00:05:34.699> spray

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
if I want to add spray I can hide spray

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.749 
if I want to add spray I can hide spray
let's<00:05:36.320> it's<00:05:36.560> another<00:05:36.770> it's<00:05:37.009> a<00:05:37.099> very<00:05:37.490> common

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
let's it's another it's a very common

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.939 
let's it's another it's a very common
combo<00:05:38.389> that<00:05:38.659> guys<00:05:38.840> will<00:05:39.050> run<00:05:39.470> into<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:39.740> nines

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
combo that guys will run into the nines

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:45.249 
combo that guys will run into the nines
so<00:05:40.550> with<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.360> light<00:05:41.570> car<00:05:41.810> fox<00:05:42.349> chassis<00:05:44.110> it'll<00:05:45.110> be

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
so with a light car fox chassis it'll be

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:51.399 
so with a light car fox chassis it'll be
definitely<00:05:46.009> doable<00:05:50.080> trying<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.139> think<00:05:51.320> if

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
definitely doable trying to think if

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:52.540 
definitely doable trying to think if
there's<00:05:51.440> anything<00:05:51.770> else<00:05:52.039> that<00:05:52.130> goes<00:05:52.310> with

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
there's anything else that goes with

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.469 
there's anything else that goes with
this

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
this

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.450 
this
I<00:05:53.509> guess<00:05:54.289> 80<00:05:54.500> pound<00:05:54.740> injectors<00:05:55.190> are<00:05:55.280> going<00:05:55.400> to

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
I guess 80 pound injectors are going to

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.930 
I guess 80 pound injectors are going to
be<00:05:55.550> run<00:05:58.990> and<00:05:59.990> really<00:06:00.199> that's<00:06:00.380> about<00:06:00.680> it

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
be run and really that's about it

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.390 
be run and really that's about it
everything<00:06:01.940> else<00:06:02.150> is<00:06:02.330> kind<00:06:02.509> of<00:06:02.630> custom<00:06:02.990> fab

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
everything else is kind of custom fab

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.980 
everything else is kind of custom fab
motor<00:06:04.400> mounts<00:06:04.759> are<00:06:05.180> pretty<00:06:05.449> easy<00:06:05.630> to<00:06:05.750> do<00:06:05.960> on

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
motor mounts are pretty easy to do on

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.219 
motor mounts are pretty easy to do on
this<00:06:06.380> I<00:06:06.650> think<00:06:07.490> you<00:06:07.580> can<00:06:07.729> even<00:06:07.820> buy<00:06:08.090> LS<00:06:08.990> motor

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
this I think you can even buy LS motor

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.730 
this I think you can even buy LS motor
mounts<00:06:09.729> for<00:06:10.729> the<00:06:10.789> Fox<00:06:11.090> chassis<00:06:11.690> to<00:06:12.409> drop<00:06:12.620> it

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
mounts for the Fox chassis to drop it

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.670 
mounts for the Fox chassis to drop it
unless<00:06:12.949> motor<00:06:13.219> in<00:06:13.630> but<00:06:14.630> I'm<00:06:15.199> going<00:06:15.469> to<00:06:15.530> just

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
unless motor in but I'm going to just

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.439 
unless motor in but I'm going to just
kind<00:06:15.860> of<00:06:15.979> see<00:06:16.430> how<00:06:16.460> much<00:06:16.729> stuff<00:06:16.969> I<00:06:17.090> can<00:06:17.270> make

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
kind of see how much stuff I can make

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:22.089 
kind of see how much stuff I can make
how<00:06:17.990> cheap<00:06:18.259> I<00:06:18.380> can<00:06:18.620> do<00:06:18.770> it<00:06:19.090> so<00:06:20.860> there's<00:06:21.860> stuff

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
how cheap I can do it so there's stuff

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:26.260 
how cheap I can do it so there's stuff
as<00:06:22.310> it<00:06:22.400> is<00:06:22.580> and<00:06:23.050> I<00:06:24.050> will<00:06:24.680> keep<00:06:25.669> you<00:06:25.820> updated<00:06:25.940> I

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
as it is and I will keep you updated I

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.550 
as it is and I will keep you updated I
guess<00:06:26.419> I'll<00:06:26.570> probably<00:06:26.750> try<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.199> take<00:06:27.320> a<00:06:27.349> video

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
guess I'll probably try and take a video

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.499 
guess I'll probably try and take a video
after<00:06:28.520> I<00:06:28.550> get<00:06:28.699> it<00:06:28.789> cleaned<00:06:28.969> up<00:06:29.090> paint<00:06:29.389> and

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
after I get it cleaned up paint and

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.860 
after I get it cleaned up paint and
sprayed<00:06:29.780> oh<00:06:30.620> I<00:06:31.520> need<00:06:31.880> to<00:06:32.210> order<00:06:32.449> head<00:06:32.630> studs

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
sprayed oh I need to order head studs

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.510 
sprayed oh I need to order head studs
yet<00:06:33.139> I<00:06:33.370> think<00:06:34.370> there<00:06:34.520> are<00:06:34.550> 70<00:06:35.029> bucks<00:06:35.180> it's<00:06:35.539> the

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
yet I think there are 70 bucks it's the

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.800 
yet I think there are 70 bucks it's the
the<00:06:37.520> one<00:06:37.669> the<00:06:37.849> head<00:06:37.969> studs<00:06:38.210> are<00:06:38.389> the<00:06:38.449> bolts<00:06:38.719> I

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
the one the head studs are the bolts I

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.000 
the one the head studs are the bolts I
pulled<00:06:39.020> out<00:06:39.139> with<00:06:39.229> three<00:06:39.469> different<00:06:39.710> lengths

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
pulled out with three different lengths

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.300 
pulled out with three different lengths
but<00:06:40.039> I

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
but I

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.890 
but I
think<00:06:40.430> the<00:06:40.520> head<00:06:40.670> stud<00:06:40.940> kit<00:06:41.330> that<00:06:41.570> I<00:06:41.600> want

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
think the head stud kit that I want

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.060 
think the head stud kit that I want
there's<00:06:42.800> two<00:06:42.980> different<00:06:43.130> length<00:06:43.430> bolts<00:06:45.070> in

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
there's two different length bolts in

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.680 
there's two different length bolts in
the<00:06:46.250> stud<00:06:46.460> kit<00:06:46.760> I<00:06:46.970> think<00:06:47.210> that's<00:06:47.390> the<00:06:47.540> one<00:06:47.630> I

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
the stud kit I think that's the one I

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.240 
the stud kit I think that's the one I
want<00:06:47.990> I<00:06:48.170> mean<00:06:48.320> that's<00:06:48.500> what<00:06:48.620> it's<00:06:48.740> listed<00:06:49.100> for

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
want I mean that's what it's listed for

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.780
