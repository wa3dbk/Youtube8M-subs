you see I work out I go to on some

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.420 
you see I work out I go to on some
circuit<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.790> stuff<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:55.280> did<00:02:56.280> some

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
circuit and stuff like that I did some

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.009 
circuit and stuff like that I did some
very<00:02:56.459> hard<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.060> get<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.329> there<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.630> another<00:02:57.780> got

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
very hard to get in there to another got

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.259 
very hard to get in there to another got
some<00:02:58.200> low<00:02:58.590> competition<00:02:59.040> yeah<00:03:01.850> that's<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.090> man
