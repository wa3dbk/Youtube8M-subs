00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.820
 one of the main features 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.890
 of the horse but 9 step they do 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.500
 unique in its type is the mechanics of its 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.630
 movement that is called plain step 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.849
 this allows the rider to transport 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.260
 with great softness and that's why 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.840
 it is said that the Peruvian Paso horse 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.940
 It is really the best saddle horse 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.949
 of the world continuing with this contest 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.779
 of horses program of steps that had 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.580
 place on Monday let's talk now 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.470
 about the preparations for the 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.000
 competition and on this occasion when 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.129
 took into account the judge sergio 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.129
 usandivaras to choose the champions 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.470
 for the contest basically ends 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.440
 to prepare by riding it if possible 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:59.559
 every day not with an intensity of 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:02.360
 time but rather quality and 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.120
 look for your four- stroke floors 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.910
 be marked 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.730
 and little by little go to the horse getting 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.140
 the best physical condition the best flats 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.990
 that the most important thing of the horse 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.140
 Peruvian that's the softness that it gives us in 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.930
 your transfer and finally you can have 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.720
 an extension this is if we need 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.570
 about walking what the horse acquires 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.910
 a speed that neither do we 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.850
 Immute up horse or we are 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.090
 allow to go comfortably and preparation 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.730
 it is practically daily they say 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.040
 Peruvians tell us that a horse of 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.300
 competition must be assembled all 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.110
 days 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.520
 day by half how much when you continue 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.220
 a horse of this breed is not so 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.540
 simple you will have seen that the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.190
 judge is not fixed on many things not only 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.120
 the logical wall part but the 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.260
 function is very important in this race and 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.040
 good 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:09.100
 It is a binomial of empathy 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.100
 and I also think that it influences a lot 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.050
 the experience of the chalán in the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.200
 contests is very important there are adn that 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.700
 they are very experienced and they lead 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.060
 very good your horses and others that good 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.060
 they will learn 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.610
 has a format 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.220
 or not 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.890
 i 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.720
 Well the truth is that it's very nice 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.840
 hobby many horses I think they were 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.750
 more than 120 horses 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.569
 here in tucumán there are really many 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.239
 exhibitors who have maybe 12 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.730
 horses but they go everywhere always 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.790
 we say we are tall with my son who 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.800
 accompanies me everywhere that the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.780
 tucumanos are upside down and he two horses 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.870
 they accompany 20 there is a hobby a desire 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.910
 to live this sharing, that's why I've 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.160
 taken the work in each of the 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.720
 categories explain the reasons and the 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.120
 fundamentals because I chose a horse 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.519
 first and why did he leave a horse 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.579
 second third fourth because I think that 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.280
 the responsibility of those who have 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.840
 to choose because this is nothing more and 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.700
 nothing less than that is to choose is 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.329
 classify and not qualify horses 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.790
 is to try that those who come from 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.129
 the breeders up to the spectators 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.349
 can learn something and that they know why 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.299
 who are judging takes this or that 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.730
 decision I think four times 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.959
 I had to ride the horses because I did not 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.740
 was decided between the first the 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.050
 second 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.200
 really very cute very convulsed and there 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.170
 categories that I concur to all 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.090
 the competitions to Peru everywhere 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.190
 I could see categories where really 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.640
 they are first class so very 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.640
 happy 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.190
 in the Peruvian horse has a 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.250
 characteristic that we have to 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.720
 defend that is the naturalness that 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.320
 ease of moving without mistreating 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.420
 the rider this time has to be soft 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.860
 but you can not move smoothly 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.670
 if you are not strong and if you are not 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.340
 Right 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.990
 the strength I think it is without 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.780
 strengthen everything else does not exist but 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.030
 the softness the naturalness the stamps in 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.520
 the males are born the capons the type 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.900
 I really like the 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.940
 characteristic of each of the 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.770
 genres of the horse in this the shawl and 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.639
 not only the chalán the chalán and the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.249
 preparation that the horse has 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:09.449
 I would say that it is almost in some cases the 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:11.610
 50% between 50 and 30% really the 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.990
 Chalán makes a lot of difference and 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.569
 when we have someone who is 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.729
 kissed in this that has a lot of time in 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.409
 this shows on the track to a horse 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.259
 very well prepared with a chalán that 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.360
 maybe not professional it can have 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.009
 very good results instead a 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.080
 professional chalán in a case that does not 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.490
 he's ready he's going to defend him but he's going 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.779
 to arrive a moment that the horse does not 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.389
 will have physical and will not be able to 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.099
 hold it in the test then it 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.259
 they need both but a shaman 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:40.039
 with knowledge and experience by 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.039
 Of course it makes a difference 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.820
 the tucumano and this I think between the 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.410
 better but the best I am from Salta 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.570
 but I have to admit that the 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.440
 tucumanos have the best horses 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.600
 it really jumps does it by tradition 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.620
 we have many breeders but tucumán has 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.870
 advanced a lot and it has 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.770
 professionalized and good we can see here 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.210
 the fans that there are really many 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.160
 they are encouraged to come and play tucumán 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.830
 because there is a lot of passion and a lot of passion 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.600
 and we know that when there is passion it is very 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.460
 difficult to enter the reason so my 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.460
 work and has been trying that reason
