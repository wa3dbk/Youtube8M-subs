00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
it doesn't make sense to me but i'm

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.590 
it doesn't make sense to me but i'm
really<00:01:05.369> pleased<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:05.970> his<00:01:06.090> figure<00:01:06.360> we're<00:01:06.479> in

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
really pleased with his figure we're in

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.780 
really pleased with his figure we're in
robot<00:01:06.990> mode<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.650> stands<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.280> much<00:01:08.549> better

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
robot mode it it stands out much better

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.480 
robot mode it it stands out much better
than<00:01:09.000> Ironhide<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:10.170> got<00:01:10.409> really<00:01:11.040> nice<00:01:11.159> red

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
than Ironhide it's got really nice red

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.469 
than Ironhide it's got really nice red
shoulders<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:14.030> think<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
shoulders and I think it's one of the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.749 
shoulders and I think it's one of the
it's<00:01:16.380> they<00:01:16.950> should<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.220> done<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.460> mold

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it's they should have done this mold

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.609 
it's they should have done this mold
first<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> then<00:01:18.450> did<00:01:18.780> Ironhide<00:01:19.140> second

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
first and then did Ironhide second

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.609 
first and then did Ironhide second
because<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.979> looks<00:01:20.310> better<00:01:21.259> it<00:01:22.259> has<00:01:22.409> got

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
because this looks better it has got

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.469 
because this looks better it has got
some<00:01:22.799> sculpt<00:01:23.280> differences<00:01:23.759> i<00:01:23.970> will<00:01:24.180> show<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479

that's basically all there is in this

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.090 
that's basically all there is in this
mode<00:01:53.610> rolls<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.060> same<00:01:54.299> got<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> black<00:01:54.840> wheels

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
mode rolls the same got the black wheels

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.030 
mode rolls the same got the black wheels
exactly<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.159> same<00:01:56.630> just<00:01:57.630> go<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> siren<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.829> its

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
exactly the same just go a siren and its

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.240 
exactly the same just go a siren and its
weight<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.479> to<00:02:00.479> transform<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:02.009> all<00:02:02.130> know

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
weight and to transform it we all know

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.459 
weight and to transform it we all know
how<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.939> won't<00:02:03.329> go<00:02:03.990> through<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.320> too

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
how to do this I won't go through it too

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.870 
how to do this I won't go through it too
much<00:02:04.759> just<00:02:05.759> bring<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.780> up

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.070 

so<00:02:09.540> pray<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.900> legs<00:02:10.400> flip<00:02:11.400> up<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.580> things<00:02:12.080> that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
so pray the legs flip up the things that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.480 
so pray the legs flip up the things that
one<00:02:13.230> always<00:02:13.350> comes<00:02:13.680> off<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.070> right<00:02:14.250> then

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
one always comes off on the right then

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
I just think it's a really good picker I

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.840 
I just think it's a really good picker I
like<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.530> white<00:03:40.709> on<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.400> red<00:03:41.580> on<00:03:41.730> his

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
like the white on it and the red on his

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.530 
like the white on it and the red on his
arms<00:03:42.240> here<00:03:42.570> is<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.810> really<00:03:43.470> nice<00:03:43.860> red<00:03:44.540> thick

arms here is a really nice red thick
paint<00:03:45.930> looks<00:03:46.500> really<00:03:46.830> cool<00:03:48.050> the<00:03:49.050> head<00:03:49.230> sculpt

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590

his<00:03:50.250> differences<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.750> won't<00:03:51.900> be<00:03:51.990> able<00:03:52.050> to

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
his differences is you won't be able to

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.570 
his differences is you won't be able to
probably<00:03:52.320> see<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:52.680> my<00:03:52.830> camera<00:03:53.250> because<00:03:53.550> I

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
probably see it in my camera because I

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.860 
probably see it in my camera because I
might<00:03:53.790> not<00:03:53.940> have<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.180> focused<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.720> right

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
might not have it focused in the right

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.449 
might not have it focused in the right
position<00:03:55.640> but<00:03:56.640> um<00:03:58.070> ratchet<00:03:59.070> has<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.270> new<00:04:00.600> chin

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459

new cheeks a new nose and a visor the
rest<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.770> heads<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.070> same<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.580> he<00:04:09.510> does

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
rest of the heads the same but he does

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.320 
rest of the heads the same but he does
have<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:12.140> different<00:04:13.140> chin<00:04:13.700> he<00:04:14.700> could<00:04:14.880> pokes<00:04:15.120> her

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
have a different chin he could pokes her

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.789 
have a different chin he could pokes her
much<00:04:15.570> further<00:04:15.840> than<00:04:16.020> ratchets<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.650> his

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
much further than ratchets and his

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.440 
much further than ratchets and his
cheekbones<00:04:17.340> have<00:04:17.580> got<00:04:17.729> slightly<00:04:17.970> different

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
cheekbones have got slightly different

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.350 
cheekbones have got slightly different
molding<00:04:19.790> is<00:04:20.790> probably<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.419> same

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
molding is probably the same

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.529 
molding is probably the same
I<00:04:23.280> must<00:04:24.280> admit<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:24.699> ratchets<00:04:25.150> a<00:04:25.210> bit<00:04:25.360> looser

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
I must admit this ratchets a bit looser

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.270 
I must admit this ratchets a bit looser
but<00:04:26.050> then<00:04:26.199> if<00:04:26.349> you<00:04:26.439> think<00:04:26.650> about<00:04:26.710> it<00:04:26.919> they've

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
but then if you think about it they've

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.350 
but then if you think about it they've
now<00:04:27.550> done<00:04:27.750> three<00:04:29.069> versions<00:04:30.069> of<00:04:30.639> this<00:04:30.909> four

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
now done three versions of this four

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.529 
now done three versions of this four
versions<00:04:31.719> of<00:04:32.080> this<00:04:32.289> toy<00:04:33.189> so<00:04:33.909> the<00:04:34.030> mold<00:04:34.240> is

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
versions of this toy so the mold is

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.379 
versions of this toy so the mold is
probably<00:04:34.870> getting<00:04:35.110> looser<00:04:36.210> because<00:04:37.210> it's

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
probably getting looser because it's

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:44.189 
probably getting looser because it's

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
degeneration one would look like this

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.510 
degeneration one would look like this
it's<00:05:13.719> not<00:05:13.930> really<00:05:14.289> a<00:05:14.319> resemblance<00:05:14.800> is<00:05:15.219> it<00:05:15.370> at
