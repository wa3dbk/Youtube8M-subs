supplementation food so that might be

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.480 
supplementation food so that might be
using<00:01:46.969> in<00:01:47.149> a<00:01:47.210> Gatorade<00:01:47.570> might<00:01:47.930> be<00:01:48.049> using<00:01:48.490> mild

Plex it might be using any of the thing

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.350 
Plex it might be using any of the thing
that<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.350> n-c-double-a<00:01:52.220> says<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.090> can

this<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:55.670> we'll<00:01:55.850> talk<00:01:56.090> briefly<00:01:56.299> about<00:01:56.600> that

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
this and we'll talk briefly about that

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.300 
this and we'll talk briefly about that
as<00:01:57.170> well<00:01:59.229> so<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.319> question<00:02:00.649> becomes<00:02:00.920> what

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
as well so the question becomes what

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.219 
as well so the question becomes what
influences<00:02:01.909> athletic<00:02:02.299> ability<00:02:02.750> alright<00:02:03.110> when

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
influences athletic ability alright when

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.380 
influences athletic ability alright when
I<00:02:03.259> was<00:02:03.470> in<00:02:03.590> college<00:02:03.829> I<00:02:03.979> 43<00:02:04.460> years<00:02:04.850> older<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:05.299> I

able to perform but the other piece that

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.140 
able to perform but the other piece that
comes<00:02:24.920> into<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.459> training<00:02:25.730> hard<00:02:26.030> and

comes into this is training hard and
that's<00:02:26.330> what<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.540> does<00:02:26.690> have<00:02:26.930> two<00:02:27.140> days

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
that's what it does have two days
