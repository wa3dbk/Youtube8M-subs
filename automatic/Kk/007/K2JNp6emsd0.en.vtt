00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
theme all right this this would take and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.080 
theme all right this this would take and
I<00:01:37.290> pre<00:01:37.710> did<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.460> everybody<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.939> see

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
I pre did this so that everybody can see

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.490 
I pre did this so that everybody can see
this<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.360> I'll<00:01:39.600> keep<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> theme

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
this and I'll keep this with the theme

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.950 
this and I'll keep this with the theme
so<00:01:40.740> everybody<00:01:41.100> could<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> fully<00:01:41.670> loaded

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
so everybody could have a fully loaded

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.200 
so everybody could have a fully loaded
here<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.369> has<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> reload<00:01:44.970> theme

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210

here is you know it has the reload theme
that<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.420> theme<00:01:45.780> file<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.070> would<00:01:47.250> load<00:01:47.579> and

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
that I theme file so this would load and
