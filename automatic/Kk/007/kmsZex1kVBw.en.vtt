00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.640

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.640
 to help 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.460

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.970

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.790

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:38.119
 have engaged where they have paid to 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.549
 deprived children are visually impaired 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.009

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.689

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.280
 even so I was collecting for a 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.680
 school that we will leave to 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.549
 curitiba that will be a legacy of bread 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.549
 It was people so he will not just go through 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.880
 This way it will pass and it will go 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.490
 generate fruits and improve the city 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.850
 we know that through music 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.130
 through education that comes from music 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.179
 these children can create a new car 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.650
 esteem 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.640
 can create new horizons and forms of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.400
 to understand one 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:30.620
 and fit better and make a better 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:34.580
 hence our future is better then 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.250
 Libero g nÃ© and everyone knows me as 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.940
 the g1 in 2004 people got a job 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.890
 here with kids and with that there we 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.220
 It works the issue of the rhythms of 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.840
 popular cultural manifestations and right 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.190
 giving this planted in would say that the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.650
 We always put a 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.239
 so that the child can not 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.220
 the community that is going through a moment 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.800
 now where it's really good 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.050
 need of space activity it 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.760
 is obsolete which means to say that 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.800
 nothing is happening here in this 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.880
 space now then we'll be there 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.440
 with this portable alliance being the space 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.160
 reforming space and creating conditions 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.800
 what is this project for? 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.600
 really multiply and really 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.690
 is bringing even more alternatives 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.400
 for these children as guitar lessons 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.110
 aa theater class english lessons lessons 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.209
 computer and bring it here. 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.739
 teachers who are not trained and 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.299
 may be multiplying it there with 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.370
 the children, right? 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.100
 the community not only that Maicon needs 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.900
 a music school here because this 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:44.600
 environment here used to be a 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:47.180
 project I attended was small already 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.980
 I frequented that it was good that I did not stay 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.760
 on the street was wandering around like a 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.100
 july mandarin 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.110
 here through this project here too 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.440
 They gave me enough education, they gave me 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.110
 knowledge connects several friends who 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.630
 They grew up with here also through 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.360
 music that will create here in the community 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.790
 will grow more and more 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.290
 this was the first first one that people 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.000
 Is doing 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.070
 we are running the first 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.549
 project, we believe that this 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.870
 project should serve as a model 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.610
 to be done in more cities is 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.130
 have more engagement have an entrepreneur 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.510
 I have come across a project to support the 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.860
 project 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.580
 So we know this is a model. 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:38.150
 So far we have people already 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.430
 the school guaranteed the very investment 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.260
 down then we want this model 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.110
 replicate the world 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.520
 we want to spend what we 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:55.150
 got to do here in the city 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.150
 promise money that says
