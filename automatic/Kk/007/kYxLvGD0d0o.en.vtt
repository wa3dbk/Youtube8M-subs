headset or an integrated on c-clamp

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.529 
headset or an integrated on c-clamp
already<00:00:18.320> in<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:18.770> frame<00:00:19.010> but<00:00:19.850> if<00:00:20.119> you<00:00:20.300> don't

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
already in the frame but if you don't

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.439 
already in the frame but if you don't
you<00:00:21.410> would<00:00:21.530> need<00:00:21.680> to<00:00:21.860> buy<00:00:22.190> a<00:00:22.220> seat<00:00:22.520> clamp<00:00:22.730> so

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
you would need to buy a seat clamp so

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.850

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
this is what the c-clamp looks like if

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.029 
this is what the c-clamp looks like if
it's<00:00:25.010> not<00:00:25.490> already<00:00:25.789> like<00:00:26.650> welded<00:00:27.650> into<00:00:27.800> your

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
little bit of trouble because there is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.280 
little bit of trouble because there is
that<00:02:32.320> it<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.360> all<00:02:34.750> right<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.110> now<00:02:35.260> I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
that it that is it all right so now I

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.780 
that it that is it all right so now I
have<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:36.340> now<00:02:36.489> I'm<00:02:36.580> gonna<00:02:36.700> tighten<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.239> up

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
I think it's clockwise and then once you

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.780 
I think it's clockwise and then once you
have<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.440> you're<00:02:47.680> probably<00:02:47.920> just<00:02:48.400> gonna<00:02:48.519> be

straight<00:02:57.459> because<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:58.000> helps<00:02:58.360> just<00:02:59.350> wit

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
straight because it helps just wit

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.120 
straight because it helps just wit
overall<00:03:00.160> writing<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.959> then<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.620> tighten<00:03:02.890> it

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
overall writing so then you tighten it

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.850 
overall writing so then you tighten it
