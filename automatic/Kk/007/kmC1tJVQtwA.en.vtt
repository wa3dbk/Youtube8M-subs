00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.470

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.599
 minecraft and 0.10 point 5 or for 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.570
 previous or future versions that 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.520

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.560
 with this mountain it is called furniture in 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.290
 mode will already know this dead for a 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.540
 once for an earlier version in this 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.460
 area a long time ago that was the 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.640
 video that gave his victories the most 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:42.590

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.990
 a thousand visits but they subscribed nothing 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.160
 more like 100 and well I do not know why but 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.620
 It was one of the videos that had the most 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.150
 visits and more likes and good because it was that 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.860
