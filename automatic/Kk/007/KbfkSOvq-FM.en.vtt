00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
intend on using assassin I can take

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.740 
intend on using assassin I can take
their<00:01:42.869> radar<00:01:43.229> away<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> count<00:01:43.799> UAV<00:01:44.750> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
their radar away with the count UAV the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.620 
their radar away with the count UAV the
Sam<00:01:45.990> turret<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.340> means<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.299> don't

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
Sam turret and this means but I don't

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.480 
Sam turret and this means but I don't
have<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.840> use<00:01:48.930> assessor<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.380> they've<00:01:49.979> reset

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
have to use assessor and they've reset

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.280 
have to use assessor and they've reset

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.139 
so all you have to do is get eight kills
for<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> santero<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.610> die<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.850> will

week and it's a really good weapon but
there<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.760> one<00:02:11.970> bad

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
there is one bad

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.930 
there is one bad
about<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.450> when<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.290> killstreaks<00:02:14.890> reset<00:02:15.400> they

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
about it when the killstreaks reset they

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.530 
about it when the killstreaks reset they
reset<00:02:16.300> in<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.480> way<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:18.180> have<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.330> get<00:02:19.450> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
reset in a way that you have to get the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.180 
reset in a way that you have to get the
final<00:02:19.780> one<00:02:20.020> before<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.410> can<00:02:20.560> build<00:02:20.739> again<00:02:20.980> so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
final one before you can build again so

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.710 
final one before you can build again so
you<00:02:21.250> have<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.430> 18<00:02:21.880> kills<00:02:22.150> before<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.630> get

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
you have the 18 kills before you can get

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.910 
you have the 18 kills before you can get
to<00:02:22.930> your<00:02:23.140> next<00:02:23.200> um<00:02:23.650> UAV<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.239> therefore<00:02:25.930> if<00:02:26.500> i

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
to your next um UAV so therefore if i

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.130 
to your next um UAV so therefore if i
use<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.190> three<00:02:27.849> four<00:02:28.060> five<00:02:28.270> or<00:02:28.569> three<00:02:28.750> for<00:02:28.989> eight

my<00:02:41.290> team<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.709> this<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.400> something<00:02:42.610> called<00:02:42.880> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
my team and this is something called the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.780 
my team and this is something called the
ballistic<00:02:43.450> vest<00:02:43.660> which<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.250> fit<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> five

point<00:02:46.090> streak<00:02:46.390> our<00:02:46.720> set<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.019> think<00:02:47.230> it's<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.350> six

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
point streak our set I think it's a six

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.120 
point streak our set I think it's a six
point<00:02:47.680> streak<00:02:48.010> I'm<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.959> split<00:02:50.709> support<00:02:51.040> i

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
point streak I'm on the split support i

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.500 
point streak I'm on the split support i
think<00:02:51.400> i<00:02:51.489> can<00:02:51.640> use<00:02:51.730> account<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.120> spy<00:02:52.299> plane

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
think i can use account of spy plane

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.640 
think i can use account of spy plane
with<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:52.690> i'm<00:02:52.780> not<00:02:52.810> sure<00:02:53.110> maybe<00:02:53.380> they're<00:02:53.620> in

seem to have like half the range from
one<00:04:08.590> fed<00:04:08.889> to<00:04:09.069> but<00:04:09.700> i'm<00:04:09.910> not<00:04:10.150> sure<00:04:10.209> if<00:04:10.450> there's<00:04:10.630> a

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
one fed to but i'm not sure if there's a

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.090 
one fed to but i'm not sure if there's a
counter<00:04:11.139> to<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.319> hobby<00:04:11.470> center<00:04:11.709> it<00:04:11.920> may<00:04:12.040> be

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
counter to the hobby center it may be

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.819 
counter to the hobby center it may be
assassin<00:04:12.760> actually<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.900> that's<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.799> really

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
assassin actually and so that's a really

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.949 
assassin actually and so that's a really
viable<00:04:15.489> viable<00:04:16.180> option<00:04:16.479> to<00:04:16.600> be<00:04:16.690> honest<00:04:16.870> with

the<00:04:43.870> game<00:04:44.080> feels<00:04:44.350> I<00:04:44.680> I<00:04:44.950> think<00:04:45.400> it's<00:04:45.520> a<00:04:45.580> mixture

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
the game feels I I think it's a mixture

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.880 
the game feels I I think it's a mixture
between<00:04:46.180> morpho<00:04:46.990> two<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.380> battlefield<00:04:47.500> bad

sometimes<00:05:03.040> a<00:05:03.280> bit<00:05:03.460> strange<00:05:03.760> I<00:05:03.970> found<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.540> game

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660

a<00:05:04.690> little<00:05:04.900> bit<00:05:04.990> inconsistent<00:05:05.500> babies<00:05:06.250> because

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
a little bit inconsistent babies because

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
quite a few hit markers and they're

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.280 
quite a few hit markers and they're
turning<00:05:11.650> when<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:11.890> killing<00:05:12.130> me<00:05:12.690> but<00:05:13.690> that's

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
turning when and killing me but that's

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.380 
turning when and killing me but that's
expected<00:05:14.680> with<00:05:15.220> a<00:05:15.250> with<00:05:15.700> a<00:05:15.730> new<00:05:15.790> game<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.300> know

I'm<00:05:16.600> not<00:05:16.840> going<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.020> be<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.200> best<00:05:17.350> at<00:05:17.530> it<00:05:17.650> but

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
I'm not going to be the best at it but

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.490 
I'm not going to be the best at it but
if<00:05:18.160> you<00:05:18.220> keep<00:05:18.370> looking<00:05:18.730> i<00:05:18.820> haven't<00:05:19.090> died<00:05:19.240> yet

if you keep looking i haven't died yet
my<00:05:20.500> killstreaks<00:05:20.740> just<00:05:21.190> keep<00:05:21.340> saying<00:05:21.700> and<00:05:21.940> the

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
my killstreaks just keep saying and the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.080 
my killstreaks just keep saying and the
basically<00:05:23.410> no<00:05:23.890> one's<00:05:24.040> got<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.280> senior<00:05:24.700> I<00:05:24.850> think

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
basically no one's got a senior I think

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.760 
basically no one's got a senior I think
I've<00:05:25.180> played<00:05:25.630> for<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.050> while<00:05:26.140> as<00:05:26.320> I<00:05:26.410> said<00:05:26.620> and

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
I've played for a while as I said and

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.770 
I've played for a while as I said and
Upton<00:05:27.160> one<00:05:27.640> person<00:05:27.970> would<00:05:28.060> assassin<00:05:28.480> so<00:05:28.600> it's

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
Upton one person would assassin so it's

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.410 
Upton one person would assassin so it's
really<00:05:29.110> good<00:05:29.380> news<00:05:29.560> so<00:05:30.370> God<00:05:30.670> keep<00:05:30.910> on<00:05:31.120> pumping

really good news so God keep on pumping

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.900 
really good news so God keep on pumping
in<00:05:31.690> them<00:05:31.870> UAVs<00:05:32.500> can<00:05:32.740> do<00:05:32.890> is<00:05:33.010> you<00:05:33.160> take<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.520> UAV

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
in them UAVs can do is you take the UAV

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.050 
in them UAVs can do is you take the UAV
away<00:05:34.450> the<00:05:35.350> advanced<00:05:35.830> UAV<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.490> know<00:05:36.790> a<00:05:36.820> lot<00:05:37.000> of

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
away the advanced UAV I know a lot of

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.550 
away the advanced UAV I know a lot of
guys<00:05:37.210> were<00:05:37.360> excited<00:05:37.420> about<00:05:37.840> that<00:05:38.080> hoping<00:05:38.470> it

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
guys were excited about that hoping it

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.350 
guys were excited about that hoping it
was<00:05:38.650> accountant<00:05:39.010> to<00:05:39.070> assassin<00:05:39.580> I<00:05:39.700> don't<00:05:40.060> think

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
was accountant to assassin I don't think

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.690 
was accountant to assassin I don't think
it<00:05:40.480> does<00:05:40.660> count<00:05:40.930> or<00:05:41.110> assessing<00:05:41.500> it<00:05:41.890> its<00:05:42.370> a<00:05:42.520> mix

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
it does count or assessing it its a mix

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.730 
it does count or assessing it its a mix
between<00:05:42.880> a<00:05:43.060> black<00:05:43.300> bird<00:05:43.510> in<00:05:43.690> a<00:05:43.750> UAV<00:05:43.990> basically

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
between a black bird in a UAV basically

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.650 
between a black bird in a UAV basically
its<00:05:44.890> way<00:05:45.100> faced<00:05:45.490> it's<00:05:45.790> not<00:05:46.000> permanent<00:05:46.240> it's

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
its way faced it's not permanent it's

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.770 
its way faced it's not permanent it's
not<00:05:46.780> constant<00:05:47.290> and<00:05:47.410> it<00:05:48.400> just<00:05:48.460> it's<00:05:48.880> a<00:05:49.000> UAV<00:05:49.390> that

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
not constant and it just it's a UAV that

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.510 
not constant and it just it's a UAV that
shows<00:05:50.020> which<00:05:50.230> direction<00:05:50.680> they<00:05:50.950> are<00:05:51.070> facing

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
shows which direction they are facing

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.540 
shows which direction they are facing
its<00:05:51.780> really<00:05:52.780> it's<00:05:52.900> pathetic<00:05:53.470> compared<00:05:54.310> to<00:05:54.460> the

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
its really it's pathetic compared to the

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.010 
its really it's pathetic compared to the
Blackbird<00:05:54.910> it's<00:05:55.150> actually<00:05:55.390> a<00:05:55.420> 12<00:05:55.750> point

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
Blackbird it's actually a 12 point

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.960 
Blackbird it's actually a 12 point
streak<00:05:56.380> on<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.530> support<00:05:56.920> so<00:05:57.670> it<00:05:57.730> really

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
streak on the support so it really

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.700 
streak on the support so it really
limits<00:05:58.210> you<00:05:58.540> so<00:05:58.690> I<00:05:58.720> definitely<00:05:59.020> stick<00:05:59.470> to<00:05:59.620> the

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
limits you so I definitely stick to the

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.100 
limits you so I definitely stick to the
UAV<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.190> count<00:06:00.400> UAV<00:06:00.910> and<00:06:01.030> the<00:06:01.600> sam<00:06:01.870> car

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
UAV the count UAV and the sam car

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.380 
UAV the count UAV and the sam car
because<00:06:02.680> whereas<00:06:03.070> that<00:06:03.760> you<00:06:03.880> can<00:06:04.030> get<00:06:04.210> 12

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
because whereas that you can get 12

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.360 
because whereas that you can get 12
kills<00:06:04.840> and<00:06:05.110> have<00:06:05.230> an<00:06:05.320> advanced<00:06:05.620> UAV<00:06:05.860> or<00:06:06.250> you

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
kills and have an advanced UAV or you

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.460 
kills and have an advanced UAV or you
can<00:06:06.520> get<00:06:06.610> 12<00:06:06.790> kills<00:06:07.270> with<00:06:07.480> Joe<00:06:07.630> Sam<00:06:07.840> Taran<00:06:08.260> and

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
can get 12 kills with Joe Sam Taran and

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.780 
can get 12 kills with Joe Sam Taran and
you<00:06:08.830> can<00:06:08.980> have<00:06:09.160> another<00:06:10.030> UAV<00:06:11.190> so<00:06:12.190> AB<00:06:12.490> plus

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
you can have another UAV so AB plus

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.970 
you can have another UAV so AB plus
you're<00:06:12.940> Sam<00:06:13.090> tart<00:06:13.330> so<00:06:13.600> it's<00:06:13.840> almost<00:06:13.990> like<00:06:14.410> you

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
you're Sam tart so it's almost like you

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.180 
you're Sam tart so it's almost like you
got<00:06:15.130> to<00:06:15.220> think<00:06:15.400> of<00:06:15.550> it<00:06:15.610> like<00:06:15.670> that<00:06:15.820> whereas<00:06:16.690> I

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
got to think of it like that whereas I

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.380 
got to think of it like that whereas I
actually<00:06:18.190> weren't<00:06:18.520> going<00:06:18.820> for<00:06:18.970> the<00:06:19.060> nucleus

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
actually weren't going for the nucleus
