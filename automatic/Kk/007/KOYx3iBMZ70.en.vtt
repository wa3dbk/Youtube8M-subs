power nice little roll over here the
plan<00:01:39.039> is<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:39.520> maybe<00:01:40.030> extend<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.600> track<00:01:40.840> down

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
plan is to maybe extend the track down

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.979 
plan is to maybe extend the track down
the<00:01:41.229> right<00:01:41.350> there<00:01:41.849> about<00:01:42.849> 90<00:01:43.239> degrees<00:01:43.299> out<00:01:43.659> so

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:43.989 
the right there about 90 degrees out so

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:47.490 
the right there about 90 degrees out so
I'm<00:01:44.619> a<00:01:44.679> little<00:01:44.799> hot<00:01:45.780> maybe<00:01:46.780> even<00:01:47.049> do<00:01:47.289> something

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
I'm a little hot maybe even do something

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.880 
I'm a little hot maybe even do something
down<00:01:47.739> there<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:49.360> right<00:01:49.840> now<00:01:49.899> I<00:01:50.049> guess<00:01:50.259> this<00:01:50.739> is

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
down there but right now I guess this is

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.029 
down there but right now I guess this is
it<00:01:50.920> for<00:01:51.130> now<00:01:51.189> I<00:01:51.549> have<00:01:52.509> a<00:01:52.599> lot<00:01:52.869> of<00:01:52.899> power<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:53.770> I

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
it for now I have a lot of power so I

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:27.570 
it for now I have a lot of power so I
don't<00:01:54.819> think<00:01:54.969> I'll<00:01:55.060> need<00:01:55.090> for<00:01:55.420> stuff<00:01:56.009> but
