about settings everything has to be the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.210 
about settings everything has to be the

right height mountains have to be

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.140 
right height mountains have to be
exactly<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> same

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
exactly the same

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.359 
exactly the same
now<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.750> MDS<00:01:43.049> 9<00:01:43.350> rack<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.100> loved

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
now with the MDS 9 rack what I loved

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.560 
now with the MDS 9 rack what I loved
about<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> straight<00:01:44.880> away<00:01:45.030> when<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.270> got<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
about it straight away when I got out of

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.569 
about it straight away when I got out of
the<00:01:45.630> box<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> set<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.409> up<00:01:46.530> was<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> stability

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the box and set it up was the stability

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.460 
the box and set it up was the stability
obviously<00:01:48.450> we've<00:01:48.570> got<00:01:48.659> four<00:01:48.899> poles<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
obviously we've got four poles on the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.679 
obviously we've got four poles on the
floor<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> rack<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.030> never<00:01:51.390> really<00:01:51.600> going

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
floor so the rack is never really going

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.780 
floor so the rack is never really going
to<00:01:51.899> go<00:01:51.990> anywhere<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.799> you're<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.100> any<00:01:53.250> uneven

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
to go anywhere if you're on any uneven

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.940 
to go anywhere if you're on any uneven
stages<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.360> adjust<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.899> simply<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.920> have

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
stages we can adjust it simply we have

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.219 
stages we can adjust it simply we have
memory<00:01:56.670> locks<00:01:56.880> now<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> bars<00:01:57.750> will<00:01:58.049> never

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
memory locks now so the bars will never

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.719 
memory locks now so the bars will never
sink<00:01:58.560> never<00:01:58.890> go<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.189> when<00:01:59.430> you're<00:01:59.549> playing

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
sink never go up when you're playing

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.889 
sink never go up when you're playing
doesn't<00:02:00.030> matter<00:02:00.149> how<00:02:00.270> hard<00:02:00.540> you're<00:02:00.659> playing

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
doesn't matter how hard you're playing

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.389 
doesn't matter how hard you're playing
the<00:02:01.259> rat<00:02:01.500> will<00:02:01.619> o<00:02:01.680> stay<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.100> same<00:02:02.280> position

now<00:02:12.720> what<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.020> rack<00:02:13.260> gives

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
now what this rack gives

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.710 
now what this rack gives
we've<00:02:14.100> never<00:02:14.280> had<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.550> past<00:02:14.760> we've<00:02:15.569> got<00:02:15.690> a

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
we've never had in the past we've got a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.320 
we've never had in the past we've got a

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
left or right exactly the same with the

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.420 
left or right exactly the same with the
hi-hat<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.200> hi-hat<00:02:22.530> once<00:02:22.830> again<00:02:23.130> can<00:02:23.310> go

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
hi-hat so the hi-hat once again can go

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.720

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
key thing is cymbals when we're going

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.510 
key thing is cymbals when we're going
around<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.470> kit<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.830> playing<00:02:29.010> our<00:02:29.130> cymbals

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
around the kit and playing our cymbals

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.040 
around the kit and playing our cymbals
they<00:02:29.880> have<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.180> be<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.390> right<00:02:30.600> height<00:02:30.810> they

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
they have to be the right height they

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.199 
they have to be the right height they
have<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.319> be<00:02:31.410> exactly<00:02:31.980> how<00:02:32.640> we<00:02:32.700> want<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.030> play

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
have to be exactly how we want to play

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.449 
have to be exactly how we want to play
them<00:02:33.480> with<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.140> one<00:02:34.319> even<00:02:34.590> one-handed<00:02:35.250> just

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
them with this one even one-handed just

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.300 
them with this one even one-handed just
turning<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:36.540> can<00:02:36.690> move<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.959> around<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.530> get<00:02:38.250> it

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
turning we can move it around and get it

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.510 
turning we can move it around and get it
perfect<00:02:38.880> for<00:02:38.970> our<00:02:39.060> performance
