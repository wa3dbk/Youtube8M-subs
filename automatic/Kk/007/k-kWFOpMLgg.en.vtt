00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:04.890
 lambert traction for low back pain in kiné balnéothérapie pool 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.480
 firstly patient preparation 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.429
 a small strip of space that the others 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.679
 a strap that will allow traction on the pelvis 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.329
 the bets around the waist 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.409
 send if the physiotherapists who adjusts 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.780
 the greenhouses a little bit this band 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.240
 which allows pelvic attraction 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.810
 on the strap in Turkish scene 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.220
 are fixed 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.550
 seems that will allow traction it's 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.660
 without glory can be symmetrical 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.700
 we see here a second place cazottes 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.830
 at the thoracic level 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.640
 on this second place faso at the top we will fix a devianne five angles 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.970
 which will allow 2 fixed 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.150
 the thorax sword to somehow achieve a fixed point 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.880
 for the attraction 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.880
 Lombaerts 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.850
 must set this 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.160
 traction does not have to slide 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.390
 it is not necessary either 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.710
 too tight 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.590
 so 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.030
 there is a certain habit to have 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.790
 to tighten neither too much 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.790
 and micropole 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.060
 we will put on a lifejacket 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.909
 so that the subject is perfectly relaxed 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.280
 during the decline declined 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.770
 no effort 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.770
 to do to keep your head out of the water 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.550
 it must be completely passive 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.430
 the patient is now ready 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.910
 just attach the slings 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.910
 to achieve the attraction 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.999
 the temperature of the water 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.619
 is about 35 degrees 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.249
 here are the slings 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.609
 which will serve as a fixed point 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.139
 at the thoracic level that will cling to the chest strap 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.549
 the patient will lie down 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:46.769
 the physiotherapist 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.769
 I recover both senses the country come 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.059
 and he was staring at his two straps 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.369
 on the lagoons that will serve 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:58.689
 to traction 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.239
 the 200 me must be much later in order to achieve 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:05.449
 at the same time a traction 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.689
 and a delors of water 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.750
 what looks like the foreground of reorganizing two shoes 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.359
 it was a wall 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.869
 and relayed by two pulleys 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:23.719
 a show 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.259
 this obvious jump at the start 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.449
 and here we go siphon a little water from the pool 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.179
 who will fill 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:35.379
 the show gradually and therefore the attraction will settle 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.379
 gradually make 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.209
 except to fill 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.849
 these fauna I do it with two hoses 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.949
 usually to go faster 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.469
 until there was in 5 liters of water in the bottom ie 25 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.089
 kilos of traction here is the installation of the patient with a buoy on the 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:57.279
 under the knees 

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:01.209
 to comment on the relaxation and the two Germans there since our 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.149
 soldiers say the disapproval of the basin 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:09.039
 axial traction which is the first time that strangely resembles the first 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:12.039
 time of reharmonization of homes has already been said 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.949
 finally pulling we live in shoah the show 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.889
 the show is therefore empty so gradually 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.340
 in about ten minutes 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.300
 and it is not the patient does not even perceive the basket pulling nor 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.539
 even the relaxation he feels above all the well-being 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.120
 winger at the attraction that decreases dramatically 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.610
 the pains at the level 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.610
 back host low back pain 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:49.669
 so here is this technique of traction and looseness extremely 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:50.389
 progressive
