00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
there up to the general so you're

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.020 
there up to the general so you're
building<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.989> whereas<00:01:01.670> deductive<00:01:02.670> what

would that mean very good you just go
back<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.610> other<00:01:08.790> way<00:01:08.909> right<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
deductive study which is what almost all

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.539 
deductive study which is what almost all
of<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:12.930> preachers<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.040> using

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
of your preachers are going to be using

of your preachers are going to be using
in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.000> sermon<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.020> start<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.619> topic

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
in the sermon you start with the topic

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.999 
in the sermon you start with the topic
or<00:01:17.310> an<00:01:17.400> apophysis<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.799> find

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
or an apophysis and then you go and find

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.550 
or an apophysis and then you go and find
scripture<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.909> proves<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.810> point<00:01:22.320> that

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
scripture that proves that point that

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.120 
scripture that proves that point that
topic<00:01:23.040> or<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.310> hypotheses<00:01:24.030> what<00:01:24.630> would<00:01:24.840> be

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
topic or that hypotheses what would be

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.670 
topic or that hypotheses what would be
the<00:01:26.130> danger<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.479> kind<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.960> studying<00:01:28.320> if

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the danger of that kind of studying if

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.969 
the danger of that kind of studying if
that<00:01:28.920> are<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.280> kind<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.990> writing<00:01:30.990> lesson<00:01:31.890> if

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that are that kind of writing lesson if

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.920 
that are that kind of writing lesson if
that's<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.430> did<00:01:32.640> what<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:36.210> could<00:01:36.420> make

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
that's all you did what you could make

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.469 
that's all you did what you could make
it<00:01:37.530> completely<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> context<00:01:39.150> okay<00:01:39.299> what

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
it completely out of context okay what

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.319 
it completely out of context okay what
yeah<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.899> point<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.759> use<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
yeah but the point is I can use the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.410 
yeah but the point is I can use the
Bible<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.869> prove<00:01:46.079> any<00:01:46.740> point<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.579> want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.180> prove

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
Bible to prove any point I want to prove

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.649 
Bible to prove any point I want to prove
and<00:01:49.130> proof<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.939> listen<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.450> some

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and proof of that is just listen to some

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.539 
and proof of that is just listen to some
of<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:54.320> not<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.560> ethical<00:01:56.040> people<00:01:56.219> that

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
of the the not so ethical people that

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.450 
of the the not so ethical people that
might<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.030> program<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.659> TV<00:01:57.840> are<00:01:58.530> something

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
might have a program on TV are something

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
might have a program on TV are something
or<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> street<00:02:00.210> preacher<00:02:00.450> or<00:02:00.840> whatever<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.409> can

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
or a street preacher or whatever you can

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.289 
or a street preacher or whatever you can
hear<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:01.890> kinds<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.430> things<00:02:02.490> can't<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
hear all kinds of things can't you

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.389 
hear all kinds of things can't you
because<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:03.960> start<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.680> hypotheses

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
because they start with on hypotheses

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.429 
because they start with on hypotheses
and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.509> find<00:02:06.689> scripture<00:02:07.259> to

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
and then just go and find scripture to

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.369 
and then just go and find scripture to
support<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:09.330> ends<00:02:09.629> up<00:02:09.750> being<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.229> of

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
support it and that ends up being out of

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.619 
support it and that ends up being out of
context<00:02:10.920> when<00:02:11.039> they<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.610> way<00:02:11.790> now<00:02:12.330> I'm

developing a sermon like that because
hopefully<00:02:19.769> he<00:02:20.400> has<00:02:20.640> used<00:02:20.939> an<00:02:21.120> inductive

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
hopefully he has used an inductive

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.610 
hopefully he has used an inductive
process<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.549> hypotheses<00:02:24.209> and

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
process to get to that hypotheses and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.979 
process to get to that hypotheses and
then<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.860> use<00:02:26.129> deductive<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:27.450> preach<00:02:27.689> it<00:02:27.870> to

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
then you use deductive to preach it to

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.600 
then you use deductive to preach it to
the<00:02:28.110> congregation<00:02:28.319> does<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.040> make<00:02:29.189> sense<00:02:29.220> to

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
the congregation does that make sense to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.479 
the congregation does that make sense to
you<00:02:29.720> okay<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.590> we've<00:02:31.769> got<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.189> have<00:02:32.370> that

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
you okay but we've got to have that

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.059 
you okay but we've got to have that
inductive<00:02:33.030> study<00:02:33.299> in<00:02:33.510> there<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:34.439> that<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:34.769> know

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
inductive study in there so that we know

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.679 
inductive study in there so that we know
that<00:02:35.579> we're<00:02:35.730> coming<00:02:35.939> to<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.329> right
