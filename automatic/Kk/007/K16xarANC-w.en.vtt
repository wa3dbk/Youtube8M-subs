00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
right here with a cutting wheel and I'm

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.830 
right here with a cutting wheel and I'm
going<00:00:43.300> to<00:00:43.450> put<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:43.989> compression<00:00:44.950> fitting<00:00:45.840> lying

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
going to put a compression fitting lying

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.860 
going to put a compression fitting lying
on<00:00:47.110> there<00:00:47.379> from<00:00:49.530> from<00:00:50.530> Lowe's<00:00:51.510> stick<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.660> on

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
on there from from Lowe's stick that on

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.090 
on there from from Lowe's stick that on
top<00:00:53.260> of<00:00:53.500> that<00:00:53.650> and<00:00:54.040> then<00:00:54.670> I<00:00:54.700> bought<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.030> new<00:00:55.300> line

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
top of that and then I bought a new line

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.840 
top of that and then I bought a new line
for<00:00:57.100> here<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:58.180> connect<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:59.170> this<00:00:59.320> end<00:00:59.590> it's<00:01:00.579> a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
for here to connect to this end it's a

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.139 
for here to connect to this end it's a
standard<00:01:01.450> line<00:01:02.410> and<00:01:02.800> needed<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.790> be<00:01:03.910> long

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
standard line and needed to be long

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.639 
standard line and needed to be long
enough<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.420> go<00:01:04.540> all<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.899> way<00:01:05.019> up<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.350> see

we've<00:01:06.369> got<00:01:06.520> some<00:01:06.579> major<00:01:07.420> issues<00:01:07.960> with<00:01:08.170> this

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
we've got some major issues with this

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.639 
we've got some major issues with this
but<00:01:08.970> when<00:01:09.970> it's<00:01:10.119> done<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.750> should<00:01:10.990> work<00:01:11.200> and

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
but when it's done it should work and

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.230 
but when it's done it should work and
I'll<00:01:11.860> show<00:01:12.189> it<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.430> you<00:01:12.520> all<00:01:12.729> right<00:01:12.909> talk<00:01:13.210> to

I'll show it to you all right talk to
you<00:01:13.390> in<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.570> bit<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.540> here's<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:17.200> finished

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
you in a bit so here's the finished

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.850 
you in a bit so here's the finished
finished<00:01:18.340> product<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.440> wasn't<00:01:20.440> sure<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.620> was

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
finished product I wasn't sure I was

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.320 
finished product I wasn't sure I was
doing<00:01:21.040> it<00:01:21.310> right<00:01:21.520> it's<00:01:21.760> a<00:01:21.880> compression

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
doing it right it's a compression

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.800 
doing it right it's a compression
fitting<00:01:23.280> after<00:01:24.280> calling<00:01:24.700> my<00:01:24.850> stepfather<00:01:25.390> to

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
fitting after calling my stepfather to

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.880 
fitting after calling my stepfather to
make<00:01:26.380> sure<00:01:26.650> that<00:01:26.979> I<00:01:27.010> did<00:01:27.310> do<00:01:27.520> this<00:01:27.700> right<00:01:28.890> it's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
make sure that I did do this right it's

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.660 
make sure that I did do this right it's
not<00:01:30.070> leaking<00:01:30.370> as<00:01:30.820> you<00:01:30.970> can<00:01:31.150> see<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:33.400> the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
not leaking as you can see what the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.609 
not leaking as you can see what the
compression<00:01:34.299> fitting<00:01:34.540> does<00:01:34.930> I'm<00:01:35.380> going<00:01:35.530> to

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
compression fitting does I'm going to

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.890 
compression fitting does I'm going to
shut<00:01:36.250> this<00:01:36.400> off<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:37.000> show<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.270> again<00:01:37.630> real

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
shut this off and show you again real

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.580 
shut this off and show you again real
quick<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.770> compression<00:01:39.430> fitting<00:01:39.729> on<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
quick the compression fitting on the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.350 
quick the compression fitting on the
other<00:01:42.070> side<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.490> part<00:01:42.700> that<00:01:42.880> goes<00:01:43.030> this

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
other side of the part that goes this

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.060 
other side of the part that goes this
goes<00:01:43.570> over<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.439> actually<00:01:45.130> put<00:01:45.580> this<00:01:46.030> part<00:01:47.070> over

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
goes over I actually put this part over

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.600 
goes over I actually put this part over
the<00:01:48.580> copper<00:01:49.299> pipe<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:50.100> then<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.189> put<00:01:51.369> this

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
the copper pipe and then you put this

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.789 
the copper pipe and then you put this
over<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.450> copper<00:01:52.659> pipe<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.229> it's<00:01:53.650> going<00:01:53.740> to

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
over the copper pipe and it's going to

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.070 
over the copper pipe and it's going to
be<00:01:53.950> loose<00:01:54.189> you're<00:01:54.670> gonna<00:01:54.760> be<00:01:54.909> able<00:01:55.000> to<00:01:55.150> there's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
be loose you're gonna be able to there's

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.480 
be loose you're gonna be able to there's
gonna<00:01:56.200> be<00:01:56.380> some<00:01:56.590> play<00:01:56.799> in<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.070> you'll<00:01:57.250> be<00:01:57.400> able

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
gonna be some play in it you'll be able

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.120 
gonna be some play in it you'll be able
to<00:01:57.640> go<00:01:57.790> but<00:01:58.630> what<00:01:58.869> happens<00:01:59.259> is<00:01:59.409> as<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.740> tighten

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
to go but what happens is as you tighten

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.520 
to go but what happens is as you tighten
it<00:02:00.189> on<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.729> that<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.770> valve<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:04.530> compresses

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
it on to that that valve it compresses

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.880 
it on to that that valve it compresses
this<00:02:06.040> metal<00:02:06.610> piece<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.530> stops<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.709> water

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
this metal piece and stops the water

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.800 
this metal piece and stops the water
from<00:02:09.009> leaking<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.849> gets<00:02:10.000> real<00:02:10.209> tight<00:02:10.509> and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
from leaking and it gets real tight and

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.000 
from leaking and it gets real tight and
on<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.920> copper<00:02:12.280> tubing<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:13.030> then<00:02:13.890> you're<00:02:14.890> all

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
on the copper tubing and then you're all

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.210 
on the copper tubing and then you're all
set<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.579> that's<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.390> oh<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.829> other<00:02:17.860> thing

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
set and that's it oh and the other thing

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.970 
set and that's it oh and the other thing
that<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.430> did<00:02:18.640> do<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.120> used<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.569> metal<00:02:20.170> file<00:02:20.680> to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
that I did do is I used a metal file to

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.300 
that I did do is I used a metal file to
just<00:02:21.220> file<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:22.110> edges<00:02:23.110> around<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.920> end<00:02:24.130> of

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
just file the edges around the end of

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.680 
just file the edges around the end of
the<00:02:24.520> copper<00:02:25.390> pipe<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.709> hope<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.190> helps

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
the copper pipe so I hope this helps

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.530 
the copper pipe so I hope this helps
talk<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.410> later
