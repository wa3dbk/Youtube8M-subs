if I come back over to the browser over

if I come back over to the browser over
here<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.479> hit<00:01:45.630> refresh<00:01:46.020> would<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.130> look<00:01:47.280> at

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
here and I hit refresh would you look at

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.990 
here and I hit refresh would you look at
that<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.270> an<00:01:48.750> inline<00:01:49.350> form<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.640> email

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that we have an inline form so email

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.910 
that we have an inline form so email
address<00:01:51.299> password<00:01:51.570> everything's<00:01:52.350> all<00:01:52.590> next

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
address password everything's all next

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.940 
address password everything's all next
to<00:01:53.070> each<00:01:53.159> other<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:54.659> guess<00:01:54.930> ideally<00:01:55.500> this

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
to each other and I guess ideally this

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.459 
to each other and I guess ideally this
would<00:01:56.159> not<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.790> file<00:01:57.180> upload<00:01:57.479> button<00:01:58.110> if

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
would not be a file upload button if

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.959 
would not be a file upload button if
this<00:01:58.740> was<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.280> login<00:01:59.729> form

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
this was going to be like a login form

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
this was going to be like a login form
where<00:02:00.180> we<00:02:00.210> needed<00:02:00.450> an<00:02:00.750> email<00:02:01.200> address<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.590> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
where we needed an email address and a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.340 
where we needed an email address and a
password<00:02:01.880> what<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.060> might<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.420> over<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.170> is

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
password what we might have over here is

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.479 
password what we might have over here is

yeah<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.080> how<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.259> set<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.739> form<00:02:10.950> up

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
yeah this is just how I set the form up

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.450 
yeah this is just how I set the form up
I<00:02:11.310> know<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.790> not

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
I know it's not

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.940 
I know it's not

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
though having a file upload here kind of

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.320 
though having a file upload here kind of
means<00:02:16.190> nothing<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:16.700> if<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.850> guys<00:02:16.970> ever<00:02:17.210> want

to change that obviously I'm sure you
can<00:02:19.580> do<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:20.290> okay<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.850> is<00:02:23.150> our<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.810> line

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
can do that okay so that is our in line

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.100 
can do that okay so that is our in line
form<00:02:24.410> done<00:02:24.710> now<00:02:25.340> let's<00:02:25.670> show<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.180> how<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.810> make

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
form done now let's show you how to make

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.710 
form done now let's show you how to make
a<00:02:27.320> horizontal<00:02:27.920> form<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.450> going<00:02:29.660> to

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
a horizontal form and this is going to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.270 
a horizontal form and this is going to
be<00:02:29.840> slightly<00:02:30.140> more<00:02:30.440> complicated<00:02:30.860> because

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
be slightly more complicated because

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.340 
be slightly more complicated because
we're<00:02:31.490> going<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.700> have<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:32.000> change<00:02:32.360> up<00:02:32.600> some<00:02:33.140> of

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
we're going to have to change up some of

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.280 
we're going to have to change up some of
the<00:02:33.500> code<00:02:33.740> over<00:02:33.950> here<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.490> give<00:02:34.760> some<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.000> this

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
the code over here and give some of this

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.730 
the code over here and give some of this
some<00:02:36.290> extra<00:02:36.590> classes<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:39.200> first<00:02:39.410> thing<00:02:39.620> I

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
some extra classes so the first thing I

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.810 
some extra classes so the first thing I
want<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:39.920> do<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.220> I'm<00:02:40.310> just<00:02:40.340> going<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.610> change

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
want to do is I'm just going to change

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.990 
want to do is I'm just going to change
this<00:02:41.120> heading<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:44.050> horizontal<00:02:45.490> form<00:02:46.490> I'm<00:02:46.760> also

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
this heading to horizontal form I'm also

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.060 
this heading to horizontal form I'm also
going<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.240> change<00:02:47.480> my<00:02:47.870> forms<00:02:48.380> class<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:50.180> read

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
going to change my forms class to read

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.780 
going to change my forms class to read
form<00:02:52.070> horizontal<00:02:53.000> instead<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.570> form<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.050> line

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
form horizontal instead of form in line

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.280 
form horizontal instead of form in line
because<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.270> a<00:02:56.300> class<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.959> we're<00:02:57.140> going

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
because that is a class that we're going

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.390 
because that is a class that we're going
to<00:02:57.500> need<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:58.130> create<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.459> horizontal<00:02:59.060> form<00:02:59.330> and

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
to need to create a horizontal form and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.010 
to need to create a horizontal form and
the<00:03:01.400> next<00:03:01.730> thing<00:03:01.880> we've<00:03:02.000> got<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.270> do<00:03:02.390> is<00:03:02.660> go

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
the next thing we've got to do is go

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.290 
the next thing we've got to do is go
over<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.440> each<00:03:03.800> one<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.220> our<00:03:04.310> labels<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.150> we're

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
over to each one of our labels and we're

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.630 
over to each one of our labels and we're
going<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.450> have<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.780> add<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:06.170> class<00:03:06.470> as<00:03:06.770> well<00:03:06.920> so

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
going to have to add a class as well so

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.280 
going to have to add a class as well so
I'm<00:03:07.700> going<00:03:07.850> to<00:03:07.880> go<00:03:08.030> ahead<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.450> add<00:03:08.600> in<00:03:09.080> this

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
I'm going to go ahead and add in this

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.400 
I'm going to go ahead and add in this
class<00:03:09.620> attribute<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.870> first<00:03:12.080> thing<00:03:12.320> I

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
class attribute and the first thing I

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.600 
class attribute and the first thing I
want<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.590> do<00:03:12.770> is<00:03:13.010> add<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.310> column<00:03:13.790> size<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.540> Col

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
want to do is add a column size of Col

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.120 
want to do is add a column size of Col
sm2<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:17.330> that<00:03:17.480> means<00:03:17.750> that<00:03:18.200> on<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.440> small<00:03:18.830> device

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
sm2 so that means that on a small device

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.280 
sm2 so that means that on a small device
or<00:03:19.459> anything<00:03:19.730> bigger<00:03:20.239> than<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.690> small<00:03:20.840> device

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
or anything bigger than a small device

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.970 
or anything bigger than a small device
this<00:03:22.040> column<00:03:22.580> or<00:03:23.269> this<00:03:23.530> label<00:03:24.530> is<00:03:24.709> going<00:03:24.860> to

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
this column or this label is going to

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.660 
this column or this label is going to
take<00:03:25.160> up<00:03:25.340> two<00:03:25.549> columns<00:03:26.230> okay<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:28.400> we're<00:03:28.549> also

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
take up two columns okay and we're also

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.100 
take up two columns okay and we're also
going<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:28.910> give<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.390> class<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:30.500> control<00:03:31.130> -

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
going to give it a class of control -

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.729 
going to give it a class of control -
label<00:03:33.110> so<00:03:34.100> that<00:03:34.459> is<00:03:34.700> our<00:03:35.090> class<00:03:35.420> setup<00:03:36.110> for<00:03:36.350> the

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
label so that is our class setup for the

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.740 
label so that is our class setup for the
label<00:03:37.190> I<00:03:37.370> can<00:03:37.519> go<00:03:37.640> ahead<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:37.850> copy<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.299> and

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
label I can go ahead and copy that and

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.780 
label I can go ahead and copy that and
paste<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.530> on<00:03:40.120> every<00:03:41.120> one<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.660> these<00:03:42.320> labels<00:03:45.790> ok

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
paste it on every one of these labels ok

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.100 
paste it on every one of these labels ok
the<00:03:46.910> submit<00:03:47.269> button<00:03:47.299> doesn't<00:03:47.810> have<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.930> label

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
the submit button doesn't have a label

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.490 
the submit button doesn't have a label
and<00:03:49.010> then<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.000> next<00:03:50.330> thing<00:03:50.450> we<00:03:50.600> can<00:03:50.750> do<00:03:50.959> is<00:03:51.260> go

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
and then the next thing we can do is go

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.759 
and then the next thing we can do is go
over<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:52.130> each<00:03:52.400> one<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:52.970> these<00:03:53.690> input<00:03:54.320> elements

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
over to each one of these input elements

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.259 
over to each one of these input elements
and<00:03:54.950> we're<00:03:55.519> actually<00:03:55.670> going<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:55.940> have<00:03:56.030> to

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
and we're actually going to have to

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.020 
and we're actually going to have to
surround<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:57.049> in<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.320> div<00:03:57.790> so<00:03:58.790> I'm<00:03:58.850> going<00:03:59.000> to

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
surround that in a div so I'm going to

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.410 
surround that in a div so I'm going to
create<00:03:59.330> all<00:03:59.480> my<00:03:59.510> spacing<00:03:59.989> and<00:04:01.120> I'm<00:04:02.120> going<00:04:02.360> to

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
create all my spacing and I'm going to

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.170 
create all my spacing and I'm going to
create<00:04:02.870> my<00:04:02.959> div<00:04:03.380> now<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:04.430> I'm<00:04:04.820> going<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.030> give

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
create my div now and I'm going to give

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.840 
create my div now and I'm going to give
this<00:04:05.450> div<00:04:05.780> a<00:04:05.989> class<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:07.070> Col<00:04:08.440> SM<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.850> remember

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
this div a class of Col SM and remember

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.500 
this div a class of Col SM and remember
bootstrap<00:04:11.360> has<00:04:11.390> 12<00:04:12.350> columns<00:04:12.920> so<00:04:13.640> if<00:04:13.940> our<00:04:14.060> label
