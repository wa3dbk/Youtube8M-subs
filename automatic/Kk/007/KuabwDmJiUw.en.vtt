00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
I should be faster obviously because I'm

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.999 
I should be faster obviously because I'm
running<00:04:47.449> choice<00:04:47.750> scarf<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.289> that<00:04:48.680> all<00:04:48.860> it

works out perfectly so after that he

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.550 
works out perfectly so after that he
ends<00:04:52.009> a<00:04:52.070> brand<00:04:52.310> in<00:04:52.400> his<00:04:52.580> mind<00:04:52.820> shell<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.560> mine

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
ends a brand in his mind shell and mine

know get rid of something here I go into
my<00:05:00.139> infinite<00:05:00.800> first<00:05:01.099> actually<00:05:01.550> just<00:05:01.729> because

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
my infinite first actually just because

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.310 
my infinite first actually just because
I<00:05:01.970> know<00:05:02.030> he's<00:05:02.210> gonna<00:05:02.330> go<00:05:02.479> for<00:05:02.599> a<00:05:02.660> fake-out<00:05:03.020> and

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
I know he's gonna go for a fake-out and

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.350 
I know he's gonna go for a fake-out and
then<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:03.889> felt<00:05:04.370> like<00:05:04.550> okay<00:05:04.910> well<00:05:05.120> he's<00:05:05.300> just

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
then I felt like okay well he's just

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.879 
then I felt like okay well he's just
gonna<00:05:05.599> go<00:05:05.720> for<00:05:05.900> fake-out<00:05:06.289> then<00:05:06.740> there's

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
gonna go for fake-out then there's

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.680 
gonna go for fake-out then there's
really<00:05:07.099> not<00:05:07.370> much<00:05:07.580> to<00:05:07.849> risk<00:05:08.000> here<00:05:08.270> because<00:05:08.389> my

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
really not much to risk here because my

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.629 
really not much to risk here because my
hitter<00:05:08.870> Nate<00:05:09.080> will<00:05:09.259> help<00:05:09.500> speed<00:05:09.830> this<00:05:09.979> guy<00:05:10.190> and

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
hitter Nate will help speed this guy and

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.249 
hitter Nate will help speed this guy and
I<00:05:10.820> guess<00:05:11.030> here's<00:05:11.270> assuming<00:05:11.720> that<00:05:11.840> you<00:05:12.110> know<00:05:12.229> I

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
I guess here's assuming that you know I

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.020 
I guess here's assuming that you know I
just<00:05:12.380> go<00:05:12.710> like<00:05:12.889> run<00:05:13.039> him<00:05:13.160> he<00:05:13.310> Dyer<00:05:13.520> still<00:05:13.910> like

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
just go like run him he Dyer still like

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.249 
just go like run him he Dyer still like
that<00:05:14.090> but<00:05:14.330> I<00:05:14.360> need<00:05:14.449> to<00:05:14.599> keep<00:05:14.720> rotating<00:05:14.900> around

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
that but I need to keep rotating around

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.350 
that but I need to keep rotating around
for<00:05:15.800> later<00:05:15.979> because<00:05:16.160> he<00:05:16.430> has<00:05:16.520> two<00:05:16.789> things<00:05:17.090> that

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
for later because he has two things that

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.510 
for later because he has two things that
I<00:05:17.509> can<00:05:18.289> only<00:05:18.470> help<00:05:18.650> speed<00:05:18.979> with<00:05:19.099> Rotom<00:05:19.370> heat

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
I can only help speed with Rotom heat

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.890 
I can only help speed with Rotom heat
which<00:05:19.639> is<00:05:19.759> gonna<00:05:19.910> be<00:05:20.030> swellow<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:20.449> greninja

easily<00:05:43.070> knocking<00:05:43.639> out<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:43.880> swellow<00:05:44.389> just

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
easily knocking out the swellow just

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.750 
easily knocking out the swellow just
depends<00:05:45.320> on<00:05:45.409> whether<00:05:45.710> our<00:05:46.010> out<00:05:46.310> speed<00:05:46.610> or<00:05:46.729> not

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
depends on whether our out speed or not

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.029 
depends on whether our out speed or not
because<00:05:47.150> honestly<00:05:47.720> i<00:05:48.020> didn't<00:05:48.409> even<00:05:48.500> know<00:05:48.770> what

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
because honestly i didn't even know what

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.439 
because honestly i didn't even know what
the<00:05:49.159> actual<00:05:49.520> speed<00:05:49.760> of<00:05:49.849> this<00:05:50.000> thing<00:05:50.150> was<00:05:50.330> I

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
the actual speed of this thing was I

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:51.570 
the actual speed of this thing was I
didn't<00:05:50.630> know<00:05:50.659> if<00:05:50.780> he<00:05:50.870> had<00:05:50.900> out<00:05:51.080> speed

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
didn't know if he had out speed

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.270 
didn't know if he had out speed
thankfully<00:05:52.580> he<00:05:52.729> did<00:05:53.199> so<00:05:54.199> that<00:05:54.680> you<00:05:54.860> know<00:05:55.009> was

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
thankfully he did so that you know was

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.339 
thankfully he did so that you know was
big<00:05:55.699> lifesaver<00:05:56.210> right<00:05:56.419> there<00:05:56.599> because<00:05:56.960> I<00:05:57.139> was

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
big lifesaver right there because I was

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:58.810 
big lifesaver right there because I was
able<00:05:57.409> to<00:05:57.530> go<00:05:57.620> for<00:05:57.800> an<00:05:57.860> overheat<00:05:58.250> being<00:05:58.460> able<00:05:58.669> to

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
able to go for an overheat being able to

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.330 
able to go for an overheat being able to
knock<00:05:59.000> out<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.389> swellow<00:06:00.229> and<00:06:00.380> now<00:06:00.770> he<00:06:00.830> ends<00:06:01.280> up

knock out the swellow and now he ends up
bringing<00:06:01.610> in<00:06:01.789> his<00:06:02.000> greninja<00:06:02.419> I'm<00:06:02.750> just<00:06:02.990> gonna

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
for that so that way my infinite could

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.839 
for that so that way my infinite could
just<00:06:11.240> easily<00:06:11.479> come<00:06:12.020> in<00:06:12.259> go<00:06:12.889> for<00:06:12.919> a<00:06:13.220> simple<00:06:13.460> mach

greninja and I'm able to win the battle
and<00:06:21.830> that's<00:06:22.220> basically<00:06:22.880> how<00:06:23.300> I<00:06:23.720> thought<00:06:24.169> of

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
and that's basically how I thought of

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:26.050 
and that's basically how I thought of
everything<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:25.070> last<00:06:25.220> three<00:06:25.610> minutes<00:06:25.940> the

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
everything the last three minutes the

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.999 
everything the last three minutes the
first<00:06:26.210> three<00:06:26.539> minutes<00:06:26.720> I<00:06:27.050> had<00:06:27.169> no<00:06:27.470> idea<00:06:27.770> you

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009 
first three minutes I had no idea you

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:30.610 
first three minutes I had no idea you
know<00:06:28.159> like<00:06:28.430> I<00:06:28.669> knew<00:06:29.659> what<00:06:29.780> I<00:06:29.870> was<00:06:30.020> doing<00:06:30.380> but<00:06:30.560> I

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
know like I knew what I was doing but I

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.440 
know like I knew what I was doing but I
don't<00:06:30.889> think<00:06:31.400> I<00:06:31.430> was<00:06:31.520> making<00:06:31.760> this<00:06:32.060> serve<00:06:32.270> the

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
don't think I was making this serve the

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.879 
don't think I was making this serve the
great<00:06:32.690> plays<00:06:32.960> now<00:06:33.260> I<00:06:33.500> didn't<00:06:33.800> necessarily

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
great plays now I didn't necessarily

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.270 
great plays now I didn't necessarily
have<00:06:34.190> the<00:06:34.340> best<00:06:34.430> Pokemon<00:06:35.210> because<00:06:35.450> as<00:06:35.840> a<00:06:35.870> mano

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
have the best Pokemon because as a mano

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.020 
have the best Pokemon because as a mano
fire<00:06:36.430> but<00:06:37.710> I<00:06:38.710> felt<00:06:39.430> like<00:06:39.550> I<00:06:39.670> could<00:06:39.820> have<00:06:39.880> made

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
fire but I felt like I could have made

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.700 
fire but I felt like I could have made
some<00:06:40.210> different<00:06:40.540> place<00:06:40.660> here<00:06:40.900> and<00:06:41.020> there<00:06:41.170> but

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
some different place here and there but

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.740 
some different place here and there but
in<00:06:42.010> the<00:06:42.160> very<00:06:42.370> last<00:06:42.639> three<00:06:43.030> minutes<00:06:43.420> I<00:06:43.540> knew

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
in the very last three minutes I knew

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.530 
in the very last three minutes I knew
exactly<00:06:43.900> what<00:06:44.530> my<00:06:44.680> opponent<00:06:45.070> was<00:06:45.130> to<00:06:45.280> do<00:06:45.540> and

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
exactly what my opponent was to do and

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.180 
exactly what my opponent was to do and
I'll<00:06:46.630> plate<00:06:46.990> it<00:06:47.020> up<00:06:47.169> perfectly<00:06:47.620> so<00:06:47.740> that<00:06:47.889> way
