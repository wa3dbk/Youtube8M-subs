00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:13.760
 I'm bigger and I just 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:15.290

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.550
 something like that or you know we want 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.920

 true, what is it when you are smaller 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.290
 Actually, nothing is as mountain 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.610
 I always wished for one 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.540
 small piece to be bigger that 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.680
 I already wished I know 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.410
 still very small bit bigger thing 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.700
 want to show the sign I know 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.700

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.340

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.810

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.730

 Do not hesitate to ask more about apple 12 das 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.540

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.160
 Maria's mother 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.870

 Cake fork in one hand and in the 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.470
 others a napkin with something 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.960
 chocolate on it gentleman yes and does not stand 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.240
 right here in front of you a plate 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.100
 crumble full of brownie 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:15.140
 is yes yes that can be 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.740
 the schools have you got the cake 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.250
 eaten 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.590
 you were how could you do that 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.750
 Just say it I can say that because I am 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.580
 the fork the plate and these values 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.030
 have seen what other explanations 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.740
 it should be otherwise let you know 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.600
 I think about what you know 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.950
 it could be it could be 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.830
 Now it could be that I am here like this 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:42.950
 sat and are so in front of me here and there 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:45.140
 suddenly roared and terribly 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.180
 yes and then it has eaten in cake 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.310
 but the monster likes to eat cake 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.960
 So good but what about the fork with 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.880
 The plate under napkin explains that 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.220
 I lack the same one yes can be 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.510
 just before it has cake ask it 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.850
 held him over the plate and 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.050
 be crumbled but then it has 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.850
 with the napkin the maul 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.890
 wiped off and the napkins left goes 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.210
 so and then name is the fork meaning 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.760
 she held me in the hand and went again 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.360
 But at least that's how it was 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.670
 been like that 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.920
 Of course, your story is not 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.520
 a little too farfetched but something too 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.650
 far 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.450
 Well I have to admit a bit 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.660
 unusual for a monster 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.250
 but it could could have been so so 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.560
 could have been so 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.310
 could be so sure 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.770
 but of course it could have been that way 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.130
 can it have not been so 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.130
 could 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:47.230
 euro cake hey what should that make green 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.760
 Green crumbs taste so good tasted 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:54.870
 well but that's not the must 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.870
 not be true 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:09.450
 Many Thanks 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:12.760
 and here a fork my goodbye 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:15.280
