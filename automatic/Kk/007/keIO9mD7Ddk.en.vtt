00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.060
 Blackjack is one of the most played casino games. 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.460
 But it's also one of the riskiest of your chips if you do not know how to play it properly. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.480
 When you have finished this video, 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.250
 are you familiar with all the rules of blackjack and you are ready for our next videos, 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.010
 which will bring you closer to the basic blackjack strategies. 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.820
 But before we go into strategies, let's take a look at the blackjack rules. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.660
 The goal in blackjack is to defeat the dealer. 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.820
 As a player you win if your card hand is higher than the dealer's, without you 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.920
 while over-buying. You also win if the dealer overbills. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.350
 Over-buy means when your card hand in the sum exceeds the value 21. 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.430
 If you pass 21, you lose automatically, no matter if the dealer is 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.540
 still overbought. Next you have to learn the card values. 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.760
 Cards 2 through 9 count the displayed value. 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.930
 10, Jack, Queen and King are equal to 10. 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.430
 Ase counts 1 or 11. So if you have a 5 and an ace, that is 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.090
 Value of your cards either 6 or 16. The strongest hand is an ace with a card, 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.780
 which corresponds to the value 10. This is called blackjack. 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.860
 If you have a blackjack as a player, you automatically win. Except the dealer 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.890
 scores a blackjack as well. Then the game ends in a draw. 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.740
 Now let's take a look at how blackjack is actually played. 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.850
 Each round begins by playing two cards face up for each player. 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.590
 Only the last card of the dealer is not visible. 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.400
 As a player, it's your first turn and four options. Card, hold, double 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.549
 or parts. Blackjack runs between you and the dealer 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.430
 all about hand signals. If you want a card, knock 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.500
 just in front of you on the table. You can draw as many cards as you like until you finish 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.620
 want to keep or overbought you. 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.800
 Just wink over the card table if 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.350
 you hold and do not want to have any more cards. If you have a good card hand, 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.600
 you can double. Doubling means that you put in the beginning 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.440
 Post again. Then you get one more card. 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.240
 To double, place your bet next to your first bet. 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.620
 If your two cards are a pair, you have the choice of dividing it into two separate card hands, 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.150
 which are played independently of each other. Simply place the identical one 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.990
 Use outside the table marking. The dealer will then share your couple. 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.700
 You now play two card hands at the same time. 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.320
 If the dealer's first card is an ace, 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.760
 You can take out insurance against a blackjack. Everything you need to know here 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.319
 is that it's not worth it in most cases. When all players finish building the cards 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.090
 are, the dealer turns his face down card. Who owns the biggest card hand now, 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.670
 without going over 21 - win. A blackjack always wins automatically, 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.260
 except against another blackjack. The payout is always 1: 1 in the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.360
 Relationship to use. Unless you win with a blackjack where the payout is 1.5: 1. 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.900
