00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.029
 now let's work normal 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.280
 four rapids 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.169
 on the south plateau 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.169
 high point of the goal 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.509
 points about people 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.199
 for 30 centimeters 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.429
 this Tuesday it is very big that dragged without hesitation a person well 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:23.789
 smaller 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.079
 then you will work according to the person's back 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.079
 this piece here because I'm doing has 50 centimeters 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.670
 but you can do 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.390
 after you have to work the 30 centimeters of the beacon Leyriense the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.960
 decreases 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.870
 in the same way four chains class 2010 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.870
 a high point than the following 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.830
 a loop current and 2010 on the next high point of the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.260
 a high point of the teacher to finish 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.370
 talk about the next point 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.350
 a high point of the 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.909
 the centenary is 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.930
 blaise goal and pass inside everyone 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.660
 a placid current the same continue to work normally on 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.660
 the following points 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.600
 I got nobody in the party 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.350
 high points of the other finals 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.980
 Let's work if 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.980
 decrease at the end of the course 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.580
 high point of the 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.040
 without ending 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.210
 sooner sometimes I will go to the next 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.210
 a high point of the hotel without finishing 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.790
 lorensetti all together a chain 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.479
 I make the last two points 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.479
 normal 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 Similarly 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.209
 think of common trenches 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.619
 his reserve 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.619
 after working the decrease of the second career 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.399
 four chain links twice a high point of the program 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:31.539
 a March chain twice over the two points that are closed 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:32.689
 together 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.099
 with a high point on the other unfinished 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.200
 I do twice get caught. 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.709
 the next point 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.249
 twice also notice that they are more woman without finalizing felt the 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.209
 floor 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.280
 a chain and continued to work normally 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:56.359
 you will do it as five races as we did the raises 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.769
 five careers just work the same 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.769
 the number of careers straight for another way 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.699
 early morning 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.909
 worked 50cm we started the increase for the back 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:18.179
 watch closely 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:21.029
 closed the work was abc 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.730
 the posture of mendes 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.579
 up until 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.359
 the career where we started 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.320
 the old career of the cinemark network we can start 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.659
 I'm going to work with someone. 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.799
 I took my piece for a version 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.339
 I held the line 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:42.369
 I make three currents within the first point taking the two 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:44.979
 understand how a box point 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.449
 will have slipped again 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.309
 and I'm going to the next month 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:53.489
 this point is great for posture and does not appear 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.279
 and working this way 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:00.279
 notes 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:04.040
 I do not know that the posture we are going to pass now goes right and works 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:05.759
 group 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.519
 I have my piece on the right side 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.879
 and we have the stitching I will introduce the glory in a corner 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.319
 and I'll get some 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.370
 let's work now 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.430
 on the Corinthian side the first space 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.419
 a low 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.219
 it's easier another low 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:33.119
 picking up score in this case where one point higher than the other 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:36.719
 the low it will be quiet 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:41.809
 cut the career below our work 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:46.279
 who finally made the last contact of the shortage 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.180
 I loved the first chain 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:51.979
 this week 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.509
 throughout the education network 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.349
 a rising current 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.349
 I do not work 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:03.680
 a total of 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.509
 three careers 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.509
 brazil with the nation 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.590
 no need to make decreases 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.640
 the low one is already in charge of this process 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.759
 if the referee of this world can still be using 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.539
 but random decreases 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.939
 in the latest output of at least in my case 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:30.050
 that depends on him 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.050
 arm and hand of each 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.499
 the provider objected well 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:43.729
 the size of the space 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.909
 ends the career opportunities that you have made and of course 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.159
 - It will be easier for you to misbehave. 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.110
 can be him 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.129
 the one that rolls in the next room 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.259
 here we analyze the sociologist so that she comes to understand the pain 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.180
 back to back 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.010
 and neck and continued to the other side
