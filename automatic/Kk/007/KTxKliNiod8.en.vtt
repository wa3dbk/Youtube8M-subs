00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:37.950
 it comes to me people I do not know 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.210
 Sometimes people are looking forward to asking questions 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.960
 she what is this here 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:54.030
 I suggest garden then beautiful nice 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:56.100
 I believe that more people 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.470
 to think about where to come 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.870
 my food actually or what 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.290
 I get to buy and where does it come from 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.810
 that then lost in the train as well 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.909
 actually grows what is why I know 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:18.420
 some who really want to garden 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:20.070
 and that, of course, something in common 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 is still fascinating for many people 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.159
 which are open for it's just that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.229
 that you can discover vegetables 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.060
 which do not grow on every corner now 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.710
 but the halt our migrants 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.350
 For example, they brought the woman out 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.670
 motivates vegetables from Vietnam what good 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.750
 you do not have any here in germany 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.750
 has proper name 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.299
 I think it's time too 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.580
 can give again or at the moment 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.930
 the prices so go up for it 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.850
 people who have little money yet 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.140
 becomes more important again that they are in 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:13.840
 the time where you can learn too 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:16.420
 they will not save things if 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.860
 there may be no more on the ground 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.299
 for cultivation and but the desire is there 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.180
 in the city a bit too 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.530
 to supply itself at least partially 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.250
 are roofs as a very good 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.250
 possibility 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.380
 when you see what effect this 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.630
 Gardens have far beyond this one place 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.400
 out there you can already see what that is 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.110
 can bring and not in the form of 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.890
 we are capable of the cities themselves 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.260
 to supply 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.989
 that is a completely different question but 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.269
 to think about that the future 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.190
 and life will be born completely in the future 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.930
 look different can afford this 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.510
 gardens and the mature are not in shape 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.200
 from any theoretical 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.549
 abstract vision of a concrete of 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.549
 you can smell and feel pure 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.040
 the massive direction city runs says 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.320
 Here I am here will be alive now 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.510
 I have to change that somehow that way 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.780
 suits me and it is for me 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.980
 coherent if I make the thing green 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.280
 I do not live on concrete and not on 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.239
 Cars from the world sent for green 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.239
 as suspicious
