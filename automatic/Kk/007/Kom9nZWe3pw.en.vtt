00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
slaves and all I know it doesn't

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.090 
slaves and all I know it doesn't
increase<00:02:58.459> much<00:02:58.970> size<00:02:59.660> for<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.140> whole<00:03:00.770> laptop

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
increase much size for the whole laptop

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.600 
increase much size for the whole laptop
a<00:03:01.630> bit<00:03:02.630> but<00:03:03.040> good<00:03:04.040> compromise<00:03:04.459> with

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
a bit but good compromise with

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.979 
a bit but good compromise with
durability<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:08.590> for<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.770> protection<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:10.730> the
