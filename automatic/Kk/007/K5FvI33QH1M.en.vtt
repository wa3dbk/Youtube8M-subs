Wallace<00:01:01.210> I<00:01:01.390> think<00:01:01.600> is<00:01:01.690> one<00:01:01.870> of<00:01:01.900> them<00:01:02.110> and

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
Wallace I think is one of them and

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.620 
Wallace I think is one of them and
probably<00:01:02.440> George<00:01:02.950> Saunders<00:01:03.190> is<00:01:03.489> another<00:01:03.790> who

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
probably George Saunders is another who

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.510 
probably George Saunders is another who
I<00:01:04.930> don't<00:01:05.080> think<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.410> Bret's<00:01:05.620> get<00:01:05.860> at<00:01:06.010> all<00:01:06.160> I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
I don't think the Bret's get at all I

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.030 
I don't think the Bret's get at all I
think<00:01:07.180> they're<00:01:07.330> just<00:01:07.450> like<00:01:07.710> why<00:01:08.710> do<00:01:08.770> people

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
think they're just like why do people

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.430 
think they're just like why do people
what<00:01:09.310> this<00:01:09.580> is<00:01:09.850> so<00:01:10.030> this<00:01:10.300> is<00:01:10.360> so<00:01:10.479> puerile<00:01:11.170> it's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
what this is so this is so puerile it's

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.230 
what this is so this is so puerile it's
so<00:01:11.620> easy<00:01:11.950> it's<00:01:12.400> what<00:01:12.729> I<00:01:12.760> don't<00:01:13.030> know<00:01:13.090> what

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
so easy it's what I don't know what

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.120 
so easy it's what I don't know what
they're<00:01:13.360> they're<00:01:13.960> thinking<00:01:14.410> or<00:01:14.590> this<00:01:14.860> is<00:01:14.979> so

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
they're they're thinking or this is so

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.190 
they're they're thinking or this is so
bratty<00:01:15.400> it's<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:15.820> annoying<00:01:16.120> or<00:01:16.630> it's<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:16.960> broad

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
bratty it's so annoying or it's so broad

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.230 
bratty it's so annoying or it's so broad
or<00:01:17.530> whatever<00:01:17.890> they're<00:01:18.729> saying<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.180> think

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
or whatever they're saying I think

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.030 
or whatever they're saying I think
there's<00:01:19.509> a<00:01:19.570> category<00:01:19.960> of<00:01:20.350> American<00:01:20.890> fiction

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040

there's a category of American fiction
that<00:01:21.310> just<00:01:21.369> doesn't<00:01:21.940> cross<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.869> ocean<00:01:23.380> so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
that just doesn't cross the ocean so

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.100 
that just doesn't cross the ocean so
well<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:24.910> think<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.450> I'm<00:01:25.630> talking<00:01:25.869> about

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
well and I think that I'm talking about

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.670 
well and I think that I'm talking about

taste thing i I think there's a kind of
well-made<00:02:16.620> product<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.630> Forster

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
well-made product that that Forster

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.050
