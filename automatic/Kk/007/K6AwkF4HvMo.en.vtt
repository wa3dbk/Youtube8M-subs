00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.040
 great moments of loneliness and that of 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.530
 the toyota auris in portugal i'm waiting 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.000
 pig everything I wanted you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.379

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:23.220
 Soaking my geese is the real life 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.670
 it was better than I had 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.439
 started 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.500
 so it's electric does not need to 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.019
 him when in addition to the engine and he knows 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.160
 what they did to me is tell you 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.510
 dashboard what is a drawing 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 but I find it a bit flat 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.170
 stop anyway a little you mount 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.600
 even in a 308 or a c4 it's more 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.969
 it's more and more working I'll 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.489
 said on the plane may even visual 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.610
 drawing you see all this this all enough 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.420
 it's pretty simplistic what is it 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.000
 finds the little specific lever of 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.329

 this campus is of course in the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:17.040

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.990

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.550
 it's a funny thing is that 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.780
 the pointed when you're in eco mode she 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.480
 is white and when you switch to 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.830

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.180

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.380
