00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.429
 this car temperature is minus 9 degrees 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:15.560
 so much gasoline and 98 filled 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:20.279
 sport mode vds box disabled 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.590
 tracking first as in the first one mode 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.699
 pressing here is an auto acceleration device 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.849
 broadcast went push with one pedal 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.849
 start pushing the gas pedal 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.730
 a hundred 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 up to 66 seconds 6 and 9 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:58.200
 previous figures were even lower 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.210
 now we will make one more arrival now 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.070
 We leave from here and probably just in the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:10.850
 the second stretch raw rubber what 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.850
 skidded healthy once again drove 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.200
 6 5 6 is actually stable 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.299
 pastor performance 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.390
 rejoice now once again for becoming 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.580
 one more time 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.580
 we will stop completely sleeping or clicked ready 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 moved over 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.450
 6 3 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.820
 for some reason we were driving on that side 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.010
 It turned out much faster 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.840
 results 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.659
 6 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.850
 there are 5 9 and 5 9 and 5 5 even can even 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:08.750
 be strong business now try 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.750
 turned around and the same thing from that side 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:17.100
 tom and week and nothing 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.310
 there will be no problems with it 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.700
 May 5 but it certainly is not every not so 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.360
 realistic 636 in the region of 6 seconds 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.470
 this here is just over 6 seconds 6 1 this here 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.470
 quite normal 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.790
 629 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.540
 but also to us that is when the same 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.340
 indicators 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:52.680
 here are the results we have 6 and here 1 5 5 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:57.090
 Of course this is fantastic unreal 5 8 969 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:02.370
 69 6 3 6 3 6 29 result design 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:06.480
 getting worse may be the case 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.069
 temperature warmed up in the summary 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.290
 right the steering wheel is completely off 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.860
 stabilization which even dramatically musa 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.860
 let's say 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.690
 not 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.830
 68 is not necessary because he is very 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:34.830
 a lot of passes on ux i think that in 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.890
 Basically, we tried enough 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.890
