00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
the options you go on key bindings and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.010 
the options you go on key bindings and
usually<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.910> normal<00:00:42.120> casting<00:00:42.690> but

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
you just go down and smart cast is here

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.840 
you just go down and smart cast is here
so<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.379> want<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.649> smart<00:00:46.920> cassavell<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.640> which

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
go to smart cast item so these are 6

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.299 
go to smart cast item so these are 6
items<00:00:59.910> slots<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> yeah<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.070> here

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
items slots and yeah as you can see here

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.889 
items slots and yeah as you can see here
if<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> press<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.059> year<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.629> through

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
if you press one year going through

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.870 
if you press one year going through
smart<00:01:04.229> cast<00:01:04.470> across<00:01:04.769> item<00:01:05.159> slots<00:01:05.430> which<00:01:05.729> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
smart cast across item slots which is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.700 
smart cast across item slots which is
what<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.210> smart<00:01:06.600> cast<00:01:06.840> everything<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.470> think

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
what I smart cast everything I think

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.399 
what I smart cast everything I think
it's<00:01:07.860> better<00:01:08.030> once<00:01:09.030> that's<00:01:09.299> done<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.810> press

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
it's better once that's done you press

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.300 
it's better once that's done you press
ok<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.210> now<00:01:12.260> war<00:01:13.260> jumping<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.890> actually

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
ok and now war jumping is actually

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.999 
ok and now war jumping is actually
pretty<00:01:14.549> simple<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.600> takes<00:01:16.049> practice<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
pretty simple it takes practice the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.539 
pretty simple it takes practice the
theory<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.490> simple<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:19.100> if<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.340> can

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
theory is simple and if you can

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.399 
theory is simple and if you can
successfully<00:01:21.000> pull<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.600> off<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.140> just

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
successfully pull it off it's just

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.609 
successfully pull it off it's just
really<00:01:22.860> satisfying<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.420> how<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.020> done<00:01:25.200> very

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
really satisfying so how it is done very

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.730 
really satisfying so how it is done very
slowly<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.640> see<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> range<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> ward<00:01:27.810> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
slowly you see the range of the ward you

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.710 
slowly you see the range of the ward you
see<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> range<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.490> W<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.000> W<00:01:30.030> has<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> bit

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
see the range of your W the W has a bit

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.929 
see the range of your W the W has a bit
higher<00:01:30.869> range<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:32.250> will<00:01:32.430> always<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:32.790> able

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
higher range so you will always be able

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.580 
higher range so you will always be able
to<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> workshop<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.259> click<00:01:34.560> here

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
to do the workshop the click here

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
there's the world

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.859 
there's the world
and<00:01:36.499> then<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.399> press<00:01:37.579> your<00:01:37.759> dope<00:01:37.939> this<00:01:38.659> is<00:01:38.840> a

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
and then you press your dope this is a

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
in a very short amount of time it's like

just impress one and then immediately w

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.380 
just impress one and then immediately w
and<00:01:54.049> it<00:01:54.740> goes<00:01:54.920> extreme<00:01:55.310> china<00:01:55.670> center<00:01:56.149> and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
and it goes extreme china center and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.149 
and it goes extreme china center and
it's<00:01:56.719> really<00:01:56.929> great<00:01:57.200> for<00:01:57.259> like<00:01:57.679> covering

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
it's really great for like covering

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.550 
it's really great for like covering
distances<00:01:58.549> for<00:01:59.060> example<00:01:59.479> here<00:01:59.829> the<00:02:00.829> wall<00:02:01.009> and

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
distances for example here the wall and

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.620 
distances for example here the wall and
yeah<00:02:03.560> basically<00:02:03.829> it's<00:02:04.429> like<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.640> flash<00:02:04.969> just

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
yeah basically it's like a flash just

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.959 
yeah basically it's like a flash just
give<00:02:05.780> me<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.929> war<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.439> your<00:02:06.859> don't<00:02:07.099> create

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
give me the war and your don't create

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.380 
give me the war and your don't create
scripts<00:02:08.479> now<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.799> that's<00:02:10.039> done<00:02:10.390> another

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
scripts now that that's done another

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.780 
scripts now that that's done another
thing<00:02:11.780> about<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.140> war<00:02:12.319> jump<00:02:12.560> is<00:02:12.739> as<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.670> may

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
thing about the war jump is as you may

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.930 
thing about the war jump is as you may
know<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.329> words<00:02:14.739> can<00:02:15.739> actually<00:02:16.129> go<00:02:16.489> further

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
know the words can actually go further

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.789 
know the words can actually go further
than<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.660> range<00:02:17.870> indicates<00:02:18.579> for<00:02:19.579> example

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
than the range indicates for example

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.339 
than the range indicates for example
where<00:02:21.799> am<00:02:22.099> I<00:02:22.310> eat<00:02:22.549> here<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:23.690> range<00:02:23.930> doesn't

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
where am I eat here the range doesn't

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.710 
where am I eat here the range doesn't
indicate<00:02:24.560> behind<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.190> trees<00:02:25.459> but<00:02:26.209> if<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.480> place

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
indicate behind the trees but if I place

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.979 
indicate behind the trees but if I place
a<00:02:26.750> ward<00:02:27.049> here<00:02:27.579> whoops<00:02:28.579> it's<00:02:29.359> gonna<00:02:29.510> jump<00:02:29.840> over

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
a ward here whoops it's gonna jump over

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.470 
a ward here whoops it's gonna jump over
and<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:30.890> can<00:02:31.099> follow<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.609> up<00:02:31.670> these<00:02:32.000> range<00:02:32.269> of

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
and I can follow that up these range of

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.240 
and I can follow that up these range of
my<00:02:32.599> W<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.140> higher<00:02:33.349> than<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.650> range<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:34.099> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
my W is higher than the range of the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.089 
my W is higher than the range of the
words<00:02:34.489> same<00:02:35.450> with<00:02:35.629> flash<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.170> mean<00:02:36.620> look<00:02:36.859> look

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
words same with flash I mean look look

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.729 
words same with flash I mean look look
at<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.310> lash<00:02:37.549> range<00:02:37.819> master<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.959> it's<00:02:39.140> me<00:02:39.349> not

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
at the lash range master the it's me not

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.949 
at the lash range master the it's me not
it's<00:02:40.069> like<00:02:40.160> about<00:02:40.549> halfway<00:02:40.790> through<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:41.870> I

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
it's like about halfway through but I

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.250 
it's like about halfway through but I
can<00:02:42.139> flash<00:02:42.349> over<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.090> show<00:02:44.260> simple

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
can flash over and just to show simple

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.520 
can flash over and just to show simple
water<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.120> can<00:02:47.329> also<00:02:47.480> work<00:02:47.780> jump<00:02:48.079> places

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
water so you can also work jump places

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.840 
water so you can also work jump places
which<00:02:48.709> are<00:02:48.859> bigger<00:02:49.400> in<00:02:49.609> sin

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
which are bigger in sin

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.920 
which are bigger in sin
yeah<00:02:51.420> then<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.840> think<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:53.250> now<00:02:54.120> some<00:02:54.480> common

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
yeah then you think and now some common

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.080 
yeah then you think and now some common
board<00:02:55.140> jump<00:02:55.320> spots<00:02:55.650> basically<00:02:56.370> what<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:56.940> can

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
board jump spots basically what you can

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.110 
board jump spots basically what you can
do<00:02:57.240> is<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:58.980> just<00:02:59.280> watch<00:02:59.460> jump<00:02:59.700> everywhere

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
do is you can just watch jump everywhere

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.820 
do is you can just watch jump everywhere
you<00:03:00.180> can<00:03:00.330> walk<00:03:00.600> here<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:03.120> yeah<00:03:03.740> that's<00:03:04.740> just

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
you can walk here so yeah that's just

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.210 
you can walk here so yeah that's just
what<00:03:05.010> jumping<00:03:05.580> it's<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:06.780> simple<00:03:07.050> technique<00:03:07.830> and
