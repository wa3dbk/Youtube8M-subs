look at my when the Machine and well
well<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.830> can<00:00:14.100> just<00:00:14.129> see<00:00:14.549> how<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.820> works<00:00:15.150> first

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
well we can just see how it works first

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.019 
well we can just see how it works first
so<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:18.259> kind<00:00:19.259> of<00:00:19.349> a<00:00:19.529> bank<00:00:19.770> system<00:00:20.040> I<00:00:20.400> am<00:00:20.820> made

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
so it is kind of a bank system I am made

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.920 
so it is kind of a bank system I am made
it<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.360> now<00:00:21.619> so<00:00:22.619> um<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:25.410> four<00:00:25.859> slots<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
it like now so um I have four slots and

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.340 
it like now so um I have four slots and
i'm<00:00:27.930> using<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:29.480> minecraft<00:00:30.480> track<00:00:32.510> and<00:00:33.510> if<00:00:34.050> i

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
i'm using a minecraft track and if i

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.380 
i'm using a minecraft track and if i
press<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.980> diamond<00:00:35.430> button<00:00:35.699> right<00:00:35.879> now<00:00:36.059> if

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
press the diamond button right now if

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.459 
press the diamond button right now if
the<00:00:36.989> diamonds<00:00:37.739> will<00:00:37.890> come<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.400> and<00:00:39.170> i<00:00:40.170> can

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the diamonds will come out and i can

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.459 
the diamonds will come out and i can
pick<00:00:40.649> my<00:00:40.800> diamonds<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.600> how<00:00:42.840> this

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
pick my diamonds and we can see how this

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
pick my diamonds and we can see how this
works<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> by<00:00:46.590> selecting<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:49.129> slots<00:00:50.129> i'm

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
works so by selecting the slots i'm

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.490 
works so by selecting the slots i'm
using<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:52.699> destination<00:00:53.699> selection<00:00:54.420> too<00:00:54.930> i

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
using a destination selection too i

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.920 
using a destination selection too i
think<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.340> called<00:00:57.109> and<00:00:58.109> i<00:00:59.010> gave<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.359> quick

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
think it's called and i gave you a quick

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.260 
think it's called and i gave you a quick
look<00:01:01.140> after<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.789> not<00:01:03.000> enough

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
look after that and this is not enough

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.800 
look after that and this is not enough
my<00:01:03.480> design<00:01:04.020> I<00:01:04.430> saw<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.910> this<00:01:06.149> channel<00:01:06.479> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
my design I saw it on this channel so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.770 
my design I saw it on this channel so
i'm<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> give<00:01:07.800> a<00:01:08.009> quick<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:09.000> I'm

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
i'm not going to give a quick or I'm

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.300 
i'm not going to give a quick or I'm
going<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.170> give<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> quick<00:01:10.800> just

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
going to give you a quick just

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.260 
going to give you a quick just
demonstration<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.119> how<00:01:12.569> it<00:01:12.630> works<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:15.090> will

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
demonstration of how it works it will

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.070 
demonstration of how it works it will
always<00:01:15.509> be<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:16.259> output<00:01:16.709> that<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.729> toggled<00:01:18.630> off

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
always be one output that is toggled off

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.160 
always be one output that is toggled off
and<00:01:19.640> restaurants<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.849> toggled<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:23.090> it

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
and restaurants is toggled on it

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.919 
and restaurants is toggled on it
consists<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.349> I<00:01:25.789> Arsenal<00:01:26.789> ash<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.569> reset

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
consists of I Arsenal ash and the reset

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.779 
consists of I Arsenal ash and the reset
line<00:01:28.110> that's<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:28.649> there<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.399> weighted

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
line that's right there the weighted

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.020 
line that's right there the weighted
line<00:01:29.970> also<00:01:30.420> perished<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.700> minecraft<00:01:32.700> rack

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
line also perished this minecraft rack

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
line also perished this minecraft rack
so<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.170> mine<00:01:34.319> cart<00:01:34.590> goes<00:01:34.920> back<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:36.050> behind

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
so the mine cart goes back and behind

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.540 
so the mine cart goes back and behind
here<00:01:37.590> I'm<00:01:37.860> sending<00:01:38.819> the<00:01:39.000> single<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.349> if<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:41.250> see

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
here I'm sending the single so if we see

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.380 
here I'm sending the single so if we see
on<00:01:41.819> number<00:01:42.420> two<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.929> is<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.950> at<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:45.030> output

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
on number two that is the at the output

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.160 
on number two that is the at the output
that<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.020> turned<00:01:46.530> off<00:01:47.390> okay<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.720> turned<00:01:48.989> on

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that is turned off okay it's turned on

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.930 
that is turned off okay it's turned on
and<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:51.319> just<00:01:52.319> invert<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.429> power<00:01:53.640> right<00:01:53.910> here

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
and I just invert the power right here

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.690 
and I just invert the power right here
and<00:01:54.390> sending<00:01:55.080> one<00:01:55.440> down<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:58.130> torch<00:01:59.130> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
and sending one down to this torch that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.680 
and sending one down to this torch that
will<00:02:00.020> change<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.410> direction<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:02.479> mine<00:02:03.479> cut

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
will change the direction of mine cut

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.040 
will change the direction of mine cut
rack<00:02:03.929> so<00:02:04.530> when<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.160> one<00:02:05.429> goes<00:02:05.789> back<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.750> we'll

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
rack so when this one goes back if we'll

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.690 
rack so when this one goes back if we'll
go<00:02:07.289> down<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:09.200> pass<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.560> track<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.310> go<00:02:11.489> up

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
go down here pass this track and go up

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.230 
go down here pass this track and go up
here<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:15.510> one<00:02:16.580> torch<00:02:17.580> par<00:02:18.000> this

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
here so and this one torch par this

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.490 
here so and this one torch par this
torch<00:02:18.720> that

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
torch that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.350 
torch that
or<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.790> track<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:24.450> if<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.700> changed<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:27.000> now

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
or this track and if I changed this now

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.450 
or this track and if I changed this now
or<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.320> want<00:02:31.500> your<00:02:31.590> about<00:02:31.920> why<00:02:32.280> I'm

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
or and I if you want your about why I'm

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.030 
or and I if you want your about why I'm
using<00:02:32.700> someone<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.360> repeater<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:34.170> got

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
using someone to repeater it's got

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.500 
using someone to repeater it's got
because<00:02:35.520> i<00:02:35.910> do<00:02:36.030> not<00:02:36.330> want<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:37.550> lines<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.790> go

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
because i do not want the lines to go

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.680 
because i do not want the lines to go
together<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.890> makes<00:02:41.270> doesn't<00:02:42.270> make<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.630> a

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
together so it makes doesn't make it a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.960 
together so it makes doesn't make it a
mess<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.170> my<00:02:43.200> system<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.950> looks<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.370> camels

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
mess in my system it looks like camels

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.750 
mess in my system it looks like camels
but<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.360> Jason's<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.530> have<00:02:47.490> repeaters<00:02:48.240> on<00:02:49.760> delay

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
but is Jason's I have repeaters on delay

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.500 
but is Jason's I have repeaters on delay
at<00:02:51.090> moons<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:53.130> reason<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.120> have<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
at moons so the reason for I have the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.930 
at moons so the reason for I have the
delay<00:02:55.020> is<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:57.030> cart<00:02:57.600> will<00:02:58.350> pass<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.220> go

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
delay is that this cart will pass and go

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.110 
delay is that this cart will pass and go
up<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.209> place<00:03:00.810> before<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.470> next<00:03:01.980> one<00:03:02.430> changes

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
