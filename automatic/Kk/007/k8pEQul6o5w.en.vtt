optical drive and so should you

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.479 
optical drive and so should you
just<00:03:00.329> get<00:03:00.420> like<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.599> Plextor<00:03:01.019> 52<00:03:01.650> X<00:03:01.829> CD<00:03:02.220> burner

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
just get like a Plextor 52 X CD burner

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.630 
just get like a Plextor 52 X CD burner
look<00:03:03.180> here<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:04.129> what's<00:03:05.129> what's<00:03:05.370> on<00:03:05.489> top

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
look here at this what's what's on top

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.360 
look here at this what's what's on top
of<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:06.410> just<00:03:07.410> get<00:03:07.530> like<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.680> plug<00:03:07.920> store<00:03:08.129> in

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
of this just get like a plug store in

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.830 
of this just get like a plug store in
beige<00:03:08.670> make<00:03:09.090> sure<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.299> get<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.420> beige<00:03:09.629> one

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
beige make sure you get a beige one

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.380 
beige make sure you get a beige one
beige<00:03:10.079> ones<00:03:10.290> are<00:03:10.410> 34%<00:03:11.280> faster<00:03:11.730> because<00:03:12.299> the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
beige ones are 34% faster because the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.020 
beige ones are 34% faster because the
black<00:03:12.569> paint<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.440> sticks<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.489> front<00:03:14.790> and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
black paint it sticks on the front and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.190 
black paint it sticks on the front and
it<00:03:15.810> absorbs<00:03:16.650> heat<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:18.090> heat<00:03:18.299> will<00:03:18.690> get<00:03:18.989> on

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
it absorbs heat and the heat will get on

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.800 
it absorbs heat and the heat will get on
to<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.829> laser<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.340> then<00:03:21.090> your<00:03:21.540> Drive<00:03:21.720> is

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
to the laser and then your Drive is

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.420 
to the laser and then your Drive is
gonna<00:03:21.930> run<00:03:22.109> slower<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.100> want<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.310> get<00:03:23.400> a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
gonna run slower and you want to get a

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.289 
gonna run slower and you want to get a
base<00:03:23.579> drive<00:03:23.819> understand<00:03:26.030> orange<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.120> even

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
base drive understand orange is even

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.640 
base drive understand orange is even
faster<00:03:27.420> because<00:03:27.690> orange<00:03:28.139> is<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.319> color<00:03:28.530> that

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
faster because orange is the color that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.250 
faster because orange is the color that
repels<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.220> most<00:03:29.370> light

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
repels the most light

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.750 
repels the most light
this<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.380> science<00:03:31.590> people<00:03:32.069> you<00:03:32.430> can't<00:03:32.609> argue
