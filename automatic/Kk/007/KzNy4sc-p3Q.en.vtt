you<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.360> ones<00:02:12.540> proline<00:02:12.989> makes<00:02:13.230> but<00:02:13.410> I

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
you can get the ones proline makes but I

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.760 
you can get the ones proline makes but I
just

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
just

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.860 
just
Jada's<00:02:15.470> if<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.680> get<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.100> if<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.370> put<00:02:17.580> if<00:02:18.210> and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
Jada's if you get that if you put if and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.310 
Jada's if you get that if you put if and
it<00:02:19.020> has<00:02:19.200> pro<00:02:19.560> tacking<00:02:20.040> arms<00:02:20.780> which<00:02:21.780> I'll<00:02:22.020> get

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
it has pro tacking arms which I'll get

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.400 
it has pro tacking arms which I'll get
more<00:02:22.860> extensive<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.390> minute<00:02:24.600> if

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
more extensive on that in a minute if

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.380 
more extensive on that in a minute if
you<00:02:25.680> get<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.010> pro<00:02:26.220> take'<00:02:26.520> arms

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
you get the pro take' arms

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.860 
you get the pro take' arms
it<00:02:27.690> adds<00:02:28.220> travel<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:30.210> have<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.510> get<00:02:30.660> the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
it adds travel but you have to get the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.580 
it adds travel but you have to get the
proline<00:02:31.440> shock<00:02:31.830> tower<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.290> fits<00:02:34.500> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
proline shock tower so it fits the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.410 
proline shock tower so it fits the
geometry<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:36.390> shocks<00:02:36.660> better<00:02:37.140> and

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
geometry of the shocks better and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.090 
geometry of the shocks better and
rewards<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:39.450> one<00:02:39.870> quick<00:02:40.110> thing<00:02:40.380> I've<00:02:40.770> heard

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
rewards just one quick thing I've heard

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.670

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
little bit more scale you can just cut

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.520 
little bit more scale you can just cut
off<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.860> part<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.310> your<00:02:47.430> bumper<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.530> just

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.550 

see<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:09.990> you<00:03:10.920> Dremel<00:03:11.340> there<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:13.230> then<00:03:13.410> you

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
see there you Dremel there and then you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.160 
see there you Dremel there and then you
jumble<00:03:13.950> kind<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.880> behind<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.510> shock<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.990> don't

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
jumble kind of behind the shock I don't

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.530 
jumble kind of behind the shock I don't
know<00:03:16.260> if<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.410> can<00:03:16.590> see<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.010> like<00:03:17.670> right<00:03:17.970> in

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
know if you can see it like right in

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.720 
know if you can see it like right in
there<00:03:18.930> or<00:03:19.380> my<00:03:19.530> fingers<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:23.340> this

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
there or my fingers and then and this

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.910 
there or my fingers and then and this
doesn't<00:03:23.910> affect<00:03:24.300> it<00:03:24.480> at<00:03:24.600> all<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.080> then<00:03:27.920> you

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
doesn't affect it at all and then you

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.699 
doesn't affect it at all and then you
get<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.370> jumble<00:03:29.730> your<00:03:29.910> caster<00:03:30.360> bought<00:03:30.600> if<00:03:31.350> you

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
get the jumble your caster bought if you

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.400 
get the jumble your caster bought if you
have<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.550> much<00:03:32.820> in<00:03:33.090> because<00:03:33.900> when<00:03:34.290> it

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
have this much in because when it

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.690 
have this much in because when it
bottoms<00:03:34.830> out<00:03:35.840> or<00:03:36.840> when<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.400> doesn't

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
bottoms out or when it so it doesn't

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.330 
bottoms out or when it so it doesn't
like<00:03:38.850> see<00:03:39.330> because<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.800> would<00:03:41.010> hit<00:03:41.220> it

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
like see because that it would hit it

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.160 
like see because that it would hit it
early<00:03:42.920> but<00:03:43.920> now<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.190> can<00:03:44.490> fully<00:03:44.910> extend<00:03:45.450> and

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
early but now it can fully extend and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.140 
early but now it can fully extend and
then<00:03:46.740> same<00:03:47.130> on<00:03:47.340> this<00:03:47.520> side

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
then same on this side

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.610 
then same on this side
and<00:03:48.420> dremeled<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:48.990> right<00:03:49.170> there<00:03:51.500> download<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
and dremeled it right there download the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.460 
and dremeled it right there download the
caster<00:03:52.980> balkan<00:03:53.400> one<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.700> my<00:03:53.790> casa<00:03:54.060> box<00:03:54.480> broke

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
caster balkan one of my casa box broke

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.640 
caster balkan one of my casa box broke
but<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.100> was<00:03:56.430> no<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:57.480> was<00:03:57.750> not<00:03:58.050> because<00:03:58.380> i

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
but it was no it was not because i

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.990 
but it was no it was not because i
dremeled<00:03:59.100> it<00:04:00.709> my<00:04:01.709> phantom<00:04:02.010> ember<00:04:02.220> exactly<00:04:02.880> how

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
dremeled it my phantom ember exactly how

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.580 
dremeled it my phantom ember exactly how
it<00:04:03.150> broke<00:04:03.330> but<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.630> wasn't<00:04:03.900> even<00:04:03.959> close<00:04:04.230> to

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
it broke but it wasn't even close to

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:12.770 
it broke but it wasn't even close to
where<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:05.160> dremel<00:04:05.580> was<00:04:09.290> then<00:04:10.459> that<00:04:11.600> was<00:04:12.600> right

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
where the dremel was then that was right

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:20.620 
where the dremel was then that was right
there<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:14.970> then<00:04:16.609> we<00:04:18.320> I'm<00:04:19.320> pretty<00:04:19.590> sure<00:04:19.799> that's

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
there so then we I'm pretty sure that's

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.010 
there so then we I'm pretty sure that's
