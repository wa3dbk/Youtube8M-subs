00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.060
 me 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.380
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:27.029
 Hello My name is Sakura even if fit the sound of Mitsui Home 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:32.900
 The impact is that the two-by-four method has evolved 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.900
 I would like to explain high strength wooden housing system g- all 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:46.970
 Opportunity of development I Is Etto is as big earthquake of your Zonchi 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:51.080
 Eh, for example, the Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:01:00.020
 Then from last year's Great East Japan Earthquake 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:01:02.250
 It is as you see in 8 buildings more than approximately 100,000 buildings are destroyed even in the last house 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:09.240
 I am 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:16.520
 In fact, because it represents the number of the last time, I put a partially broken building or a half- broken building 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:22.939
 And that the building which is several times this is broken by the earthquake 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:26.930
 This is because we are a company that provides housing 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.360
 Also big cattle earthquake disaster of unexpected 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:35.840
 Can stand 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:41.570
 Rather , I feel that our mission is to create such a strong yo which is not broken 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:44.679
 But then you come out to Fu that another one of the numbers and now 184,000 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.679
 Well this is 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:02:01.890
 Shows the number of buildings that were completely demolished in the last year 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.920
 In fact, this report has been to is the coefficient is so real is the Fu that twice there this 1.5-fold 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.430
 It is said 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:14.480
 Great unprecedented earthquake disaster 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:17.840
 There is a reality that more than that and several times as many buildings are being broken every year 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:25.930
 This is eh 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:29.280
 It represents the average number of fields from the time a building is built to the time it is actually destroyed . 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:36.090
 Someone is 30 years in Japan 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:38.180
 In the same way, wooden houses are relatively 55 years in the US 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.450
 And with us 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.849
 Is 30 years since, for example, mortgage gar 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.630
 Because it is roughly 30 years Toka 35 years to say the building when the loan is finished will be destroyed 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:56.130
 Is the average site 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.130
 I think in the wind that I want to break this 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:05.000
 Why is it so short ? 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:09.980
 Well this is the Fu that it is not in the vertical pot of the physical durability of us I think 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:16.099
 Is a high level and we are very advanced is because Japan's residential construction technology 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.180
 The wind that physically is not a level such that Subekaraku broken result in 30 years 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:23.299
 thinking about 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:28.849
 So why are you scared ? In fact, the lifestyle of people who are males 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.590
 It seems that there are a lot of cases that are broken because they have not matched 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.890
 We are evaluating 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:41.720
 So we aimed 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:46.190
 This new business candidate is a strong house that can withstand unexpected disasters and is highly variable. 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:50.580
 We are thinking of a house where old design is possible 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:54.260
 But these two are well in a wooden house 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.260
 It is an element to 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:04.110
 In a typical wooden house, it is necessary to arrange many walls when trying to make the building more quake resistant 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.860
 There is 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:12.950
 Place a lot of walls and of the building 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:21.590
 It is undermined to say that it is Heisei 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:26.510
 ag all Newly developed next behind has less walls than just the outer perimeter more than ever 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:33.380
 It has become a feature that a strong building can make 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:35.650
 It is possible to create such a large-scale large-scale space with no questions 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.650
 I will 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:54.839
 It is internal so you can cover only in the most outer circumference of the shear walls of the building 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:56.929
 The interior of the building can also be freed of partitions to create a new shape 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:56.929
 The 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.240
 Technology behind the g All candidates would like me refer to the 8 bd 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.450
 tee 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.660
 There Hawwa 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.660
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:05.139
 The second place is very strong physical blow and 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:13.120
 It has a very simple structure only the floor set 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:15.780
 I also fit the 8 walls are very hot so I put the insulation well and now very much 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:22.490
 Because it is power saving or severe 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:22.490
 It is characterized by having such high energy saving performance together 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:33.920
 As you have seen, the point is actually the point of this high strength bearing wall 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:35.920
 It was in the development of the screw for physical fitness station 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:41.500
 Of wood 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:45.840
 Become high-strength accordingly Well because there are many compatibility features depending on the type of tree 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.190
 The point is that it was developed as 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.590
 In a 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:07:00.180
 Even though there is that wall magnification as a general indicator of the strength of the building wall 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:07:00.180
 So it is to say that it has secured a 10 times higher performance 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:08.920
 As we build a simple and clear system with a very strong wall and floor assembly 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:22.410
 It became possible to create a very open space at the same time as earthquake resistance . 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:36.650
 It is from now on that the interior of the building 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:43.280
 Establishing so-called good fill technology to create a space 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:44.960
 The wind that you want to provide housing that can Following Well forever living for those who get sumo 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.520
 am thinking 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.520
 Thank you for your attention
