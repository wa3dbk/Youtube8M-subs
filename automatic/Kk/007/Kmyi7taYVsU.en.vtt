perspective<00:02:30.170> right<00:02:30.680> there<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.280> made<00:02:32.180> me<00:02:32.360> this

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
perspective right there I made me this

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.420 
perspective right there I made me this
one<00:02:32.660> time<00:02:32.690> I<00:02:32.930> may<00:02:33.230> not<00:02:33.410> hope<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.069> can<00:02:34.190> get<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.310> the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
one time I may not hope I can get it the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.540
