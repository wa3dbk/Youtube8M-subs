high-end<00:00:15.360> features<00:00:15.930> on<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.230> one<00:00:16.789> the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
high-end features on this one the

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.370 
high-end features on this one the
general<00:00:18.210> construction<00:00:18.509> of<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.019> stick<00:00:19.230> is

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
general construction of the stick is

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.560 
general construction of the stick is
going<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.679> using<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.269> carbon<00:00:21.269> elite

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
going to be using that carbon elite

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.089 
going to be using that carbon elite
material<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.349> it's<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.589> be<00:00:22.650> nice<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
material so it's going to be nice and

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.820 
material so it's going to be nice and
lightweight<00:00:23.339> and<00:00:23.759> still<00:00:24.060> really<00:00:24.330> durable<00:00:24.830> up

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
lightweight and still really durable up

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.069 
lightweight and still really durable up
towards<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> shaft<00:00:26.999> right<00:00:27.269> here<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:27.900> we

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
towards the shaft right here we see we

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.019 
towards the shaft right here we see we
have<00:00:28.230> some<00:00:28.499> rounded<00:00:28.980> shaft<00:00:29.339> walls<00:00:29.669> on<00:00:29.880> there

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
have some rounded shaft walls on there

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.669 
have some rounded shaft walls on there
so<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.329> can<00:00:30.419> get<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> nice<00:00:30.869> traditional<00:00:31.439> feel

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
so you can get a nice traditional feel

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.500 
so you can get a nice traditional feel
with<00:00:31.829> the<00:00:31.949> stick<00:00:32.220> and<00:00:32.940> going<00:00:33.180> down<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.329> little

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
with the stick and going down a little

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.200 
with the stick and going down a little
bit<00:00:33.660> farther<00:00:33.930> here<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.579> red<00:00:35.850> ring

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
bit farther here you see that red ring

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.420 
bit farther here you see that red ring
right<00:00:36.480> around<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> stick<00:00:37.050> right<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.590> that's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
right around the stick right here that's

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.099 
right around the stick right here that's
the<00:00:38.640> biggest<00:00:38.879> new<00:00:39.180> technology<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:39.960> this

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:40.109 
the biggest new technology with this

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.000 
the biggest new technology with this
stick<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.039> the<00:00:41.430> shaka<00:00:41.820> technology

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
stick is the the shaka technology

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.060 
stick is the the shaka technology
basically<00:00:44.010> what<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.789> polyurethane

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
basically what that is is a polyurethane

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.160 
basically what that is is a polyurethane
sleeve<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.489> put<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.850> there<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.989> then

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
sleeve that they put in there and then

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.099 
sleeve that they put in there and then
they<00:00:49.500> put<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.949> sleeve<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:51.120> into<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> shaft

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
they put the sleeve up into the shaft

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.560 
they put the sleeve up into the shaft
and<00:00:52.410> then<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> paddle<00:00:53.070> into<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.550> sleeve<00:00:53.910> so

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and then the paddle into that sleeve so

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.610 
and then the paddle into that sleeve so
that's<00:00:54.719> basically<00:00:54.899> you're<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.559> to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
that's basically you're just going to

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680 
that's basically you're just going to
help<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> eliminate<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.850> majority<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
help to eliminate a majority of the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.270 
help to eliminate a majority of the
vibration<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.500> stick<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.010> you're<00:00:59.160> not

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
vibration in the stick so you're not

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.029 
vibration in the stick so you're not
going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> shot<00:01:00.920> shaking<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> entire

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
going to have a shot shaking the entire

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.130 
going to have a shot shaking the entire
stick<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.879> pretty<00:01:03.179> much<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> stop<00:01:03.960> it

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
stick it pretty much is going to stop it

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140 
stick it pretty much is going to stop it
right<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.760> great<00:01:05.910> new

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
right there so it's a great new

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.720 
right there so it's a great new
technology<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.070> another<00:01:08.430> thing

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
technology there and then another thing

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.310 
technology there and then another thing
right<00:01:08.940> here<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.360> well<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.110> their

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
right here as well as they have their

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.670 
right here as well as they have their
twister<00:01:10.860> grip<00:01:11.160> material<00:01:11.940> on<00:01:12.510> there<00:01:12.720> basically

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
twister grip material on there basically

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.830 
twister grip material on there basically
it's<00:01:13.980> just<00:01:14.160> a<00:01:14.280> slightly<00:01:14.640> raised<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.360> tacky

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it's just a slightly raised and tacky

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.150 
it's just a slightly raised and tacky
surface<00:01:16.050> so<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.620> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.830> give<00:01:16.980> you<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
surface so it's going to give you a

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.250 
surface so it's going to give you a
little<00:01:17.220> bit<00:01:17.520> extra<00:01:17.820> grip<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.960> right

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
little bit extra grip right it right

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.780 
little bit extra grip right it right
there<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.620> handle<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.160> the<00:01:20.280> stick<00:01:20.550> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
there at the handle of the stick and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.580 
there at the handle of the stick and
then<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.690> down<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:22.020> farther<00:01:22.260> here

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
then going down a little farther here

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
then going down a little farther here
into<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.980> paddle<00:01:23.370> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.480> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
into the paddle you can see it's a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.690 
into the paddle you can see it's a
really<00:01:24.900> flat<00:01:25.350> design<00:01:25.800> there<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> paddle

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
really flat design there on the paddle

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.420 
really flat design there on the paddle
so<00:01:26.910> you're<00:01:27.660> not<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.140> any<00:01:28.430> shots

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
so you're not going to have any shots

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.340 
so you're not going to have any shots
kind<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.970> skipping<00:01:30.450> over<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> stick<00:01:31.080> there

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
kind of skipping over the stick there

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.070 
kind of skipping over the stick there
and<00:01:31.560> then<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.370> down<00:01:32.490> into<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> blade<00:01:33.180> still

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
and then going down into the blade still

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.990 
and then going down into the blade still
going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.770> carbon<00:01:35.220> elite<00:01:35.430> material

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
going to have that carbon elite material

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.980 
going to have that carbon elite material
down<00:01:36.150> there<00:01:36.330> it's<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.600> some<00:01:36.780> great

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
down there it's just some great

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.200 
down there it's just some great
durability<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.830> there's<00:01:38.400> also<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.880> foam

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
durability and there's also that foam

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.520 
durability and there's also that foam
core<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.200> help<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
core and that it's going to help to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.740 
core and that it's going to help to
dampen<00:01:40.860> those<00:01:41.040> shots<00:01:41.370> and<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:42.390> stick<00:01:42.600> is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
dampen those shots and this stick is
