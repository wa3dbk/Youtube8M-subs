00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.220
 Hi seekers. 

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.161
 In today's video, I'll show Easter eggs from a pilot series. 

00:00:04.161 --> 00:00:05.180
 TV series Flash. 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.709
 As I wrote under one of the videos and on the page in 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.480
 contact, I have long wanted to do issues with easter eggs 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.120
 not just from video games. 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.730
 And then, finally, decided on a trial release. 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.951
 I will still think how best it will be to do it all, but 

00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.869
 for now, try this. 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.840
 There may be small spoilers, because there is intersection with 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.820
 comics, so be careful. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.449
 In the pilot a lot of easter eggs and references to the universe 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.449
 DC Comics. 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.079
 And I will start from the beginning. 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.550
 Presentation in the launch of the episode with the words - “Me 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.640
 my name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man on earth ” 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.140
 - This is a tribute to Mark Wade's long wound of Flash. 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.950
 Then, the main character was Wally West and practically 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.770
 each episode began with the phrase “My name is Wally 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.200
 West and I are the fastest man on earth. ” 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.220
 If you have already watched all or almost all published 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.720
 at the moment of the series, then you probably already heard 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.360
 Pro Back Flush. 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.110
 But he appeared in the pilot series. 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.450
 Saw this yellow ball of lightning at the time of the murder 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.450
 mom barry? 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.460
 This is the Reverse Flash, one of several enemies. 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.140
 Flash, which are connected by the same “force of speed”, 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.100
 which gives Barry his abilities. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.580
 Reverse Flash is a sworn enemy of Barry and he can be 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.830
 even closer than you think. 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.830
 But while all this is the secrets of the creators of the series. 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.190
 And yes, the presence of the Back Flash in Barry’s childhood means 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.690
 possible presence of time travel. 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.860
 In the death of his mother, Barry was accused of his father - Henry Allen. 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.970
 But he periodically appears in some series further 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.970
 in the plot. 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.990
 So the actor who plays Harry is John Wesley Shipp, 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.430
 it was he who played Flash in the 90's eponymous series. 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.040
 It was very nice of them to do that. 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.229
 In one of the conversations, Iris will call a particle accelerator 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.690
 like “Atom Smasher”. 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.590
 Interestingly, the exact same name is one of the characters 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.890
 DC Universe. 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.909
 He is known for his super strength and ability to 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.320
 huge increase in size. 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.410
 The supervillains in this series are Mardon Brothers. 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.409
 In the comic, evil is only one brother. 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.550
 Here, apparently, they both are. 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.450
 But only one that is really a supervillain. 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.770
 in the comic, here is considered dead. 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.880
 It means that his brother is Clyde Mardon, the villain of the series and the one 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.810
 whose death we see can be motivation for the present 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.310
 Weather Wizard - Marc Mardon, if the same appears 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.310
 in the series. 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.310
 Interesting thing about STAR 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.770
 Labs is the largest super science center in the DC universe. 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.000
 Chief in this center is Harrison Welles. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.130
 He is not a comic character, but something approximate. 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.840
 There is no one in the DC universe named Harrison Wells, 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.150
 but there is Harrison Slate who started the STAR 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.150
 Labs. 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.760
 I think these similarities between them are enough. 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.980
 Although, Harrison's character still remains big 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.160
 mystery series. 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.030
 And nothing exact about him is unknown. 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.659
 Another character in the series, this is the partner of father Iris 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.300
 - Detective Joe West - Eddie Town. 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.820
 It is very interesting how the creators of the series will behave with 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.100
 his character. 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.760
 Since in the comic, Eddie is a villain from the future and a man 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.750
 responsible for the murder of mother barry. 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.980
 Is he Professor Zoom or Reverse Flash, if you 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.980
 whatever 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.730
 With him here it is very strange now everything is not clearly implicated 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.290
 Does the serial Eddie with the events in childhood Barry. 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.060
 Eddie Town of Keystone City, twin brother of Central 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.220
 Seely in which, interestingly, in the Flash of the Golden Age 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.680
 lived Barry's nephew - Wally West. 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.890
 There is another connection with Barry's nephew. 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.460
 A reporter who was on TV during an accelerator crash 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.460
 particles. 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.000
 This is Linda Park, or at least that's her name. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.860
 in Strela, they did not show her name. 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.700
 Linda is the wife of Wally West, the third Flash to the new 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.680
 canon comic series DC “52”. 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.750
 I don’t know how it works, but Linda looks older 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.750
 Barry. 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.110
 Then how old is Wally? .. 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.510
 Did you know that Tsisko Ramon and Caitlin Snow, employees 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.510
 STAR 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.510
 Labs, celebrities? 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.510
 Caitlin Snow, STAR Technician 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.760
 Labs, in the comics, is better known as Killer Frost. 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.950
 And Tsisko Ramon from time to time a member of the League of Justice. 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.860
 This dude is just on top of his references. 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.050
 He not only throws the word “vibe” in conversation 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.629
 in a small appearance in Strela, but also catching up 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.250
 shy of Slade with a super-weapon that discharges energy 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.480
 and works in a similar way as the abilities of the hero Vibe 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.480
 in the comic. 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.220
 Which, by the way, is Tsisko. 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.050
 In the pilot the destroyed cell on which hangs 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.600
 sign with the name Grodd. 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.739
 Who is this? 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:04.909
 Grodd is a gorilla. 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.700
 Not enough information, huh? 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.660
 Okay, Gorilla Grodd is a longtime supervillain of the universe 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.250
 DC is one of the main enemies of Flash. 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.379
 So, given that there is no one in the cage, we can 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.220
 sooner or later see Grodd. 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.180
 In the series will fly a laundry truck “Gambi Cleaners”. 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.020
 In the comics, Peter, Paul and Anthony Gumbi brothers, tailors 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.240
 and in the case of Paul, the guy who designs 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.230
 costumes for most villains and super villains 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.419
 Central City. 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.380
 Barry tests the speed of the team on the runway 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.430
 Ferris Aircraft strip. 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.290
 It was here that he worked as a test pilot Hal Jordan - the second and most 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.889
 Popular Green Lantern. 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.449
 Surely you have noticed strange ears on Flash costume. 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.310
 Cisco made them as receivers so that you could communicate 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.310
 with Barry. 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.350
 And, as Cisco said, they are modified to withstand 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.240
 on the battlefield noise impulse. 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.180
 Impulse - that's exactly what Barry's grandson is, and later Kidd 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.180
 Flash 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.100
 Have you ever wondered why the lightning that created Flash, 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.100
 hit it in barry? 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.020
 As Barry Oliver Queen said, “I don’t think this 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.639
 lightning just hit you. 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.160
 I think she chose you. ” 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.699
 It sounds a bit strange, but if you think about it 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.940
 in the context of comics, that's exactly what happened. 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.550
 In the “Crisis on the Endless Lands” comic, Barry seems to have 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.310
 died, speeding insanely fast to stop 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.160
 anti-matter cannon from a shot and catching a tachyon ray in the heart 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.000
 arms forcing him to miss the mark. 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.419
 After that, in one of the issues it turned out that Barry had turned 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.030
 in a zipper and went back in time. 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.270
 Yes, Barry, by all appearances, was the lightning that struck 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.680
 in his own lab, sprinkling chemicals on himself 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.730
 and turning it into a flash. 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.220
 Such is the paradox from which the head can ache. 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.290
 Back in the pilot, Oliver Queen, and his last 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.840
 Barry's advice was: “Wear a mask.” 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.060
 Funny advice from him, because Barry did 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.770
 and gave the mask Strela. 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.800
 And finally, the Harrison newspaper in the final episode. 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.479
 The date on it is indicated - 2024. 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.039
 The heading on it reads “Flash disappears during 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.060
 Crisis. 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.080
 Mention Crisis is in several names. 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.430
 DC Comics, including “The Crisis on the Infinite 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.610
 The Lands ”in which Barry sacrificed his life 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.610
 saving the world. 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.870
 The newspaper also has a mention of the merger of WayneTech and Queen Industries. 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.910
 And although the creators of the series were forbidden to mention Batman 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.850
 and Superman on TV shows to separate them from movies, 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.530
 in spite of this such a mention is still left 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.530
 in the series. 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.160
 It was the last Easter eggs in the video on which I leave you and 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.229
 until next week. 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.120
 Do not forget to subscribe to the channel to find out 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.389
 about the new commercials the very first.
