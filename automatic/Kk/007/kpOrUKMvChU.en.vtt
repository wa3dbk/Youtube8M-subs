 the code for this battery is click 7.004 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.450
 so I'm going to put it here so that 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.370
 Forward the search it is important that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.010

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.380
 let's put the corresponding category of 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.330
 correct way in order to simplify the 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.490

 we have for this battery that we are 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.650
 looking and I'm going to choose the middle 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.750
 is the original kodak battery and I'm going to 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.020
 choose the middle option that I 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.230
 It seems economical because it says 15 dollars 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.830
 now we see on this screen the 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.260
 11 options including the option that most 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.290
 I was attracted to the most economical 15 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.880

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.600
