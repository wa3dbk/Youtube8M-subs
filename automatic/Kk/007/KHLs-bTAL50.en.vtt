00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
come to your TV and then you also need a

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.959 
come to your TV and then you also need a
remote<00:02:02.200> right<00:02:02.409> so<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:03.310> will<00:02:03.430> be<00:02:03.460> surprised

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
remote right so you will be surprised

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.810 
remote right so you will be surprised
but<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.420> remote<00:02:04.719> is<00:02:04.899> something<00:02:05.290> like<00:02:05.409> this

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
but the remote is something like this

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.819 
but the remote is something like this
now<00:02:06.820> this<00:02:07.000> looks<00:02:07.329> quite<00:02:07.780> complicated<00:02:08.350> but

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829 
now this looks quite complicated but

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.770 
now this looks quite complicated but
actually<00:02:09.280> if<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.489> use<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.850> for<00:02:10.000> some<00:02:10.179> time<00:02:10.209> it

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
actually if you use it for some time it

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.039 
actually if you use it for some time it
feels<00:02:11.320> very<00:02:11.620> easy<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.579> the<00:02:13.180> remote<00:02:13.870> is

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
feels very easy so the remote is

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.589 
feels very easy so the remote is
logically<00:02:14.590> divided<00:02:14.980> into<00:02:15.280> two<00:02:15.430> parts<00:02:15.459> this<00:02:16.390> is

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
logically divided into two parts this is

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.229 
logically divided into two parts this is
the<00:02:16.900> keyboard<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:18.010> QWERTY<00:02:18.370> keyboard<00:02:18.819> that

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
the keyboard the QWERTY keyboard that

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.300 
the keyboard the QWERTY keyboard that
you<00:02:19.420> use<00:02:19.510> for<00:02:19.720> typing<00:02:20.080> in

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
you use for typing in

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.010 
you use for typing in
you<00:02:20.580> want<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.880> reply<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.239> your<00:02:21.480> emails<00:02:21.840> from

you want to reply to your emails from
your<00:02:22.230> TV<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:22.680> do<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:24.209> side

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
your TV you can do that and this side

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.280 
your TV you can do that and this side
this<00:02:26.250> side<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.090> stuff<00:02:27.690> that's<00:02:27.989> required

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
this side is the stuff that's required

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.410 
this side is the stuff that's required
for<00:02:28.500> TV<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.640> trackpad<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.239> you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
for TV so this is the trackpad like you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.390 
for TV so this is the trackpad like you

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
operate the mouse on the screen and then

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.979 
operate the mouse on the screen and then
you<00:02:35.459> have<00:02:35.610> these<00:02:35.760> buttons<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.450> case<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.810> want

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
cursor right so it's actually very easy

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.839 
cursor right so it's actually very easy
but<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.599> feels<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:43.080> bit<00:02:43.230> odd<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.530> use<00:02:44.010> such

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849

but<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.810> easily<00:03:19.110> create<00:03:19.290> another

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
but you can easily create another

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.820 
but you can easily create another
account<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:20.130> download<00:03:20.519> these<00:03:20.670> apps<00:03:20.959> so<00:03:21.959> that's

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
account in download these apps so that's

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.610 
account in download these apps so that's
the<00:03:23.190> basic<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.819> Google<00:03:24.239> TV<00:03:24.540> but<00:03:24.810> how<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.590> that

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
the basic of Google TV but how is that

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:37.550 
the basic of Google TV but how is that
the<00:03:25.980> device<00:03:26.519> itself<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.269> now<00:03:27.420> let's<00:03:27.690> jump<00:03:28.019> in

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.649 

so<00:03:38.560> once<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:38.920> start<00:03:39.219> google<00:03:39.819> DB<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.269> land<00:03:40.480> on

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
so once you start google DB you land on

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.750 
so once you start google DB you land on
your<00:03:40.780> bookmark<00:03:41.230> screen<00:03:41.590> this<00:03:42.069> is<00:03:42.129> basically<00:03:42.609> a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
your bookmark screen this is basically a

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.250 
your bookmark screen this is basically a
list<00:03:42.969> of<00:03:43.150> websites<00:03:43.329> and<00:03:43.719> apps<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.230> use

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
list of websites and apps that you use

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.289 
list of websites and apps that you use
most<00:03:44.560> frequently<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.730> screen<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.030> completely

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
most frequently the screen is completely

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.479 
most frequently the screen is completely
customizable<00:03:46.840> so<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.650> can<00:03:47.859> add<00:03:48.099> or<00:03:48.370> remove

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
customizable so you can add or remove

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.209 
customizable so you can add or remove
websites<00:03:49.060> as<00:03:49.239> you<00:03:49.480> like<00:03:49.739> then<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:50.859> have<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:51.219 
websites as you like then you have the

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:54.270

the applications that are installing
Google<00:03:56.049> TV<00:03:56.319> for<00:03:56.950> instance<00:03:57.159> there<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.400> Twitter
