 nativity the purity of these stones 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.250
 the modesty of this entrance and above all what comes from here

 centuries jealously guarded say much more suggestive singer marti 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.810

 everything in here in the Basilica of the Nativity of Bethlehem in these days 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.949
 seems to talk

 icons are different 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.980

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:42.329
 even joyful service I would say joyful because Christmas brings joy 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.999
 and it created this atmosphere of sharing the family age then 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:53.939
 the guardian is the one who serves because this and joy is felt lived by 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:03:00.259
 all challenging because as a guardian he has to think he has to organize things 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:02.469
 because everyone is happy 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:07.379
