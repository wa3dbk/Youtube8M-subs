like for example our right here for us
test<00:04:13.900> two<00:04:15.600> we<00:04:16.600> click<00:04:16.900> on<00:04:17.260> create<00:04:17.800> the<00:04:18.130> system

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
test two we click on create the system

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.720 
test two we click on create the system
will<00:04:18.730> create<00:04:19.000> this<00:04:19.810> restoring<00:04:20.320> point<00:04:20.730> as

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
will create this restoring point as

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.760 
will create this restoring point as
desired<00:04:22.180> by<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:23.110> user

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.320 

then<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.100> restore<00:04:28.460> point<00:04:28.850> was<00:04:29.120> created

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
then the restore point was created

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.180 
then the restore point was created
successfully<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.560> confirmation<00:04:31.160> message

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
successfully the confirmation message

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.780 
successfully the confirmation message
has<00:04:31.670> been<00:04:31.700> shown<00:04:35.380> so<00:04:36.380> by<00:04:36.740> opening<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.340> system

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
has been shown so by opening the system

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.200 
has been shown so by opening the system
restore<00:04:38.090> again<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.660> we<00:04:39.500> click<00:04:39.770> on<00:04:40.010> next<00:04:40.490> will

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
restore again and we click on next will

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.410 
restore again and we click on next will
find<00:04:41.660> that<00:04:42.020> this<00:04:42.910> restoring<00:04:43.910> point<00:04:44.120> has<00:04:44.270> been

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
find that this restoring point has been

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.830 
find that this restoring point has been
created<00:04:44.780> via<00:04:44.990> last<00:04:45.170> test<00:04:45.470> too<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:47.330> we<00:04:47.510> can<00:04:47.690> use

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
created via last test too so we can use

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.500 
created via last test too so we can use
it<00:04:47.870> whenever<00:04:48.200> we<00:04:48.410> want<00:04:48.670> in<00:04:49.670> case<00:04:50.000> if<00:04:50.180> we<00:04:50.360> want

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
it whenever we want in case if we want

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.830 
it whenever we want in case if we want
to<00:04:50.680> apply<00:04:51.730> changes<00:04:52.730> to<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.510> system

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.740 

so<00:04:57.650> this<00:04:57.920> is<00:04:58.070> how<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.370> deal<00:04:58.850> with<00:04:59.120> System

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
so this is how to deal with System

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.820 
so this is how to deal with System
Restore<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.520> Microsoft<00:05:01.520> Windows<00:05:01.960> 7<00:05:02.960> thank

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
Restore and Microsoft Windows 7 thank

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.070
