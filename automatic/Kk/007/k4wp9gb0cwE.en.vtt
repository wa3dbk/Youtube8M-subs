 built before choosing a company 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.900
 wooden house 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.810

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.150

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.480
 explained and offered to look at the place 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.030
 how to cut a house to go big village 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.090
 well we are a big village did not go we went 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.710
 see the cutting process itself because 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.379
 in general, the hand process is often in 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.329
 many companies are broken and here we are 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.590
 I wanted to just like that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.340
 the suns how brie is cut me a hole 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.750
 what would it be handmade they 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.479
 mechanical as is done in others 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 edging like a house chops us very this 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.750
 liked we turned your company 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.020
 already with what order we wanted 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.720
 build a house long thought sizes 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.320
 mean about plans here we come late 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.770
 Whose ends do we need a square 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.220
 durable 6 walls about 9 in size 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.939
 9 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.920
 mihailovich issued his proposals 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.619
 their deed processed with his 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 by architects and exit specialists 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.549
 It turned out such a project is good 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.540
 Well, the first stage is pouring 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.149
 foundation 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.280
 it was a yanagi i would say very 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.580
 qualitatively 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.820
 what is great he made us the foundation 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.240
 so durable and later it already worked us 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.909
 on to the spatula of the house and painting and also 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.720
 very pleased with the work of the master 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:09.440
 the head of the other stages took place without 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.959
 us here is the assembly of the house itself we are not 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.050
 attended this assembly and we 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:19.610
 took it from photographs without coming 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.370
 Well here I would say that this is the company 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.220
 what is characteristic of it is that you can even 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.510
 and do not come to take a photo session 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.660
 that is, do in good faith honestly 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.090
 qualitatively 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.780
 yes that's compared to other companies 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.340
 where we were driving watched their work 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.970
 here, of course, quality 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.670
 a level higher you know than others 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.280
 companies with people can be trusted to work and 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.989
 they will do well but as for 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.120
 Value for money I think of how 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.180
 times here your company chose from you in 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.239
 the middle exactly got here as they say 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.790
 in the bull's eye in this regard 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.430
 Well, of course there were some 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.230
 small enough weather well with you 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.290
 said last year the rain 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.940
 half summer lily therefore dates 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.099
 really could not stand st but in 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.260
 In principle, it is tolerable. 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.220
 transfer were claims when accepting there 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.400
 in some places 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.730
 the demise of the work on the little things but right there 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.390
 with me it was all an example all guys 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.910
 all fixed and in principle at the exit 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.239
 the way to his son is what we wanted to see 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.610
 this is what you are designing but i'm so 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.239
 I will say if you want to build it 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.790
 quality is how we need a 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.420
 we built it to live there and 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.299
 winter come or the same if you want 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.120
 it can bear here such nuances are not 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.609
 I liked the general situation in the company 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.150
 Firstly, I understand it is iron 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.470
 discipline is very clear such 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:04.319
 observed subordination 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:06.150
 and among the workers and the relations of the higher 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.680
 with the subordinate that is, I watched 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:14.639
 craftsmen and workers are very kindhearted 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.680
 such a relationship and well, I would say 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.829
 do these people kindness 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.470
 with kindness it is very nice it is captivating 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.540
 For all the time of construction, I have never 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.600
 saw 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.550
 Well, just cases of violation there 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.640
 disciplines of some use 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.880
 liquor nothing that's what i 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.550
 like the discipline are wonderful then 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.860
 the guys lived in their own house and after 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.770
 all cleaned themselves up clean boyfriend left 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.780
 life as if no one was if you 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.320
 really want to build your 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.410
 a dream 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.100
 then turn wooden then you and 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.100
 to build
