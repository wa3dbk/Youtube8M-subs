00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.850
 on girls 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.010
 Today I'll show you how I do it. 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.289
 to take a bunch of magazine 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.370
 I'm going to show you what I use and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.610
 How do I shoot? 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.519
 so do the following I put the sheet 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.650
 on the table not even to put the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.929
 role that the team needs to take the mold 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.890
 or using a wallet he had in 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.920
 played 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.760
 I caught her blade is plentiful but can be 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.520
 paper kraft paper have have a role 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.300
 own to take the modeling more this 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.489
 Do you have home paper at the end of the purchase? 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.039
 You were wrong to play outside. 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.000
 so I have this reel that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.090
 primer 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.289
 she has the teeth you can 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.930
 and she does not need to draw with the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.550
 pen or mold 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.110
 in case you do not have to take them out 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.840
 You take a pen without load is always 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.570
 Running and passing like this will mark 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.689
 the place will come out the other side and it will not 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.070
 be drawing your world tour as is 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.100
 so the next the magazine is coming 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.710
 directing the pieces that I need 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 I already took a part that I needed 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.189
 needed 31 32 and 33 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.829
 I'm going to take 32 for you. 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.240
 side is help is continued with two 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.299
 little dots 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.420
 here on this side, do not look at the magazine 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:46.159
 It is written where you need my 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:51.780
 leaf one and I need 32 mode to stay 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:55.290
 here comes directing arrive 3332 for 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.850
 here I am going to find the direction where it is 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.790
 Mine at 36 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:06.259
 I come here more or less water and almost 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.259
 in the same line of drawing you need 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:18.710
 it begins the year 3332 we use 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:32.070
 32 Here I go where I'm going to go 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:34.590
 is to put on paper I use 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.540
 marble and monique you may have buy 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.540
 a few round changes I had 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:52.740
 despite the excellent value and the piece 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:03:03.390
 32 is little 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:05.970
 I'm going to take it and cut it to make the 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.980
 well enough to look across the 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.850
 my role is probably not going to me 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.950
 show you guys but you can see 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.519
 in the ways people have some 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.459
 comes 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.580
 marks all because it will bend where 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.860
 will fit in and not have I do 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.410
 small bikinis pikes 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.170
 This gives a direction to Quito where you 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.200
 will join one piece with the other what 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.910
 you have to do is everything you want and 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.170
 have a child, we can never 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:41.880
 forget to take the child from piece to piece 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.220
 will give you direction decide if profile is 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.830
 because it is finite right? 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.850
 if he was injured strip too but it is written 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.400
 in beauty 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.500
 here I have already done all the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.950
 notifications from time to time 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:01.310
 forget the tiredness can not identify 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.310
 again and I'm going to cut do not you know 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:24.900
 there's a lot here that needed a 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.760
 continuity in the city perhaps the point 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.150
 it's everything but 2015 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.160
 op 15 to 1 that has the little scratch here in the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.220
 I checked the edge I'll do pix 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.410
 because there later when you speak 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.890
 the network in the journal join a piece the 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.190
 another to bend it or come here it already gives you 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:47.690
 one direction a child must have a 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.000
 Son, it's just you take off this clothes 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:05:04.730
 I'll do a teaching video later. 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:06.960
 the myophilus part 32 may also 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.790
 my party 32 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.200
 I like to write everything that writes to 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.400
 magazine 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.440
 ah ah ah the piece the modeling up the cover 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.580
 I write because I put everything in 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.770
 in a folder 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.660
 at the time you need to where you are and 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.000
 Wherever they went far away 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.250
 I hope you have enjoyed it later. 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.050
 I 'll post the staff video is a 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.060
 Most people request has a little bit 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.730
 no time but I'm going to make for fear 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.730
 which is putting instead in the bra 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.830
 Okay, kiss. I hope you like that.
