an experimental VR mode is available to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.819 
an experimental VR mode is available to
test<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.369> race<00:00:17.669> from<00:00:17.939> racing<00:00:18.449> experience<00:00:18.829> I've

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:19.829 
test in race from racing experience I've

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.979 
test in race from racing experience I've
had<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.070> details<00:00:20.610> on<00:00:20.789> how<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:20.970> do<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:21.989 
had a details on how to do this in the

had a details on how to do this in the
description<00:00:22.680> below<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.820> little<00:00:24.060> unstable

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
description below it's a little unstable

description below it's a little unstable
at<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> moment<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> very<00:00:26.310> brief

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
at the moment so this is a very brief

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.680 
at the moment so this is a very brief
look<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.449> first<00:00:27.779> impressions

I<00:00:29.750> can't<00:00:30.380> seem<00:00:30.620> to<00:00:30.740> get<00:00:30.860> the<00:00:31.010> instrument

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
I can't seem to get the instrument

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
panels to work as I was having to guess

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.010 
panels to work as I was having to guess
what<00:00:33.950> Garrow<00:00:34.250> is<00:00:34.490> in<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.300> in<00:00:35.450> terms<00:00:35.660> of<00:00:35.840> the

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
what Garrow is in but in terms of the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.800 
what Garrow is in but in terms of the
actual<00:00:36.230> VR<00:00:36.830> implementation<00:00:37.790> it<00:00:38.150> seems<00:00:38.450> really

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
actual VR implementation it seems really

actual VR implementation it seems really
solid<00:00:39.430> tracking<00:00:40.430> seems<00:00:40.700> excellent<00:00:41.300> both

rotational<00:00:42.470> and<00:00:42.620> positional<00:00:43.250> they've<00:00:43.670> got

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
rotational and positional they've got

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.540 
rotational and positional they've got
low<00:00:44.150> persistence<00:00:44.810> and<00:00:45.050> chromatic<00:00:45.650> aberration

all<00:00:51.500> working<00:00:51.920> very<00:00:52.100> nicely<00:00:52.190> already<00:00:52.879> I'd<00:00:53.390> say

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
all working very nicely already I'd say

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:05.130 
all working very nicely already I'd say
it's<00:00:53.720> pretty<00:00:53.960> comparable<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:55.010> live<00:00:55.220> for<00:00:55.400> speed

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.960 

there<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:05.830> one<00:01:06.040> issue<00:01:06.220> with<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.790> arm

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
there is one issue with the arm

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
from the center for stopping if you

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.530 
from the center for stopping if you
disable<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.950> arms<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.550> wheel<00:01:12.729> will<00:01:13.060> rotate

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
disable the arms the wheel will rotate

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.719 
disable the arms the wheel will rotate
beyond<00:01:13.869> 90<00:01:14.350> but<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.040> doesn't<00:01:15.340> feel<00:01:15.580> that

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
beyond 90 but it doesn't feel that

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.609 
beyond 90 but it doesn't feel that
comfortable<00:01:16.180> when<00:01:16.479> your<00:01:16.630> body<00:01:16.900> seems<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.440> be

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
comfortable when your body seems to be

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.740 
comfortable when your body seems to be
invisible<00:01:17.890> I'm<00:01:18.880> expecting<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.600> be<00:01:19.630> a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
invisible I'm expecting it to be a

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.990 
invisible I'm expecting it to be a
problem<00:01:20.020> with<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.380> racing<00:01:20.920> as<00:01:21.040> well<00:01:21.250> as<00:01:21.460> their

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
problem with I racing as well as their

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.880 
problem with I racing as well as their
arm<00:01:22.210> animation<00:01:22.750> also<00:01:23.110> stocks<00:01:23.410> beyond<00:01:23.770> a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
arm animation also stocks beyond a

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.580 
arm animation also stocks beyond a
quarter<00:01:24.250> turn<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:25.570> not<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.840> massive<00:01:26.380> issue

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
quarter turn it's not a massive issue

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.190 
quarter turn it's not a massive issue
but<00:01:27.009> something<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.150> hope<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.690> developers

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
but something that I hope the developers

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:40.780 
but something that I hope the developers
are<00:01:29.380> aware<00:01:29.650> of

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.270 

apart<00:01:41.480> from<00:01:41.660> that<00:01:41.750> VR<00:01:42.230> is<00:01:42.440> absolutely<00:01:43.040> amazing

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
apart from that VR is absolutely amazing

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.700 
apart from that VR is absolutely amazing
as<00:01:43.640> usual<00:01:43.850> for<00:01:44.120> instance<00:01:44.690> it<00:01:45.320> lets<00:01:45.560> you

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
as usual for instance it lets you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.920 
as usual for instance it lets you
appreciate<00:01:46.310> some<00:01:46.670> of<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.940> interior<00:01:47.510> modeling

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
appreciate some of the interior modeling

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.870 
appreciate some of the interior modeling
that<00:01:48.110> you'd<00:01:48.320> otherwise<00:01:48.590> miss<00:01:49.010> like<00:01:49.640> this

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
that you'd otherwise miss like this

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.910 
that you'd otherwise miss like this
switch<00:01:50.150> up<00:01:50.360> here<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:51.290> might<00:01:51.500> look<00:01:51.650> pretty

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
switch up here it might look pretty

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.010 
switch up here it might look pretty
strange<00:01:52.220> on<00:01:52.670> video<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:53.660> stuff<00:01:53.870> is

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
strange on video but this stuff is

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:05.890 
strange on video but this stuff is
fascinating<00:01:54.770> in<00:01:54.890> person

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.040 

the<00:02:06.500> replays<00:02:06.890> are<00:02:07.100> going<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.340> be<00:02:07.460> great<00:02:07.670> fun<00:02:07.880> to

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
the replays are going to be great fun to

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.540 
the replays are going to be great fun to
these<00:02:09.050> wide<00:02:09.320> angle<00:02:09.680> shots<00:02:09.920> are<00:02:10.070> incredible

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
these wide angle shots are incredible

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.060 
these wide angle shots are incredible
mountains<00:02:11.510> look<00:02:11.720> enormous<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.530> this<00:02:12.650> fantasy

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
mountains look enormous and this fantasy

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.730 
mountains look enormous and this fantasy
track<00:02:13.430> suddenly<00:02:13.910> feels<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.270> lot<00:02:14.420> more<00:02:14.600> real<00:02:14.840> as

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
track suddenly feels a lot more real as

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.500 
track suddenly feels a lot more real as
always<00:02:16.070> it's<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.430> sense<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.820> scale<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.450> is

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
always it's a sense of scale that is

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:30.940 
always it's a sense of scale that is
really<00:02:17.960> impressive

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.800 

being<00:02:31.950> able<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.370> freely<00:02:32.760> look<00:02:33.060> around<00:02:33.420> using

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
being able to freely look around using

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.660 
being able to freely look around using
the<00:02:34.050> replay<00:02:34.410> cameras<00:02:34.860> there's<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.100> lot<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.310> fun

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
the replay cameras there's a lot of fun

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.550 
the replay cameras there's a lot of fun
but<00:02:35.880> there's<00:02:36.240> too<00:02:36.420> many<00:02:36.540> tracking<00:02:37.080> shots<00:02:37.380> at

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
but there's too many tracking shots at

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.380 
but there's too many tracking shots at
the<00:02:37.650> moment<00:02:38.010> which<00:02:38.340> can<00:02:38.580> make<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.940> feel<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> bit

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
the moment which can make you feel a bit

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.510 
the moment which can make you feel a bit
sick<00:02:39.690> as<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:39.960> keeps<00:02:40.380> wanting<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.860> take<00:02:41.160> control

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
sick as it keeps wanting to take control

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.240 
sick as it keeps wanting to take control
of<00:02:41.670> where<00:02:42.000> you're<00:02:42.120> looking<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.920> hope<00:02:43.920> they<00:02:44.070> can

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
of where you're looking I hope they can

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.980 
of where you're looking I hope they can
add<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> bunch<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.880> static<00:02:45.180> cameras<00:02:45.780> from
