00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.630 

so<00:00:55.220> so<00:00:55.490> this<00:00:55.640> is<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:56.590> obviously<00:00:57.640> string

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
so so this is a obviously string

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.560 
so so this is a obviously string
skipping<00:00:58.840> lick<00:00:59.840> and<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:02.000> interesting

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
skipping lick and the the interesting

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.689 
skipping lick and the the interesting
thing<00:01:02.810> if<00:01:03.410> you<00:01:03.620> can<00:01:03.830> call<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.010> interesting

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
thing if you can call that interesting

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.890 
thing if you can call that interesting
about<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.690> is<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.250> I<00:01:07.250> actually<00:01:07.610> pick<00:01:08.300> all<00:01:08.570> the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
about it is that I actually pick all the

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.810 
about it is that I actually pick all the
notes<00:01:09.110> in<00:01:10.690> which<00:01:11.690> most<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.330> popular

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
notes in which most of the popular

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.030 
notes in which most of the popular
string<00:01:16.820> skipping<00:01:16.970> licks<00:01:17.360> are<00:01:17.840> not<00:01:18.229> in<00:01:18.650> many

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
string skipping licks are not in many

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.310 
string skipping licks are not in many
cases<00:01:19.130> they<00:01:19.729> are<00:01:19.760> a<00:01:20.240> combination<00:01:20.780> of

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
cases they are a combination of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.450 
cases they are a combination of
alternate<00:01:22.070> picking

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
alternate picking

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.969 
alternate picking
combined<00:01:22.940> with<00:01:23.150> legato<00:01:24.050> which<00:01:24.350> is<00:01:24.500> very<00:01:24.740> a

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
combined with legato which is very a

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.100 
combined with legato which is very a
very<00:01:25.100> cool<00:01:25.550> way<00:01:25.760> a<00:01:25.790> very<00:01:26.030> nice<00:01:26.300> sound<00:01:26.630> and

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
very cool way a very nice sound and

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.100 
very cool way a very nice sound and
makes<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:27.860> easier<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:29.270> do<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.750> skips

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
makes it easier to to do the skips

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.760 
makes it easier to to do the skips
without<00:01:30.770> missing<00:01:31.250> notes<00:01:32.320> one<00:01:33.320> of<00:01:33.410> my<00:01:33.530> picking

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
without missing notes one of my picking

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.740 
without missing notes one of my picking
inspirations<00:01:34.580> for<00:01:34.820> something<00:01:35.300> like<00:01:35.420> this<00:01:35.509> was

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
inspirations for something like this was

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.810 
inspirations for something like this was
of<00:01:35.930> of<00:01:36.830> course<00:01:37.100> Paul<00:01:37.430> Gilbert<00:01:39.100> but<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.729> he

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
of of course Paul Gilbert but and he

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.180 
of of course Paul Gilbert but and he
does<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.149> in<00:01:41.240> another<00:01:41.450> way<00:01:41.660> and<00:01:42.050> which<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:42.770> also

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
does it in another way and which is also

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.359 
does it in another way and which is also
very<00:01:43.399> cool<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.880> sounds<00:01:44.450> awesome<00:01:44.660> but<00:01:44.990> I<00:01:45.950> just

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
very cool and sounds awesome but I just

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.690 
very cool and sounds awesome but I just
I<00:01:46.759> just<00:01:47.090> think<00:01:47.750> it<00:01:47.810> feels<00:01:47.990> good<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.470> pick<00:01:49.460> all

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
I just think it feels good to pick all

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.150 
I just think it feels good to pick all
the<00:01:49.850> notes<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:50.960> actually<00:01:51.470> does<00:01:51.619> not<00:01:51.830> make<00:01:52.039> it

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
the notes this actually does not make it

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.580 
the notes this actually does not make it
easier<00:01:52.460> but<00:01:52.520> quite<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.539> bit<00:01:53.990> harder<00:01:54.410> because

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
easier but quite a bit harder because

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.289 
easier but quite a bit harder because
you<00:01:55.100> have<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.310> be<00:01:55.580> quicker<00:01:55.940> with<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.539> pick<00:01:58.299> in

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
you have to be quicker with the pick in

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.260 
you have to be quicker with the pick in
in<00:01:59.479> order<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.960> pull<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.710> notes<00:02:00.920> off<00:02:01.159> at<00:02:02.060> the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
in order to pull the notes off at the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.590 
in order to pull the notes off at the
right<00:02:02.450> time<00:02:02.780> without<00:02:03.020> getting<00:02:03.760> too<00:02:04.760> long<00:02:05.119> of<00:02:05.450> a

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
right time without getting too long of a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.120 
right time without getting too long of a
break<00:02:05.630> between<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:07.570> patterns<00:02:08.739> so<00:02:09.739> what<00:02:09.950> I<00:02:09.979> do

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
break between the patterns so what I do

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.949 
break between the patterns so what I do
is<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:10.429> just<00:02:10.540> kick<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.660> off<00:02:11.810> with<00:02:12.790> down<00:02:13.790> up<00:02:14.180> down

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
is I just kick it off with down up down

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.320 
is I just kick it off with down up down
obviously<00:02:15.709> here<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.250> go<00:02:16.760> from<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> g

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
obviously here and I go from the g

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.780 
obviously here and I go from the g
string<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.900> high<00:02:18.380> E<00:02:18.410> string<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.610> go

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
string to the high E string and I go

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.360 
string to the high E string and I go
down<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.299> D<00:02:20.480> string<00:02:20.540> after<00:02:21.019> this<00:02:21.200> back<00:02:22.160> to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
down to the D string after this back to

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
down to the D string after this back to
the<00:02:22.489> e<00:02:22.519> so<00:02:23.799> my<00:02:24.799> pedal<00:02:25.130> point<00:02:25.310> pretty<00:02:25.850> much<00:02:26.000> is

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
the e so my pedal point pretty much is

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.440 
the e so my pedal point pretty much is
the<00:02:26.600> high<00:02:26.780> E<00:02:26.810> string<00:02:26.959> at<00:02:27.350> all<00:02:27.470> times<00:02:28.450> through

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
the high E string at all times through

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.110 
the high E string at all times through
the<00:02:29.540> D<00:02:29.720> string<00:02:29.930> back<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.650> high<00:02:30.920> e<00:02:30.980> down<00:02:31.910> to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
the D string back to the high e down to

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.190 
the D string back to the high e down to
the<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.239> string<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:35.090> actually<00:02:35.269> play<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.959> the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
the a string and I actually play to the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.840 
the a string and I actually play to the
most<00:02:36.410> extreme<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.799> play<00:02:37.040> from<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.459> high<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
most extreme a play from the high to the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.569 
most extreme a play from the high to the
low<00:02:37.970> E<00:02:38.120> string<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.310> quite

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
low E string so so it's quite

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.540 
low E string so so it's quite
challenging

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.980 

so<00:02:45.760> from<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.090> a-string<00:02:46.390> backs<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.840> high<00:02:46.960> e

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
so from the a-string backs of the high e

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.100 
so from the a-string backs of the high e
string<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.070> g<00:02:48.220> string<00:02:48.460> again<00:02:48.750> d<00:02:49.750> string

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
string to the g string again d string

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.670 
string to the g string again d string
high<00:02:50.980> e<00:02:51.010> string<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.700> string<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.810> then<00:02:53.290> i<00:02:53.350> go<00:02:53.500> hop

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
high e string a string and then i go hop

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.920 
high e string a string and then i go hop
up<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.040> high<00:02:54.310> e<00:02:54.340> string<00:02:54.520> here<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.240> i<00:02:55.780> go

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
up to the high e string here and i go

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.530 
up to the high e string here and i go
down<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.410> low<00:02:56.530> E<00:02:56.560> string<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.250> back<00:02:58.150> up<00:02:58.390> to

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
down to the low E string and back up to

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.910 
down to the low E string and back up to
the<00:02:58.630> high<00:02:58.780> E<00:02:58.810> string<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.320> then<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.470> just<00:02:59.680> play

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
the high E string and then I just play

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.840 
the high E string and then I just play
the<00:03:00.130> harmonic<00:03:01.030> minor<00:03:02.370> seventh<00:03:03.370> position<00:03:05.850> this

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
the harmonic minor seventh position this

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.420 
the harmonic minor seventh position this
is<00:03:07.030> such<00:03:07.210> just<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:08.530> be<00:03:08.650> honest<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.190> just

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
is such just to be honest this is just

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.680 
is such just to be honest this is just
something<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.820> play<00:03:10.000> because<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:10.360> think<00:03:10.420> it's

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
something I play because I think it's

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.150 
something I play because I think it's
fun<00:03:10.870> it's<00:03:11.050> not<00:03:11.200> really<00:03:11.560> something<00:03:11.770> that<00:03:11.980> I

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
would use in my own playing but by all

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.550 
would use in my own playing but by all
means<00:03:14.800> try<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.820> work<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.270> into<00:03:16.420> your<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:17.410> your

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
means try to work it into your to your

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.190 
means try to work it into your to your
playing<00:03:17.770> if<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.240> prefer<00:03:19.240> that<00:03:21.420> this<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.690> the

playing if you prefer that this is the
third<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:24.340> second<00:03:24.700> position<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.270> the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
third the second position of the

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.040 
third the second position of the
harmonic<00:03:26.140> minor<00:03:26.260> scale<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.720> if<00:03:29.020> you

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
harmonic minor scale so so you if you

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.380 
harmonic minor scale so so you if you
wanted<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:29.500> use<00:03:29.710> something<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.390> something

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
wanted to use something in something

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.730 
wanted to use something in something
like<00:03:31.510> this<00:03:31.660> in<00:03:31.900> your<00:03:31.930> playing<00:03:32.260> in<00:03:32.590> your

like this in your playing in your

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:40.970 
like this in your playing in your
improvising<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:38.470> then<00:03:39.280> from<00:03:39.460> there<00:03:39.640> just

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
improvising and then from there just

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.250 
improvising and then from there just
played<00:03:41.980> from<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.310> g<00:03:42.940> string<00:03:43.210> and<00:03:43.360> in<00:03:44.020> the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
played from the g string and in the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.920 
played from the g string and in the
second<00:03:44.710> position<00:03:45.070> of<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.280> harmonic<00:03:45.610> minor

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
second position of the harmonic minor

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.780 
second position of the harmonic minor
and<00:03:46.930> good<00:03:47.170> luck<00:03:47.320> with<00:03:47.530> that
