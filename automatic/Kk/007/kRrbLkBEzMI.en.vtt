00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.110
 hello that such friends as they are today we are going 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.530
 to cook a corn soup and 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.639
 ingredients that we will need are 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.450
 golden corn 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.810
 that can be achieved in canning 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.000
 a little milk 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.750
 We're going to need some oil 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 baked olive oil for soup a 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.180
 little butter 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.490
 garlic and onion and finally a little bit of 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.250
 salt what we are going to do is start 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.790
 liquefy our ingredients in a 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.010
 blender 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.700
 now the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.520
 liquefy are 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.350
 the onion our clove of garlic we are going to 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.350
 add all our boat 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.180
 let's add 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.180
 to our milk 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.329
 and finally a little salt that this one already 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.329
 it will be to taste 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:07.770
 all these ingredients we are going to liquefy 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.420
 to make our themes 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.729
 here we already have all our 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.810
 perfectly liquefied ingredients 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.200
 now what we are going to do 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.810
 a saucepan have it hot for 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.790
 add a little butter and start 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.710
 to cook our cream 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.880
 here we have our pan 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:33.700
 hot let's add our 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.700
 butter and we're going to melt it 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.050
 in this case as it is a bit of 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.230
 butter I'm going to remove it 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.340
 and we're going to cook everything at temperature 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.009
 high 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.649
 let's hope it gets a little hot 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.850
 our butter and when you're 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:01.450
 starting to burn slightly let's 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.149
 add our cream as I had them 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.460
 said at high temperature since that's going to 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.649
 avoid being cut in our cream 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.210
 here is already heating up our 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.990
 Butter 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:18.480
 we wait a few seconds 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.480
 and we add our cream at once 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.790
 here 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.920
 we're going to move it and we're going to let 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.920
 go expressing little by little 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.530
 here our soup must be 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.989
 moving constantly since this is 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.750
 It can hit us, it can burn us 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:48.150
 so you have to do it continuously 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.250
 at one minute intervals so that it does not 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.200
 is going to stick all this we're going to 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.959
 make at high temperature 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.959
 so that he expresses little by little 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.180
 here already our soup is already 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.900
 and go see our cream is already 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.430
 boiling here there is not much problem 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.850
 or so much risk that it sticks 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.990
 our cream but I recommend you 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.330
 we keep moving it just a little 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.910
 to see if we get to hit or not 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.670
 I get to burn 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.680
 here as we can see we already have list 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.050
 our cream is already literally 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.600
 thick what we're going to do is turn it off 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.850
 so that it is no longer consumed and not 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.780
 express so much here I recommend them 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.780
 before 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.250
 add our liquefied directly to 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.269
 the pan you can strain our 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.490
 the smoothie so they have a more cream 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.400
 clarified in this case I what 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.260
 I pour it directly without going through 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.230
 a colander 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.780
 here you can see perfectly the 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.780
 corn cob 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.180
 but if you do not want to see the corn 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.160
 you can pass it before by a colander and 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.920
 then start pressing the cream 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:18.019
 now we have our subject we are going to 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.019
 fry some of our cookies 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.660
 now let's open a little of our 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.150
 baked cookies we're going to add a 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.590
 some olive oil 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.590
 to give it a little more flavor 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.870
 let's see our 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.770
 and let it fry lightly 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.650
 have a slightly more golden color of 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.230
 that they already have now we are going to go 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.750
 watching we are going to go 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.070
 turning to leave cooking 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.070
 all uniformly 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.600
 here we have our 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.550
 cookies already a little more golden what 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.320
 let's do is turn them off and reserve 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.920
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.230
 plate our saucer 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.480
 and good friends here we have a list 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.210
 our cream is already perfectly 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.870
 cooked at the end we added a little 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.000
 of our recipes that have already been 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.760
 passed by a little olive oil 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.980
 to give it more flavor and good 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.590
