00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.120 
flier magazine today we're doing an
engine<00:00:06.990> test<00:00:07.200> review<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.519> new<00:00:08.670> Y<00:00:08.970> s<00:00:09.240> FZ<00:00:10.130> 115

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
engine test review of the new Y s FZ 115

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.330 
engine test review of the new Y s FZ 115
s<00:00:12.019> this<00:00:13.019> engine<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.799> an<00:00:13.920> increased

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
s this engine is an increased

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.420 
s this engine is an increased
displacement<00:00:14.730> version<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.020> previous<00:00:16.430> 110

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
displacement version of the previous 110

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.560 
displacement version of the previous 110
s<00:00:18.560> so<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.980> run-up<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:20.939> going<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.270> with<00:00:21.420> an
