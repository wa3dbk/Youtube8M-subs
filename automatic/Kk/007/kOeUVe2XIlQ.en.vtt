because it's very hot and then I'll let

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.610 
because it's very hot and then I'll let
you<00:02:35.360> know<00:02:35.540> what<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.750> tastes<00:02:35.930> like<00:02:38.290> hey<00:02:39.290> Ted

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
you know what it tastes like hey Ted

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.050 
you know what it tastes like hey Ted
time<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.950> cool<00:02:40.130> wall<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.730> I'm<00:02:40.790> gonna<00:02:40.880> take<00:02:41.000> a

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
time to cool wall so I'm gonna take a

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.630 
time to cool wall so I'm gonna take a
bite<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.270> it<00:02:44.830> all<00:02:45.830> but<00:02:46.010> it's<00:02:46.130> basically<00:02:46.520> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
bite of it all but it's basically the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:57.250 
bite of it all but it's basically the
same

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.160 

it<00:02:58.260> definitely<00:02:58.440> has<00:02:58.740> more<00:02:58.890> flavor<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.370> them

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
it definitely has more flavor of them

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.570 
it definitely has more flavor of them
the<00:03:01.170> first<00:03:01.350> two<00:03:01.620> had<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.920> bacon<00:03:02.250> one<00:03:02.370> was<00:03:02.550> very

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
the first two had the bacon one was very

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.640 
the first two had the bacon one was very
disappointing<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.660> had<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:04.080> was

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
disappointing it really had I was

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.290 
disappointing it really had I was
expecting<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.070> really<00:03:05.250> good<00:03:05.400> smoky<00:03:05.820> bacon<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.240> I

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
expecting a really good smoky bacon so I

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.550 
expecting a really good smoky bacon so I
had<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.660> little<00:03:06.780> bit<00:03:06.960> of<00:03:06.990> bacon<00:03:07.200> flavor<00:03:07.350> but<00:03:07.530> not

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
had a little bit of bacon flavor but not

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.490 
had a little bit of bacon flavor but not
very<00:03:07.800> strong<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.750> egg<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.080> cheese<00:03:10.200> was<00:03:10.470> a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
very strong the egg and cheese was a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.410 
very strong the egg and cheese was a
joke<00:03:10.920> we<00:03:11.130> might<00:03:11.310> as<00:03:11.370> well<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.940> night<00:03:12.090> had

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
joke we might as well that night had

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.120 
joke we might as well that night had
that<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.900> egg<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.200> cheese<00:03:13.380> was<00:03:13.680> completely

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
that the egg and cheese was completely

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.590 
that the egg and cheese was completely
ridiculous<00:03:14.490> because<00:03:14.760> all<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.000> could<00:03:15.120> taste<00:03:15.390> was

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
ridiculous because all I could taste was

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.590 
ridiculous because all I could taste was
the<00:03:15.750> bread<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:17.670> though<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.120> sausage<00:03:18.480> is

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
the bread this though the sausage is

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.540 
the bread this though the sausage is
much<00:03:18.810> stronger<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.590> it's<00:03:19.770> it's<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.190> little<00:03:20.220> more

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
much stronger so it's it's a little more

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.240 
much stronger so it's it's a little more
flavorful<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:22.050> sausage<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.560> not<00:03:22.710> bad<00:03:22.950> it's

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
flavorful the sausage is not bad it's

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.160 
flavorful the sausage is not bad it's
still<00:03:23.459> not<00:03:23.580> great<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.180> don't<00:03:24.420> like<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.750> maple

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
still not great I don't like that maple

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.980 
still not great I don't like that maple
flavor<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:26.190> fake<00:03:26.430> maple<00:03:26.820> flavor<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.720> in

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
flavor that fake maple flavor in the in

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.940 
flavor that fake maple flavor in the in
the<00:03:28.140> bread<00:03:28.350> but<00:03:29.070> um<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.930> one's<00:03:31.140> not<00:03:31.380> horrible

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
the bread but um this one's not horrible

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.070 
the bread but um this one's not horrible
I<00:03:32.610> think<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.120> gave<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.390> other<00:03:33.480> one<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.870> last

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
I think I gave the other one the last

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.949 
I think I gave the other one the last
one<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.290> know<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.530> gave<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:35.660> this<00:03:36.660> one<00:03:36.840> I'd

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
one I know I gave it to this one I'd

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.570 
one I know I gave it to this one I'd
give<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> three<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.590> would<00:03:37.800> get<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.220> if<00:03:38.310> somebody

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
give a three I would get it if somebody

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.820 
give a three I would get it if somebody
were<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.790> buy<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.330> would<00:03:39.510> eat<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.870> but<00:03:40.440> I

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830
