00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.440
 in one of the interviews ga diomid designer 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.660
 responsible for the appearance with belt 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.059
 for said that wearable device should 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.700
 look good enough for you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.560
 wanted to wear it even if there is no inside 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.720
 no electronics these words are more than 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.850
 applicable to this bracelet here 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.670
 tracks your physical activity and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.740
 sleep quality with fitbit sensors 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.470
 force looks nice 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.480
 at the same time stylish and not catchy excellent 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.969
 sits on hand the device is sold on 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.610
 official website for $ 129 and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.120
 Available in two colors black and sulfur 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.559
 blue as we should note that he 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.660
 created not for professional 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.030
 athletes but rather the opposite for 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.219
 ordinary people who want supports 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.050
 even I never really fit 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.000
 fond of sports now always 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.070
 I look how much this stepped in a day and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.870
 if possible, trying to build up 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.760
 bracelet looks like another 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.010
 model company Fitbit flex 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.110
 however, there is a small oled display 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.850
 on it, except for the time you can see 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.250
 number of steps taken per day 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.200
 mileage calories burned approximate 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.180
 the number of floors that went up 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.950
 so-called active minutes and 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.439
 closest alarm clock all navigation 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 performed by the sole 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.759
 buttons active minutes this is the time in 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.470
 during which you, for example, ran 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.630
 holding the button starts the stopwatch on 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.430
 In fact, it is not very convenient if necessary 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.290
 just have to track time 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.990
 adjust to the stopwatch 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.360
 kicked off during 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.310
 if any particular information 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.320
 you are most interested in the order and and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.280
 the display can be changed 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.530
 customize 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.509
 and display the time at the moment 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.789
 there are three not very different 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.280
 option is all set up on the site 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.860
 fitbit dot com in the same place are exposed and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.530
 other settings all data received 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.780
 available on the website as well as in the application 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.670
 they are very detailed are not interesting at all 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.350
 and before studying 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.420
 synchronized by forces on bluetooth 4.0 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.890
 with the mobile device or s.c. 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.319
 bluetooth receiver comes with 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.940
 list of supported android devices 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.510
 very small what really 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.190
 sad for more motivation on one of 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.230
 activity items can be set 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.420
 the bar to be overcome in 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.890
 during the day and as soon as you reached 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.140
 goals watch vibrate 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.900
 and when you first turn on show sweet 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.850
 the animation vibrates force and to 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.250
 wake you up when the alarm clock is set 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.350
 it all happens silently which is convenient 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.330
 when you live not alone and you are afraid to wake up 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.640
 loud phone call not only yourself 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.239
 at the same time I didnâ€™t exactly sleep 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.239
 will turn out 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.050
 unfortunately unlike jova he is about 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.920
 this bracelet does not know how to phase 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.750
 fast sleep 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.390
 but track its quality and then 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.370
 please show the device what you 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.380
 made it easier to turn on the stopwatch 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.630
 for the night or by selecting the appropriate 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.550
 point on the smartphone in principle, you can already 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.380
 and after sleep indicate when you were sleeping and 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.760
 see the statistics which I would not 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.890
 He said that it was very interesting except 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.750
 this service that provides fit 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.489
 bit to all its users allows 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.739
 track body weight amount 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.959
 water consumed and what and how much 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.180
 you eat but you have to enter all this 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.819
 manually therefore not sure that many 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.130
 ready to spend your time on this force 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.319
 do not have to often removed hands full 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.819
 the charge lasts more than a week to 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.290
 besides, they are protected from water 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.480
 although not swimming with them yet 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.220
 It is recommended to charge the bracelet with 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.019
 using a special cable included 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.090
 as a clock fitbit force not 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.920
 perfect account always press on 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.840
 a small button to look at 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.940
 time would be much more convenient for example 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.010
 knock on the clock so that they wake up 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.870
 strange that with the presence of all 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.730
 necessary accessory can not 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.410
 track coming on smartphone 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.959
 notice and this is extremely lacking 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.819
 however, the developers promise to add 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.760
 such an opportunity soon 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.620
 perhaps this is exactly what they need to 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.930
 to become really welcome because 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.209
 everything else fit the bit of force is excellent 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.890
 the gadget you really want to wear 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.019
 On the hand 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.700
 If you are still looking for a smart watch, that is 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.560
 pebble possessing much more 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.840
 impressive opportunities but also 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.880
 they look not so cool in my opinion 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.800
 But wishing to wear on hand in the first 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.900
 turn stylish accessory which when 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.039
 this is also useful in everyday life I advise 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.080
 look at force 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.340
 Is that waiting for when they finally 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.340
 learn how to display notifications 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.790
 the device gave us a store and 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.500
 cult. where you can get it 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.500
 but on this I have everything see you 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.760
 Inferno
