00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
I got it working so it holds it up

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.720 
I got it working so it holds it up
really<00:00:02.429> nicely<00:00:03.319> now<00:00:04.319> stop<00:00:04.650> there<00:00:05.370> it<00:00:05.549> is

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
really nicely now stop there it is

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.430 
really nicely now stop there it is
however<00:00:06.720> when<00:00:07.529> it<00:00:07.649> goes<00:00:07.830> down<00:00:09.019> you<00:00:10.019> can<00:00:10.230> see

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
however when it goes down you can see

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.710 
however when it goes down you can see
that<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.769> kind<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.070> jumps<00:00:13.040> crankin<00:00:17.600> and<00:00:18.600> I

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
that it kind of jumps crankin and I

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.570 
that it kind of jumps crankin and I
would<00:00:18.869> actually<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.500> get<00:00:19.650> start<00:00:20.340> doing

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
would actually have to get start doing

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.599 
would actually have to get start doing
undoing<00:00:20.910> myself<00:00:21.420> soon<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.980> that's<00:00:26.220> not

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
undoing myself soon so that's not

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.839 
undoing myself soon so that's not
exactly<00:00:27.000> right<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.070> hope<00:00:29.369> greasing<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
exactly right so I hope greasing the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.470 
exactly right so I hope greasing the
wiffle<00:00:30.179> tree<00:00:30.359> will<00:00:30.510> take<00:00:30.720> care<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:32.480> now

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
wiffle tree will take care of that now

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.229 
wiffle tree will take care of that now
to<00:00:33.540> grease<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.989> wiffle<00:00:34.290> tree<00:00:34.820> pretty<00:00:35.820> simple

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
to grease the wiffle tree pretty simple

turn those to make sure they're in there
working<00:01:55.080> what<00:01:56.080> I'm<00:01:56.140> going<00:01:56.289> to<00:01:56.320> do<00:01:56.410> is<00:01:56.500> I'm

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
working what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.080 
working what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.740> try<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:56.950> take<00:01:57.280> off<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.640> much<00:01:57.700> grease

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
going to try to take off as much grease

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:08.180 
going to try to take off as much grease
as<00:01:58.240> possible<00:02:02.039> so<00:02:03.039> I<00:02:03.070> can<00:02:03.100> put<00:02:03.340> new<00:02:03.490> grease<00:02:03.789> on

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.440 

now<00:02:08.700> here's<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.060> nice<00:02:09.240> clean<00:02:09.690> wiffle<00:02:10.230> tree<00:02:11.450> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
now here's a nice clean wiffle tree and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.900 
now here's a nice clean wiffle tree and
I<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.600> what<00:02:12.780> they<00:02:12.930> say<00:02:13.140> don't<00:02:13.500> move<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.370> like

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
I know what they say don't move it like

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.030 
I know what they say don't move it like
a<00:02:14.970> little<00:02:15.240> treat<00:02:15.570> cover<00:02:15.780> up<00:02:16.020> but<00:02:16.350> what<00:02:16.860> you're

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
a little treat cover up but what you're

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.650 
a little treat cover up but what you're
making<00:02:17.250> sure<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:17.970> doesn't<00:02:18.390> twist

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
making sure is that this doesn't twist

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.450 
making sure is that this doesn't twist
because<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.170> rides<00:02:19.470> either<00:02:19.770> on<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.010> top<00:02:20.220> plate

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
because it rides either on the top plate

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.040 
because it rides either on the top plate
for<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:20.910> or<00:02:21.060> most<00:02:21.210> often<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.750> bottom

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
for this one or most often on the bottom

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.950 
for this one or most often on the bottom
cover<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.670> move<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.210> be<00:02:24.540> careful

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
cover so you can move it just be careful

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.260 
cover so you can move it just be careful
that<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.200> won't<00:02:25.380> twist<00:02:25.830> around<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.430> only<00:02:27.090> move

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
that this won't twist around I only move

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.850 
that this won't twist around I only move
it<00:02:27.360> about<00:02:27.510> two<00:02:27.690> inches<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.380> get<00:02:28.530> down

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
it about two inches so I can get down

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.710
