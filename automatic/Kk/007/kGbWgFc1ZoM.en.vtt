00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.850
 hello how are you today I bring you a video 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.069
 about how to install windows phone 7 in 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.140
 your android phone first of all 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.300
 we have to go to our country store or 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.850
 android market let's go to our play 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.760
 store and then we will look for the 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.370
 application that is called launcher seven or 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:23.110
 launcher 7 that we look for in the magnifying glass 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.110
 and then launcher seven 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.070
 we come back good I come back and after 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.070
 we press launcher seven 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.160
 and then we are going to press 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.160
 install you know is the color icon 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.930
 green with a 7 after we will give 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.950
 accept and download 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.590
 and then keep buying 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.490
 Then, there, you start to download 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.900
 heavy 205 megabytes and above all 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.580
 is an application that really is worth the 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.100
 sorry as you can customize and all 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.320
 that and then actually this phone 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.200
 it is not that we say so of the most of the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.699
 better but if it runs perfectly 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.380
 application and agree with many 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.060
 fluency 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.900
 so if we approach there we can 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.520
 see that the icons are interchangeable 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.560
 and then really if we have a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.930
 phone that and it really is like that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.760
 type square, people will say that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.760
 really if it's a windows phone 7 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.869
 then it is said installing and everything 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.869
 that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.510
 and we wait a while 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.870
 good once you install the 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.870
 we open 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.660
 can you say that irrigation is very 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.550
 lend the buttons but as you will know in 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.730
 the screen is the size of my finger 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.730
 thumb 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.030
 it's quite uncomfortable and then here we have 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.580
 the configuration screen here 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.880
 We can put our icons according to the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.040
 applications for example where it says font 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.070
 there we are going to click 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.350
 sorry but I have a drunken pulse 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.620
 where it says frontal let's choose the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.410
 phone application is phone 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.350
 then our icon that says font 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.840
 then we will open the phone application 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.269
 which is quite 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.930
 not mandatory after browser 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.590
 obviously we are going to search 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.269
 or better said browser 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.510
 I do not know how they tell you if your browser has 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.519
 searched but browser is searched after 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.230
 here says browser we select it and 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.760
 then we continue with the others for 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.880
 example market because you know that is the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.970
 appstore 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.090
 or play store sorry in the app store no 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.200
 is 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.910
 play station and stanley store and well 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.660
 successively with the other icons 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.030
 then we give you create times 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.690
 and then after ok 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.550
 ok always always and then here we 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.020
 now our windows phone theme appears 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.060
 7 but do not get excited yet 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.030
 we finish to finish this process 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.350
 we have to crush the menu button the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.410
 button with which we always go to 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.300
 start menu and we get this tab 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.459
 but if it does not come to you then 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.120
 try everything with all the buttons 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.980
 that they have there 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.720
 and we select this one that says 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.239
 use by default 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.110
 we wash it we mark it and we express it 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.110
 launcher 7 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.350
 the one that is shaking my hand 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.870
 and then let's go to good and we have the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.250
 theme already installed and predetermined 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.340
 every time we learn and turn off the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.150
 phone our phone 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.610
 automatically know here we already have 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.960
 there our application or our theme 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.180
 with windows phone 7 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.740
 and now the good thing is to install the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.250
 widgets 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.370
 if these here are only going to give 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.990
 we will do it if the left and 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.500
 we have our applications installed 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.870
 as it would have a windows phone 7 but 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.960
 obviously not true but it is a subject 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.150
 then for example we choose recorder 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.130
 of sound we leave you pressed and we get 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.720
 he painted home screen that is to add the 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.549
 widget 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.739
 there are not different options available 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.350
 customization for example color of the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.920
 tile floor and they say it's not albur 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.550
 and then we go to once they set 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.210
 this we are going to click on to add 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.280
 tile 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.030
 and as you see below we already have our 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.370
 sound recorder 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.340
 so it's pretty easy to do this and 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.140
 really because it weighs nothing we see that it is 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.690
 a pretty old phone and we see that 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.610
 run all this with a fluency that 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.060
 it could even be compared with that of 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.130
 windows phone7 and they can add the 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.620
 number of widgets that they want for 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.480
 example I do not know about games and all that here 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.660
 and we come two as default 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.610
 the video and music then as 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.200
 this would be all I say goodbye I hope that 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.640
 you liked it and especially if you do not 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.190
 understood please please leave me your 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.310
 comments is really important this 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.110
 because they may fail something or do 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.760
 something wrong then then please 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.640
 leave the comments and above all 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.720
 that they subscribe and comment and it was until 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.720
 the next video goodbye
