 let's start taking better lateral and what 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:29.130
 divided in four I cross the strands of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.840
 center now I carry the locks of the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.840
 ends towards the center 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.500
 I cross these backwards and the others 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.870
 in front now the ones in front the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.530
 I will take to the center crossing the 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.530
 backward 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.900
 I add a lock of hair 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.490
 he stopped 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.130
 and left him in the middle 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.909
 and cross the strands back and 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.909
 vice versa 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.740
 we repeat again took a more lock 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:33.060
 just separated the strands from behind left 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.060
 the lock in the middle and we make the crossing 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.830
 m 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.190
 yes 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.740
 so we will keep repeating until we finish 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.020
 to weave the strands leaving you 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.590
 I recommend that you observe very well the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.590

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.760
 we will continue making Celtic knots 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.520
 with tufts more delgaditos the machado 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.550

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:40.210

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:42.280

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.139
