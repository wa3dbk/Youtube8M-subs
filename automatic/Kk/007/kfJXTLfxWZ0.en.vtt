00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
three different types just to get a feel

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.020 
three different types just to get a feel
of<00:00:46.530> each<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.160> become<00:00:47.399> proficient<00:00:47.700> with

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.440 
like 12 or 13 and I've found that i
liked<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.250> break<00:01:26.250> action<00:01:26.460> more<00:01:26.850> than<00:01:27.060> any<00:01:27.240> of

or<00:01:30.240> sorry<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.810> pump<00:01:31.079> not<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> semi-auto<00:01:31.860> but

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
or sorry the pump not the semi-auto but

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.859 
or sorry the pump not the semi-auto but
some<00:01:32.850> strengths<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.240> weaknesses<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.689> I

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
some strengths and weaknesses that I

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.200 
some strengths and weaknesses that I
should<00:01:34.020> lay<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.710> are<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
should lay out for you are that the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.480 
should lay out for you are that the
semi-auto<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.750> obviously<00:01:37.140> much<00:01:37.380> faster<00:01:37.979> but

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
semi-auto is obviously much faster but

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.569 
semi-auto is obviously much faster but
some<00:01:38.700> people<00:01:39.000> say<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:40.579> more

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
some people say that it's more

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.249 
some people say that it's more
unreliable<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.750> because<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.110> has<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
unreliable because that because it has a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.800 
unreliable because that because it has a
gas<00:01:43.820> blowback<00:01:44.820> system<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> little<00:01:45.540> bit<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
gas blowback system a little bit and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.490 
gas blowback system a little bit and
also<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.130> slightly<00:01:47.340> inertia<00:01:47.700> driven<00:01:48.500> if

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
also this is slightly inertia driven if

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.810 
also this is slightly inertia driven if
you<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> little<00:01:50.189> bit<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.430> gap<00:01:50.640> between

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
you have a little bit of a gap between

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.910 
you have a little bit of a gap between
the<00:01:51.119> stock<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.689> your<00:01:51.840> shoulder<00:01:52.259> when<00:01:52.470> you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the stock and your shoulder when you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.300 
the stock and your shoulder when you
shoot<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.820> bolt<00:01:54.479> will<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:55.079> come<00:01:55.950> back<00:01:56.100> all

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
shoot the bolt will not come back all

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.740 
shoot the bolt will not come back all
the<00:01:56.340> way<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.759> then<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> will<00:01:57.060> reach<00:01:57.210> amber<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the way and then it will reach amber the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.959 
the way and then it will reach amber the
empty<00:01:58.020> shell<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.649> could<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.009> problem<00:01:59.189> so

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
empty shell that could be a problem so

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.749 
empty shell that could be a problem so
that's<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.450> little<00:02:00.689> bit<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.930> unreliable

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
that's one little bit of unreliable

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.370 
that's one little bit of unreliable
unreliability<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> found<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.140> gun

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
unreliability that I found at the gun

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.100 
unreliability that I found at the gun
but<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.159> most<00:02:05.280> part<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.729> has<00:02:05.759> not<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
but for the most part it has not the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.619 
but for the most part it has not the
pump<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.500> said<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.550> very<00:02:08.729> reliable

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
pump is said to be very reliable

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.119 
pump is said to be very reliable
compared<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.110> semi-auto<00:02:10.530> because<00:02:10.890> you're

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
compared to semi-auto because you're

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.010 
compared to semi-auto because you're
just<00:02:11.730> cycling<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.209> action<00:02:12.510> your<00:02:12.660> cell

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
just cycling the action your cell

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.380 
just cycling the action your cell
and<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.770> just<00:02:13.920> pump<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.280> through<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.820> pump<00:02:15.300> it

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and you just pump it through and pump it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.750 
and you just pump it through and pump it
forward<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.900> that's<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.370> I've<00:02:17.370> had<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> couple

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
forward and that's it I've had a couple

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.920 
forward and that's it I've had a couple
problems<00:02:18.060> with<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.480> one<00:02:18.660> though<00:02:18.780> because

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
problems with this one though because

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.310 
problems with this one though because
the<00:02:19.170> ejector<00:02:20.630> doesn't<00:02:21.630> even<00:02:21.780> want<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.020> ject

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
the ejector doesn't even want to ject

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.900 
the ejector doesn't even want to ject
and<00:02:22.470> end<00:02:22.590> up<00:02:22.680> with<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.830> stovepipe<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.760> I've

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and end up with a stovepipe but I've

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.510 
and end up with a stovepipe but I've
cleaned<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.780> out<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.200> after<00:02:25.650> about<00:02:25.950> six<00:02:26.280> seven

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
cleaned it out and after about six seven

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.030 
cleaned it out and after about six seven
hundred<00:02:26.730> channels<00:02:26.880> it's<00:02:27.150> been<00:02:27.300> fine<00:02:27.860> but<00:02:28.860> it's

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
hundred channels it's been fine but it's

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.860 
hundred channels it's been fine but it's
it<00:02:29.610> really<00:02:29.970> doesn't<00:02:30.210> have<00:02:30.270> too<00:02:30.480> many<00:02:30.510> problems

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
it really doesn't have too many problems

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.480 
it really doesn't have too many problems
and<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.470> brake<00:02:31.650> actions<00:02:32.040> got<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.280> be<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.460> most

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
and the brake actions got to be the most

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.040 
and the brake actions got to be the most
reliable<00:02:32.850> here<00:02:33.240> if<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.390> just<00:02:33.480> break<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.930> open

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
reliable here if you just break it open

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.960 
reliable here if you just break it open
put<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.890> back<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.160> cut<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.520> know<00:02:35.610> like<00:02:35.790> break

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
put it back to cut you know like break

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.760 
put it back to cut you know like break
it<00:02:36.090> open<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.390> close<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.570> back<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:36.810> with<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.590> new

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
it open and close it back up with a new

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.860 
it open and close it back up with a new
shell<00:02:38.340> only<00:02:38.700> thing<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.300> hammer<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:39.720> get

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
shell only thing is the hammer can get

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.320 
shell only thing is the hammer can get
up<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.590> ejector<00:02:41.070> block<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:41.880> gunked<00:02:42.240> up

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
up the ejector block can get gunked up

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.330 
up the ejector block can get gunked up

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
get blocked up or gunked up as well but

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.240 
get blocked up or gunked up as well but
one<00:02:48.810> thing<00:02:48.990> you<00:02:49.110> have<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.290> know<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.560> if<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.070> run

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
one thing you have to know is if you run

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.650 
one thing you have to know is if you run
your<00:02:50.400> weapon<00:02:50.700> clean<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.240> don't<00:02:51.420> have<00:02:51.540> to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
your weapon clean you don't have to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.120 
your weapon clean you don't have to
worry<00:02:51.840> about<00:02:51.990> it<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.260> run<00:02:52.410> your<00:02:52.560> shotguns<00:02:52.980> is

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
worry about it you run your shotguns is

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.550 
worry about it you run your shotguns is
nice<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.550> dirty<00:02:53.730> well<00:02:54.060> then<00:02:54.290> then<00:02:55.290> obvious

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
nice and dirty well then then obvious

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.690 
nice and dirty well then then obvious
you're<00:02:55.650> going<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.830> experience<00:02:56.010> problems<00:02:56.400> but

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
you're going to experience problems but

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.390 
you're going to experience problems but
from<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.540> recreational<00:02:58.140> standpoint<00:02:58.410> you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
from a recreational standpoint you

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.100 
from a recreational standpoint you
probably<00:02:59.850> do<00:03:00.120> clean<00:03:00.360> your<00:03:00.480> guns<00:03:00.690> for<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.930> most

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
probably do clean your guns for the most

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.420 
probably do clean your guns for the most
part<00:03:01.290> all<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> time<00:03:01.770> so<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.280> have

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
part all the time so you have to have

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.890 
part all the time so you have to have
worry<00:03:02.760> about<00:03:02.970> any<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.240> those<00:03:03.300> problems<00:03:03.570> it

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
worry about any of those problems it

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.800 
worry about any of those problems it
basically<00:03:04.440> ends<00:03:05.190> up<00:03:05.280> being<00:03:05.550> your<00:03:06.120> personality

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
basically ends up being your personality

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.750 
basically ends up being your personality
the<00:03:06.930> type<00:03:07.080> person<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.560> are<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:07.950> what<00:03:08.550> you

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the type person you are and what you

the type person you are and what you
what<00:03:09.210> you<00:03:09.240> find<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.630> be<00:03:09.690> fun<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.380> find<00:03:11.250> breaking

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
what you find to be fun I find breaking

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.000 
what you find to be fun I find breaking
it<00:03:12.000> breaking<00:03:12.300> open<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.660> shotgun<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.320> be<00:03:13.440> more

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
it breaking open the shotgun to be more
