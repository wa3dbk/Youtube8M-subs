00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.899
 digital tv my friends and we 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.280
 should lars unnerstall we are here im 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:15.240
 s04 directly at the arena and handed in 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.710
 very elaborate relax training after the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.900
 move into the 8th 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.000
 how was the feeling yesterday ? 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.710
 come and work so hard today 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.080
 have to 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.300
 Of course, a few were getting yesterday 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.160
 important, of course, many leverkusen and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.439
 yes today was then accordingly 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.880
 bit quieter the trend therefore has 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.989
 Now stop to us to meet with us 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.850
 to chat a bit 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.890
 of course as the culprit for us here 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.610
 In particular, states create the best 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.610
 goalkeeper 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.520
 Selected comes even because you have 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.140
 yes, you know played at Prussia 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.340
 you münster like in münster 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.629
 video you can find the development of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.800
 Pruss and do you know that 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.690
 city ​​championships yes of course 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.719
 the city of marl procured kate 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.289
 Of course unfavorable is a great city 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.940
 So one can experience a lot and yes, the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 Of course, the development of the club is in the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.899
 nationally I think so now 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.150
 even among the top three 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.799
 at least really lower 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.200
 of course, if they are still great 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.070
 ascend a more imaginative 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.970
 already instead of team must 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.799
 probably like it again 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.509
 play with which especially if you 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:22.710
 return what I have 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.840
 played at pruss gft werk all 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 the others yes we have chosen 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.659
 for the best but first 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.280
 we still have to play something as usual 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.170
 a few games with us you said 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.420
 your colleagues can not do my job 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.369
 like that in the background 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.590
 hear cutlery where of course players 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.869
 just practice all in like sniping 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.880
 according to this statement and therefore one 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:48.119
 board a mayor and two knives 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.470
 but brought not only furniture before 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.310
 most certainly goalkeeper so if we now 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.310
 are the same 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:02.090
 please the dull better I hold yes 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.660
 jermaine jones would say now 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.270
 forward makes it ready so in his 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.399
 inimitable cabriolet is rather quiet or 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.440
 he loud weight so falls a bit 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.550
 louder I want to say comes once 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.990
 So then we know 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.980
 have a look at jermaine jones here 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.120
 In particular, there is still a lot to learn 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.360
 there look already the servants 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.680
 that invite to that you hello so who 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.300
 so can cut the may also a 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.300
 have big mouth in the furniture business 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.880
 learned before and mother about the 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.630
 Finma in the future a bock load 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.430
 open 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.410
 I had planned ever to 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.000
 home is also times with the bock and 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.000
 perhaps it is indeed my mainstay 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.940
 We do not want that to last long 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.080
 talk around 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.910
 It's about the best goalkeeper you 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.900
 do you know the hall here you can see 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.940
 on my background 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.310
 we have very special people for you 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.519
 selected and that once Roman 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.230
 Becker played at Bochum now 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.400
 at tus hiltrup so to speak at 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.930
 competitors to probably know 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.330
 but choose this incredible 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.550
 wonderful grin could be natural 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.500
 maybe not convincing then 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.140
 we patrick beyer 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.440
 it was ok childhouse the hairstyle 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.250
 one knows him his captivating reward 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.410
 someday when his hair fails 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.820
 I am sorry but that is 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.800
 highly toxic, what do you do to those 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.880
 native now and then we have 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.100
 of course mario cheap dos santos yes 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.540
 the life of the gate 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.040
 we can all 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.560
 you know all you all have 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.719
 ever in the city championships 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.760
 I have brought her the place 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.200
 there will be able to show you whom 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.140
 Would you or what do you think who 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.620
 make this year the race 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.730
 So I think he will do it because 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.730
 what i was there k 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.290
 Only the hairstyle and then I will 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:02.060
 always be so distracted that they just 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.769
 Do not hit the gate so go through 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.299
 do not dye hair but on everyone 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.450
 If you are, then you have good chances 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.980
 according to lars unnerstall yes we will always 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.079
 maybe more instructive to watch 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.549
 if you have time yes if if I have 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.139
 time I like to come over 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.229
 Of course you always have to look 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.669
 Training so if your appointment can 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.910
 maybe tell if I'm there 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:30.280
 is the 25 you have I think exactly 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:30.280
 25 to 26 to 29 or 30 63 to 30.12 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:38.180
 pass yes there is THAT CONDITION doing the 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.220
 schalke worlds where are you going seemed 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.030
 a lot of Schalke fans in Münster something 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.520
 the goal now in chemistry is what 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.389
 Do you really want to ask them? 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.919
 who is not a sky moderator today so well 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.090
 Yesterday, everything has always tried so 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.930
 say what do you want first 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.930
 to become a group winner 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.280
 that's exactly what you wanted yesterday and yes then 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.280
 we just have to go from round to round 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.780
 look around in the ko are round 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.659
 we decide the daily form 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.220
 and anything can happen but me 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.660
 think that we are on the eighth-finals of 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.130
 the specific one 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.840
 wonderfully courageous times would have 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.190
 The keeper of the furniture said 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.450

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.130
