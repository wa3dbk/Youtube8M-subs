two of my predictions turn out to be

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.910 
two of my predictions turn out to be
partially<00:02:20.600> right<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.990> first<00:02:21.230> being<00:02:21.440> Juhasz

gates for 6,000 seconds which is roughly
an<00:02:28.580> hour<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:28.970> 40<00:02:29.270> minutes<00:02:29.570> is<00:02:29.720> sort<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.290> odd<00:02:30.470> to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
an hour and 40 minutes is sort of odd to

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.070 
an hour and 40 minutes is sort of odd to
think<00:02:30.890> Aizen<00:02:31.490> went<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.790> such<00:02:32.090> great<00:02:32.120> lengths

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
to get the key and all you had to do was

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.940 
to get the key and all you had to do was
wait<00:02:35.269> for<00:02:35.330> each<00:02:35.600> go<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.840> arrive<00:02:36.170> seems<00:02:36.590> pretty
