00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 very good morning good afternoon good staff 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.720
 night due to the great success of the video 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.230
 how to show an anp plan in five 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.019
 minutes 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.759
 activate the 2014 version since the news 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.740
 what I want to talk about a company 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.420
 bit of the plan and closed is a 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.580
 Brazilian company with seven years of 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.220
 the market that prioritizes the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.170
 quality and mainly people of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.740
 company's standards that focus on 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.240
 people 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.880
 so look how seven years it has been in the market 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.980
 the idealizer 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.800
 Clear is a pencil a business man 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.930
 director of itaÃº bank for several years 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.090
 so money was not his focus 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.070
 money he already had other than 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.200
 we are accustomed is a company created 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.890
 to help people and not only to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.450
 to earn money 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.010
 all products within the range of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.980
 personal care 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.690
 perfume shampoo body creams and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.820
 oral hygiene with products of daily use 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.559
 products for continuous use and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.629
 mainly quality products 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.940
 You will not find anything singular in the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.949
 market with our price and with our 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.420
 quality you can even find with the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.260
 our quality but with a very high price 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.090
 bigger 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.119
 you can find with our price 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.369
 but with a quality well below a 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.500
 cost benefit of pm beat to generate 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.510
 repurchase and demand, so I have a 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.369
 solid company with seven years of market 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.390
 with the highly directive body 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.430
 competent 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.360
 already in the process of expansion and in 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.460
 united states peru colombia company 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.560
 Brazil but already a multinational one 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.869
 company whose products are for all 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.369
 everybody uses a market 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.479
 highly heated raw material 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.509
 French 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.220
 coming from a company called meme in 142 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.259

 armani thierry mugler 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.049
 all these companies buy 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.259
 raw material too so I have the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.000
 imported raw materials from the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.390

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.420
 same raw material of paco rabanne o 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.180

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.250
 Thierry Mugler's raw material is Indian 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.560

 women's handball 50 ml from the mall 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.719

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:18.870
 it costs 79 reais in the same packaging me 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.150
 but in compensation the value is less than 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.120
 20 percent for the end customer and we 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.489
