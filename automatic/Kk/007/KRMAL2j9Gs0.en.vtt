00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
concave part of the valve stem so that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.060 
concave part of the valve stem so that
you<00:01:20.990> know<00:01:21.140> it's<00:01:21.320> facing<00:01:21.590> up<00:01:23.500> then<00:01:24.500> you'll<00:01:24.770> need

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
you know it's facing up then you'll need

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.090 
you know it's facing up then you'll need
some<00:01:25.510> kind<00:01:26.510> of<00:01:26.690> metal<00:01:27.020> shim<00:01:27.290> on<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.590> top<00:01:27.830> to

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
some kind of metal shim on the top to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.800 
some kind of metal shim on the top to
make<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.400> stem<00:01:28.700> level<00:01:29.090> with<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.420> end<00:01:29.540> of<00:01:29.690> the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
make the stem level with the end of the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.960 
make the stem level with the end of the
screw<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.290> I've<00:01:30.410> taken<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.950> washer<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.700> bent

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
screw and I've taken a washer and bent

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.990 
screw and I've taken a washer and bent
it<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:33.560> that<00:01:33.800> it'll<00:01:33.950> fit<00:01:34.040> on<00:01:34.310> there<00:01:34.760> without

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
it so that it'll fit on there without

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.210 
it so that it'll fit on there without
slipping<00:01:35.540> off<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:39.440> next<00:01:39.800> thing<00:01:39.979> you'll<00:01:40.160> need

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
slipping off the next thing you'll need

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.390 
slipping off the next thing you'll need
to<00:01:40.550> do<00:01:40.759> is<00:01:41.030> take<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.869> stack<00:01:42.290> of<00:01:42.320> metal<00:01:42.890> washers

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
to do is take a stack of metal washers

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.359 
to do is take a stack of metal washers
to<00:01:44.270> place<00:01:44.540> underneath<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.200> valve<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:46.100> that's

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
to place underneath the valve so that's

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.560 
to place underneath the valve so that's
nice<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:46.940> snug<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.950> act<00:01:49.130> as<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:49.430> shim<00:01:49.940> on<00:01:50.150> the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
nice and snug to act as a shim on the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.140 
nice and snug to act as a shim on the
underside<00:01:51.290> of<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:52.640> concave<00:01:54.280> valve<00:01:55.280> stem<00:01:55.759> then

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
underside of the concave valve stem then

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.249 
underside of the concave valve stem then
you<00:01:56.330> take<00:01:56.540> your<00:01:56.570> pipe<00:01:56.930> clamp<00:01:58.930> position<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.080> on

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
you take your pipe clamp position it on

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.540 
you take your pipe clamp position it on
top<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.100> shim<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:02.680> under<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:03.890> then<00:02:04.250> very

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
top of the shim and under and then very

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.199 
top of the shim and under and then very
slowly<00:02:06.370> tightening<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.520> valve<00:02:08.590> checking<00:02:09.590> it

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
slowly tightening the valve checking it

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.449 
slowly tightening the valve checking it
often<00:02:11.380> until<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.530> get<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.830> valve<00:02:13.040> straight

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
often until you get the valve straight

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.770 
often until you get the valve straight
and<00:02:13.989> that's<00:02:14.989> all<00:02:15.260> there<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:15.890> my<00:02:16.010> friends

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and that's all there is to it my friends

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.410 
and that's all there is to it my friends
the<00:02:17.780> last<00:02:17.989> step<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.560> course<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.610> remove<00:02:20.180> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
the last step of course is to remove the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.039 
the last step of course is to remove the
pipe<00:02:20.630> plant<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:23.570> little<00:02:23.810> shim<00:02:25.840> remove<00:02:26.840> the

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
pipe plant and a little shim remove the

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.960 
pipe plant and a little shim remove the
washers

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.050 

and<00:02:33.970> then<00:02:36.510> remove<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.750> in<00:02:37.900> screw<00:02:39.060> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
and then remove the in screw and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.839 
and then remove the in screw and
reassemble<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.620> valve<00:02:44.860> goes<00:02:45.159> back<00:02:45.430> on

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:59.850 

tighten<00:02:48.849> it<00:02:53.280> put<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.459> screw<00:02:54.760> back<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:58.860> just

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
tighten it put the screw back in just

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.900 
tighten it put the screw back in just
tight<00:03:00.099> enough<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:01.090> doesn't<00:03:01.420> leak

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
tight enough so that it doesn't leak

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.270 
tight enough so that it doesn't leak
then<00:03:03.910> loosen<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:04.480> handle<00:03:04.870> again<00:03:05.190> bring<00:03:06.190> it

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
then loosen the handle again bring it

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.400 
then loosen the handle again bring it
all<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.549> way<00:03:06.670> out

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.620 

and<00:03:12.980> when<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:13.190> turn<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.430> clockwise<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.390> want

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630
