00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
playing a mission so setting up an

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.499 
playing a mission so setting up an
equity<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> house<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.640> staff<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.939> odium

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
equity to the house to staff the odium

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.600 
equity to the house to staff the odium
and<00:01:54.899> i<00:01:55.140> made<00:01:55.320> an<00:01:55.439> interesting<00:01:55.710> mistake<00:01:56.310> here<00:01:56.579> i

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
and i made an interesting mistake here i

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.999 
and i made an interesting mistake here i
didn't<00:01:56.880> even<00:01:56.939> realize<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> while<00:01:58.009> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
didn't even realize it for a while the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.340 
didn't even realize it for a while the
odium<00:01:59.460> has<00:01:59.850> already<00:02:00.090> staffed<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.960> his<00:02:01.079> staff

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
odium has already staffed and his staff

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990 
odium has already staffed and his staff
with<00:02:01.619> an<00:02:01.770> insulin<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> happened<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.850> be

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
with an insulin that happened to be

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.999 
with an insulin that happened to be
under<00:02:03.329> happened<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.259> be<00:02:04.439> within<00:02:04.680> range

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
under happened to be within range

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.510 
under happened to be within range
without<00:02:05.340> employment<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.170> my<00:02:07.530> i<00:02:07.799> meant<00:02:08.340> for

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
without employment and so my i meant for

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.190 
without employment and so my i meant for
that<00:02:08.640> equity<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.209> stafford<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.050> our

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
that equity the stafford so our

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.020 
that equity the stafford so our
entertainment<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.129> actually<00:02:11.430> still<00:02:11.610> low<00:02:11.849> as

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
entertainment is actually still low as

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.290 
entertainment is actually still low as
an<00:02:12.180> equity<00:02:12.629> were

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
an equity were

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.940 
an equity were
staffing<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.690> odium<00:02:14.320> then<00:02:14.530> would<00:02:14.680> be<00:02:14.800> all

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
staffing that odium then would be all

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.320 
staffing that odium then would be all
right<00:02:15.100> we'd<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:15.430> at<00:02:15.640> least<00:02:15.790> we'd<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.180> our

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
right we'd have at least we'd have our

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330 
right we'd have at least we'd have our
20<00:02:16.720> entertainment<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:17.740> I'm<00:02:17.800> going<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:17.980> add<00:02:18.130> an

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
20 entertainment so I'm going to add an

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.470 
20 entertainment so I'm going to add an
in<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:19.530> add<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.100> entertainment<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:21.910> staff

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
in to add to the entertainment and staff

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.320 
in to add to the entertainment and staff
it<00:02:22.750> with<00:02:22.960> an<00:02:23.110> equity<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.790> can<00:02:24.910> do<00:02:25.090> that

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
it with an equity and you can do that

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.230 
it with an equity and you can do that
because<00:02:25.570> we<00:02:25.780> also<00:02:26.200> have<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> grape<00:02:26.910> farm<00:02:27.910> going

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
because we also have a grape farm going

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.360 
because we also have a grape farm going
so<00:02:28.540> we<00:02:28.690> have<00:02:28.900> basically<00:02:29.350> all<00:02:29.740> five<00:02:30.010> farms

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
so we have basically all five farms

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.230 
so we have basically all five farms
going<00:02:30.760> at<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.060> point<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:33.060> building<00:02:34.060> in

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
going at this point and so building in

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.270 
going at this point and so building in
and<00:02:34.750> looking<00:02:35.050> at<00:02:35.200> building<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.560> tavern<00:02:36.100> but

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
and looking at building a tavern but

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.480 
and looking at building a tavern but
first<00:02:36.520> i<00:02:36.640> want<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.910> put<00:02:37.030> down<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.380> Prefecture<00:02:38.490> to

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
first i want to put down a Prefecture to

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.390 
first i want to put down a Prefecture to
cut<00:02:39.820> down<00:02:40.000> on<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.390> materials<00:02:41.400> maintenance

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
cut down on the materials maintenance

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.160 
cut down on the materials maintenance
costs<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.030> could<00:02:43.300> have<00:02:43.390> more<00:02:43.600> free<00:02:43.840> building

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
costs so I could have more free building

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.230 
costs so I could have more free building
materials<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.310> will<00:02:45.610> put<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.760> over<00:02:45.910> there

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
materials so I will put it over there

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.320 
materials so I will put it over there
and<00:02:46.600> if<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.230> ended<00:02:47.440> up<00:02:47.500> expanding<00:02:48.100> this<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.610> you

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
and if I ended up expanding this I you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.760 
and if I ended up expanding this I you
know<00:02:49.450> be<00:02:49.660> nice<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:50.020> have<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.200> more<00:02:50.350> simply

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
know be nice to have it more simply

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.070 
know be nice to have it more simply
located<00:02:51.520> but<00:02:51.730> there's<00:02:52.210> fine<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:52.900> we<00:02:52.960> can

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
located but there's fine and it we can

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.510 
located but there's fine and it we can
move<00:02:53.230> one<00:02:53.440> if<00:02:53.590> that's<00:02:53.710> kind<00:02:54.070> of<00:02:54.130> if<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.340> think

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
move one if that's kind of if you think

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.700 
move one if that's kind of if you think
of<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.790> as<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:54.970> northwest<00:02:55.750> corner<00:02:56.530> then

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
of that as the northwest corner then

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.410 
of that as the northwest corner then
over<00:02:57.070> in<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.250> southeast<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:57.880> might<00:02:58.060> build<00:02:58.240> a

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
over in the southeast we might build a

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.120 
over in the southeast we might build a
second<00:02:58.780> Prefecture<00:02:59.350> just<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.680> make<00:02:59.830> sure<00:02:59.860> we

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
second Prefecture just to make sure we
