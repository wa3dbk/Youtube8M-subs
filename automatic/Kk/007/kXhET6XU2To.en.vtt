00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 This is okay with you these days. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.270
 I was thinking how we have it. 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.780
 craze to curse our own culture 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.460
 in painting we are very critical of the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.380
 our culture when it speaks in cultures 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.420
 of nerd culture who blogs that 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.199
 was on the blog the culture that exists in 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.150
 said common western modern and order and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.029
 I think health as we criticize 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.039
 when the subject is internet too 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.590
 cell type technology is very common 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.939
 You find someone is talking to us. 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.800
 everybody stays on the cell phone 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.500
 My god, the other day, I 'm not going on a 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.320
 interview with the philosopher saying that 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.200
 nowadays it is absurd that relations 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.360
 are special that people seem to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.820
 have relationships for post instagram photos 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.370
 and show how happy they are as 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.579
 It's important for you to show more 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.920
 happy that you are really happy not to 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.780
 I'm saying technology does not have 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.610
 their problems much less than our 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.359
 society does not have the problems you have 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.609
 good things and bad things but the point is 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:06.320
 who gave names to us today because 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.080
 What to talk about in this ozuna record audio 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.350
 they are not things of our era, people are not 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.229
 internet in the opinion that to come face 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.580
 internet has increased a pact is than 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.360
 people say that people usually 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.939
 do 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.720
 but it's not just talking that believes via came with 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.830
 the advent of the internet right there is not okay 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.009
 long time 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.829
 hypocrisy selectiveness to envy to 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.090
 will finally right defects in race 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.090
 since forever 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.190
 good about this mania that there are about 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.460
 of hunting for in excerpt from the famous book 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.290
 sad tropics of cholesterol 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.660
 he was in rio has a 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.990
 Years when I even read you a thick book. 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.030
 the people who loves to play and then look at it 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.640
 more this stretch 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.530
 often subversive and among their 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.050
 state of rebellion against customs 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.850
 the ethnographer shows 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.340
 respectful of conservatism 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.260
 provided that the society under study is 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.300
 different from your 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.980
 I found it marked 13 when I think 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.960
 not only with 7 numbers 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.880
 it is very common for us to defend and 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.980
 understand what happens to cultures 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.230
 very far from ours 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.410
 It's kind of like it 's not their culture. 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.850
 Well, we use the burka they want in 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.330
 fire will have as judge and with 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.670
 with the culture of outside and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.130
 very critical of our culture with the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.830
 our culture was just rotten it was horrible 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.700
 only in the same sad tropics some 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.470
 pages ahead 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.950
 the author says that there is no culture 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.290
 perfect neither we nor the others nor of 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.540
 existing one to criticize others not 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.390
 It's all we do, I think so. 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.850
 common people often detonate 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.670
 to the present day as if the things that 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.239
 happen today you interest exclusive 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.650
 It will never keep all the good we 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.940
 times in which we see that has many 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.030
 even the internet was a 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.070
 revolution our super concord 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.400
 Calm down there, I separated a book from 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.400
 south that shows very well these people 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.140
 had lunch with thinker injuries 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.620
 this volume actually brings several 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.080
 his books and this book has sections that 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.180
 I'll read if it's a speech about 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.290
 origin and the foundations of equality 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.019
 among men 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.019
 and then we had the page marked 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.480
 right valentino problem like 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.160
 wild win even social man 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.010
 always out of it alone the fact of living 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.930
 based on the opinion of the others and 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.519
 feeling 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.519
 resistance almost only one 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.530
 their judgment is everything boils down to the 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.859
 appearances makes everything artificial and 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.829
 represent is a friendship and attitude 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:55.099
 look at a kind of man who does not 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.859
 value in the eyes of the rest of the 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.810
 feel satisfied with themselves but not 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.769
 testimony of others than by their 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.450
 own 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.189
 we see a lot this is that people 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.909
 who criticize this thing of using much 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.700
 Internet 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.129
 people want and I get happier and 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.169
 shown who would have something right? 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.909
 but if she was or was already speaking in a 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.950
 century in the 18th century 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.810
 the internet has increased the reach of 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.209
 information changed the relationship with 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.280
 privacy has opened up our features 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.949
 ridiculous nÃ© our lack of ours 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.840
 our will to be 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.789
 I loved that produced some 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.710
 ways in Greek texts now 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.259
 reflect the need for 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.080
 sharing at last things change 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.699
 It's on your way to resist but you 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.800
 It was that it did not exist before 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.349
 internet did not invent a new human being 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.990
 It 's wonderful for a change. 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.300
 I'm not scrounged all the same time. 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.940
 lacking will called relationships 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.460
 facade hypocrisy speak one thing in the 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.760
 room speaks another in the speech cry at home 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.810
 go public who never here or in the 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.370
 ancient Greece 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.110
 It's these people I hope you have 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.000
 We like to enjoy a little more 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.099
 to stay a little less has things 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.860
 Your good side, anyway, the internet can be 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.780
 wonderfully nothing can be 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.990
 ridiculously used depletion to use 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.490
 videos videos of video reitories 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.349
 people who get weird all the time 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.240
 cell or accountability through 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.460
 I'm thinking of going there . 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.830
 negative I do not consider very negative 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.419
 internet can be perfectly use but 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.229
 can be beautifully used in most 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.720
 of alternating times but at last did not invent 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.940
 a new society and I think that this 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.430
 culture that many good things to lend 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.320
 one that I find very good very positive 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.470
 this increased awareness that I see 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.240
 this humanization this shock in 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.639
 relation to violence when I read texts 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.620
 years 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.719
 I do not see so much I see the violence 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.810
 more embedded in people's lives 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:50.430
 much but naturalized analyze today it 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.560
 of course the one organized by some ne 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.349
 own people who have 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.909
 violent and such but it is as a whole I think 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.340
 that our society collides and this is 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.330
 a super positive trait of ours is 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.590
 I hope that you guys have 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.120
