to the point where it would normally
turn<00:01:58.570> into<00:01:58.900> steam

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
turn into steam

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.260 
turn into steam
except<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.220> doesn't<00:02:00.460> because<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.090> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
except it doesn't because of the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.060 
except it doesn't because of the
pressure<00:02:01.570> of<00:02:01.720> all<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.140> other<00:02:02.259> water<00:02:02.590> on<00:02:02.860> top

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
pressure of all the other water on top

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.180 
pressure of all the other water on top
of<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:04.150> it<00:02:04.210> gets<00:02:04.390> really<00:02:04.750> hot<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.560> expands

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
of so it gets really hot and it expands

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.070 
of so it gets really hot and it expands
and<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.610> pushes<00:02:06.940> some<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.479> colder<00:02:07.900> water

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
and it pushes some of the colder water

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.320 
and it pushes some of the colder water
out<00:02:08.350> of<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.619> top<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.700> relieves<00:02:10.119> the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
out of the top that relieves the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.449 
out of the top that relieves the
pressure<00:02:10.540> and<00:02:10.929> all<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.260> sudden<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.980> hot<00:02:12.190> water

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
pressure and all of sudden the hot water

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.720 
pressure and all of sudden the hot water
turns<00:02:12.880> into<00:02:13.030> steam<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.600> how<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.950> drops<00:02:15.400> out

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
turns into steam and how it drops out

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.210 
turns into steam and how it drops out
along<00:02:16.390> with<00:02:16.600> all<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.959> colder<00:02:17.410> water<00:02:17.620> on<00:02:17.920> top

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
along with all the colder water on top

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.880 
along with all the colder water on top
then<00:02:19.030> more<00:02:19.270> water<00:02:19.480> flows<00:02:19.840> down<00:02:20.170> into<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.620> deep

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
then more water flows down into the deep

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.220 
then more water flows down into the deep
passages<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.209> whole<00:02:22.390> thing<00:02:22.630> starts<00:02:23.020> all
