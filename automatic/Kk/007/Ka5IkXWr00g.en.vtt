consistency they say to make it like

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.250 
consistency they say to make it like
like<00:02:10.789> yogurt<00:02:11.269> or<00:02:11.450> pudding<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.959> may<00:02:12.080> be<00:02:12.140> a

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.199 
like yogurt or pudding you may be a
little<00:02:12.530> bit<00:02:12.739> thinner<00:02:12.950> than<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.220> cuz<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:13.849> just

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
little bit thinner than that cuz I just

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.989 
little bit thinner than that cuz I just
added<00:02:14.450> some<00:02:14.810> more<00:02:14.840> water<00:02:15.140> in<00:02:15.379> and<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.709> think

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:15.999 
added some more water in and I think

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.170 
added some more water in and I think
that<00:02:16.999> means<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.359> little<00:02:17.510> too

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that means a little too

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.690 
that means a little too
thin<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:20.840> still<00:02:21.840> gonna<00:02:21.930> work<00:02:22.109> with<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.260> anyway

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
thin but still gonna work with it anyway

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.490 
thin but still gonna work with it anyway
and<00:02:23.700> I'm<00:02:24.090> hoping<00:02:24.359> that<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.689> one<00:02:24.959> pack<00:02:25.260> is

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
and I'm hoping that that one pack is

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.289 
and I'm hoping that that one pack is
going<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.769> be<00:02:25.890> enough<00:02:26.280> because<00:02:26.579> I<00:02:26.790> only<00:02:27.060> have

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
going to be enough because I only have

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.039 
going to be enough because I only have
the<00:02:27.450> one<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.560> gonna<00:02:28.709> have<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:29.099> enough

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
the one so it's gonna have to be enough

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.839 
the one so it's gonna have to be enough
but<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.230> main<00:02:31.409> focus<00:02:31.859> for<00:02:31.890> me<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:32.640> going<00:02:32.790> to

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
but the main focus for me it's going to

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.449 
but the main focus for me it's going to
be<00:02:32.909> like<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.390> fronts<00:02:33.840> anyway<00:02:34.319> because<00:02:34.590> that's

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
be like the fronts anyway because that's

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.149 
be like the fronts anyway because that's
where<00:02:35.879> all<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:37.049> gray<00:02:37.230> hair<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.400> front

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
where all the gray hair is is the front

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.729 
where all the gray hair is is the front
so<00:02:41.159> there's<00:02:41.670> three<00:02:41.849> wells<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.480> mean<00:02:43.439> it's<00:02:43.560> not<00:02:43.680> a

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
so there's three wells I mean it's not a

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.440 
so there's three wells I mean it's not a
whole<00:02:44.040> lot<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.370> grey<00:02:44.579> like<00:02:44.879> it's<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.150> whole<00:02:45.299> lot

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
whole lot of grey like it's a whole lot

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.119 
whole lot of grey like it's a whole lot
of<00:02:45.480> great<00:02:45.689> to<00:02:45.870> me<00:02:45.989> like<00:02:46.200> right<00:02:46.409> here<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:46.980> like

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
of great to me like right here but like

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.619 
of great to me like right here but like
everywhere<00:02:47.579> else<00:02:47.639> it's<00:02:47.969> not<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.389> much<00:02:48.569> but

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
everywhere else it's not that much but

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.319 
everywhere else it's not that much but
there<00:02:48.959> are<00:02:49.049> some<00:02:49.260> strands<00:02:49.829> like<00:02:50.700> sprinkle

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
there are some strands like sprinkle
