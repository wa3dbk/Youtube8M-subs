00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
a sample for there was a sign can you

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.990 
a sample for there was a sign can you
see<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:11.780> clearly<00:04:12.200> from<00:04:12.530> here<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:13.190> put<00:04:13.760> up<00:04:13.910> a

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
going to create the wings you can see

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.330 
going to create the wings you can see
the<00:04:36.500> wind<00:04:36.680> say<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:36.860> will<00:04:37.160> forward<00:04:37.640> down<00:04:38.060> foot<00:04:38.480> I

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.480 
see the inner outward toward the other
side<00:05:14.060> there<00:05:14.450> I<00:05:14.480> push<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:15.020> pointy<00:05:15.680> part<00:05:15.920> out

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
side there I push the pointy part out

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.670 
side there I push the pointy part out
it's<00:05:16.760> this<00:05:17.480> a<00:05:17.510> little<00:05:17.870> bit<00:05:17.990> hard<00:05:18.200> to<00:05:18.320> fold

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
it's this a little bit hard to fold

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.990 
it's this a little bit hard to fold
that's<00:05:18.950> way<00:05:19.930> so<00:05:20.930> do<00:05:21.590> slowly<00:05:21.950> oh<00:05:22.280> yeah<00:05:22.880> I<00:05:22.910> just

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
that's way so do slowly oh yeah I just

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.070 
that's way so do slowly oh yeah I just
pulled<00:05:23.510> out<00:05:23.720> as<00:05:24.020> you<00:05:24.260> can<00:05:24.410> see<00:05:24.560> there<00:05:25.090> and<00:05:26.090> then

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
pulled out as you can see there and then

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.920 
pulled out as you can see there and then
push<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.410> down<00:05:27.560> little<00:05:27.950> bit<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.610> little<00:05:29.390> bit<00:05:29.570> and

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
push it down little bit a little bit and

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.560 
push it down little bit a little bit and
then<00:05:30.110> now<00:05:30.260> fix<00:05:30.800> this<00:05:31.010> one<00:05:31.820> by<00:05:32.030> one

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
then now fix this one by one

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.590 
then now fix this one by one
I<00:05:34.900> fixed<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:36.430> top<00:05:37.430> part<00:05:37.760> I<00:05:37.880> will<00:05:38.150> throw<00:05:38.510> it

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
I fixed the top part I will throw it

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.740 
I fixed the top part I will throw it
down<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:39.020> I<00:05:39.350> pull<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:39.830> wings<00:05:40.040> up<00:05:40.310> and<00:05:40.720> pull<00:05:41.720> it

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
down and I pull the wings up and pull it

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.340 
down and I pull the wings up and pull it
down<00:05:41.870> again<00:05:42.350> as<00:05:42.830> you<00:05:43.010> can<00:05:43.130> see<00:05:43.310> there<00:05:44.230> and<00:05:45.230> I

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
down again as you can see there and I

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.730 
down again as you can see there and I
put<00:05:45.650> the<00:05:45.800> paper<00:05:46.010> on<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.780> tables<00:05:47.780> so<00:05:48.140> I<00:05:48.170> can<00:05:48.530> put

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
put the paper on the tables so I can put

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.630 
put the paper on the tables so I can put
easier<00:05:49.900> now<00:05:50.900> for<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.290> winds<00:05:51.470> up<00:05:51.710> first<00:05:52.280> a<00:05:52.430> bit

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
easier now for the winds up first a bit

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.870 
easier now for the winds up first a bit
I'm<00:05:53.390> going<00:05:53.750> to<00:05:53.840> create<00:05:54.320> a<00:05:54.410> few<00:05:55.100> more<00:05:55.130> crease<00:05:55.610> to

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
I'm going to create a few more crease to

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.620 
I'm going to create a few more crease to
meet<00:05:56.030> the<00:05:56.150> wings<00:05:56.390> look<00:05:56.630> nicer<00:05:56.930> I<00:05:57.580> forced

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
meet the wings look nicer I forced

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.300 
meet the wings look nicer I forced
diagonally<00:05:59.630> and<00:05:59.990> as<00:06:00.320> you<00:06:00.500> can<00:06:00.620> see<00:06:00.860> there<00:06:01.070> make

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
diagonally and as you can see there make

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.080 
diagonally and as you can see there make
a<00:06:01.340> very<00:06:01.730> tiny<00:06:02.800> triangle<00:06:03.800> shape<00:06:04.070> and<00:06:04.370> this<00:06:04.880> is

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
a very tiny triangle shape and this is

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.650 
a very tiny triangle shape and this is
very<00:06:05.360> pointy<00:06:05.900> and<00:06:06.230> I<00:06:07.220> repeat<00:06:08.060> the<00:06:08.120> same<00:06:08.150> fold

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
very pointy and I repeat the same fold

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.810 
very pointy and I repeat the same fold
for<00:06:08.690> the<00:06:08.870> above<00:06:09.080> sasai<00:06:09.470> I<00:06:09.710> would<00:06:09.860> use<00:06:10.130> the<00:06:10.580> edge

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
for the above sasai I would use the edge

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.420 
for the above sasai I would use the edge
from<00:06:11.510> the<00:06:11.750> other<00:06:11.930> side<00:06:12.260> as<00:06:12.470> my<00:06:12.740> preference<00:06:13.250> to

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
from the other side as my preference to

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.780 
from the other side as my preference to
fall

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
fall

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.920 
fall
and<00:06:15.790> now<00:06:16.330> a<00:06:16.390> foot<00:06:16.870> down<00:06:17.110> one<00:06:17.590> more<00:06:17.740> time<00:06:17.980> and<00:06:18.930> I

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
and now a foot down one more time and I

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.190 
and now a foot down one more time and I
must<00:06:20.260> decrease<00:06:20.740> very<00:06:21.340> hard<00:06:21.700> and<00:06:22.480> I<00:06:22.660> repeat<00:06:23.140> the

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
must decrease very hard and I repeat the

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.840 
must decrease very hard and I repeat the
same<00:06:23.230> fold<00:06:23.710> for<00:06:23.740> the<00:06:23.920> above<00:06:24.100> Society

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
same fold for the above Society

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.700 
same fold for the above Society
the<00:06:25.180> reason<00:06:25.540> we're<00:06:25.690> falling<00:06:26.200> this<00:06:26.470> way

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
the reason we're falling this way

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.160 
the reason we're falling this way
because<00:06:26.950> I<00:06:27.250> want<00:06:27.490> I<00:06:27.760> want<00:06:28.240> to<00:06:28.390> have<00:06:28.630> the<00:06:28.960> uneven

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
because I want I want to have the uneven

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.460 
because I want I want to have the uneven
wings<00:06:29.890> to<00:06:30.880> make<00:06:31.030> the<00:06:31.180> dragon<00:06:31.600> look<00:06:31.780> nicer<00:06:32.050> and

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
wings to make the dragon look nicer and

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.350 
wings to make the dragon look nicer and
I<00:06:32.860> repeat<00:06:33.190> the<00:06:33.280> same<00:06:33.310> for<00:06:33.730> here

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
I repeat the same for here

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.110 
I repeat the same for here
and<00:06:35.250> I've<00:06:36.250> pushed<00:06:36.490> it<00:06:36.610> that<00:06:36.760> one<00:06:36.940> more<00:06:37.090> time

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
and I've pushed it that one more time

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.260 
and I've pushed it that one more time
also<00:06:37.990> for<00:06:38.290> the<00:06:38.530> other<00:06:38.650> side<00:06:38.980> and<00:06:39.490> now<00:06:40.210> the

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
also for the other side and now the

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.230 
also for the other side and now the
dragon<00:06:40.720> looks<00:06:40.900> really<00:06:41.290> weird<00:06:41.760> anyways<00:06:42.760> I<00:06:42.970> will

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
dragon looks really weird anyways I will

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.660 
dragon looks really weird anyways I will
unfold<00:06:43.660> the<00:06:43.840> wings<00:06:44.080> and<00:06:44.530> you<00:06:45.280> can<00:06:45.430> see<00:06:45.550> the

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:45.670 
unfold the wings and you can see the

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.280 
unfold the wings and you can see the
wind<00:06:45.850> stairs<00:06:46.150> look<00:06:46.480> a<00:06:46.660> little<00:06:47.020> bit<00:06:47.140> awkward

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
wind stairs look a little bit awkward

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.760 
wind stairs look a little bit awkward
but<00:06:47.920> we<00:06:48.130> will<00:06:48.670> fix<00:06:48.880> it<00:06:49.030> later

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
but we will fix it later

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.340 
but we will fix it later
sending<00:06:50.770> here<00:06:51.010> I<00:06:51.220> will<00:06:51.880> fold<00:06:52.180> the<00:06:52.510> wings<00:06:53.110> up<00:06:53.320> a

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
sending here I will fold the wings up a

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.070 
sending here I will fold the wings up a
bit<00:06:53.650> it's<00:06:54.400> look<00:06:54.700> more<00:06:54.970> like<00:06:55.150> a<00:06:55.180> bat<00:06:55.540> now<00:06:55.810> but

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
bit it's look more like a bat now but

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.080 
bit it's look more like a bat now but
it's<00:06:56.350> okay<00:06:56.650> we're<00:06:56.950> going<00:06:57.130> to<00:06:57.250> fix<00:06:57.490> it<00:06:57.610> anyways

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
it's okay we're going to fix it anyways

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.930 
it's okay we're going to fix it anyways
I<00:06:58.330> put<00:06:58.960> up<00:06:59.140> little<00:06:59.620> bit<00:06:59.740> and<00:07:00.010> now<00:07:00.610> I<00:07:00.640> will<00:07:00.910> make

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940 
I put up little bit and now I will make

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.590 
I put up little bit and now I will make
the<00:07:01.920> skeleton<00:07:02.920> of<00:07:03.070> the<00:07:03.160> wings<00:07:03.580> this<00:07:04.240> is<00:07:04.390> very

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
the skeleton of the wings this is very

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.300 
the skeleton of the wings this is very
important<00:07:05.020> to<00:07:05.110> meet<00:07:05.260> the<00:07:05.290> wing<00:07:05.530> strong<00:07:06.040> and

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
important to meet the wing strong and

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.250 
important to meet the wing strong and
looks<00:07:06.610> nice<00:07:09.030> you<00:07:10.030> see<00:07:10.240> the<00:07:10.420> claw<00:07:10.720> of<00:07:11.080> the

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.260 
looks nice you see the claw of the

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.950 
looks nice you see the claw of the
dragon<00:07:11.800> now<00:07:11.830> I'm<00:07:12.280> fixed<00:07:12.940> since<00:07:13.090> the<00:07:13.480> end<00:07:13.720> of

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 
dragon now I'm fixed since the end of

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.170 
dragon now I'm fixed since the end of
the<00:07:14.020> wings<00:07:14.320> is<00:07:14.740> this<00:07:15.010> also<00:07:15.340> the<00:07:15.460> claw<00:07:15.790> of<00:07:16.060> the

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
the wings is this also the claw of the

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.440 
the wings is this also the claw of the
dragon<00:07:19.080> we<00:07:20.080> see<00:07:20.290> a<00:07:20.320> little<00:07:20.470> bit<00:07:20.650> and<00:07:21.450> decreased

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.450 
dragon we see a little bit and decreased

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.590 
dragon we see a little bit and decreased
very<00:07:22.780> hard<00:07:23.080> and<00:07:23.320> the<00:07:24.070> wings<00:07:24.280> now<00:07:24.580> can<00:07:25.120> stand<00:07:25.450> up

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:25.600
