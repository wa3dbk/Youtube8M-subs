00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
these headphones while I was playing

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.140 
these headphones while I was playing
basketball<00:03:11.760> at<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.239> park<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.799> I<00:03:13.819> have<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:14.970> say

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
basketball at the park and I have to say

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.589 
basketball at the park and I have to say
they're<00:03:15.389> pretty<00:03:15.629> good<00:03:15.870> because<00:03:17.329> the<00:03:18.329> entire

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
they're pretty good because the entire

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.930 
they're pretty good because the entire
time<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:18.870> was<00:03:18.959> there

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
time I was there

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.089 
time I was there
they<00:03:20.940> never<00:03:21.180> fell<00:03:21.449> out<00:03:21.569> of<00:03:21.599> my<00:03:21.750> ears<00:03:21.959> which<00:03:22.829> is

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
they never fell out of my ears which is

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.670 
they never fell out of my ears which is
very<00:03:23.970> good<00:03:24.209> because<00:03:24.419> you<00:03:24.900> know<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.290> lot<00:03:25.650> of

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
very good because you know a lot of

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.589 
very good because you know a lot of
times<00:03:25.949> when<00:03:26.069> you<00:03:26.129> play<00:03:26.280> sports<00:03:26.579> you<00:03:27.299> getting

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
times when you play sports you getting

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.210 
times when you play sports you getting
you<00:03:27.810> know<00:03:27.930> bumped<00:03:28.409> around<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.829> everything

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
you know bumped around and everything

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.140 
you know bumped around and everything
especially<00:03:29.519> when<00:03:29.879> you're<00:03:29.970> playing

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
especially when you're playing

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.949 
especially when you're playing
basketball<00:03:30.769> so<00:03:32.150> it's<00:03:33.150> very<00:03:33.329> surprising<00:03:33.569> that

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
basketball so it's very surprising that

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.020 
basketball so it's very surprising that
headphones<00:03:34.470> actually<00:03:35.010> stay<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.819> fact
