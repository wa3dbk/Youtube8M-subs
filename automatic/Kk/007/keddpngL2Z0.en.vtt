hello everybody this is a new version of

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.349 
hello everybody this is a new version of
the<00:00:05.250> diamond<00:00:05.730> Factory

the diamond Factory

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.290 
the diamond Factory
I<00:00:07.040> made<00:00:08.040> one<00:00:08.220> previously<00:00:08.640> I<00:00:08.700> got<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.060> lot<00:00:09.270> of

I made one previously I got a lot of
views<00:00:09.600> I<00:00:09.750> decided<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.380> upgrade<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:11.130> make<00:00:11.280> it

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520 
views I decided to upgrade to make it

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.630 
views I decided to upgrade to make it
much<00:00:12.060> smaller<00:00:12.330> much<00:00:13.050> less<00:00:13.440> complicated<00:00:14.070> as

you can see have my three villagers here
to<00:00:16.439> trade<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.099> pork<00:00:17.490> their<00:00:18.240> diamonds<00:00:18.660> for

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
to trade up the pork their diamonds for

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.480 
to trade up the pork their diamonds for
the<00:00:18.839> pork<00:00:19.109> chops<00:00:19.349> that<00:00:19.439> come<00:00:19.679> through<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the pork chops that come through the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.859 
the pork chops that come through the
first<00:00:20.789> one<00:00:20.939> basically<00:00:21.060> gets<00:00:21.449> all<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.689> them<00:00:21.749> but

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
first one basically gets all of them but

diamonds lots of it too
lots<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.650> lots<00:00:31.739> of<00:00:31.949> aimed<00:00:32.130> here<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> switches

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
lots and lots of aimed here the switches

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.870 
lots and lots of aimed here the switches
they<00:00:33.240> all<00:00:33.330> do<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.630> same<00:00:33.660> thing<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.830> I<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
they all do the same thing and I have a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.000 
they all do the same thing and I have a
new<00:00:36.270> invention<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.810> makes<00:00:37.080> this<00:00:37.260> much<00:00:37.710> much

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
new invention that makes this much much

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:50.300 
new invention that makes this much much
easier<00:00:44.570> it's

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.800 

he's<00:00:51.310> out<00:00:51.520> of<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.760> way<00:00:51.910> for<00:00:51.970> the<00:00:52.180> Despenser's

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
he's out of the way for the Despenser's

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:02.640 
he's out of the way for the Despenser's
it<00:00:53.080> wasn't<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.850> was<00:00:54.970> too<00:00:55.360> quick

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:10.350 

even<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.580> rate<00:01:08.640> first<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:09.850> got<00:01:10.030> through<00:01:10.240> much

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
even the rate first I got through much

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.510 
even the rate first I got through much
all<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:10.690> diamonds<00:01:11.020> again<00:01:11.290> see<00:01:12.100> all<00:01:12.310> these

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
all the diamonds again see all these

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.200 
all the diamonds again see all these
diamonds<00:01:13.030> tons<00:01:13.510> of<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:13.869> to<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:15.610> that's<00:01:16.000> a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
diamonds tons of it to there that's a

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.490 
diamonds tons of it to there that's a
new<00:01:16.360> diamond<00:01:16.570> factory<00:01:17.229> much<00:01:18.070> much<00:01:18.340> smaller

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
new diamond factory much much smaller

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.070 
new diamond factory much much smaller
you<00:01:20.500> can<00:01:20.680> tell<00:01:20.920> here's<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.820> nice<00:01:22.149> area<00:01:22.180> some

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
you can tell here's the nice area some

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.219 
you can tell here's the nice area some
more<00:01:23.259> diamonds<00:01:23.410> coming<00:01:24.479> quite<00:01:25.479> a<00:01:25.509> diamond

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
more diamonds coming quite a diamond

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.650 
more diamonds coming quite a diamond
goes<00:01:26.619> very<00:01:27.009> very<00:01:27.280> quickly<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.790> this<00:01:28.119> as<00:01:28.300> quick

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
goes very very quickly to this as quick

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.050 
goes very very quickly to this as quick
as<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:28.899> could<00:01:28.960> get<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.380> go<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:30.759> I'll<00:01:30.850> show<00:01:31.030> you

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
as I could get to go here I'll show you

as I could get to go here I'll show you
the<00:01:31.479> first<00:01:32.050> kind<00:01:32.830> of<00:01:32.920> little<00:01:33.160> rough<00:01:33.420> version

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
of that thing you saw in the middle you

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.340 
of that thing you saw in the middle you
know<00:01:36.430> this<00:01:36.700> is<00:01:36.850> just<00:01:37.000> one<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:38.080> other<00:01:38.200> ones

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
know this is just one the other ones

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.130 
know this is just one the other ones
double<00:01:38.680> thick<00:01:38.860> as<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.790> can<00:01:39.940> tell<00:01:40.860> oops<00:01:41.860> sorry

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
double thick as you can tell oops sorry

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.350 
double thick as you can tell oops sorry
you<00:01:44.830> could<00:01:44.979> tell<00:01:45.190> it<00:01:45.580> moves<00:01:45.850> very<00:01:46.210> very

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
you could tell it moves very very

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.380 
you could tell it moves very very
quickly<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:47.410> dispenses<00:01:48.369> out<00:01:48.550> pretty<00:01:48.880> quick

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
quickly and dispenses out pretty quick

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.270 
quickly and dispenses out pretty quick
and<00:01:49.539> even<00:01:49.810> right<00:01:49.990> items<00:01:50.800> can<00:01:51.009> fall<00:01:51.250> through

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
and even right items can fall through

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.389 
and even right items can fall through
generally<00:01:52.180> you<00:01:52.509> can't<00:01:52.840> sometimes<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:54.190> fall

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
generally you can't sometimes the fall

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.919 
generally you can't sometimes the fall
through<00:01:54.610> right<00:01:54.759> in<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.000> hole<00:01:55.209> you're<00:01:55.600> very

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
through right in the hole you're very

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.620 
through right in the hole you're very
unlucky<00:01:56.500> but<00:01:56.890> don't<00:01:57.459> just<00:01:57.819> lie<00:01:57.940> on<00:01:58.209> top<00:01:58.300> like

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
unlucky but don't just lie on top like

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.130 
unlucky but don't just lie on top like
that<00:01:59.490> it's<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.700> very<00:02:01.209> very<00:02:01.509> very<00:02:01.840> cool

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
that it's a very very very cool

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.650 
that it's a very very very cool
invention<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.399> discovered<00:02:03.850> it's<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.420> I

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
invention that I discovered it's a I
