that's<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.829> light<00:00:44.070> version<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.629> has<00:00:45.809> the

to<00:00:54.510> emulate<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.989> look<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.350> feel<00:00:55.620> though

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to emulate the look and feel though

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.510

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
gonna be running lollipop um in final

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.340 
gonna be running lollipop um in final
form<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:52.060> we're<00:02:52.510> hoping<00:02:52.690> that's<00:02:52.930> gonna<00:02:53.170> be

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
form but we're hoping that's gonna be

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.910 
form but we're hoping that's gonna be
the<00:02:53.500> case<00:02:53.739> here<00:02:54.220> with<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.480> it's<00:02:56.470> powered<00:02:56.800> by

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
the case here with it so it's powered by

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.199 
the case here with it so it's powered by
a<00:02:57.569> Arctic<00:02:58.569> or<00:02:58.840> Qualcomm<00:02:59.410> Snapdragon<00:02:59.819> 615<00:03:00.819> chip

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
a Arctic or Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chip

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.509 
a Arctic or Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chip
so<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.290> little<00:03:02.440> bit<00:03:02.620> different<00:03:02.890> from<00:03:03.069> the

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
so it's a little bit different from the

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.640 
so it's a little bit different from the
p8<00:03:03.940> Lite<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.450> was<00:03:04.569> announced<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:05.200> few<00:03:05.440> days

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
p8 Lite that was announced a few days

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.580 
p8 Lite that was announced a few days
ago<00:03:06.010> which<00:03:06.310> was<00:03:06.459> using<00:03:06.819> Kirin<00:03:07.269> processor<00:03:08.019> so

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
ago which was using Kirin processor so

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.170 
ago which was using Kirin processor so
hopefully<00:03:08.890> that's<00:03:09.069> gonna<00:03:09.250> produce<00:03:09.519> better

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
hopefully that's gonna produce better

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.729 
hopefully that's gonna produce better
results<00:03:10.300> with<00:03:10.810> its<00:03:11.019> performance<00:03:11.380> and

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
results with its performance and

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.270 
results with its performance and
snappiness<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:13.450> whole<00:03:13.600> package<00:03:14.110> for
