but<00:03:19.909> the<00:03:20.030> only<00:03:20.180> downfall<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.989> see<00:03:21.319> is<00:03:21.500> thorn

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
but the only downfall I see is thorn

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.640 
but the only downfall I see is thorn
though<00:03:22.280> it's<00:03:22.879> not<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.150> big<00:03:23.450> deal<00:03:23.720> if<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.440> just

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
though it's not a big deal if you just

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.580 
though it's not a big deal if you just
leave<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.099> pot<00:03:25.310> alone<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.780> thorns<00:03:27.170> are<00:03:27.349> there

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
leave the pot alone the thorns are there

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.670 
leave the pot alone the thorns are there
and<00:03:28.040> it's<00:03:28.849> actually<00:03:29.239> protecting<00:03:29.959> itself<00:03:30.349> I

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
and it's actually protecting itself I

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.949 
and it's actually protecting itself I
suppose<00:03:30.980> from<00:03:31.370> anything<00:03:32.180> wanting<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.780> bother

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
suppose from anything wanting to bother

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.740 
suppose from anything wanting to bother
with<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:34.069> thorns<00:03:34.549> you<00:03:34.939> know<00:03:35.090> that's<00:03:35.480> their

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
with it the thorns you know that's their

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.680 
with it the thorns you know that's their
defense<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.400> think<00:03:37.549> that's<00:03:37.940> not<00:03:38.329> a<00:03:38.359> bad

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
defense so I think that's not a bad

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.979 
defense so I think that's not a bad
thing<00:03:39.019> I'm<00:03:39.769> not<00:03:40.040> usually<00:03:40.310> liking<00:03:41.030> plants<00:03:41.810> that

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
thing I'm not usually liking plants that

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.069 
thing I'm not usually liking plants that
