00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
flaps move up and down as well so you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.950 
flaps move up and down as well so you
can<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.100> more<00:01:23.490> dynamic<00:01:23.909> posing<00:01:24.390> he's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
can get more dynamic posing he's

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.120 
can get more dynamic posing he's
combined<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.979> Bionicle<00:01:26.850> system<00:01:27.330> and

combined of Bionicle system and
technique<00:01:29.130> pieces<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.439> he<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.790> again<00:01:32.790> another

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
technique pieces and he is again another

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.569 
technique pieces and he is again another
experiment<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.810> mixing<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.770> systems<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
experiment on mixing the systems and the
