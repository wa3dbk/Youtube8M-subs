00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
that's pretty much it I would transfer

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.260 
that's pretty much it I would transfer
this<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> smaller<00:02:08.560> container<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.310> less

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
this to a smaller container to a less

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.750 
this to a smaller container to a less
cumbersome<00:02:11.130> container<00:02:12.130> than<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.520> bag

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
cumbersome container than this bag

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.610 
cumbersome container than this bag

because<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.630> powder<00:02:58.900> sort<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.290> thing<00:02:59.500> but

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
because this is powder sort of thing but

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.220 
because this is powder sort of thing but
cocoa<00:03:00.070> powder<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.400> hard<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.700> get<00:03:00.989> stir<00:03:01.989> into

cocoa powder is hard to get stir into
the<00:03:02.470> liquid<00:03:02.799> itself<00:03:03.209> just<00:03:04.209> keep<00:03:04.360> working<00:03:04.660> it

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.550 

that's<00:03:09.910> one<00:03:10.269> spoonful<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.019> I'm<00:03:11.140> going<00:03:11.350> to<00:03:11.440> add

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
exact same thing it copies it right to

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.280 
exact same thing it copies it right to
the<00:04:23.940> water<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.419> just<00:04:24.570> kind<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:24.870> floats<00:04:25.110> the

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
the water it just kind of floats the

the water it just kind of floats the
right<00:04:25.410> there<00:04:25.590> on<00:04:25.680> top<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.400> can<00:04:29.430> just<00:04:29.700> grab

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
right there on top and you can just grab

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.630 
right there on top and you can just grab
a<00:04:29.880> teaspoon<00:04:30.390> and<00:04:30.900> just<00:04:30.960> gonna<00:04:31.370> grab<00:04:32.370> that<00:04:32.430> out

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
a teaspoon and just gonna grab that out

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.210 
a teaspoon and just gonna grab that out
with<00:04:32.940> that<00:04:33.090> this<00:04:33.960> is<00:04:34.260> perfectly<00:04:34.740> fine<00:04:35.010> though

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
with that this is perfectly fine though

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.840 
with that this is perfectly fine though
it<00:04:35.430> kind<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.640> looks<00:04:35.820> like<00:04:35.880> froth<00:04:36.180> on<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.390> top

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
it kind of looks like froth on the top

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.730 
it kind of looks like froth on the top
then<00:04:38.850> it's<00:04:39.000> actually<00:04:39.270> pretty<00:04:39.419> good<00:04:39.740> that's

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
then it's actually pretty good that's

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.030 
then it's actually pretty good that's
one<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.100> most<00:04:41.310> fun<00:04:42.320> parts<00:04:43.320> of<00:04:43.530> this<00:04:43.710> is

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
one of the most fun parts of this is

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.100 
one of the most fun parts of this is
just<00:04:44.940> seeing<00:04:45.150> how<00:04:45.300> much<00:04:45.450> doesn't<00:04:45.960> get

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
just seeing how much doesn't get
