00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.190
 all right 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.290
 hello this is the product that I use 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.890
 to blur tip I do not consider that 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.529
 be a necessary product that we have 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.169
 what to have but it facilitates your work 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.960
 I always use it but when I go to 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.719
 do a job like this translucent deal 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.460
 of this product is about putting a 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.130
 droplet in the on the little bank in the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.450
 step cited you leave it a minute and when 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:46.540
 come and limes blur the tip this 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.370
 it is not necessary as he told them but 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.110
 here starting on the set 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.760
 all the nails were different because of that 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.910
 I wanted to show him how I decorate with 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.570
 different clickers of silver tones 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.600
 only graphics but on the next nail 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.170
 which is the ring finger I wanted to make 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.470
 a half spiral style for this applied 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.159
 the acrylic a little bit wetter than 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.829
 usual 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.159
 and before I know I'm going to dial with 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.710
 my brush the waves of these are the 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.439
 spirals are the nut as you want 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.649
 say also figured as a screw 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:28.459
 a nut but I liked how it looked like that 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.709
 the ripple is on the nail called the 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:34.159
 attention and do not worry that there is no 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:37.099
 weak is quite strong I promise you 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.590
 the strips that we leave to the nail give 

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:42.920
 force if you want you can also 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.429
 encapsulate and well thin in the area 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.549
 that is sunk and then you pass the 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:53.329
 tri and you lower it a little bit I did pass 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.129
 by all pink acrylic nail like 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.110
 this translucent as he says 

00:01:55.129 --> 00:02:00.349
 encapsulating and then I marked with 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.739
 trip that after I show you the mixture 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:06.829
 that I used for the nails these are nothing 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:08.780
 more white acrylic a little bit of 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.069
 crystal acrylic to give 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.180
 Transparency and leaders of different 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.379
 silver sizes 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.930
 I really did not do this, I do not need 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:24.799
 teach them that it is something very simple 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.480
 a very simple mix and here in this 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.810
 part of the video for example this 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.849
 almond this mixture was difficult to 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.080
 control because they have a lot of wing 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.540
 Angel 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.760
 and that's why it goes size but it was a pink 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.200
 translucent with angel wing 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.709
 They were super decorated but from 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.709
 party would have liked perhaps there 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.530
 people who like the very simple and 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.769
 there are also times when it is required 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.909
 very simple is depends on your style and 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:03:00.079
 Well, your mood is the day of a wedding 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:03.090
 now we are going to apply this appointment network 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.020
 with pure resin of this that I used to 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.750
 paste the tips 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.330
 I apply it no matter how it is because 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.360
 that's nothing more than an effect that hardly 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.390
 you can see against the light it looks pretty 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.880
 but for example the photos if I was very 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.260
 Shining the glitter could not see 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.290
 necessarily here I am applying 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.380
 again that acrylic with angel wing 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.610
 that with the same battle and then I put 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.980
 a capita of white acrylic meet 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.780
 but very thin and then encapsulate 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.450
 it is translucent 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.470
 anyway we have already filed 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.420
 here we jump a part jack and 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.870
 I want you to see how I slime the 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.190
 spiral nail without facilitation is the same as 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.990
 forever 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.080
 I will go around the area of 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:58.450
 cuticle and in each 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:01.060
 ondita or in each rifle quoted that I did 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.120
 I'm going to put the thriller to mark those 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.220
 dating lines without leaving them too 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.490
 thin because we do not want him to leave 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.660
 to weaken the nail as in equal thickness 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:16.810
 it is polished and the nail is very good and strong 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.380
 Ready to decorate it 's all well I'm going 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:24.220
 to leave the video at the end is also 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.550
 a photo of the golden design that I brought 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.310
 in the right hand that is the same but 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.560
 obviously in golden tones the thumb is 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.960
 a little bit different but I do not show it 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.430
 I did not like how it was definitely 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.070
 I liked more the silver design 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.470
 the thumb was made more elaborate 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.320
 I stay with him when silver design 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.080
 but you will see it as always 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.410
