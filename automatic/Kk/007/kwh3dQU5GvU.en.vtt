aside somewhere and what you do with

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.229 
aside somewhere and what you do with
this<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:19.430> put<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.420> in<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:21.140> optic<00:02:21.500> extreme

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
this is you put it in the optic extreme

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.170 
this is you put it in the optic extreme
like<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:23.510> this<00:02:23.930> little<00:02:24.260> little<00:02:24.890> dip<00:02:25.640> curve

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
like that this little little dip curve

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.140 
like that this little little dip curve
things<00:02:26.540> go<00:02:27.290> on<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.440> outside<00:02:27.830> just<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:28.940> that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
things go on the outside just like that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.520 
things go on the outside just like that
so<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:30.650> looks<00:02:30.860> like<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.280> then<00:02:32.269> you<00:02:32.630> do<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.410> you

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
millimeter cameras and you just put that

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:49.000 
millimeter cameras and you just put that
on<00:02:42.260> like<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:45.640> screw<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:48.230> does

distortion on the edges and crab so yeah
um

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:52.510 

you

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.820 

you

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.380 

also<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:57.750> final<00:04:57.990> thing<00:04:58.380> is<00:04:58.410> uh<00:04:58.760> this<00:04:59.760> lens<00:05:00.150> is

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
also the final thing is uh this lens is

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.960 
also the final thing is uh this lens is
the<00:05:00.540> exact<00:05:00.930> same<00:05:01.200> ones<00:05:01.500> as<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.800> raynox<00:05:02.280> MX

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
the exact same ones as the raynox MX

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.100 
the exact same ones as the raynox MX
three<00:05:03.260> thousand<00:05:04.260> i<00:05:04.500> think<00:05:05.010> it<00:05:05.070> is<00:05:05.190> yeah<00:05:05.370> um

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
three thousand i think it is yeah um

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.870 
three thousand i think it is yeah um
then<00:05:07.110> you<00:05:07.530> can<00:05:07.680> everyone<00:05:08.430> calls<00:05:08.670> it<00:05:08.730> like<00:05:08.790> a

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
then you can everyone calls it like a

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.000 
then you can everyone calls it like a
ray<00:05:09.090> mod<00:05:09.330> once<00:05:09.570> they<00:05:09.750> bought<00:05:09.960> it<00:05:09.990> so<00:05:10.650> it's<00:05:10.830> the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
ray mod once they bought it so it's the

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.690 
ray mod once they bought it so it's the
same<00:05:11.220> exact<00:05:11.550> thing<00:05:11.820> basically<00:05:13.280> so<00:05:14.280> yeah<00:05:14.430> and

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
same exact thing basically so yeah and

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.000 
same exact thing basically so yeah and
it's<00:05:14.880> like<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.390> think<00:05:16.380> it's<00:05:16.470> like<00:05:16.590> sixty

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
it's like I think it's like sixty

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.190 
it's like I think it's like sixty
dollars<00:05:17.250> cheaper<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.910> extreme<00:05:18.900> is<00:05:19.020> like

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
dollars cheaper the extreme is like

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.980 
dollars cheaper the extreme is like
sixty<00:05:19.470> dollars<00:05:19.740> cheaper<00:05:19.920> than<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.810> great<00:05:21.810> mod

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
sixty dollars cheaper than the great mod

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.340 
sixty dollars cheaper than the great mod
so<00:05:22.650> this<00:05:23.580> is<00:05:23.730> basically<00:05:23.850> just<00:05:24.330> like<00:05:24.450> I<00:05:24.930> got

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
so this is basically just like I got

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.500 
so this is basically just like I got
this<00:05:25.500> lens<00:05:25.830> thinking<00:05:26.640> it's<00:05:26.910> not<00:05:27.060> gonna<00:05:27.180> it

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
this lens thinking it's not gonna it

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.570 
this lens thinking it's not gonna it
wasn't<00:05:27.750> going<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.900> be<00:05:27.960> 2y<00:05:28.620> just<00:05:28.950> like<00:05:29.100> the<00:05:29.280> rain

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
wasn't going to be 2y just like the rain

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.710 
wasn't going to be 2y just like the rain
ox<00:05:29.760> but<00:05:30.540> I<00:05:30.840> had<00:05:31.020> my<00:05:31.200> I'll<00:05:31.590> take<00:05:32.100> a<00:05:32.160> extreme<00:05:33.120> or
