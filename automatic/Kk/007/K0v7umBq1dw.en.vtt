the smaller the orders the less poses

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.820 
the smaller the orders the less poses
they're<00:06:35.969> going<00:06:36.149> to<00:06:36.209> want<00:06:36.300> to<00:06:36.449> go<00:06:36.599> from<00:06:36.899> which

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
you the smaller the order the more time

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.590 
you the smaller the order the more time
it<00:06:42.870> frees<00:06:43.320> up<00:06:43.590> for<00:06:44.100> you<00:06:44.280> the<00:06:44.670> less<00:06:44.940> you<00:06:44.970> have<00:06:45.540> to
