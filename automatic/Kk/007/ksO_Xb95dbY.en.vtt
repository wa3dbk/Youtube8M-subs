00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
breeds would you say that on the whole

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.760 
breeds would you say that on the whole
they<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.660> aware<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.410> problems<00:00:52.710> that

exist within their breed and are trying

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.600 
exist within their breed and are trying
to<00:00:54.420> solve<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.899> very<00:00:55.350> very<00:00:55.590> much<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.340> think

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
to solve them very very much so I think

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.389 
to solve them very very much so I think
in<00:00:56.789> earlier<00:00:57.149> days<00:00:57.500> people<00:00:58.500> tend<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> sweep

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
in earlier days people tend to sweep

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.889 
in earlier days people tend to sweep
things<00:00:59.550> under<00:00:59.730> public<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.600> didn't

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
things under public because they didn't

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.139 
things under public because they didn't
have<00:01:01.050> solutions<00:01:01.649> now<00:01:02.340> we've<00:01:02.550> got<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.910> many

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
have solutions now we've got so many

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.609 
have solutions now we've got so many

they're going to do something about the

they're going to do something about the

their eyes removed and we've now

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.720

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
that disease and all those breeds we've

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.820 
that disease and all those breeds we've
developed<00:02:53.250> some<00:02:53.810> simple<00:02:54.810> DNA<00:02:55.170> test<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.739> the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
developed some simple DNA test that the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.160 
developed some simple DNA test that the
breeders<00:02:56.190> can<00:02:56.370> use<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:57.480> really<00:02:57.600> minimize<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
breeders can use to really minimize the

breeders can use to really minimize the
risk<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.470> producing<00:02:58.950> dogs<00:02:59.310> ever<00:02:59.640> again<00:03:00.000> with

risk of producing dogs ever again with
that<00:03:00.690> condition<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.350> there's<00:03:01.470> at<00:03:01.530> least<00:03:01.560> 12

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
that condition and there's at least 12

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.400 
that condition and there's at least 12
reads<00:03:02.370> many<00:03:02.670> terrier<00:03:03.120> breeds<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:04.140> therefore

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
reads many terrier breeds and therefore

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.500 
reads many terrier breeds and therefore
now<00:03:04.500> benefiting<00:03:05.070> from<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.280> DNA<00:03:05.700> test<00:03:06.000> so

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
now benefiting from that DNA test so

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.030 
now benefiting from that DNA test so
that<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.720> can<00:03:06.870> scientifically<00:03:07.350> will<00:03:07.709> remove

do you think that the kennel club has

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.470 
do you think that the kennel club has
enough<00:03:16.890> authority<00:03:17.459> do<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.700> feel<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.269> you

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
enough authority do you feel that you

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.970 
enough authority do you feel that you
have<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.830> ability<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:21.000> kick<00:03:21.450> out<00:03:21.950> quite<00:03:22.950> a

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
have the ability to kick out quite a

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.560 
have the ability to kick out quite a
large<00:03:23.250> number<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.610> dogs<00:03:23.820> if<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.120> don't<00:03:24.330> think

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
large number of dogs if you don't think

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.590 
large number of dogs if you don't think
that<00:03:24.750> they<00:03:25.110> are<00:03:25.380> healthy<00:03:26.070> enough<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.550> I<00:03:27.300> think

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
that they are healthy enough and I think

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.150 
that they are healthy enough and I think
what<00:03:27.750> would<00:03:27.900> rather<00:03:28.140> do<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.800> that

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
what would rather do is that

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.490 
what would rather do is that
to<00:03:29.250> get<00:03:29.460> people<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.880> breathe<00:03:30.240> differently<00:03:30.810> and

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
to get people to breathe differently and

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.170 
to get people to breathe differently and
these<00:03:31.680> are<00:03:31.860> pet<00:03:32.040> dogs<00:03:32.250> first<00:03:32.490> and<00:03:32.790> foremost

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
these are pet dogs first and foremost

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.890 
these are pet dogs first and foremost
their<00:03:33.450> dogs<00:03:36.020> themselves<00:03:37.310> pets<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.900> important

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
their dogs themselves pets so important

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.690 
their dogs themselves pets so important
to<00:03:40.370> realize<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.820> they<00:03:42.330> are<00:03:42.830> we<00:03:43.830> want<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.160> mess

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
to realize that they are we want to mess

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.720 
to realize that they are we want to mess
with<00:03:45.240> us<00:03:45.270> because<00:03:45.750> we<00:03:46.410> kick<00:03:46.620> them<00:03:46.800> out<00:03:46.950> who<00:03:47.550> is

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
with us because we kick them out who is

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.460
