00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:33.050
 attempt finally fashion a tent and word 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.670
 coming from it's a part where maybe yes 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.859
 or no I will not realize the mob 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.219

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.289
 part whether or not I unlock them in 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.870

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.000

 and warren and in fact we were coming out of everything 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:59.510
 just a little this crime so I play 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.309
 alarm that is peace 90 m 1 I know 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.730
 that this weapon is not the armed the 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.040
 more complicated to play at all but the 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.840
 mode the ctfc completely different from 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.950
 other game modes the mentality is 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.570
 different all the players 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.450
 how to play everything is different in 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.570
 made in either game compared to a mmo 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.040
 classic or something else so I'm going 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.070
 introduce you my class my class is 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.840
 one is the pp 90 m to concentration 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.880
 extreme conditions good trigger 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.230
 dead silence in that it would be that I 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.180
 plays with specialists 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.100
 so what I had I 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.690
 assassin determination is aimed solid 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.180
 I know most of you 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.300
 who already know 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.820
 mimi and rainbow you will say but 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.010
 what are they doing alarm 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.260
 it is usually seen with a sniper 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.870
 or something like this finally wayne 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.370
 sniper and you will say but what is it 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.190
 that they fuck with a big enough and 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.000
 thin and that's not at all their style 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.100
 simply i will tell you i 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.900
 are you going to answer it? 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.990
 launched at the decerto a little bit these 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.530
 time 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.319
 before just before this part I had 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.510
 did a little we had done a little 4 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.870
 against 4 months I was facing them 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.140
 I was with other friends and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.290
 I was facing my mirambeaux hills and 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.470
 warren warren who is a bit of our 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.670
 coach let's say from decerto we 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.500
 learn a little bit about how we're going to do 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.750
 knowing that I had asked me 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.620
 if he could take a little rules 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.500
 etc., etc 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.080
 and it is with pleasure that he accepted and 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.870
 so we had done some games 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.230
 in private for four against four 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.209
 with decerto rules and that's not it 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.340
 worse it's not so bad for 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.730
 I finally did a good job 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.239
 part 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.500
 I had a little purple we will say 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.090
 and by the way I'm sorry if you 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.459
 hear some noise behind kind of 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.630
 of shortness of breath in front of web enough that's 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.310
 con all that I have said and 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.870
 it's up to a fucking kim fire 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.299
 storm at home we do not know there is 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.400
 wind blowing in Basel and suddenly it 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.540
 starts to break my balls 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.730
 to hear the wind blowing and I believe 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.840
 that I did not see sleep this afternoon 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.730
 yes because I had a little party 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.130
 because I'm tired because I 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.350
 go out of course me it's wednesday 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.120
 currently checked the video just before 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.190
 that you see it you see it yourself 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.329
 watch this video passage there I 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.030
 were looking for a little the enemy I was finding 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.200
 no and there you were in the corner was dead in 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.480
 same time I had paralyzed him from the blow 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.000
 that's it then I'm sorry if ever 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.739
 you have if you hear the wind 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.640
 blow because it's true it's 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.980
 pretty awesome brief so I believe 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.440
 that I answered yeah to the why of 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.209
 how to play me alarm and rambo but 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.540
 that's it now that the 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.069
 gameplay has advanced quite a bit I do not know 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.829
 do I say yes or no 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.239
 I managed the kid I do not answer you 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.810
 go we'll leave a little bit 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:02.010
 advanced gameplay in passing and and 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.560
 warren who was in the snipe he was doing a 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.389
 attempt mob also my exit 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.519
 finally he was like that quietly 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.490
 they smelled show with his sniper and he 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.830
 get me out 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.450
 yeah buddies who's the best or 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.070
 sniper actually it's a weapon of nimes 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.100
 that and all to laugh of course that he 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.780
 said that and he says I'm going to do the 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.820
 mob he was soon one does not prevent 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.130
 that he was even score that I believe 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.550
 that there I was and at 13.0 I know more 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.360
 exactly 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.740
 and you will see if he will succeed 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.820
 or not 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.930
 I do not know I'm going to look at the bar 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.530
 fid if ever his name my name 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.000
 appears 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.890
 if we succeed in Russia 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.660
 you'll see well and then that's it 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.070
 see her half and half henkel I think 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.130
 it's just after he's going to get killed 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.340
 not even good damage I had thought 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.000
 it was there then well as cetef the 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.300
 rain sensor 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.210
 I think you must have seen a lot 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.860
 finally not bad a little bit to 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.120
 whoever sent them he was disgusted 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.680
 there they were they really had 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.700
 want to whine on the spot I think 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.680
 that you of recent times you have 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.210
 had a lot of youtube hours doing 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.220
 finally one or two multi to more or 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.940
 less known as you know 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.140
 maybe white eagle 2 years old who is a 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.060
 smaller youtuber I'll put that 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.960
 can be bought from the description that made 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.420
 a little mob on the map and run it's 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.460
 that or that's not it I do not know anymore 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.690
 spider pig 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.980
 I do not think I know any shorter I 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.470
 will tell you simply if yes or 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.970
 no I managed the mob his chain will be 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.710
 in the scripts sion I cut myself 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.420
 in passing you see that I am a little 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.730
 discreet and the other that arouses in not 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.140
 understood why the flag I them 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:46.270
 bring me there I tell myself if we are here but 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.470
 billion brought flag I was 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.210
 exactly I think we'll see the 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.200
 score his record is there right now 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.330
 after which after cam beautiful 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.860
 I know I think I was at 19.0 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.690
 we'll see that right now 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.600
 and yes I was 19.0 so that's it 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.500
 on that we split up on this score and at 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.500
 the next everyone lease
