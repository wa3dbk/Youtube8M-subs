00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.950
 the last I notice of the apple year we 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.519
 leaves several great ads 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.370
 transcendence new macbook macbook pro 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.040
 and a mac pro of the most futuristic but 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.380
 let's be realistic and let's say that at least 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.110
 among the mass of apple fans the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.210
 most anticipated ad and see without a doubt the 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.730
 of the new ipad 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.070
 ipad r remember that name because it is 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.169
 how abel has called his new tablet 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.750
 basing the term on them 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.890
 arguments that in the case of the macbook 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.650
 air the lightness and thinness of them 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.320
 the ipad air responds more or less to what 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.140
 that was already rumored months ago 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.629
 first your screen as you already 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.030
 we counted the front part weeks ago 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.519
 of ipad air happens to be like the ipad 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.390
 mini apple has reduced at the edges 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:01.149
 side by 43% doing that the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.850
 device reduce its dimensions the 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.960
 design is really beautiful to the purest 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.450
 Apple company style 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.520
 going to the hardware section between 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.049
 features of ipad air we see 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.030
 also coincidences with the 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.640
 leaks that have been coming to 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.460
 dropper first thing the processor 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.850
 as expected the ipad air equips the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.960
 chip 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.360
 7 64 bit used by the iphone 5 s 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.479
 this is a huge increase in 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.570
 power with respect to ipad 4 also 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.409
 your gpu has been reinforced now we can 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.700
 work with 3d graphics with a fluency 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.030
 surprising considering that 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.729
 we talk about a tablet 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.190
 the new shock also brings something more 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.350
 of autonomy to ipad 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.720
 apple ensures that we can be ten 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.590
 hours watching videos with a 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.830
 single charge 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.470
 the ipad is renewed then with a new and 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.350
 functional design much more power a 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.509
 64-bit architecture that optimizes 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.909
 in case the performance more autonomy and 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.239
 a remarkable reduction of dimensions and 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:14.560
 weight leaving these 675 millimeters of 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:18.340
 thickness and 453 grams of weight the price 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.440
 of ipad air is therefore 499 euros 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.140
 for the most basic version 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.230
 the lte model of lower capacity part 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.080
 of 629 euros and has planned its 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.580
 departure for November 1 also in 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.580
 Spain 'guys, what do you think?
