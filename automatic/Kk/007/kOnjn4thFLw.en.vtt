00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.580
 hey here is from all about samsung today 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.320
 has me something very exclusive and exclusive 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.610
 Although at the time where the video here 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.929
 the thing is not even created 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.310
 announced this is the brand new one 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.310
 samsung ssd 840 per so it is the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.720
 the successor to the samsung series 830 is 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.210
 you were very successful 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.699
 but that was not perfect in the tests 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.019
 was there such a few small mistakes 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.460
 That was the case 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.559
 once the high power consumption in the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.750
 Compared to the competition and that was 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.110
 also the relatively strong heat development 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.960
 and both samsung actually has itself 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.460
 Looked at and changed and the result 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.930
 of the whole is the new samsung 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.730
 series 840 pro ssd good thing is more 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.129
 or less the new rolls royce below 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.379
 the ssds for the first time in the design 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.579
 Samsung has with the 830 he say we 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.590
 have created the cool that looks 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.020
 Very good and the people in chic 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.000
 i mean ssd the thing he disappears 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.470
 in the pc after that, there's never anyone but 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.309
 on samsung has come here again 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.020
 given a little more 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.290
 You have this mat up here 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.090
 metal then you have this bare 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.840
 knew which one had also with the 830 had 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.939
 and on the back 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.020
 I do not believe the plastic I know 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.340
 in any case , he is pretty 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.920
 easy are a total of 54 grams 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.780
 in the end, in the laptop stand 123 grams 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.939
 more or less neither but it is 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.040
 very light and therefore suitable 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.689
 such a ssd as here the 840 prodi 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.460
 new, of course, excellent for the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.259
 use for example servers lower 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.390
 Power consumption low heat generation 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.530
 and then for a very long time 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.750
 lifetime at a very high 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.210
 speed because that says samsung 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.810
 itself is 540 megabytes per 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.579
 second 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.930
 Küssel and I have just in one 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.970
 benchmark tested we are even up 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.070
 560 m megabytes per second at the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.420
 reading speed started my 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.090
 Write speed why do we do it then? 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.250
 are around 500 megabyte per second the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.869
 course laboratory values ​​in the daily 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.479
 Practice is usually lower because 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.460
 There are rarely large files of 8 GB 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.290
 which one writes with particular blog 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.560
 sizes but mostly are so small 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.550
 40 50 mb files you write there is 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.929
 the speed of course one 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.700
 others but that's a thing of the kind 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.300
 is just such a benchmark problem 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.560
 that's why i hold it is so much 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.390
 in daily use the thing is up 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.750
 every case killer as fast as he gives me 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.970
 Now windows 8 in the 64 bit 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.600
 version on popped a professional 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:30.010
 version 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:32.170
 and enough talk that's what we have to do 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.500
 have 840 per time here at the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.320
 system connected and start from the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.000
 Now, just windows 8 are now 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.650
 professional in the 64 bit version on it 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.110
 Of course, you can do it a bit over 10 o'clock 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.070
 the bâloise but overall it starts 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.770
 ding it quite quickly that they 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.780
 Somehow it was 14 15 seconds what 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.250
 Definitely a good value - eighth 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.290
 the whole thing already accelerated anyway 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.820
 but the ssd then brings again a 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.260
 bit out so you are now at 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.840
 start process because you can not anymore 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.520
 of course, complaining is difficult too 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.780
 show how fast a ssd is that 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.670
 you notice everything in daily life 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.010
 use if you use it if he so 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.260
 then uses a series 48 pro notes 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.180
 everything just opens up fast and easy 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.350
 you have no problems about one 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.820
 browser and so on everything goes completely 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.100
 fast but of course you can do it too 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.900
 on a showed and pure pay 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.760
 somehow be limited there with us 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.900
 in the blog post 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.640
 some results just look 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.310
 I have my mine here 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.950
 christel disc market 3.0 is a 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.110
 benchmark tool for a ssd and that 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.380
 we can now just once with 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.030
 a size of 2000 gb 2000 mw once 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.150
 go through and then show the result 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.650
 just how fast the ssd is 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.060
 not the most optimal conditions though 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.739
 it's pretty good in the first one 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.840
 impression of how fast 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.400
 the ssds at the reds so at the 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.260
 Reading speed is then so 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.580
 at 510 500 15 megabytes and at the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.410
 write speed which is an 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.510
 a bit below but not like at 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.270
 the cheap ssds that you really have 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.940
 drops to somehow only 260 mb 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.370
 or so but here you stay with 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.930
 500 500 5 mb here of course in the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.720
 benchmark that was not optimal then 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.580
 only 460 400 560 mb are left 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.840
 that values ​​are like very good and above 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.850
 you will see all things afterwards afterwards 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.000
 in the line because it's the speed 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.709
 for very small files of 4 kb that is 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.150
 for such a ssd quasi high work was 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.070
 write me a lot of small files 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.020
 must and for the access time is very 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.400
 important and this needs with the 830 he 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.000
 have you been very good? 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.560
 It 's also extremely good here 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.450
 That's why you still get on then 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.030
 a write speed of over 30 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.100
 mb and a reading speed of 50 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.690
 60 mb / s are values ​​that are very good 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.690
 Here you see one now 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.150
 write speed even of 470 mw 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.920
 or 474 mb which is really not for this 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.230
 optimal am already pretty good value 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.770
 is , of course, only pay and his 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.640
 benchmark 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.640
 I mean the thing is no one dares 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.410
 benchmark you do not fake yourself 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.600
 the best impression of such a ssd den 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.980
 gets her naturally in the text app on 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.690
 that is when your program opens and 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.950
 so on if you're working with it 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.510
 everything just goes a bit 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.460
 liquid from the hand everything swallows 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.630
 as evasion and programs open up 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.250
 especially faster were also big ones 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.230
 programs and now if you want to 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.970
 example, decompress files with 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.290
 winrar or something , that works too 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.910
 faster by the hand those are so 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.940
 things where the sds really strengthen theirs 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.470
 can play and if it is her 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.660
 when the benchmark is first through 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.770
 then you see a result that finds 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.000
 Then you also have one with us 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.680
 Blogbeitrag sets you with 517 mb s 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.390
 write speed 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.270
 reading speed and 474 mb s 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.220
 write speed you can on 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.720
 live every case 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.090
 that is, as I said, the highest performance 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.729
 line that's 31 mb s 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.860
 write speed 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.729
 reading speed and 450 mb s 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.930
 write speed 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.030
 my goodness now everything comes 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.800
 confused but as I said the best 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.479
 then war program started by the 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.520
 and now we just have one 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.840
 few programs installed on windows 8 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.729
 that is, if we are such a mozilla 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.590
 firefox thunderbird teamviewer skype what 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.240
 One too adobe reader is a park 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.100
 programs with which we have a party here 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.340
 put on and the dust me now easy 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.370
 and you are currently watching 15 programs 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.560
 within three and a half seconds 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.580
 four seconds maybe start there 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.229
 needs a bit longer because of that 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.520
 load module but that was it 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.140
 already all programs are here now 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.270
 started immediately that is very fast 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.350
 by hand and by the program like gimp 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.870
 and so on maybe there 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.790
 some of you know how slow that is 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.550
 some opens or adobe reader 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.490
 that's here with the series 840 pro ssd 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:36.039
 So the samsung really happened 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.039
 series 840 ps damn fast 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:42.379
 So samsung series let 840 per ssd 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.449
 Samsung truly make a 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:46.819
 quite a bit presented the rolls 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.340
 royce or ssds is damn fast and 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:51.949
 especially very durable he will be me 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.930
 was or is not really warm and needs 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.219
 relatively little power for server and such 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.620
 far that the thing is a really good one 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:59.180
 thing anyway the thing is really great 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.919
 and I hope the review has you 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.569
 Please, if you have any questions 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.620
 skin pour into us in the comments and 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:04.340
 We're gonna try that somehow too 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.319
 answer 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.960
 at the time when you see the video 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:10.430
 i am currently traveling in korea and i can 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.439
 you maybe directly from the source 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.029
 Report what the thing can do where the
