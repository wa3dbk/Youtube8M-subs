00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:07.866
 I tried to listen best and tried to get into the melody. 

00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:11.866
 I was trying to play this huge forehead, but I didn't do it much. 

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:18.832
 It's up to me to play in this symphony because it must be my destiny. 

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:23.666
 And that's what my cutiemark says to me. 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.100
 I play a bunch of loud music and all the one toned Wuby. 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.100
 But no matter how hard I try, the audience does not show any love. 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.166
 I'm sure I can do it over time, because as you can see, it must be my destiny. 

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:44.166
 And that's what my cutiemark says to me. 

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:50.633
 I have mopped up all these sweets, but I think it's just a waste of time. 

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:55.399
 I don't have a lot of trouble with flavors, but I always bust my basses. 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.566
 I have to be a Ponyville confectioner because it is my destiny. 

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:06.799
 And that's what my cutiemark says to me. 

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:12.966
 I'm trying to play my harp here, but it's just a laugh. 

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:16.966
 I have to play with her hooves because I'm not a unicorn. 

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:20.966
 Perhaps it should be so that the audience prefer to run away, 

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:27.999
 My fate isn't nice, but it's what my cutiemark says to me. 

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:34.166
 My cutiemark are bubbles. I don't know what went wrong. 

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:39.166
 I can't get these letters to those they belong to. 

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:43.532
 Your mailbox has broken and I hope you will forgive me. 

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.733
 It has to be... 

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.766
 ... my destiny. 

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:51.766
 And that's what my cutiemark ... 

00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:55.766
 Yes, that's what my cutiemark says to me. 

00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:00.199
