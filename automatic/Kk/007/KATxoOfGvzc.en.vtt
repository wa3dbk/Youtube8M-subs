00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.540
 hi we are all here with a new one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.970
 video of gta 5 indeed the first video of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.550
 gta 5 on playstation 4 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.519
 in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:18.449
 to always receive the brand new car 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.810
 present on next gen over there code for 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.060
 we should have some small ones 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.880
 step that now I'll show you then 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.150
 the first is to do the mission with tonia 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.949
 that this woman here with franklin then 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.920
 in front of Franklin's house she will be there 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.000
 you can find it through believe a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.780
 question mark and it will be you who will do you 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.879
 make a special delivery practically 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.289
 you will have to take the tow truck to 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.430
 take on a car they tell you 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:57.510
 they come back and deliver it to the garage 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.190
 now I'll show you that tow 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.940
 we call the car until 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.680
 deposit and then finish the mission 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.680
 therefore rather inexistent 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:15.890
 ok now we have arrived at the depot 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.299
 we leave the car and finish the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.719
 mission the mission is called as 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.789
 you can see it is called a favor 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.560
 and this is a necessary mission for 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.959
 to be able to have the car once 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.600
 you have completed the mission you can 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:38.030
 immediately go to this point near 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.599
 the sandy onlus landing runway 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.220
 so the desert is here near where 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:46.130
 cars are modified at santos 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.099
 customs there will be a blue dot and in the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.709
 in the aid you will be told that 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:56.289
 hasan andrea many things happen and that 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:02:00.200
 so you will have to go and see 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.030
 approach the blue dot and find 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.929
 the car immediately the new machine 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.929
 modified 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.310
 all you need to do now enter 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.700
 in the vehicle and trying to escape is not 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.959
 not at all difficult with this vehicle 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.690
 try to escape from truck drivers 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.209
 crazy that they will try to kill me and 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.739
 and I didn't know this thing yet 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.980
 so I was surprised when a 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.980
 truck cut me off 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.150
 anyway this is over there 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.359
 modified this model is not 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.650
 editable by santos customs 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:39.220
 in fact it will be so stop and cannot 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.260
 be modified further and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.049
 inside you see a cylinder of the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.370
 of nitro but still does nothing 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.959
 therefore it is not clear why they have it 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.120
 mass 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.030
 now I'll show you where to find it later 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.459
 that you will have lost it for the first time there 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.400
 are two places it could be 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:02.030
 indeed it is certainly almost certainly the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.760
 vehicle after doing all the steps 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.980
 and this is one area here now 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.319
 hold before me by one of 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.040
 these are called instructors for 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.730
 oil 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:18.829
 Something like this is the car here 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.599
 below and I took this one 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.639
 in the other location and also found 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.829
 so I think there will be 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.000
 practically always 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.090
 once you have done it correctly 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.239
 so this was the first steps 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.519
 place is this the second is the first one 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:40.400
 place is therefore close to the place 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:43.970
 of the airport and while it is located 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.750
 here in the nearby tip south of the map 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.849
 near the port and this is the true 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.940
 city ​​and this is where it is 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.419
 will find the duke changed to duke on 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.480
 That 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:58.730
 this is a warehouse you see around here 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.069
 there is this right here to make you understand 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:07.069
 where you can find it and it's inside 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.959
 of this shed and here it is 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:17.539
 these are the two places you can 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:21.620
 just be found and let's say it is 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.270
 fast when you use the lights 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.810
 dazzling will rise and yes 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:30.740
 will lower some of the covers ago 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.409
 very cool here is good so I hope the 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.930
 video you enjoyed put a like if 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.699

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.620

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.750
 that will come in the coming days and in the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.550
 coming months thanks for 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.270
 displaying goodbye to a
