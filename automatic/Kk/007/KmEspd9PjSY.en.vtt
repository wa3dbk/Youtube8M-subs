00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.640 
Yuki and eyelid
it<00:00:26.580> only<00:00:26.760> comes<00:00:27.029> with<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> UK<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.590> I've

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
it only comes with the UK one so I've

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.950 
it only comes with the UK one so I've
decided<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.160> put<00:00:29.279> an<00:00:29.400> Irish<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.119> well<00:00:30.330> just

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
decided to put an Irish one as well just

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.810 
decided to put an Irish one as well just
so<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.170> matches<00:00:31.349> up<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.189> rest<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.489> them<00:00:32.610> I

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
so it matches up with the rest of them I

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.930 
so it matches up with the rest of them I
think<00:00:33.660> it's<00:00:33.809> our<00:00:33.930> Holland<00:00:34.170> anyway<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.880> is

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
