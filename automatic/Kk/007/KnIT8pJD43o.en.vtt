00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the problem with that is once you find

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.860 
the problem with that is once you find
one<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:41.070> back<00:00:41.700> out<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.149> confirm<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
one you have to back out and confirm the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.389 
one you have to back out and confirm the
virus<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.980> once<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.370> find<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.879> show<00:00:45.059> you

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
virus but once I find one I can show you

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.150 
virus but once I find one I can show you
like<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.640> see<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> confirm<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.410> if

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
like that see you have to confirm it if

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.180 
like that see you have to confirm it if

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
you do not confirm it it will not count

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.770 
you do not confirm it it will not count
