00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
to see how well the gorilla glass 4 on

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.869 
to see how well the gorilla glass 4 on
the<00:00:36.420> s6<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.260> actually<00:00:37.770> withstand<00:00:38.250> damage

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the s6 can actually withstand damage

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:39.889 
the s6 can actually withstand damage
because<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> lot<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.300> people<00:00:39.390> don't<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:39.719> to

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
because a lot of people don't like to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.900 
because a lot of people don't like to
use<00:00:39.930> cases<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.219> basically<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910

you say face down face down so we're

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
you say face down face down so we're
going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.809> drop<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.079> face<00:00:58.469> down<00:00:58.500> from<00:00:59.309> waist

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
going to drop it face down from waist

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.020 
going to drop it face down from waist
height<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.899> nx1<00:01:01.500> recording<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.309> 120

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
height I have my nx1 recording it in 120

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.109 
height I have my nx1 recording it in 120
frames<00:01:03.180> per<00:01:03.329> second<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.159> 1080p<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.939> that's

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
frames per second in 1080p so that's

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.789 
frames per second in 1080p so that's
going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.360> capture<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> drop<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.770> course

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
going to capture the drop and of course

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.870 
going to capture the drop and of course
you're<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.310> able<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> witness<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
you're going to be able to witness to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.980 
you're going to be able to witness to
drop<00:01:09.119> through<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.880> waist<00:01:11.880> height<00:01:12.090> face

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
drop through this so waist height face

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.649 
drop through this so waist height face
face<00:01:13.500> down<00:01:13.850> one<00:01:14.850> two<00:01:15.570> three

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.109 

okay<00:01:22.469> so<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.859> see<00:01:23.039> a<00:01:23.280> waist<00:01:23.729> height

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
okay so you can see a waist height

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.870 
okay so you can see a waist height
facedown<00:01:24.960> pretty<00:01:25.829> much<00:01:26.039> shattered<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
facedown pretty much shattered the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.669 
facedown pretty much shattered the
entire<00:01:27.499> screen<00:01:28.499> here<00:01:29.960> but<00:01:30.960> since<00:01:31.439> it's

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
entire screen here but since it's

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.020 
entire screen here but since it's
already<00:01:31.829> broken<00:01:32.219> we<00:01:32.399> might<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.640> well<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:32.880> what

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
already broken we might as well see what

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.370 
already broken we might as well see what
we<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.270> accomplish<00:01:33.509> from<00:01:34.009> shoulder<00:01:35.009> height

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
we can accomplish from shoulder height

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.690 
we can accomplish from shoulder height
so<00:01:37.380> let's<00:01:37.709> go<00:01:37.829> ahead<00:01:37.859> and<00:01:38.039> drop<00:01:38.250> at<00:01:38.429> shoulder

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
so let's go ahead and drop at shoulder

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.949 
so let's go ahead and drop at shoulder
height<00:01:38.729> down<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> damage

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
height down but you can see the damage

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.010 
height down but you can see the damage
here<00:01:40.319> so<00:01:41.189> try<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:41.969> keep<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.390> mind<00:01:42.719> when<00:01:42.899> we

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
here so try to keep that in mind when we

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.109 
here so try to keep that in mind when we
drop<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.380> again<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.429> let's<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:44.819> ahead<00:01:44.849> and<00:01:44.969> drop

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
drop it again so let's go ahead and drop

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.699 
drop it again so let's go ahead and drop
it<00:01:45.270> again<00:01:45.329> ok<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.109> now<00:01:47.009> shoulder<00:01:47.579> height

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
it again ok so now shoulder height

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.050 
it again ok so now shoulder height
however<00:01:49.709> you<00:01:49.859> want<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.039> drop<00:01:50.219> it<00:01:50.429> it<00:01:50.789> doesn't

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
too bad it was just only around the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.600 
too bad it was just only around the
display<00:05:01.770> phone<00:05:02.770> definitely<00:05:03.220> does<00:05:03.310> not<00:05:03.430> turn
