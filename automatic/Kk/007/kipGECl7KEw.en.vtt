00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.389
 the fundamental element of both the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.580
 publicity like public relations 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.589

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.209
 distinctive products 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.820
 services that you are going to advertise or that 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.250
 let's communicate then curiosity is 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.850
 something fundamental what this says 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.690
 university is fundamentally its value 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.000
 humanist is to say 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.700
 both in terms of the values that 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.770
 inculcates as the personalized treatment that 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.720

 team we are talking about a graduate 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.150
 first with values because a 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.210
 communication without values really not 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.289
 it serves for nothing to whose experience 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.969
 enhanced through the agreements of 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.769
 practices that we have the conventions of 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.289
 internationalization that we have then 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.870
 that experience is anchored in what 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.180
 really asks the entrepreneur and a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.070
 world around you 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.040
 try to reinterpret reality 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.900

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.120
 human because knowing well the being 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.400
