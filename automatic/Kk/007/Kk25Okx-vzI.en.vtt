pattern<00:02:12.150> required<00:02:12.600> for<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:12.989> stripes<00:02:13.290> but

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
pattern required for the stripes but

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.170 
pattern required for the stripes but
when<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.070> actually<00:02:14.100> comes<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.670> physically

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
when it actually comes to physically

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.780 
when it actually comes to physically
putting<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.690> stripes<00:02:16.019> on<00:02:16.489> like<00:02:17.489> not<00:02:17.670> with

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
putting the stripes on like not with

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.670 
putting the stripes on like not with
tape<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.299> with<00:02:18.450> paint<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.109> things<00:02:19.440> like<00:02:19.620> that

tape but with paint and things like that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.069 
tape but with paint and things like that
it's<00:02:20.519> all<00:02:20.730> done<00:02:20.970> by<00:02:21.150> hand<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.720> if<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.930> look

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
it's all done by hand like if you look

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.710 
it's all done by hand like if you look
at<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.290> in<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.470> light<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.459> can<00:02:23.700> see<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.359> won't

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
at it in the light you can see I won't

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.970 
at it in the light you can see I won't
be<00:02:24.780> able<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.989> catch<00:02:25.109> you<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.350> camera<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.859> have

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
be able to catch you on camera you have

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.160 
be able to catch you on camera you have
to<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.610> prove<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.150> but<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.989> can

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
to have one to prove it but you can

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.350 
to have one to prove it but you can
really<00:02:28.319> see<00:02:28.550> somewhat<00:02:29.550> places<00:02:30.000> where<00:02:30.150> there

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
really see somewhat places where there

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.940 
really see somewhat places where there
is<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
is the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.710

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
your E string from a e down to D by

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.600 
your E string from a e down to D by
literally<00:03:12.110> if<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.319> just<00:03:12.500> press<00:03:12.739> down<00:03:12.799> but

literally if you just press down but

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.180 
literally if you just press down but
pull<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.880> out<00:03:13.970> like<00:03:14.450> that<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.870> then<00:03:15.860> obviously

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
pull it out like that and then obviously

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.280 
pull it out like that and then obviously
push<00:03:16.640> down<00:03:16.849> push<00:03:17.299> it<00:03:17.390> back<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.660> for<00:03:18.019> it<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.170> work

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
push down push it back in for it to work

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.120 
push down push it back in for it to work
we<00:03:18.590> also<00:03:18.980> we<00:03:19.099> have<00:03:19.190> one<00:03:19.340> control<00:03:19.750> which<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:20.780> a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
we also we have one control which is a

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.069 
we also we have one control which is a
tone<00:03:22.130> knob<00:03:22.160> well<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.150> says<00:03:23.450> it's<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.690> tone<00:03:23.870> knob

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
tone knob well it says it's a tone knob

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.380 
tone knob well it says it's a tone knob
it's<00:03:24.319> actually<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> volume<00:03:24.980> knob<00:03:25.130> what<00:03:26.060> the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
it's actually a volume knob what the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.640 
it's actually a volume knob what the
reason<00:03:26.630> why<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.750> label<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.170> tone<00:03:27.349> knob<00:03:27.530> is

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
reason why is label the tone knob is

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.100 
reason why is label the tone knob is
because<00:03:27.920> Van<00:03:28.099> Halen<00:03:28.579> when<00:03:29.209> obviously<00:03:29.630> play

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
because Van Halen when obviously play

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.610 
because Van Halen when obviously play
he's<00:03:30.319> off<00:03:30.560> yes<00:03:31.630> what<00:03:32.630> he<00:03:32.690> does<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.230> when<00:03:33.500> he's

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
he's off yes what he does is when he's

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.400 
he's off yes what he does is when he's
playing<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:34.099> really<00:03:34.790> distorted<00:03:35.209> riff<00:03:35.480> so<00:03:36.170> take

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
playing a really distorted riff so take

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.199 
playing a really distorted riff so take
for<00:03:36.590> instance<00:03:36.650> he<00:03:36.889> could<00:03:37.040> be<00:03:37.130> playing<00:03:37.370> Panama

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
for instance he could be playing Panama

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.940 
for instance he could be playing Panama
and<00:03:38.600> then<00:03:38.720> he<00:03:38.780> gets<00:03:38.959> like<00:03:39.109> really<00:03:39.139> quiet<00:03:39.590> part

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
and then he gets like really quiet part

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.280 
and then he gets like really quiet part
in<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.100> middle<00:03:40.340> what<00:03:40.819> you'll<00:03:40.970> do<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.450> back

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
in the middle what you'll do is back

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.800 
in the middle what you'll do is back
this<00:03:42.530> off<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:43.489> clean<00:03:43.700> out<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:43.910> sound<00:03:44.269> then

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
this off to clean out a sound then

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.569 
this off to clean out a sound then
you'll<00:03:44.959> get<00:03:45.079> a<00:03:45.109> really<00:03:45.290> really<00:03:45.560> nice<00:03:45.769> oh<00:03:46.040> no
