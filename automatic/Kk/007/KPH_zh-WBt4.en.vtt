00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.850
 Hello everyone, this time we will learn a very simple effect 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.919
 trade - m 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.109
 black and white and you highlight 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.589
 using the most expensive highlighted certain aspects of the photo 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.220
 yes the color 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.339
 weighed in the result 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.529
 we want to have 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.529
 well for it the issues of doing 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.519
 is to have our picture 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.480
 in this case we will duplicate it so as not to lose the content of the photograph 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.490
 the original i go to image adjustments 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.360
 and just input is this option that existing saturate 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.260
 and added the source 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.990
 thor was in black and white 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.750
 what they are going to do now is create a mask 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.860
 and about this mask 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.810
 with our 6 pib 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.020
 we will urge 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.750
 in black 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.990
 about the layers that we want to be in color 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.010
 in this case for example 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.010
 paint on our site 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.790
 our fish 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.150
 If you did not activate the mask 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.180
 we had previously seen in the background that is black 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.650
 black rose 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.980
 we do with our fish in green 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.980
 continue in color 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.810
 and that our lyrics 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.190
 a sign of this store also 100 color 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.490
 as you see it is very easy simply 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.280
 irala optional to saturate 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.050
 and then with the brush 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.340
 painting on the mask 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 we erase the part that we do not want and it is candle 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.420
 bottom that exists is in color 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.769
 good legislator form 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.969
 quick just to see everything there is observed 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.789
 the final effect 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.789
 the interesting thing is to learn to play with a mask 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.299
 to create before for example this example sector though and black and color 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.769
 contrast between whites and blacks 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.769
 it's a very simple matter 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:33.769
 but community I have told you what interests me is that the pact is learned to 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.509
 use the maximum anp 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.549
 on this occasion for example I 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.109
 the painted 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.109
 outside attack to the bids to be 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:46.809
 If I'm wrong, all they do is change to white and paint over 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:49.659
 dangerous 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.979
 what we do not want 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.979
 and automatically according to the counts 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.449
 the Basque what it does is teach what is black and hide the white part 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.219
 as simple as that we could play with grays 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:09.999
 to show 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:11.989
 a part 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.989
 blurred 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.069
 well we continue in this lower part 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.889
 of our signs as I say 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.309
 to a very fast way 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.309
 just for you to see 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.069
 the final effect 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:54.969
 you have to have the final effect 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.969
 to me what we can do that place of 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.499
 to create is not capable as nothing 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:05.499
 First 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:09.839
 we can putra double to not lose information 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.389
 equally and they will go 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.799
 my settings image 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.319
 of saturated to get it in black and white and what we have to do 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:20.870
 now other actions 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.300
 with our magic wand for example, session 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.059
 everything we want 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:32.059
 kristen color 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.059
 froome at 20 hours 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.659
 an user 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.400
 just so you can see another where to go 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.400
 play with the mask 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.650
 with the mask 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.559
 we keep our 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:03.459
 our PCs simply injured with the PCs selector what we have to 

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:06.409
 to do is to invest 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.330
 safety pin 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.249
 invest stressed 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:13.249
 selection 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.059
 now we can create 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:19.509
 Our capacity tomaticÃ¡n windows in addition final result 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.569
 the turks they injured 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.900
 instead of going with the brush 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.919
 painting on the layer that we want 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.689
 your attraction to select 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:31.580
 to create a layer already with a 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.400
 to be selected 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.199
 while to say all but liked
