Patricia<00:01:16.500> would<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.830> won't<00:01:17.280> explain<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:18.000> or

Patricia would you won't explain this or
you<00:01:18.509> won't<00:01:18.600> even<00:01:18.810> answer<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.500> bar<00:01:20.310> there's<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
you won't even answer the bar there's a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.820 
you won't even answer the bar there's a
transient<00:01:21.630> increase<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.140> blood<00:01:22.320> pressure<00:01:22.650> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
transient increase in blood pressure it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.580 
transient increase in blood pressure it
spikes<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.340> real<00:01:23.610> high<00:01:23.880> right<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.350> thought

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
spikes up real high right so the thought

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.010 
spikes up real high right so the thought
that<00:01:25.619> holy<00:01:26.400> man<00:01:26.700> breath<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.659> way<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that holy man breath is a way to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.640 
that holy man breath is a way to
mitigate<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.990> is<00:01:30.990> something<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.500> all

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
mitigate that is something that all

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.920 
mitigate that is something that all
those<00:01:31.860> other<00:01:31.890> organizations<00:01:32.400> teach<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.900> teach

those other organizations teach we teach
the<00:01:34.380> valsalva<00:01:34.799> maneuver<00:01:36.560> not<00:01:37.560> only<00:01:37.890> for

the valsalva maneuver not only for

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.569 
the valsalva maneuver not only for
efficiency<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.150> also<00:01:39.210> safety<00:01:40.170> okay

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
efficiency but also safety okay

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.740 
efficiency but also safety okay
holding<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> breath<00:01:42.810> actually

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
holding the breath actually

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.670 
holding the breath actually
is<00:01:43.990> out<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.260> forces<00:01:44.850> between<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:47.140> outside<00:01:47.590> of

the vessel the inside of the vessel
better<00:01:49.350> than<00:01:50.350> when<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:50.620> exhale<00:01:51.010> right<00:01:51.760> but

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
better than when you exhale right but

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.950 
better than when you exhale right but
because<00:01:53.260> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.670> perceived<00:01:55.060> danger<00:01:55.600> of<00:01:55.780> the

because of the perceived danger of the
spike<00:01:56.320> in<00:01:56.530> blood<00:01:56.650> pressure<00:01:56.950> all<00:01:57.340> these

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
spike in blood pressure all these

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.980 
spike in blood pressure all these
organizations<00:01:58.150> teach<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.720> BellSouth

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
organizations teach that the BellSouth

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.960 
organizations teach that the BellSouth
maneuver<00:01:59.500> is<00:01:59.590> dangerous<00:02:00.070> right<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.760> all

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
maneuver is dangerous right and all

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.109 
maneuver is dangerous right and all
those<00:02:01.119> sorts<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.450> things<00:02:01.660> so<00:02:03.060> holding<00:02:04.060> the

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
those sorts of things so holding the

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.240 
those sorts of things so holding the
breath<00:02:04.360> is<00:02:04.869> not<00:02:05.140> only<00:02:05.410> protected<00:02:05.920> but<00:02:06.070> it's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
breath is not only protected but it's

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.029 
breath is not only protected but it's
the<00:02:06.340> most<00:02:06.520> efficient<00:02:07.000> way<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.960> lift<00:02:08.740> a<00:02:08.890> heavy

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
the most efficient way to lift a heavy

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.830 
the most efficient way to lift a heavy
load<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:10.090> supports<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.869> spine<00:02:11.110> airs<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.970> rigid

load it supports the spine airs a rigid
back<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.500> what<00:02:14.709> protects<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.340> back<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
back is what protects the back not a

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.010 
back is what protects the back not a
vertical<00:02:17.830> back<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.340> rigid<00:02:19.180> strong<00:02:19.570> that

and<00:05:35.490> last<00:05:35.849> one<00:05:37.580> good<00:05:42.949> see<00:05:43.949> the<00:05:44.099> difference<00:05:44.490> in

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
and last one good see the difference in

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.400 
and last one good see the difference in
the<00:05:44.729> first<00:05:44.880> two<00:05:45.180> in<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.570> last<00:05:45.780> three

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.600 

stitching<00:05:49.410> up<00:05:49.530> out<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.830> London<00:05:50.400> there<00:05:50.580> is

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
stitching up out of London there is

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.550 
stitching up out of London there is
Claude<00:05:52.220> right<00:05:53.220> so<00:05:53.880> that's<00:05:54.539> a<00:05:54.750> given<00:05:55.139> what<00:05:55.380> we

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
Claude right so that's a given what we

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.469 
Claude right so that's a given what we
would<00:05:55.740> like<00:05:55.889> to<00:05:56.130> do<00:05:56.250> is<00:05:56.400> Maxima<00:05:57.150> as<00:05:57.330> the

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
would like to do is Maxima as the

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.029 
would like to do is Maxima as the
involvement<00:05:57.990> of<00:05:58.139> all<00:05:58.289> the<00:05:58.650> other<00:05:58.770> muscles

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
involvement of all the other muscles

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.980 
involvement of all the other muscles
that<00:05:59.310> can<00:05:59.550> possibly<00:05:59.880> be<00:06:00.240> involved<00:06:00.810> in<00:06:00.930> the

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
that can possibly be involved in the

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.960 
that can possibly be involved in the
squat<00:06:01.289> so<00:06:01.740> we<00:06:01.860> could<00:06:01.979> train<00:06:02.160> more<00:06:02.430> muscle<00:06:02.789> fast

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
squat so we could train more muscle fast

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.210 
squat so we could train more muscle fast
so<00:06:03.599> we<00:06:03.750> can<00:06:03.870> lift<00:06:04.020> heavier<00:06:04.440> weight<00:06:04.650> so<00:06:04.919> we<00:06:05.039> get

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
so we can lift heavier weight so we get

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.700 
so we can lift heavier weight so we get
stronger<00:06:05.570> that's<00:06:06.570> why<00:06:06.780> we<00:06:07.050> do<00:06:07.229> it<00:06:07.259> in<00:06:07.530> this

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
stronger that's why we do it in this

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.089 
stronger that's why we do it in this
very<00:06:08.009> particular<00:06:08.310> look<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.270> it's<00:06:10.020> it's<00:06:10.560> it's

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
very particular look and it's it's it's

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.300 
very particular look and it's it's it's
not<00:06:11.460> intuitive<00:06:12.150> it<00:06:13.139> has<00:06:13.349> to<00:06:13.530> be<00:06:13.650> learned<00:06:13.949> it

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
not intuitive it has to be learned it

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.089 
not intuitive it has to be learned it
has<00:06:14.430> to<00:06:14.580> be<00:06:14.699> coached<00:06:15.030> this<00:06:15.840> squad<00:06:16.199> is<00:06:16.229> a<00:06:16.409> fairly

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
has to be coached this squad is a fairly

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.740 
has to be coached this squad is a fairly
complicated<00:06:17.490> movement<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.270> way<00:06:18.389> we<00:06:18.539> do<00:06:18.690> it

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
complicated movement the way we do it

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.710 
complicated movement the way we do it
but<00:06:19.110> done<00:06:19.560> this<00:06:20.130> way<00:06:20.550> it<00:06:20.909> works<00:06:21.479> better

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
but done this way it works better

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.170 
but done this way it works better
because<00:06:22.620> it<00:06:22.979> involves<00:06:23.520> more<00:06:23.729> muscle<00:06:24.150> mass

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
because it involves more muscle mass

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.409 
because it involves more muscle mass
over<00:06:25.050> a<00:06:25.080> more<00:06:25.520> over<00:06:26.520> a<00:06:26.550> longer<00:06:26.849> range<00:06:27.210> of

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
over a more over a longer range of

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.680 
over a more over a longer range of
motion<00:06:28.099> thus<00:06:29.099> you<00:06:29.490> allowing<00:06:29.909> you<00:06:30.180> to<00:06:30.330> use<00:06:30.509> more

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
motion thus you allowing you to use more

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.039 
motion thus you allowing you to use more
weights<00:06:30.990> on<00:06:31.289> the<00:06:31.380> to<00:06:31.530> get<00:06:31.770> strong
