what's<00:00:08.069> up<00:00:08.189> guys<00:00:08.340> join<00:00:08.700> here<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
what's up guys join here of the

what's up guys join here of the
objective-c<00:00:09.480> Toros<00:00:09.930> lesson<00:00:10.380> 31<00:00:10.620> do-while

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
objective-c Toros lesson 31 do-while

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.999 
objective-c Toros lesson 31 do-while
loops<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.879> as<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.900> remember<00:00:13.019> last<00:00:13.530> lesson<00:00:13.889> we

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
loops and as you remember last lesson we

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.250 
loops and as you remember last lesson we
went<00:00:14.219> over<00:00:14.490> while<00:00:15.150> loops<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:15.990> may<00:00:16.200> be

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
went over while loops so you may be

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.240 
went over while loops so you may be
saying<00:00:16.530> well<00:00:16.680> what's<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.950> difference

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
saying well what's the difference

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.550 
saying well what's the difference
between<00:00:17.370> a<00:00:17.640> while<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.480> do-while<00:00:18.720> loop<00:00:19.140> well

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
between a while and do-while loop well

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.220 
between a while and do-while loop well
they're<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.460> same<00:00:20.730> thing<00:00:21.150> except<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:21.990> one

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
they're the same thing except for one

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.610 
they're the same thing except for one
thing

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620 
thing

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.160 
thing
with<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.670> do-while<00:00:24.180> loop<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.630> condition<00:00:24.990> is

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
with a do-while loop the condition is

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.590 
with a do-while loop the condition is
evaluated<00:00:25.800> after<00:00:25.950> the<00:00:26.430> loop<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.150> means<00:00:27.360> a

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
evaluated after the loop so this means a

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.480 
evaluated after the loop so this means a
do-while<00:00:28.020> loop<00:00:28.260> will<00:00:28.440> always<00:00:28.470> run<00:00:28.980> at<00:00:29.250> least

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
do-while loop will always run at least

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.820 
do-while loop will always run at least
once<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.270> down<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.230> at<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> bottom<00:00:31.560> you

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
once and down there at the bottom you

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.459 
once and down there at the bottom you
can<00:00:32.279> see<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.610> generic<00:00:33.120> example<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
can see the generic example of a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.840 
can see the generic example of a
do-while<00:00:34.710> loop<00:00:35.810> so<00:00:36.810> how<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> do<00:00:37.560> while<00:00:37.850> loop

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
do-while loop so how I do while loop

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.470 
do-while loop so how I do while loop
works<00:00:39.590> do<00:00:40.590> tells<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.310> compiler<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.970> this<00:00:42.329> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the possibility of an array being empty

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.489 
the possibility of an array being empty
you<00:01:17.460> would<00:01:17.609> not<00:01:17.880> want<00:01:18.179> to<00:01:18.270> use<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.749> do-while

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
you would not want to use a do-while

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:22.279 
you would not want to use a do-while
loop<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.069> iterate<00:01:20.280> through<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.969> and<00:01:21.289> do-while

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
loop to iterate through it and do-while

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.399 
loop to iterate through it and do-while
loops<00:01:22.889> are<00:01:23.100> ended<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> semicolon<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:25.319> to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
loops are ended with a semicolon just to

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.379 
loops are ended with a semicolon just to
remember<00:01:25.649> that<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.639> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:27.389 
remember that as you can see in the

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:30.800 
remember that as you can see in the
example<00:01:27.479> there<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.439> however<00:01:29.399> other<00:01:30.209> loops

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
example there and however other loops

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.809 
example there and however other loops
are<00:01:31.020> not<00:01:31.259> terminated<00:01:31.889> with<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> semicolon<00:01:32.490> so

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
are not terminated with a semicolon so

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.120 
are not terminated with a semicolon so
just<00:01:32.999> remember<00:01:33.209> that<00:01:33.359> the<00:01:34.109> do-while<00:01:34.709> loop<00:01:34.979> is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
just remember that the do-while loop is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.459 
just remember that the do-while loop is
the<00:01:35.249> only<00:01:35.369> loop<00:01:35.609> that<00:01:35.969> is<00:01:36.200> ended<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
the only loop that is ended with a

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.679 
the only loop that is ended with a
semicolon<00:01:37.889> not<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:39.029> brace<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:41.179> that's<00:01:42.179> all<00:01:42.450> for

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
semicolon not a brace and that's all for

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.239 
semicolon not a brace and that's all for
this<00:01:42.779> lesson<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.380> wasn't<00:01:43.679> too<00:01:43.859> much<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.130> go

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
this lesson there wasn't too much to go

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:45.349 
this lesson there wasn't too much to go
over<00:01:44.459> so<00:01:44.639> now<00:01:44.759> we're<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:44.969> to<00:01:45.060> jump<00:01:45.240> into

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
over so now we're going to jump into

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.929 
over so now we're going to jump into
Xcode<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.929> add<00:01:46.529> a<00:01:46.560> do-while<00:01:47.130> loop<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.609> our

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
Xcode and add a do-while loop to our

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
Xcode and add a do-while loop to our
code<00:01:48.209> ok<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:48.869> here<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.319> are<00:01:49.349> in<00:01:49.560> Xcode<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
code ok so here we are in Xcode and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.190 
code ok so here we are in Xcode and
we're<00:01:50.429> just<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.639> to<00:01:50.700> add<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.719> do-while

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
we're just going to add the do-while

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.980 
we're just going to add the do-while
loop<00:01:52.469> right<00:01:52.920> below<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.399> other<00:01:53.639> two<00:01:54.450> loops<00:01:54.689> so

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
loop right below the other two loops so

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.569 
loop right below the other two loops so
say<00:01:55.740> du<00:01:57.560> then<00:01:58.560> we're<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:58.859> going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.219> put<00:01:59.399> in

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
say du then we're just going to put in

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.649 
say du then we're just going to put in
all<00:02:01.219> this<00:02:02.219> information<00:02:02.819> that<00:02:02.939> we<00:02:03.060> put<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.389> and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
all this information that we put in and

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.980 
all this information that we put in and
the<00:02:04.380> other<00:02:04.529> two<00:02:04.770> loops<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.329> transaction

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
the other two loops so a transaction

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.100 
the other two loops so a transaction
just<00:02:08.739> gonna<00:02:08.830> finish<00:02:10.080> declaring<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:12.370> object

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
just gonna finish declaring this object

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.650 
just gonna finish declaring this object
transaction<00:02:14.110> new<00:02:16.230> then<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.560> transaction

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
transaction new then a transaction

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.150 
transaction new then a transaction
called<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.840> create<00:02:20.140> transaction<00:02:20.590> method

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
called the create transaction method

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.660 
called the create transaction method
we're<00:02:21.280> going<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.610> same<00:02:21.790> n<00:02:22.060> times<00:02:23.670> 100

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
we're going to do the same n times 100

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.330 
we're going to do the same n times 100
and<00:02:25.470> I've<00:02:26.470> type<00:02:26.680> we're<00:02:26.890> gonna<00:02:26.980> make<00:02:27.190> this

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
and I've type we're gonna make this

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.580 
and I've type we're gonna make this
charge<00:02:29.400> then<00:02:30.400> we're<00:02:30.670> gonna<00:02:30.760> add<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
charge then we're gonna add it to the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.660 
charge then we're gonna add it to the
transactions<00:02:33.489> right<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:34.480> add<00:02:34.599> objects<00:02:35.170> a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
transactions right so add objects a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.809 
transactions right so add objects a
transaction<00:02:36.670> close<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:37.750> all<00:02:37.870> out<00:02:38.580> then<00:02:39.580> we

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
transaction close that all out then we

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.580 
transaction close that all out then we
need<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.120> increment<00:02:41.069> N<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.850> whoops<00:02:43.630> semicolon

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
need to increment N and whoops semicolon

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.309 
need to increment N and whoops semicolon
then<00:02:45.310> close<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.790> loop<00:02:46.299> out<00:02:46.510> or<00:02:47.049> a<00:02:47.080> number

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
then close that loop out or a number

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.690 
then close that loop out or a number
that<00:02:47.530> then<00:02:47.739> we<00:02:47.860> still<00:02:48.069> have<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.220> put<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.459> while

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
that then we still have to put a while

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.229 
that then we still have to put a while
and<00:02:49.350> then<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.470> condition<00:02:50.890> n<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.489> less<00:02:51.760> than<00:02:51.970> or

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
and then the condition n is less than or

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.530 
and then the condition n is less than or
equals<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:53.190> 3<00:02:54.190> then<00:02:54.970> closed<00:02:55.209> out<00:02:55.390> with<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
equals to 3 then closed out with the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.240 
equals to 3 then closed out with the
semicolon<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.170> then<00:02:56.380> we're<00:02:56.530> all<00:02:56.709> done<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.130> we

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
semicolon and then we're all done so we

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.870 
semicolon and then we're all done so we
go<00:02:57.370> ahead<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.670> build<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:57.940> run<00:02:58.650> save<00:02:59.650> all<00:02:59.880> so

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
go ahead and build and run save all so

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.580 
go ahead and build and run save all so
the<00:03:01.030> first<00:03:01.060> four<00:03:01.450> lines<00:03:01.630> here<00:03:01.989> are<00:03:02.200> what<00:03:02.470> we

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
the first four lines here are what we

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.559 
the first four lines here are what we
worked<00:03:02.799> with<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.190> last<00:03:03.340> two<00:03:03.610> lessons<00:03:03.819> go<00:03:04.510> to

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
worked with the last two lessons go to

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.180 
worked with the last two lessons go to
the<00:03:04.780> fifth<00:03:05.019> line<00:03:05.080> where<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.560> see<00:03:05.739> charging

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
the fifth line where you see charging

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.339 
the fifth line where you see charging
$300<00:03:06.849> in<00:03:06.970> foreign<00:03:07.209> currency<00:03:07.569> leaves<00:03:07.810> negative

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
$300 in foreign currency leaves negative

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.170 
$300 in foreign currency leaves negative
$50<00:03:08.860> that's<00:03:09.040> exactly<00:03:09.519> what<00:03:09.670> we<00:03:09.760> expected

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
$50 that's exactly what we expected

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.420 
$50 that's exactly what we expected
because<00:03:10.330> 300<00:03:11.110> times<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.739> transaction<00:03:12.280> rate

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
because 300 times that transaction rate

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.470 
because 300 times that transaction rate
of<00:03:12.579> 1.25<00:03:13.209> is<00:03:13.750> 375<00:03:14.709> subtracted<00:03:15.340> from<00:03:15.430> 30<00:03:15.700> 25<00:03:16.180> is

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
of 1.25 is 375 subtracted from 30 25 is

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.949 
of 1.25 is 375 subtracted from 30 25 is
negative<00:03:16.870> $50<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.660> just<00:03:19.660> what<00:03:19.780> we<00:03:19.870> expected

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
negative $50 so just what we expected

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.710 
negative $50 so just what we expected
would<00:03:20.440> happen<00:03:20.769> happened<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.459> but<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.540> may<00:03:22.660> be

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
would happen happened and but you may be

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.770 
would happen happened and but you may be
saying<00:03:22.959> well<00:03:23.170> why<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.709> $300<00:03:24.700> well<00:03:25.180> to

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
saying well why is it $300 well to

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.240 
saying well why is it $300 well to
understand<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.320> you<00:03:26.500> first<00:03:26.799> have<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.070> look

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
understand that you first have to look

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.259 
understand that you first have to look
at<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.459> while<00:03:27.790> loop<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:28.329> N<00:03:29.370> equals<00:03:30.370> 1<00:03:30.579> so<00:03:30.880> 1<00:03:31.120> is

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
at this while loop so N equals 1 so 1 is

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.610 
at this while loop so N equals 1 so 1 is
less<00:03:31.420> than<00:03:31.450> 3<00:03:31.780> that's<00:03:31.930> correct<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.500> goes

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
less than 3 that's correct it goes

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.069 
less than 3 that's correct it goes
through<00:03:32.890> then<00:03:33.370> increments<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:34.239> now<00:03:34.540> N<00:03:34.780> equals

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
through then increments so now N equals

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.470 
through then increments so now N equals
2<00:03:35.290> so<00:03:35.590> 2<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:36.340> less<00:03:36.459> than<00:03:36.519> 3<00:03:36.640> that's<00:03:37.030> correct<00:03:37.269> so

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
2 so 2 is less than 3 that's correct so

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.120 
2 so 2 is less than 3 that's correct so
it<00:03:37.569> runs<00:03:37.750> through<00:03:37.930> again<00:03:38.560> so<00:03:38.709> that's<00:03:38.859> why<00:03:39.010> it

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
it runs through again so that's why it

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.920 
it runs through again so that's why it
ran<00:03:39.280> through<00:03:39.340> twice<00:03:39.760> then<00:03:40.030> it's<00:03:40.420> incrementing

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
ran through twice then it's incrementing

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.710 
ran through twice then it's incrementing
again<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.500> 3<00:03:41.859> is<00:03:42.160> less<00:03:42.400> than<00:03:42.519> 3<00:03:42.700> no<00:03:42.880> that's<00:03:43.390> not

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
again so 3 is less than 3 no that's not

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.309 
again so 3 is less than 3 no that's not
true

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
true

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.610 
true
so<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:45.069> jumps<00:03:45.430> down<00:03:45.489> here<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.530> runs<00:03:47.530> through

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
so it jumps down here and runs through

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.979 
so it jumps down here and runs through
this<00:03:47.829> do-while<00:03:48.340> loop<00:03:48.609> so<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:49.510> runs<00:03:49.840> through

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
this do-while loop so it runs through

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.099 
this do-while loop so it runs through
this<00:03:50.230> one<00:03:50.530> time<00:03:50.769> it<00:03:51.370> increments<00:03:52.090> n<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.569> 4<00:03:52.900> and

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
this one time it increments n to 4 and

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.879 
this one time it increments n to 4 and
then<00:03:53.500> checks<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.459> condition<00:03:54.569> while<00:03:55.569> n<00:03:55.989> is

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
then checks the condition while n is

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.059 
then checks the condition while n is
less<00:03:57.310> than<00:03:57.370> or<00:03:57.670> equal<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.180> 3<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:59.079> 4<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.889> less

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
less than or equal to 3 so 4 is less

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.860 
less than or equal to 3 so 4 is less
than<00:04:00.130> or<00:04:00.459> equal<00:04:00.519> to<00:04:00.790> 3<00:04:00.970> that's<00:04:01.269> not<00:04:01.480> correct

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
than or equal to 3 that's not correct

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.229 
than or equal to 3 that's not correct
so<00:04:02.290> then<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.739> ends<00:04:03.069> the<00:04:03.160> loop<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.760> only<00:04:03.880> ran

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
so then it ends the loop and it only ran

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.069 
so then it ends the loop and it only ran
that<00:04:04.450> one<00:04:04.720> time<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:07.120> default<00:04:07.480> time<00:04:07.780> that

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
that one time the the default time that

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.460 
that one time the the default time that
a<00:04:08.109> do-while<00:04:08.709> loop<00:04:09.040> will<00:04:09.220> always<00:04:09.250> run<00:04:09.700> so

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
a do-while loop will always run so

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.009 
a do-while loop will always run so
that's<00:04:11.470> all<00:04:11.739> for<00:04:12.389> loops<00:04:13.389> we're<00:04:13.690> all<00:04:13.870> done

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
that's all for loops we're all done

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.680 
that's all for loops we're all done
talking<00:04:14.350> about<00:04:14.530> them<00:04:14.769> now<00:04:15.010> so<00:04:15.549> that's<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:16.180> for

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
talking about them now so that's the for

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.580 
talking about them now so that's the for
loop<00:04:17.639> while<00:04:18.639> loop<00:04:18.669> do-while<00:04:19.510> loop<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.019> then

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
loop while loop do-while loop and then

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.900 
loop while loop do-while loop and then
we<00:04:20.680> have<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.979> for<00:04:21.250> in<00:04:21.459> loop

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
we have the for in loop

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.910 
we have the for in loop
right<00:04:22.060> there<00:04:22.240> so<00:04:22.480> four<00:04:23.020> types<00:04:23.260> of<00:04:23.440> loops<00:04:23.710> that

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
right there so four types of loops that

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.760 
right there so four types of loops that
you<00:04:24.100> now<00:04:24.400> know<00:04:24.640> a<00:04:24.880> lot<00:04:25.030> about<00:04:25.600> so<00:04:26.230> that's<00:04:26.530> all

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
you now know a lot about so that's all

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.410 
you now know a lot about so that's all
