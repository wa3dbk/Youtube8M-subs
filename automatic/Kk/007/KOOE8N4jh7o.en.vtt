00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
versus paying 60 bones for and then

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.679 
versus paying 60 bones for and then
being<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:33.110> this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.229> all<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> did<00:01:35.240> really<00:01:36.240> you

going<00:02:05.670> with<00:02:05.909> an<00:02:06.030> open<00:02:06.270> mind<00:02:06.710> because<00:02:07.710> there's

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
going with an open mind because there's

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.309 
going with an open mind because there's
some<00:02:08.340> very<00:02:08.369> different<00:02:08.819> gameplay<00:02:09.780> mechanics

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
some very different gameplay mechanics

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.120 
some very different gameplay mechanics

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.760 
something out of a three saying hey
maybe<00:03:46.340> we'll<00:03:46.520> get<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.760> Gears<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.090> War<00:03:47.240> 3

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
maybe we'll get a Gears of War 3

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.590 
maybe we'll get a Gears of War 3
re-release<00:03:48.770> or<00:03:49.040> HD<00:03:49.490> remaster<00:03:50.210> or<00:03:50.270> whatever

for<00:03:51.080> Xbox<00:03:51.680> one<00:03:51.890> I<00:03:51.920> think<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.840> pretty<00:03:53.840> high

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
for Xbox one I think that is pretty high

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.900 
for Xbox one I think that is pretty high
chance<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.670> happening<00:03:56.380> I'm<00:03:57.380> hoping<00:03:58.100> that<00:03:58.730> they

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
chance of happening I'm hoping that they

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.760 
chance of happening I'm hoping that they
would<00:03:59.120> take<00:03:59.330> some<00:03:59.690> of<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.990> things<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:00.620> they

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
would take some of the things that they

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.070 
would take some of the things that they
implemented<00:04:01.430> across<00:04:01.670> all<00:04:02.060> of<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.450> games<00:04:02.720> and

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
implemented across all of the games and

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.440 
implemented across all of the games and
kind<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.680> pacted<00:04:04.070> that<00:04:04.550> everyone<00:04:04.940> liked<00:04:05.180> and

kind of pacted that everyone liked and

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.930 
kind of pacted that everyone liked and
enjoyed<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:06.020> kind<00:04:06.170> of<00:04:06.200> packed<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.590> into<00:04:06.940> this

enjoyed and kind of packed it into this

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.030

and putting them into the game to get a

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.000 
and putting them into the game to get a
better<00:04:22.100> flow<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:22.580> feel<00:04:23.229> obviously<00:04:24.229> downs<00:04:24.770> are

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
better flow and feel obviously downs are

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.760 
better flow and feel obviously downs are
in<00:04:25.130> locus<00:04:25.580> or<00:04:25.700> in<00:04:25.880> so<00:04:26.090> none<00:04:26.240> of<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.450> bad

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
in locus or in so none of the bad

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.990 
in locus or in so none of the bad
suffered<00:04:27.069> judgment<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.580> people<00:04:27.819> didn't

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
suffered judgment that people didn't

suffered judgment that people didn't
like<00:04:28.180> are<00:04:29.020> gonna<00:04:29.229> be<00:04:29.379> there

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
like are gonna be there

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.159 
like are gonna be there
maps<00:04:30.280> are<00:04:30.520> in<00:04:30.699> I<00:04:31.060> would<00:04:31.509> hope<00:04:31.690> that<00:04:31.720> they<00:04:31.960> have

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
maps are in I would hope that they have

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.339 
maps are in I would hope that they have
plenty<00:04:32.530> more<00:04:32.830> maps<00:04:33.129> although<00:04:33.960> if<00:04:34.960> they

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
plenty more maps although if they

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.960 
plenty more maps although if they
include<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.889> whole<00:04:36.069> thing<00:04:36.400> what<00:04:36.669> is<00:04:36.759> it<00:04:36.879> like

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
include the whole thing what is it like

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.360 
include the whole thing what is it like
30<00:04:37.330> maps<00:04:37.690> I<00:04:38.319> think<00:04:38.680> that's<00:04:38.830> right<00:04:38.949> like<00:04:39.099> 30

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
30 maps I think that's right like 30

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.430 
30 maps I think that's right like 30
maps<00:04:39.669> and<00:04:39.970> Gears<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.300> War<00:04:40.419> 3<00:04:40.780> it's<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.990> lot<00:04:41.139> 20

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
maps and Gears of War 3 it's a lot 20

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.740 
maps and Gears of War 3 it's a lot 20
some<00:04:41.590> 25<00:04:42.039> 30<00:04:42.490> something<00:04:42.849> like<00:04:43.000> that<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.180> forgot

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
some 25 30 something like that I forgot

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.409 
some 25 30 something like that I forgot
what<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.080> count<00:04:44.289> is<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:45.180> then<00:04:46.180> you<00:04:46.300> guys

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
what the count is and then you guys

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.980 
what the count is and then you guys
would<00:04:46.720> see<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.259> brother<00:04:47.500> arctic<00:04:48.780> back<00:04:49.780> on

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
would see that brother arctic back on

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.790 
would see that brother arctic back on
some<00:04:50.229> gears<00:04:50.500> okay<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:52.360> if<00:04:53.319> that<00:04:53.530> were<00:04:53.680> to

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
some gears okay so if that were to

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.520 
some gears okay so if that were to
happen<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:54.190> would<00:04:54.250> actually<00:04:54.849> play<00:04:55.090> some

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
happen I would actually play some

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.059 
happen I would actually play some
probably<00:04:56.530> more<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.129> than<00:04:58.259> otherwise<00:04:59.259> because

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
probably more so than otherwise because

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.950 
probably more so than otherwise because
I<00:05:00.430> actually<00:05:00.520> really<00:05:01.060> really<00:05:01.090> enjoyed<00:05:01.659> Gears

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
I actually really really enjoyed Gears

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.850 
I actually really really enjoyed Gears
of<00:05:02.020> War<00:05:02.139> 3<00:05:02.650> and<00:05:03.389> I<00:05:04.389> think<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.080> lot<00:05:05.289> of<00:05:05.319> my<00:05:05.470> videos

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
of War 3 and I think a lot of my videos

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.189 
of War 3 and I think a lot of my videos
would<00:05:06.009> be<00:05:06.069> relevant<00:05:06.490> again<00:05:06.880> shit<00:05:07.300> you<00:05:07.840> guys<00:05:08.020> be

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
would be relevant again shit you guys be

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.309 
would be relevant again shit you guys be
like<00:05:08.229> huh<00:05:08.610> Arctic<00:05:09.610> as<00:05:09.789> he<00:05:09.940> was<00:05:10.120> he<00:05:10.690> was<00:05:10.870> tearing

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:11.319 
like huh Arctic as he was he was tearing

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:16.620 
like huh Arctic as he was he was tearing
people<00:05:11.530> up<00:05:11.970> was<00:05:12.970> he<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.150> pro<00:05:13.830> maybe<00:05:14.830> he<00:05:15.130> was<00:05:15.630> at

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
people up was he a pro maybe he was at

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.100 
people up was he a pro maybe he was at
one<00:05:16.900> point<00:05:17.139> in<00:05:17.380> time<00:05:18.240> no<00:05:19.240> but<00:05:19.539> uh<00:05:19.569> seriously

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
one point in time no but uh seriously

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.899 
one point in time no but uh seriously
though<00:05:20.409> I<00:05:20.440> don't<00:05:21.069> know<00:05:21.340> what's<00:05:21.550> gonna<00:05:21.699> happen

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
though I don't know what's gonna happen

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.709 
though I don't know what's gonna happen
I<00:05:22.270> do<00:05:22.599> think<00:05:23.110> it's<00:05:23.259> kind<00:05:23.500> of<00:05:23.940> really<00:05:24.940> cryptic

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
I do think it's kind of really cryptic

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:29.040 
I do think it's kind of really cryptic
that<00:05:26.379> they<00:05:26.500> would<00:05:26.710> release<00:05:26.919> a<00:05:27.870> launch<00:05:28.870> event

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
that they would release a launch event

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.570 
that they would release a launch event
from<00:05:30.330> 2011<00:05:31.330> on<00:05:31.870> their<00:05:32.409> channel<00:05:33.039> it's<00:05:33.190> just<00:05:33.400> not

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
from 2011 on their channel it's just not

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.969 
from 2011 on their channel it's just not
relevant<00:05:34.030> right<00:05:34.599> unless<00:05:35.289> there's<00:05:35.680> something

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
relevant right unless there's something

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.120 
relevant right unless there's something
there<00:05:36.430> trying<00:05:36.789> to<00:05:37.030> be<00:05:37.509> very<00:05:38.139> roundabout<00:05:38.710> about

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
there trying to be very roundabout about

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.290 
there trying to be very roundabout about
how<00:05:39.340> they're<00:05:39.520> doing<00:05:39.550> their<00:05:39.789> messaging<00:05:40.210> around

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
how they're doing their messaging around

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.749 
how they're doing their messaging around
the<00:05:40.539> game<00:05:40.719> so<00:05:41.099> look<00:05:42.099> we<00:05:42.219> don't<00:05:42.279> have<00:05:42.400> that<00:05:42.610> much

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
the game so look we don't have that much

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.360 
the game so look we don't have that much
further<00:05:42.940> until<00:05:43.330> III<00:05:43.900> we're<00:05:44.139> like<00:05:44.319> a<00:05:44.560> month<00:05:45.130> six

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
further until III we're like a month six

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.219
