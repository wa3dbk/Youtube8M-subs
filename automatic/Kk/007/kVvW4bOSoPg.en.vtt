from we're gonna discuss a cheese in the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.780 
from we're gonna discuss a cheese in the
Loire<00:01:01.080> Valley<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.100> white<00:01:02.280> wine<00:01:02.490> from<00:01:02.700> the

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
Loire Valley and a white wine from the

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.200 
Loire Valley and a white wine from the
law<00:01:02.970> as<00:01:03.120> well<00:01:04.160> another<00:01:05.160> rule<00:01:05.430> would<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.700> strong

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
law as well another rule would be strong

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.730 
law as well another rule would be strong
with<00:01:06.420> strong<00:01:06.690> light<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.200> light<00:01:07.410> so<00:01:07.620> you're

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
with strong light with light so you're

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.350 
with strong light with light so you're
gonna<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:08.010> lighter<00:01:08.220> cheese's<00:01:08.910> with<00:01:09.150> lighter

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
gonna have lighter cheese's with lighter

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.300 
gonna have lighter cheese's with lighter
winds<00:01:09.660> stronger<00:01:10.470> cheeses<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:11.040> stronger

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
winds stronger cheeses with stronger

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.630 
winds stronger cheeses with stronger
wines<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.540> guess<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.840> third<00:01:13.020> rule<00:01:13.260> is

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
wines and I guess the third rule is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.920 
wines and I guess the third rule is
every<00:01:14.640> rule<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.090> broken<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.600> are<00:01:15.750> no

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
every rule can be broken there are no

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.210 
every rule can be broken there are no
