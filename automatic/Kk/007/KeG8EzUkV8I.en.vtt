00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
just the easiest thing ever the oven has

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.290 
just the easiest thing ever the oven has
to<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:28.019> absolutely<00:00:28.970> spotlessly<00:00:29.970> clean

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
to be absolutely spotlessly clean

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.080 
to be absolutely spotlessly clean
otherwise<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.650> will<00:00:31.859> smoke<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.790> entire

kitchen I try to do this part as quickly
as<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:37.020> because<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.530> still<00:00:37.860> kind<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
as I can because it still kind of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.030 
as I can because it still kind of
grosses<00:00:38.399> me<00:00:38.430> out<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.600> use<00:00:39.780> any<00:00:40.079> number<00:00:40.800> of

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.119 
grosses me out you can use any number of
herbs<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.090> really<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.629> time<00:00:43.010> even<00:00:44.010> though

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
herbs but I really like time even though

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.200

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you're not supposed to have a lot of

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.729

moisture<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.719> there<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.170> gonna<00:00:46.289> stick<00:00:46.559> some

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
moisture in there I'm gonna stick some

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.229 
moisture in there I'm gonna stick some
lemons<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:47.280> anyway<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.000> flavor

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
lemons in there anyway just for flavor

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.330 
lemons in there anyway just for flavor
there's<00:00:48.899> not<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> lot<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.440> ingredients<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.250> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
there's not a lot of ingredients in this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.160 
there's not a lot of ingredients in this
recipe<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:51.059> salt<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.390> pepper<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.719> definitely

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
recipe but salt and pepper is definitely

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.110 
recipe but salt and pepper is definitely
one<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.350> them<00:00:57.500> yeah<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:58.800> most<00:00:59.489> people<00:00:59.609> do

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
one of them yeah I know most people do

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
one of them yeah I know most people do
and<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.960> was<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.440> those<00:01:01.649> people<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and and I was one of those people the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
and and I was one of those people the
thought<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.379> roasting<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:04.439> such<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> high

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
thought is that roasting at such a high

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.340 
thought is that roasting at such a high
temperature<00:01:04.920> gets<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> outside<00:01:06.060> crispy<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
temperature gets the outside crispy and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.990 
temperature gets the outside crispy and
it<00:01:07.439> sort<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.650> traps<00:01:08.010> all<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> juices<00:01:08.820> inside

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
it sort of traps all the juices inside

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.160 
it sort of traps all the juices inside
and<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:10.950> seems<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.790> work<00:01:12.150> you're<00:01:13.080> not

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and that seems to work you're not

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.480 
and that seems to work you're not
supposed<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.439> trust<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.860> you're<00:01:14.070> not<00:01:14.159> supposed

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
supposed to trust it you're not supposed

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
supposed to trust it you're not supposed
to<00:01:14.549> baste<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.060> you're<00:01:15.780> actually<00:01:15.900> not<00:01:16.200> supposed

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
to baste it you're actually not supposed

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.109 
to baste it you're actually not supposed
to<00:01:16.560> put<00:01:16.799> anything<00:01:17.250> underneath<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.000> I'm

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to put anything underneath it but I'm

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.550 
to put anything underneath it but I'm
fudging<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.720> little<00:01:18.930> bit<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.140> we're<00:01:19.229> gonna<00:01:19.320> see

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
fudging a little bit and we're gonna see

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.289 
fudging a little bit and we're gonna see
what<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:19.740> come<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.850> about<00:01:20.970> 4<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
what we come up with it's about 4 and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.530 
what we come up with it's about 4 and
1/2<00:01:21.450> pounds<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.920> want<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.369> about<00:01:24.299> 10

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
1/2 pounds and we want to do about 10

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.609 
1/2 pounds and we want to do about 10
minutes<00:01:24.750> per<00:01:24.990> pound<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:26.750> think<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.840> used<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
minutes per pound I think I used to be a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
minutes per pound I think I used to be a
little<00:01:28.799> bit<00:01:28.979> fancier<00:01:29.400> when<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.610> had<00:01:29.820> more<00:01:29.970> time

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
little bit fancier when I had more time

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.149 
little bit fancier when I had more time
