who<00:02:20.080> died<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:21.430> we<00:02:21.700> Christians<00:02:22.209> rejoice<00:02:22.660> in

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
who died but we Christians rejoice in

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.199 
who died but we Christians rejoice in
the<00:02:23.110> miracle<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.520> one<00:02:24.670> miner<00:02:24.940> who

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
the miracle of the one miner who

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.940 
the miracle of the one miner who
survived<00:02:26.250> well<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:28.360> 48<00:02:28.810> hours<00:02:28.840> anyway<00:02:29.560> before

the<00:02:32.170> point<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.730> Christians<00:02:33.730> understand<00:02:34.450> that

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
the point is Christians understand that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.920 
the point is Christians understand that
only<00:02:34.870> 11<00:02:35.530> God<00:02:35.770> would<00:02:36.160> would<00:02:37.120> string<00:02:37.690> along

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
gift the other families didn't get to

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.670 
gift the other families didn't get to
wonderful<00:02:44.650> days<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.250> hope<00:02:45.760> against<00:02:46.239> hope

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
wonderful days of hope against hope

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.949 
wonderful days of hope against hope
which<00:02:47.680> by<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.489> way<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.970> something<00:02:49.239> atheists

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
which by the way is something atheists

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.199 
which by the way is something atheists
do<00:02:50.110> not<00:02:50.320> have<00:02:50.620> they<00:02:51.610> have<00:02:51.760> no<00:02:51.940> hope<00:02:52.180> that

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
do not have they have no hope that

can't hope for a better tomorrow here on

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.100 
can't hope for a better tomorrow here on
earth<00:02:57.420> because<00:02:58.420> they<00:02:58.569> don't<00:02:58.720> believe<00:02:58.959> in

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110

earth because they don't believe in
prayer<00:02:59.819> even<00:03:00.819> though<00:03:00.970> prayer<00:03:01.360> has<00:03:01.720> been

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
prayer even though prayer has been

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.750 
prayer even though prayer has been
demonstrated<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.920> be<00:03:02.950> an<00:03:03.130> effective<00:03:03.610> and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
demonstrated to be an effective and

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.340 
demonstrated to be an effective and
reliable<00:03:03.940> way<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.510> get<00:03:04.750> things<00:03:04.959> done

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350

reliable way to get things done
I<00:03:05.970> think<00:03:07.500> atheists<00:03:08.500> say<00:03:08.830> we<00:03:09.010> should<00:03:09.190> all<00:03:09.310> just

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
I think atheists say we should all just

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.130 
I think atheists say we should all just
try<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.150> make<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.480> world<00:03:10.510> better<00:03:10.870> ourselves

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
and spend all of that praying time

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.150 
and spend all of that praying time
actually<00:03:14.200> doing<00:03:14.459> something<00:03:16.410> how<00:03:17.410> arrogant<00:03:17.860> is

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
actually doing something how arrogant is

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.940 
actually doing something how arrogant is
that<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:19.360> think<00:03:19.570> that<00:03:19.720> we<00:03:20.170> could<00:03:20.410> improve<00:03:20.769> upon

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
that to think that we could improve upon

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.490 
that to think that we could improve upon
a<00:03:21.160> world<00:03:21.459> created<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.329> guided<00:03:22.720> by<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.870> perfect
