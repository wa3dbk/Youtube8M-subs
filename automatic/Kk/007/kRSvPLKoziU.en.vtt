goes<00:01:02.969> into<00:01:05.119> under<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> g10<00:01:07.220> on<00:01:08.220> either<00:01:08.490> side

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
goes into under the g10 on either side

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
goes into under the g10 on either side
so<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.840> loosen<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.320> screw<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.890> just

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
so when you loosen the screw you just

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.760 
so when you loosen the screw you just
pull<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:12.170> loosen<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.290> screw<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.740> pull

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
pull this out loosen this screw and pull

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.240 
pull this out loosen this screw and pull
out<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.250> lanyard<00:01:14.670> loop<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.020> switch<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:17.009> so

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
out the lanyard loop and switch them so

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.370 
out the lanyard loop and switch them so
that'll<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.700> fine<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.390> left<00:01:18.659> or<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.110> hand

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that'll be fine for left or right hand

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.859 
that'll be fine for left or right hand
carry<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:20.369> course<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.759> think<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.030> could<00:01:21.240> remove

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
carry of course I think you could remove

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.770 
carry of course I think you could remove
this<00:01:22.020> if<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.290> didn't<00:01:22.530> want<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.450> it's<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.540> hollow

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
this if you didn't want it it's a hollow

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.880 
this if you didn't want it it's a hollow
brine<00:01:25.640> this<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.820> satin<00:01:27.299> finish<00:01:28.290> he<00:01:28.470> also<00:01:28.590> has

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
brine this is satin finish he also has

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.880 
brine this is satin finish he also has
it<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.189> stone<00:01:29.549> wash<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.079> blacked<00:01:31.560> out

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it in stone wash I think I blacked out

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.870 
it in stone wash I think I blacked out
or<00:01:31.950> acid<00:01:32.610> wash<00:01:33.259> it's<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.590> flips<00:01:35.280> out<00:01:35.400> great<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
or acid wash it's a flips out great you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.480 
or acid wash it's a flips out great you
can<00:01:35.970> flip<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.270> either<00:01:36.770> by<00:01:37.770> sweeping<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.310> back

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
can flip it either by sweeping it back

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.600 
can flip it either by sweeping it back
or<00:01:39.210> by<00:01:39.600> pushing<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.920> pushing<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.490> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
or by pushing it in pushing it in you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.660 
or by pushing it in pushing it in you
definitely<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> stronger<00:01:42.979> push<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.280> think

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
definitely get a stronger push I think

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.399 
definitely get a stronger push I think
the<00:01:44.790> best<00:01:45.000> knife<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.390> compare<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.049> would<00:01:46.259> be

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the best knife to compare it to would be

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.210 
the best knife to compare it to would be
the<00:01:47.360> spyderco<00:01:48.439> paramilitary<00:01:49.439> 2<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.100> can

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the spyderco paramilitary 2 so you can

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.200 
the spyderco paramilitary 2 so you can
see<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:50.630> similar<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.780> size<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.909> put<00:01:54.119> them

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
see it's similar in size you put them

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.870 
see it's similar in size you put them
pivot<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.630> pivot<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.229> blades<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.280> almost<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
pivot to pivot the blades go almost the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.429 
pivot to pivot the blades go almost the
same<00:01:57.090> length<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.719> handles<00:01:58.110> are<00:01:58.229> almost

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
same length and the handles are almost

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.060 
same length and the handles are almost
say<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.100> slightly<00:02:00.229> longer<00:02:01.229> not<00:02:01.890> by

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
say this is just slightly longer not by

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.709 
say this is just slightly longer not by
much<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.579> mainly<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.509> bit<00:02:03.630> on

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
much it's mainly just a little bit on

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.399 
much it's mainly just a little bit on
the<00:02:03.810> end<00:02:03.990> here<00:02:04.159> it<00:02:05.159> does<00:02:05.630> feel<00:02:06.630> similar<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
the end here it does feel similar in the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.130 
the end here it does feel similar in the
hand<00:02:08.270> when<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.360> hold<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
hand when you hold it the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.200 
hand when you hold it the
just<00:02:13.140> flip<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:13.470> around<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.800> way<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.910> see

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
just flip it around this way you can see

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.400 
just flip it around this way you can see
a<00:02:15.240> little<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:17.670> again<00:02:18.090> similar<00:02:18.720> kind<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.290> I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
a little but again similar kind of I

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.640 
a little but again similar kind of I
guess<00:02:19.440> utility<00:02:20.250> style<00:02:20.610> knife<00:02:20.880> good<00:02:21.840> good<00:02:22.320> feel

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
guess utility style knife good good feel

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.850 
guess utility style knife good good feel

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
the gym ping here is really just for

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.500 
the gym ping here is really just for
looks<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.430> can't<00:02:26.820> really<00:02:27.060> even<00:02:27.120> feel<00:02:27.270> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
looks that you can't really even feel it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.060 
looks that you can't really even feel it
it's<00:02:27.930> not<00:02:28.050> going<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.290> provide<00:02:28.560> much<00:02:28.830> but

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
it's not going to provide much but

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.550 
it's not going to provide much but
because<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.880> have<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.270> finger<00:02:31.020> guard<00:02:31.260> with

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
because you have this finger guard with

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.710 
because you have this finger guard with
the<00:02:31.590> flipper<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.760> definitely<00:02:32.970> your<00:02:33.510> hands

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the flipper you definitely your hands

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.020 
the flipper you definitely your hands
not<00:02:33.900> going<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.200> move<00:02:34.470> forward<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.760> blade

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
not going to move forward on the blade

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.320 
not going to move forward on the blade
and<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:37.040> way<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.280> tapers<00:02:38.730> back<00:02:38.970> there<00:02:39.240> is

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
and the way this tapers back there is

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.570 
and the way this tapers back there is
some<00:02:39.510> jimping<00:02:39.900> here<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.470> don't<00:02:41.070> really<00:02:41.220> feel

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
some jimping here I don't really feel

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.100 
some jimping here I don't really feel
that<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:42.060> kind<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.390> like<00:02:42.540> your<00:02:42.720> hand<00:02:42.930> goes

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
that it's kind of like your hand goes

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.010 
that it's kind of like your hand goes
around<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.820> in<00:02:44.820> reverse<00:02:45.210> grip<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:45.720> think<00:02:45.930> it

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
around it in reverse grip I think it

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.080 
around it in reverse grip I think it
might<00:02:46.230> be<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.890> little<00:02:47.100> more<00:02:47.310> effective<00:02:47.430> but

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
might be a little more effective but

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.000 
might be a little more effective but
it's<00:02:48.720> really<00:02:49.020> this<00:02:49.170> finger<00:02:49.560> guard<00:02:49.770> that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
it's really this finger guard that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.160 
it's really this finger guard that
really<00:02:50.460> gives<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:51.000> great<00:02:51.060> purchase<00:02:51.750> on

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
really gives you that great purchase on

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.690 
really gives you that great purchase on
the<00:02:52.320> knife<00:02:54.080> I'm<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.170> big<00:02:55.350> fan<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.650> Jason's<00:02:56.190> work

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
the knife I'm a big fan of Jason's work

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.030 
the knife I'm a big fan of Jason's work
I<00:02:56.940> think<00:02:57.150> he's<00:02:57.330> one<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.350> most<00:02:58.560> innovative

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
I think he's one of the most innovative

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.280 
I think he's one of the most innovative
knife<00:02:59.640> makers<00:03:00.120> out<00:03:00.270> there<00:03:00.330> he's<00:03:00.810> not<00:03:01.020> afraid

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
knife makers out there he's not afraid

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.770 
knife makers out there he's not afraid
to<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:02.430> take<00:03:02.640> things<00:03:02.850> kind<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.480> next

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
to to take things kind of to the next

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.810 
to to take things kind of to the next
level<00:03:04.170> just<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.650> kind<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.040> compare<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
level just to kind of compare it to the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.230 
level just to kind of compare it to the
to<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.750> reloader<00:03:07.640> they're<00:03:08.640> very<00:03:08.790> similar<00:03:09.060> in

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
to the reloader they're very similar in

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.140 
to the reloader they're very similar in
size<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.840> well<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.830> little<00:03:10.920> more<00:03:11.150> arced

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
size as well this is a little more arced

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.810 
size as well this is a little more arced
where<00:03:13.020> this<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.350> little<00:03:13.620> more<00:03:13.770> straight<00:03:14.220> but

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
where this is a little more straight but

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.620 
where this is a little more straight but
they<00:03:14.850> are<00:03:15.090> virtually<00:03:15.660> identical<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:16.230> size<00:03:17.630> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
they are virtually identical in size the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.080 
they are virtually identical in size the
blade<00:03:18.930> thicknesses<00:03:21.290> appears<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.470> be<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.820> same

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
blade thicknesses appears to be the same

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.540 
blade thicknesses appears to be the same
I<00:03:24.360> would<00:03:25.200> be<00:03:25.380> doubt<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.920> he<00:03:25.980> uses<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.340> same

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
I would be doubt that he uses the same

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.080 
I would be doubt that he uses the same
blade<00:03:27.390> stock<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.190> one<00:03:29.370> thirty<00:03:29.640> four<00:03:29.940> out

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
blade stock this is one thirty four out

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.400 
blade stock this is one thirty four out
of<00:03:30.180> five<00:03:30.360> hundred<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.080> this<00:03:31.770> again<00:03:32.070> is<00:03:33.200> 63<00:03:34.200> out

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
of five hundred and this again is 63 out

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.310 
of five hundred and this again is 63 out
of<00:03:34.560> 1000<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.400> think<00:03:36.239> he<00:03:36.330> did<00:03:36.510> just<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:37.020> certain

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
of 1000 I think he did just a certain

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.190 
of 1000 I think he did just a certain
number<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.590> each<00:03:37.800> in<00:03:38.070> each<00:03:38.220> style<00:03:39.050> which<00:03:40.050> is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
number of each in each style which is

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.080 
number of each in each style which is
nice<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:42.480> again<00:03:42.780> they<00:03:42.930> both<00:03:43.110> flip<00:03:43.500> great

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
nice but again they both flip great

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.229 
nice but again they both flip great
there's<00:03:45.090> no<00:03:46.130> no<00:03:47.130> issues<00:03:47.489> these<00:03:47.610> are<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.120> know

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
there's no no issues these are you know

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.430 
there's no no issues these are you know
really<00:03:48.810> great<00:03:49.110> flippers<00:03:49.790> excellent<00:03:50.790> designs

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
really great flippers excellent designs

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.280 
really great flippers excellent designs
and<00:03:52.440> again<00:03:53.450> you're<00:03:54.450> kind<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:54.720> unique<00:03:54.989> in<00:03:55.200> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
and again you're kind of unique in the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.020 
and again you're kind of unique in the
knife<00:03:55.470> world<00:03:55.769> there's<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.070> lot<00:03:56.190> more<00:03:56.220> texture

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
knife world there's a lot more texture

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.640 
knife world there's a lot more texture
and<00:03:57.360> design<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:58.019> can<00:03:58.050> tell<00:03:58.350> these<00:03:58.500> are

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
and design you can tell these are

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.220 
and design you can tell these are
designed<00:03:59.040> with<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.370> computer<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.989> really

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
designed with a computer and you really

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.130 
designed with a computer and you really
pushes<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.800> great<00:04:02.730> thick<00:04:03.060> liners<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.750> can<00:04:03.900> see

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
pushes it great thick liners you can see

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.130 
pushes it great thick liners you can see
here<00:04:04.580> you're<00:04:05.580> getting<00:04:05.910> really<00:04:06.510> great<00:04:07.820> lock<00:04:08.820> up

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
here you're getting really great lock up

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.440 
here you're getting really great lock up
this<00:04:10.140> hasn't<00:04:10.350> moved<00:04:10.650> much<00:04:11.070> at<00:04:11.940> all<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.360> was

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
this hasn't moved much at all it was

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.420 
this hasn't moved much at all it was
very<00:04:12.540> early<00:04:13.080> lock<00:04:13.320> up<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.769> flip<00:04:14.070> this<00:04:14.220> out<00:04:14.400> a

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
very early lock up and I flip this out a

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.539 
very early lock up and I flip this out a
ton<00:04:14.760> so<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.720> right<00:04:15.900> where<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.109> needs<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.410> be

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
ton so it's right where it needs to be

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.400 
ton so it's right where it needs to be
and<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.700> same<00:04:17.940> can<00:04:18.180> be<00:04:18.209> said<00:04:18.540> about<00:04:18.780> this<00:04:19.200> one

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
and the same can be said about this one

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.060 
and the same can be said about this one
really<00:04:20.400> great<00:04:20.729> lock<00:04:21.030> up<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:22.530> again<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.830> just

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
really great lock up so again I just

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.409 
really great lock up so again I just
wanted<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.340> give<00:04:23.490> people<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.880> little<00:04:24.060> bit<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.270> an

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
wanted to give people a little bit of an

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.080 
wanted to give people a little bit of an
insight<00:04:24.750> into

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
insight into

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.850 
insight into
how<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.240> compares<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:28.020> some<00:04:28.260> more<00:04:28.500> common
