00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.180
 Well I'm going to show you how it is that I 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.370
 I did this even though the 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.670
 town planner yesterday and the things that the video 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.670
 I should not have gone up yesterday but hey 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.520
 I made myself this 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.420
 it would 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.470
 have to try to find one that has 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.160
 pretty ink 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.160
 this highlighted 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.329
 but that is very big for me 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.300
 so he says to me I'm talking 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.620
 these sheets or the report and good was coming 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.010
 a sheet with many drawings would be I do not know 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.350
 how to say it and I'm cutting them out like that 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.559
 that then move on to sheet now think 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.549
 this I do not know why because he has one that 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.549
 have enough ink 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.140
 and well you have to put acetone I do not 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.670
 I have acetone now then you text that 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.130
 It is a very good brand and it is the only one that 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.690
 really removes the enamel or if not 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.420
 alcohol but not alcohol is very big 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.850
 of bottle bothers me with cotton in the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.820
 video told me cotton but if it is not 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.890
 like it's annoying and it drips a lot 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.960
 then we put 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.680
 and what they have a lot 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.680
 in cotton 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.609
 and the good ones try to cut them 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.109
 rather than not only the 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.740
 drawing because when they grab it not 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:46.509
 they have to touch the symptoms what black 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.479
 they give it to the other side and it wet it well 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.090
 well fine that it drips without touching the 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.409
 drawing and it has to be a drawing in 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.229
 black and white because if you do not do it 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.229
 notice skin thoroughly wet 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.110
 and once he's soaked he grabs it and 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.360
 before seeing where they want it once 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.360
 who already know they support 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.000
 and they have it for a while without moving 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.770
 Yes bad 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.330
 I give them a second if I stay but 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.890
 do not forget since we have two minutes 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.890
 but well I 'm not going to have that much 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.780
 but this video also precedes me to be 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.130
 a little long since I did not cut it because 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.160
 they did not want the cuts if you see me 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.820
 appear as trick and so on 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.820
 and good 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.069
 about blood very fast that's why it's 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.950
 that did not stay 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.079
 and also because the mobile I do not know if it 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.290
 note , take it out fast so you can see 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.510
 how to do it if I do not show it to me ever and 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.760
 it stayed like this the ink ran 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.879
 he still did not leave because I did it very 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.069
 quickly this one was the ink a lot and 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.840
 the black man was left but he was moved 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.960
 as 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.360
 good 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.360
 I took it out but it shows something 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.569
 good and that super easy if they want it 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.379
 take out with the same alcohol 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.379
 for sanz 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.450
 and it rises 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.760
 or if not with water they rub a little and 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.739
 comes out or if not when you bathe you are going to 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.750
 I guess what happens is that I said 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.680
 after bathing yesterday then now 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.540
 the night when I bathed I will see 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.880
 but it looks very nice and looks pretty 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.800
 real 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.800
 and it's easy and it does not hurt the skin 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.260
 good and that nothing and good this video 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.269
 page for serbia since they asked me 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.080
 those from there and good later if they want 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.960
 let them pass the other photos 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.550
 although it is that it has enough ink and not 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.810
 like this taken out that has a little 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.489
 because later they will be when 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.209
 let's propose 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.209
 cast 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.250
 well now it looks better 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.610
 but they do not have to measure where they are going to 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.610
 be here 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.330
 in throwing everything tower 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.770
 with strap 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.500
 without touching there and once they supported what 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.810
 keep 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.140
 a while without moving it so that they are not 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.140
 run 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.230
 good 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.540
 people
