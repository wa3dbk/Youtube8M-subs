00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.940
 so good day to all of me 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:13.910
 name is evgeny today i will tell you how 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:16.710
 change fuel pressure regulator to 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.930
 citroen c5 cars with diesel 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 engine 252 principle the same principle 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:31.769
 like 2 liters 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:35.250
 bosch motor here so the reason 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.890
 why I want to change it with me 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.270
 how would the car become bad 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.550
 wind up here first began to swim 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.260
 momentum well that is for the future momentum 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.050
 start swimming that is not exactly 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.620
 running wilderness what else would he 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.910
 continue some time well 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.890
 Sausage so to speak 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.860
 the reason is black smoke from the muffler 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:11.210
 bad traction gains momentum 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:14.400
 Well, that's the reason for this sensor 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.619
 on the sensor the grid is mostly clogged 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.689
 it can be rinsed simply rinse this 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.950
 mesh and as it were 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.780
 what will help for a while 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.350
 you can go washing 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.920
 ultrasonic bath that is pouring 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.220
 solvent 646 647 about my 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.560
 ultrasonic bath all kind of work 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.150
 so but now we will try it from 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.920
 envy well what i think is hardly how would he 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.920
 it won't start at all 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:59.530
 well yes that’s okay, we don’t want the sensor 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:03.890
 let's change how the sensor bought a new one 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:12.410
 I will open the original sensor now and 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:15.130
 I show you this one for today 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.130
 the operator 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:28.580
 author so well here it is the sensor bazhovsky 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:32.720
 niki so here it is the tip the tip here 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.420
 the so -called this here is a mesh and and bad 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.000
 It is clear that this is a mesh 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:51.519
 very very finely here and and slaughtered and 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:59.079
 car bad work can be seen here 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:04.329
 tsiferki him a pen right now we will do 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.329
 family so open the hood 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.220
 so i will do it even in the field 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.900
 conditions can be said on the street in the yard 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.120
 nothing here can do it 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.780
 every so here we have the motor 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.780
 two just do not force twice 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:41.040
 us cover the filter so here under the filters to 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.910
 here we have this is now pumps so 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.450
 here I took off 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:50.220
 the fuel filter and the sensor immediately became 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:53.910
 we see here we have a connector on it so 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.620
 to unscrew it we need an asterisk 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.030
 tharks 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:09.290
 call on 3330 now I will turn it off 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:09.290
 take off you show part on y sensor 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.790
 rinse and already rinsed 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.940
 repeatedly my case he is quite 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:23.310
 dead fishnet and even the tip is already 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.570
 bit off but did not help that is 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.870
 my only way was to start 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.700
 the car it was to connect the sensor 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.700
 which is on the ramp 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:43.780
 so. disconnect the car starts and 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:47.560
 It does not work as well as it is necessary here right now 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:53.730
 We put a new sensor Screw 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:57.270
 let's try here installed a new sensor 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.270
 table as cast 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:05.410
 on the brilliant brilliant pretty 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.410
 set back the filter 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:13.450
 we start the car so well that we sensor 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.790
 all set all restored now 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:19.970
 try to start the car so 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:24.530
 I will repeat it a couple more times 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.540
 Ignition so that the pump is located 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:31.090
 in the tank the booster pumped in there 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:49.660
 pressure is only after that we start 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:49.660
 turn on 1 1 2 1 3 1 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.080
 listen there even in the tank gurgled and what 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.260
 expelled all air from the filter system and 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.260
 tried to start 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.870
 Now the machine started up at once started up on 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.680
 just yet System 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.400
 injection pump 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.400
 1 fuel 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:15.899
 everything is working exactly momentum in principle 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:23.179
 now do not float on new sensors 

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:23.179
 there is a new sensor 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.450
 video ended subscribe to my 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.310
 channel put likes dislike like there 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.240
 even more precisely I do not know how it is 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:38.300
 called write comments 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.960
 come to contact me will try 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.440
 explain something tell prompt 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.440
 all all bye
