00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
that the maker puts in not just for

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.470 
that the maker puts in not just for

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
where the bridge should should sit if

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.949 
where the bridge should should sit if
you<00:02:20.720> were<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.170> draw<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> line<00:02:21.590> from<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.640> notch

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
you were to draw a line from this notch

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.740 
you were to draw a line from this notch
to<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.110> notch<00:02:24.290> on<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.680> other<00:02:24.800> side<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:26.480> line

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
to the notch on the other side that line

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.710 
to the notch on the other side that line
typically<00:02:27.470> will<00:02:27.890> intersect<00:02:28.550> right<00:02:29.360> down<00:02:29.570> the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
typically will intersect right down the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.350 
typically will intersect right down the
middle<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.260> bridge<00:02:30.610> that's<00:02:31.610> sort<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.209> a

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
middle of the bridge that's sort of a

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.660 
middle of the bridge that's sort of a
rough<00:02:32.600> guide<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.290> bridge<00:02:33.709> placement<00:02:34.370> and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
rough guide for bridge placement and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.510 
rough guide for bridge placement and
your<00:02:34.730> luthier<00:02:35.510> or<00:02:35.810> violin<00:02:36.739> maker<00:02:36.950> may<00:02:37.250> have<00:02:37.489> a

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
your luthier or violin maker may have a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.310 
your luthier or violin maker may have a
different<00:02:37.910> idea<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.480> where<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.050> put<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
different idea of where to put the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.280 
different idea of where to put the
bridge<00:02:39.560> based<00:02:40.489> on<00:02:40.760> where<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.450> position<00:02:41.630> is<00:02:42.050> of

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
bridge based on where the position is of

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.090 
bridge based on where the position is of
the<00:02:42.410> f-holes

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
the f-holes

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.509 
the f-holes
and<00:02:43.420> also<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:45.290> affect<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.769> string<00:02:46.070> length<00:02:46.250> on

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
and also to affect the string length on

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.030 
and also to affect the string length on
the<00:02:46.670> instrument<00:02:47.239> but<00:02:47.959> that's<00:02:48.140> generally

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
the instrument but that's generally

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.460 
the instrument but that's generally
where<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.730> bridge<00:02:49.910> should<00:02:50.180> go<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.170> want

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
where the bridge should go so you want

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.720 
where the bridge should go so you want
to<00:02:51.680> look<00:02:51.890> just<00:02:52.730> down<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.180> side<00:02:54.459> see<00:02:55.459> if<00:02:55.489> the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
to look just down the side see if the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.520 
to look just down the side see if the
knotch<00:02:55.940> lines<00:02:56.360> up<00:02:56.630> with<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.050> center<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.440> the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
knotch lines up with the center of the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.030 
knotch lines up with the center of the
bridge<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.640> in<00:02:59.390> some<00:02:59.660> cases<00:02:59.930> on<00:03:00.350> some<00:03:00.560> violins

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
bridge and in some cases on some violins

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.680 
bridge and in some cases on some violins
the<00:03:01.250> notches<00:03:01.459> aren't<00:03:01.970> even<00:03:02.209> in<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.360> same

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
the notches aren't even in the same

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.960 
the notches aren't even in the same
place<00:03:02.959> one<00:03:03.290> can<00:03:03.530> be<00:03:03.680> up<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.070> one<00:03:04.370> can<00:03:04.580> be<00:03:04.730> down

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
place one can be up and one can be down

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.300 
place one can be up and one can be down
so<00:03:05.810> they're<00:03:06.019> just<00:03:06.230> sort<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.769> rough<00:03:07.010> guide

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
so they're just sort of a rough guide

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.850 
so they're just sort of a rough guide
but<00:03:07.670> as<00:03:07.760> long<00:03:07.940> as<00:03:08.060> you've<00:03:08.209> got<00:03:08.420> your<00:03:08.450> bridge

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
but as long as you've got your bridge

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.350 
but as long as you've got your bridge
basically<00:03:09.860> sitting<00:03:10.640> in<00:03:10.820> between<00:03:10.970> these

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
basically sitting in between these

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.870 
basically sitting in between these
notches<00:03:12.100> you're<00:03:13.100> going<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.370> have<00:03:13.519> your<00:03:13.670> bridge

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
notches you're going to have your bridge

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.019 
notches you're going to have your bridge
in<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.420> good<00:03:14.600> spot<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.640> it's<00:03:16.640> just<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.630> simple
