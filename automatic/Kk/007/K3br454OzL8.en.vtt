hi<00:00:00.210> in<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.719> video<00:00:00.900> we're<00:00:01.380> going<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.560> be

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
hi in this video we're going to be

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.139 
hi in this video we're going to be
looking<00:00:01.829> at<00:00:01.979> applying<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.340> text<00:00:02.669> shadow<00:00:02.820> in

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
looking at applying a text shadow in

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.360 
looking at applying a text shadow in
such<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.840> way<00:00:04.110> that<00:00:04.140> it<00:00:04.470> creates<00:00:04.770> an<00:00:04.920> inset

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
such a way that it creates an inset

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.950 
such a way that it creates an inset
looking<00:00:05.640> effect<00:00:05.970> for<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.390> text<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:06.899> we

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
looking effect for the text that we

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.900 
looking effect for the text that we
apply<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.529> so<00:00:08.340> something<00:00:08.670> like<00:00:08.700> this

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
apply it to you so something like this

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.089 
apply it to you so something like this
where<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.110> headline<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.679> page<00:00:10.889> and

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
where we have a headline on a page and

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.129 
where we have a headline on a page and
the<00:00:11.550> text<00:00:11.849> looks<00:00:12.090> slightly<00:00:12.360> sunken<00:00:12.840> into<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
the text looks slightly sunken into the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.470 
the text looks slightly sunken into the
page<00:00:13.290> rather<00:00:13.740> than<00:00:13.860> giving<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.000> 3d<00:00:15.389> effect

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
page rather than giving it a 3d effect

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.390 
page rather than giving it a 3d effect
which<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.260> we<00:00:16.379> traditionally<00:00:16.680> expect

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
which is what we traditionally expect

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.000 
which is what we traditionally expect
from<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.119> text<00:00:18.390> shadow<00:00:18.449> property<00:00:19.010> we're

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
from the text shadow property we're

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.019 
from the text shadow property we're
going<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> be<00:00:20.279> doing<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.670> such<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> way

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
going to be doing this in such a way

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.240 
going to be doing this in such a way
that<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.480> reuse<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.900> style<00:00:22.350> anywhere<00:00:23.160> on

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
that we can reuse the style anywhere on

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.250 
that we can reuse the style anywhere on
the<00:00:23.369> site<00:00:23.519> nice<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.029> easily<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.630> by<00:00:24.689> using<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the site nice and easily just by using a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.400 
the site nice and easily just by using a
span<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.099> class<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.910> spam<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:28.230> let's

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
span and a class on that spam so let's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.769 
span and a class on that spam so let's
start<00:00:28.590> writing<00:00:28.920> some<00:00:29.070> code<00:00:29.480> what<00:00:30.480> we'll<00:00:30.630> need

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
start writing some code what we'll need

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.040 
start writing some code what we'll need
first<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.470> all<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.740> an<00:00:31.949> HTML<00:00:32.460> template<00:00:33.050> looking

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
first of all is an HTML template looking

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.720 
first of all is an HTML template looking
something<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.800> crucially<00:00:35.579> we'll

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
something like this and crucially we'll

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.970 
something like this and crucially we'll
have<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> link<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.570> style<00:00:36.899> sheet<00:00:37.020> which<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
have a link to a style sheet which is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.080 
have a link to a style sheet which is
where<00:00:38.129> we're<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> obviously<00:00:38.550> put<00:00:38.879> our

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
where we're going to obviously put our

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.270 
where we're going to obviously put our
text<00:00:39.450> shadow<00:00:39.540> property<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.230> use<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
text shadow property and use that and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
text shadow property and use that and
the<00:00:42.210> style<00:00:42.480> sheets<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the style sheets here is just in the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.510 
the style sheets here is just in the
same<00:00:43.800> directory<00:00:44.789> as<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.329> HTML<00:00:45.809> file<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:47.340> let's

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
same directory as the HTML file so let's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.299 
same directory as the HTML file so let's
start<00:00:47.760> doing<00:00:48.030> some<00:00:48.210> markup<00:00:48.800> we'll<00:00:49.800> need<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.980> div

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
start doing some markup we'll need a div

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.810 
start doing some markup we'll need a div
with<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:51.239> class<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.840> container<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> allow

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
with a class of container just to allow

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.680 
with a class of container just to allow
us<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.030> put<00:00:54.600> all<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.050> code<00:00:55.829> you'll<00:00:56.070> need<00:00:56.690> for

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
us to put all the code you'll need for

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.500 
us to put all the code you'll need for
the<00:00:57.809> headline<00:00:58.710> itself<00:00:59.129> inside<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.149> give

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the headline itself inside this and give

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.130 
the headline itself inside this and give
that<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> bit<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.930> formatting<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:02.489> there<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.760> are

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
that a bit of formatting so there we are

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.329 
that a bit of formatting so there we are
that's<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> first<00:01:04.470> thing<00:01:04.500> you'll<00:01:04.680> need<00:01:04.769> then

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.460 
that's the first thing you'll need then
inside<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.909> container<00:01:06.479> we'll<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.260> have

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
inside this container we'll just have

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.210 
inside this container we'll just have
our<00:01:07.939> h1<00:01:08.939> which<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.770> title<00:01:11.130> of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.710 
the page but you can have any element
there<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> P<00:01:14.340> tag<00:01:14.549> or<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.270> apply<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
there so a P tag or so on and apply the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.280

start<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.200> PTA<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:18.020> then<00:01:19.020> we'll<00:01:19.170> need

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
start of the PTA and then we'll need

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.419 
start of the PTA and then we'll need
some<00:01:19.560> text<00:01:20.040> say<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.939> dark<00:01:22.610> night

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.450 

then<00:01:27.429> we'll<00:01:27.579> need<00:01:27.670> some<00:01:27.850> text<00:01:28.270> so<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:29.049> dark

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
then we'll need some text so the dark

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.230 
then we'll need some text so the dark
knight<00:01:30.460> rises<00:01:31.299> will<00:01:32.079> do<00:01:32.229> nicely<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:33.240> finally

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
knight rises will do nicely and finally

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.090 
knight rises will do nicely and finally
we'll<00:01:34.630> apply<00:01:34.840> a<00:01:35.229> span<00:01:35.679> tag<00:01:36.009> around<00:01:36.880> this<00:01:37.149> text

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
we'll apply a span tag around this text

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.749 
we'll apply a span tag around this text
and<00:01:39.179> basically<00:01:40.179> we'll<00:01:40.719> add<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:41.079> class<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.729> the

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
and basically we'll add the class to the

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.349 
and basically we'll add the class to the
span<00:01:43.149> tag<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:44.130> class<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.310> insert<00:01:45.759> shadow<00:01:46.030> and

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
span tag a class of insert shadow and

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.419 
span tag a class of insert shadow and
that's<00:01:47.259> what<00:01:47.439> will<00:01:47.560> target<00:01:47.799> and<00:01:48.130> apply<00:01:48.369> the

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
that's what will target and apply the

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.480 
that's what will target and apply the
shadow<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:49.859> and<00:01:50.859> this<00:01:50.950> will<00:01:51.159> allow<00:01:51.310> us<00:01:51.340> to

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
shadow to you and this will allow us to

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.179 
shadow to you and this will allow us to
reuse<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.959> shadow<00:01:53.200> where<00:01:53.500> if<00:01:53.619> we<00:01:53.679> really<00:01:54.009> want

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
reuse the shadow where if we really want

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.370 
reuse the shadow where if we really want
to<00:01:54.340> say<00:01:54.849> for<00:01:55.000> example<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.420> us<00:01:55.539> to<00:01:55.689> take<00:01:55.869> rises

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
to say for example of us to take rises

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.819 
to say for example of us to take rises
out<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:57.219> there<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.789> put<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.060> here<00:01:58.619> then<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
out of there and put it here then the

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.649 
out of there and put it here then the
shadow<00:02:00.039> would<00:02:00.219> only<00:02:00.399> be<00:02:00.700> applied<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.479> dark

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
shadow would only be applied to the dark

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.209 
shadow would only be applied to the dark
night<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.140> not<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.069> word<00:02:03.640> rises<00:02:05.039> so<00:02:06.039> let's

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
night and not to the word rises so let's

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.499 
night and not to the word rises so let's
go<00:02:06.489> back<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:08.940> see<00:02:09.940> what<00:02:10.119> we<00:02:10.239> get<00:02:10.360> on

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
go back to this and see what we get on

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.839 
go back to this and see what we get on
the<00:02:10.599> page<00:02:10.810> with<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.349> at<00:02:12.129> the<00:02:12.220> moment<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.610> just

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
the page with that at the moment is just

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.430 
the page with that at the moment is just
a<00:02:12.940> basic<00:02:14.250> bit<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.340> HTML<00:02:15.519> with<00:02:15.849> no<00:02:16.000> styling<00:02:16.440> so

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
a basic bit of HTML with no styling so

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.580 
a basic bit of HTML with no styling so
let's<00:02:17.590> apply<00:02:17.680> some<00:02:17.980> styles<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.410> first

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
let's apply some styles so the first

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.559 
let's apply some styles so the first
thing<00:02:20.620> I'm<00:02:20.799> going<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.950> do<00:02:21.099> is<00:02:21.340> just<00:02:21.370> give<00:02:22.299> the

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
thing I'm going to do is just give the

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.289 
thing I'm going to do is just give the
background<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.319> color<00:02:24.160> which<00:02:24.879> is<00:02:25.030> going<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.209> be

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
background a color which is going to be

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.050 
background a color which is going to be
just<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.410> gray<00:02:26.590> color<00:02:26.739> then<00:02:27.670> I'm<00:02:27.849> going<00:02:28.000> to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
just a gray color then I'm going to

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.690 
just a gray color then I'm going to
remove<00:02:28.299> any<00:02:28.569> default<00:02:29.019> styling<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.799> any

the<00:02:55.720> page<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> little<00:02:56.290> bit<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.880> there<00:02:58.090> we<00:02:58.239> go<00:02:58.269> see

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
the page a little bit so there we go see

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.589 
the page a little bit so there we go see
that<00:02:59.079> again<00:02:59.639> and<00:03:00.639> there<00:03:00.849> we<00:03:00.940> are<00:03:01.000> we've<00:03:01.419> got

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
that again and there we are we've got

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.809 
that again and there we are we've got
our<00:03:01.750> title<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.769> middle<00:03:03.010> but<00:03:03.190> no<00:03:03.340> shadow

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
our title in the middle but no shadow

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.270 
our title in the middle but no shadow
applied<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.419> it<00:03:04.510> just<00:03:04.660> yet<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.069> let's<00:03:06.069> create

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
applied to it just yet so let's create

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.039 
applied to it just yet so let's create
the<00:03:06.489> shadow<00:03:07.109> so<00:03:08.109> you<00:03:08.169> will<00:03:08.349> select<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:10.049> so

the shadow so you will select the so

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.640 
the shadow so you will select the so

we'll select the spam tag using um so

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.960 
we'll select the spam tag using um so
I'll<00:03:14.769> select<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.190> spam<00:03:15.430> tagged<00:03:15.669> with<00:03:15.849> the

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
I'll select the spam tagged with the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.940 
I'll select the spam tagged with the
class<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.299> internet<00:03:16.690> shadow<00:03:16.959> using<00:03:17.859> this

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
class of internet shadow using this

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.159 
class of internet shadow using this
selector<00:03:18.489> here<00:03:18.519> and<00:03:18.880> then<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.870> first<00:03:20.049> thing

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
selector here and then the first thing

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.050 
selector here and then the first thing
we'll<00:03:20.380> need<00:03:20.500> which<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:20.769> crucial<00:03:21.310> is<00:03:21.549> we're

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
we'll need which is crucial is we're

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.110 
we'll need which is crucial is we're
going<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.269> give<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:23.519> text<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.639> color<00:03:24.910> of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
going to give the text a color of

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.539 
going to give the text a color of
transparent<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.650> what<00:03:26.859> this<00:03:26.980> means<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.519> that

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
transparent and what this means is that

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.460 
transparent and what this means is that
we<00:03:28.060> won't<00:03:28.239> actually<00:03:28.389> see<00:03:28.810> any<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.169> text

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
we won't actually see any of the text

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.559 
we won't actually see any of the text
will<00:03:29.590> only<00:03:29.799> see<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.190> shadows

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
will only see the shadows

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.270 
will only see the shadows
and<00:03:31.659> the<00:03:32.319> reason<00:03:32.469> this<00:03:32.680> works<00:03:32.829> is<00:03:33.129> because

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
and the reason this works is because

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.759 
and the reason this works is because
transparent<00:03:34.090> is<00:03:34.180> equivalent<00:03:34.659> to<00:03:34.749> having<00:03:35.560> an

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
transparent is equivalent to having an

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.309 
transparent is equivalent to having an
RGB<00:03:36.219> a<00:03:36.370> color<00:03:36.790> where<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.450> Alpha<00:03:37.780> value<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.139> set

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
RGB a color where the Alpha value is set

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.020 
RGB a color where the Alpha value is set
to<00:03:38.469> zero<00:03:38.709> so<00:03:38.950> we<00:03:39.340> literally<00:03:39.700> just<00:03:39.760> see

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
to zero so we literally just see

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.500 
to zero so we literally just see
straight<00:03:40.450> through<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:42.340> text<00:03:42.639> itself<00:03:42.730> as<00:03:43.239> it

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
straight through the text itself as it

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.080 
straight through the text itself as it
isn't<00:03:43.780> there<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.519> then<00:03:45.519> we'll<00:03:45.670> need<00:03:45.819> some

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
isn't there and then we'll need some

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.319 
isn't there and then we'll need some
text<00:03:46.329> shadows<00:03:47.219> now<00:03:48.219> we<00:03:48.280> need<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.670> text<00:03:49.030> shadows

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
text shadows now we need to text shadows

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.110 
text shadows now we need to text shadows
and<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:50.560> can<00:03:50.680> use<00:03:50.829> two<00:03:51.040> shakes<00:03:51.310> take<00:03:51.790> shadows

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
and you can use two shakes take shadows

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.080 
and you can use two shakes take shadows
by<00:03:52.299> commas<00:03:52.629> separating<00:03:53.040> text<00:03:54.040> chalets<00:03:54.310> in<00:03:54.519> the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
by commas separating text chalets in the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.199 
by commas separating text chalets in the
selector<00:03:55.739> so<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.829> first<00:03:56.980> of<00:03:57.159> all<00:03:57.219> I<00:03:57.250> need<00:03:57.459> is<00:03:57.849> a

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
selector so the first of all I need is a

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.509 
selector so the first of all I need is a
white<00:03:58.569> text<00:03:58.930> shadow<00:03:59.019> with<00:03:59.829> a<00:03:59.859> slight<00:04:00.250> offset

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
white text shadow with a slight offset

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.259 
white text shadow with a slight offset
so<00:04:01.389> I'm<00:04:02.139> going<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.349> have<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.829> y<00:04:03.310> offset<00:04:03.430> of<00:04:03.730> 1x

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
so I'm going to have a y offset of 1x

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.800 
so I'm going to have a y offset of 1x
offset<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:05.019> one<00:04:05.200> a<00:04:06.060> blur<00:04:07.060> radius<00:04:07.239> of<00:04:07.599> two

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
offset of one a blur radius of two

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.009 
offset of one a blur radius of two
pixels<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:08.469> then<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:10.120> color<00:04:10.389> is<00:04:10.599> going<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.930> be

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
pixels and then the color is going to be

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:17.909 
pixels and then the color is going to be
rgba<00:04:12.930> 255<00:04:14.699> 255<00:04:15.699> 255<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.930> then<00:04:17.650> I'm<00:04:17.829> gonna

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
rgba 255 255 255 and then I'm gonna

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.189 
rgba 255 255 255 and then I'm gonna
pacity<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.579> nor<00:04:18.759> point<00:04:18.970> six<00:04:19.269> so<00:04:19.930> it's<00:04:20.049> going<00:04:20.139> to

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
pacity of nor point six so it's going to

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.390 
pacity of nor point six so it's going to
be<00:04:20.259> white<00:04:20.440> but<00:04:20.620> we<00:04:20.739> can<00:04:20.889> see<00:04:21.130> through<00:04:21.370> it

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
be white but we can see through it

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.969 
be white but we can see through it
slightly<00:04:21.789> and<00:04:22.229> then<00:04:23.229> the<00:04:23.410> next<00:04:23.440> thing<00:04:23.770> we'll

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
slightly and then the next thing we'll

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.620 
slightly and then the next thing we'll
need<00:04:24.130> is<00:04:25.289> actually<00:04:26.289> before<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:26.590> do<00:04:26.710> that<00:04:27.630> let's

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
need is actually before I do that let's

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.210 
need is actually before I do that let's
save<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.380> see<00:04:29.620> what<00:04:29.740> it<00:04:29.800> looks<00:04:29.949> like<00:04:30.070> on

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
save this and see what it looks like on

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.540 
save this and see what it looks like on
the<00:04:30.340> page<00:04:31.440> here<00:04:32.440> we<00:04:32.560> here<00:04:32.919> we<00:04:32.979> can<00:04:33.160> see<00:04:33.340> what<00:04:33.460> we

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
the page here we here we can see what we

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.920 
the page here we here we can see what we
have<00:04:33.699> and<00:04:33.940> it's<00:04:34.060> just<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.330> bit<00:04:34.479> of<00:04:34.509> a<00:04:34.599> blur<00:04:34.810> at

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
have and it's just a bit of a blur at

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.420 
have and it's just a bit of a blur at
the<00:04:35.020> moment<00:04:35.289> and<00:04:35.440> not<00:04:35.590> doesn't<00:04:35.919> quite<00:04:36.220> look

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
the moment and not doesn't quite look

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.089 
the moment and not doesn't quite look
like<00:04:36.490> what<00:04:36.759> we<00:04:36.849> want<00:04:37.000> at<00:04:37.120> all<00:04:37.380> so<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.710> crucial

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
like what we want at all so the crucial

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.640 
like what we want at all so the crucial
thing<00:04:39.130> to<00:04:39.370> do<00:04:39.460> now<00:04:39.669> is<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.449> apply<00:04:40.599> a<00:04:40.930> black<00:04:41.199> box

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
thing to do now is to apply a black box

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.670 
thing to do now is to apply a black box
shadow<00:04:42.240> sorry<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.810> crucial<00:04:43.990> thing<00:04:44.199> to<00:04:44.409> do<00:04:44.500> now

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
shadow sorry the crucial thing to do now

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.300 
shadow sorry the crucial thing to do now
is<00:04:44.949> apply<00:04:45.220> black<00:04:45.550> text<00:04:45.970> shadow<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.979> we're<00:04:48.220> not

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
is apply black text shadow and we're not

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.649 
is apply black text shadow and we're not
going<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.550> give<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:48.789> black<00:04:48.940> text<00:04:49.300> shadow<00:04:49.419> and

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:49.659 
going to give the black text shadow and

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:50.909 
going to give the black text shadow and
offset<00:04:49.960> at<00:04:50.050> all<00:04:50.199> it's<00:04:50.409> going<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.710> render

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
offset at all it's going to render

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.110 
offset at all it's going to render
exactly<00:04:51.460> where<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.669> color<00:04:51.880> would<00:04:52.060> render<00:04:52.590> and

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
exactly where the color would render and

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.430 
exactly where the color would render and
the<00:04:55.120> reason<00:04:55.419> we're<00:04:55.630> doing<00:04:55.750> this<00:04:55.870> is<00:04:56.139> so<00:04:56.259> that

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
the reason we're doing this is so that

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.249 
the reason we're doing this is so that
we<00:04:56.590> can<00:04:56.919> see<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.430> very<00:04:58.030> slight<00:04:58.720> amount<00:04:58.960> of<00:04:59.169> the

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
we can see a very slight amount of the

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.230 
we can see a very slight amount of the
black<00:04:59.440> text<00:04:59.710> shadow<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.130> then<00:05:00.610> all<00:05:00.849> of<00:05:00.880> the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
black text shadow and then all of the

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.050 
black text shadow and then all of the
white<00:05:01.389> text<00:05:01.720> shadow<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.789> that'll<00:05:03.789> allow<00:05:04.030> us

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
white text shadow and that'll allow us

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.610 
white text shadow and that'll allow us
to<00:05:04.539> create<00:05:04.659> the<00:05:04.900> effect<00:05:04.960> that<00:05:05.259> we're<00:05:05.440> going

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
to create the effect that we're going

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.279 
to create the effect that we're going
for<00:05:06.090> so<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.150> summarize<00:05:07.419> before<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:07.990> show<00:05:08.139> this

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
for so to summarize before I show this

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:09.990 
for so to summarize before I show this
on<00:05:08.409> the<00:05:08.560> page<00:05:08.740> we<00:05:09.430> have<00:05:09.460> a<00:05:09.580> color<00:05:09.880> of

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
on the page we have a color of

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.149 
on the page we have a color of
transparent<00:05:10.539> which<00:05:11.169> means<00:05:11.380> we<00:05:11.500> don't<00:05:11.710> see<00:05:11.949> the

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
transparent which means we don't see the

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.920 
transparent which means we don't see the
text<00:05:12.490> itself<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.940> tool<00:05:13.150> we<00:05:13.449> only<00:05:13.599> see<00:05:13.810> the

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
text itself a tool we only see the

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.499 
text itself a tool we only see the
shadows<00:05:14.259> we<00:05:15.159> have<00:05:15.280> a<00:05:15.310> white<00:05:15.580> shadow<00:05:16.060> that<00:05:16.389> is

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
shadows we have a white shadow that is

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.360 
shadows we have a white shadow that is
slightly<00:05:16.719> see<00:05:16.990> through<00:05:17.020> so<00:05:17.889> that<00:05:18.009> we<00:05:18.070> can<00:05:18.190> see

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
slightly see through so that we can see

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.589 
slightly see through so that we can see
some<00:05:18.550> of<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.669> background<00:05:19.060> through<00:05:19.479> the

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
some of the background through the

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.020 
some of the background through the
shadow<00:05:19.780> and<00:05:20.740> behind<00:05:21.159> that<00:05:21.340> shadow<00:05:21.580> we<00:05:21.880> have<00:05:21.969> a

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
shadow and behind that shadow we have a

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.149 
shadow and behind that shadow we have a
black<00:05:22.389> shadow<00:05:22.659> which<00:05:23.590> is<00:05:23.740> just<00:05:23.919> a<00:05:24.009> solid

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
black shadow which is just a solid

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.110 
black shadow which is just a solid
shadow<00:05:25.050> so<00:05:26.050> let's<00:05:26.229> save<00:05:26.409> that<00:05:26.729> go<00:05:27.729> to<00:05:27.789> the<00:05:27.969> page

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
shadow so let's save that go to the page

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.450 
shadow so let's save that go to the page
refresh<00:05:28.900> and<00:05:29.199> there<00:05:29.229> we<00:05:29.830> are<00:05:29.860> we<00:05:30.130> have<00:05:30.310> our

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
refresh and there we are we have our

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.040 
refresh and there we are we have our
effect<00:05:30.789> just<00:05:31.210> like<00:05:31.360> what<00:05:31.570> we<00:05:31.599> wanted

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
effect just like what we wanted

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.899 
effect just like what we wanted

and five in the final thing I'm going to

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.389 
and five in the final thing I'm going to
do<00:05:36.089> is<00:05:36.389> remove<00:05:36.719> rises<00:05:37.259> from<00:05:37.770> that<00:05:37.919> span<00:05:38.189> tag

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:38.399 
do is remove rises from that span tag

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:41.739 
do is remove rises from that span tag

just to show you that the shadow is only

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.379 
just to show you that the shadow is only
going<00:05:44.159> to<00:05:44.279> be<00:05:44.339> applied<00:05:44.580> to<00:05:45.029> the<00:05:45.119> bit<00:05:45.270> inside

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
going to be applied to the bit inside

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.050 
going to be applied to the bit inside
