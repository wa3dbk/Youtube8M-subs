00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.630 
can see we got the new plug out and we
got<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.910> nice<00:02:12.209> bit<00:02:12.570> of<00:02:12.680> anti-seize<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:14.250> them

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
got a nice bit of anti-seize on them

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.940 
got a nice bit of anti-seize on them
makes<00:02:15.510> them<00:02:15.600> taking<00:02:16.080> them<00:02:16.200> out<00:02:16.320> easier<00:02:16.739> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
makes them taking them out easier the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.830 
makes them taking them out easier the
next<00:02:17.010> time<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:17.430> do<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.600> we're<00:02:18.750> going

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
next time we do this and as we're going

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.610 
next time we do this and as we're going
to<00:02:18.930> do<00:02:19.110> we're<00:02:19.320> just<00:02:19.470> going<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.709> put<00:02:19.890> them<00:02:19.980> right

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
to do we're just going to put them right

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.520 
to do we're just going to put them right
into<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.739> end<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.130> six<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:25.230> spark

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
into the end of the six the the spark

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.699 
into the end of the six the the spark
plug<00:02:25.739> wrench<00:02:26.840> socket<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.170> then<00:02:28.380> put<00:02:28.620> them

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
plug wrench socket and then put them

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.300 
plug wrench socket and then put them
back<00:02:28.739> in

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.680 

now<00:02:35.310> make<00:02:35.550> sure<00:02:35.580> you're<00:02:35.880> really<00:02:36.090> careful<00:02:36.570> when

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
now make sure you're really careful when

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.610 
now make sure you're really careful when
you<00:02:36.810> do<00:02:36.960> this<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:38.070> go<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.460> like<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:40.560> have

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
you do this you go in like so you have

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.490 
you do this you go in like so you have
to<00:02:40.860> pull<00:02:41.100> up<00:02:41.130> on<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.460> plastic<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.060> little<00:02:42.090> bit

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
to pull up on the plastic a little bit

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.930 
to pull up on the plastic a little bit
but<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.710> want<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.950> gingerly<00:02:44.370> ease<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.820> in

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
but you just want to gingerly ease it in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.680 
but you just want to gingerly ease it in
there<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.240> twist<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.690> down<00:02:47.360> twist<00:02:48.360> twist

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
there and twist it down twist twist

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.140 
there and twist it down twist twist
twist<00:02:48.870> twist<00:02:49.320> twist<00:02:49.500> until<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:50.760> start<00:02:51.030> to

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
twist twist twist until you start to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150 
twist twist twist until you start to
feel<00:02:51.180> resistant<00:02:52.020> because<00:02:52.200> that's<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.800> spark

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
feel resistant because that's the spark

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.580 
feel resistant because that's the spark
plug<00:02:53.430> settling<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.300> as<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:55.050> can<00:02:55.200> see<00:02:55.410> it's

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
plug settling in as you can see it's

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.480 
plug settling in as you can see it's
going<00:02:55.800> deeper<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.340> still<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.310> got<00:02:59.460> a

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
going deeper and still and I got a

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.160 
going deeper and still and I got a
little<00:02:59.760> resistance<00:03:00.300> there<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.990> we're<00:03:01.140> just

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
little resistance there so we're just

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.720 
little resistance there so we're just
going<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.940> finish<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.240> off<00:03:03.420> with<00:03:03.690> our<00:03:04.730> ratchet

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
going to finish it off with our ratchet

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.660 
going to finish it off with our ratchet
here<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.770> we're<00:03:07.890> not<00:03:07.980> going<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.250> put<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.520> too

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
here and we're not going to put it too

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.200 
here and we're not going to put it too
tight<00:03:08.940> just<00:03:09.240> tight<00:03:09.600> enough<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.550> we<00:03:11.550> know<00:03:11.790> there

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
tight just tight enough so we know there

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.950 
tight just tight enough so we know there
goes<00:03:12.570> it's<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.890> back<00:03:14.100> off<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.370> little<00:03:14.670> bit

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
goes it's in and back off a little bit

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.780 
goes it's in and back off a little bit
there<00:03:15.960> we<00:03:16.230> go<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.800> in<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.610> just

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
there we go and it's in and you just

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.430 
there we go and it's in and you just
repeat<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.330> step<00:03:18.630> for<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.960> three<00:03:19.290> other

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
repeat this step for the three other

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.240 
repeat this step for the three other
holes<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.060> then<00:03:21.060> put<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.720> coil<00:03:22.620> packs<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:23.100> and

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
holes and then put the coil packs in and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.930 
holes and then put the coil packs in and
you're<00:03:23.400> done<00:03:23.700> as<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:25.380> can<00:03:25.410> see<00:03:25.830> all<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.700> plugs

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
you're done as you can see all the plugs

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.420 
you're done as you can see all the plugs
are<00:03:27.090> back<00:03:27.300> in<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:28.410> just<00:03:28.770> in<00:03:28.920> time<00:03:29.160> because

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
are back in and just in time because

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.280 
are back in and just in time because
it's<00:03:29.730> about<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.180> force<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.630> rain<00:03:30.840> down<00:03:31.020> on<00:03:31.080> me

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
it's about the force of rain down on me

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.070 
it's about the force of rain down on me
so<00:03:32.040> altogether<00:03:32.490> if<00:03:33.120> you're<00:03:33.390> motivated<00:03:33.600> it

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
so altogether if you're motivated it

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.650 
so altogether if you're motivated it
should<00:03:34.260> take<00:03:34.470> about<00:03:34.740> 20<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.190> 30<00:03:35.520> minutes<00:03:35.940> it

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
should take about 20 to 30 minutes it

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.240 
should take about 20 to 30 minutes it
took<00:03:36.810> me<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.020> little<00:03:37.170> longer<00:03:37.320> since<00:03:37.770> I<00:03:37.950> had<00:03:38.100> to

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
took me a little longer since I had to

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.370 
took me a little longer since I had to
jerry-rig<00:03:38.490> my<00:03:39.000> extension<00:03:39.540> bolt<00:03:39.750> but<00:03:40.170> under

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
jerry-rig my extension bolt but under

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.020 
jerry-rig my extension bolt but under
that<00:03:40.500> it's<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.800> simple<00:03:41.280> cost-effective

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
that it's a simple cost-effective

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.600 
that it's a simple cost-effective
measure<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:43.350> change<00:03:43.650> your<00:03:43.860> own<00:03:44.010> spark<00:03:44.370> plugs

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
measure to change your own spark plugs

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.940 
measure to change your own spark plugs
without<00:03:44.850> taking<00:03:45.240> it<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.540> dealership

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
without taking it to the dealership

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.410 
without taking it to the dealership
altogether<00:03:46.950> between<00:03:47.430> tools<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.000> parts<00:03:48.150> were

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
altogether between tools and parts were

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.450 
altogether between tools and parts were
about<00:03:48.660> sixty<00:03:49.170> bucks<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.680> about<00:03:50.040> an<00:03:50.160> hour<00:03:50.310> of

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
about sixty bucks and about an hour of

about sixty bucks and about an hour of
