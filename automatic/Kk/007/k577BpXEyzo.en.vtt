00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
know what they can get away with when

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.940 
know what they can get away with when
and<00:03:10.600> where<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:12.780> they<00:03:13.780> get<00:03:14.049> no<00:03:14.260> treats<00:03:14.709> when

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950
