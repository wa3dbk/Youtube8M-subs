formatting I'll go in resume

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.690 
formatting I'll go in resume
all<00:02:44.469> right<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:44.890> now<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.129> our<00:02:45.249> format<00:02:45.579> is

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
all right and now that our format is

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.309 
all right and now that our format is
complete<00:02:46.060> what<00:02:46.269> we<00:02:46.390> need<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.659> do<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:46.900> make<00:02:47.109> the

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
complete what we need to do is make the

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.520 
complete what we need to do is make the
card<00:02:47.859> bootable<00:02:48.249> for<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.790> camera<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.930> that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
card bootable for the camera and that

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.410 
card bootable for the camera and that
goes<00:02:50.709> pretty<00:02:50.950> quickly<00:02:51.340> as<00:02:51.579> you<00:02:51.700> can<00:02:51.849> see<00:02:52.090> here

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
goes pretty quickly as you can see here

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.270 
goes pretty quickly as you can see here
basically<00:02:53.139> what<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.680> want<00:02:53.859> to<00:02:53.920> make<00:02:54.040> sure<00:02:54.159> that

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
we do is just lock the card after we

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.470 
we do is just lock the card after we
remove<00:02:56.499> it<00:02:56.530> from<00:02:56.680> our<00:02:56.980> card<00:02:57.400> beater<00:02:57.609> now<00:02:58.329> we're

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
remove it from our card beater now we're

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.500 
remove it from our card beater now we're
going<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.629> select<00:02:58.810> chdk<00:02:59.439> to<00:02:59.680> card<00:03:00.280> up<00:03:00.670> here<00:03:00.969> and
