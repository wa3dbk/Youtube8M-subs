00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.000
 The Hope for Swans organization received an emergency call 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 About a dog lying on a pile of rubbish. 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.000
 Of course he has rays. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 I was told Miley survived here for months 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Bravo. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Let's go. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 No, we did not sit down again. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 We got to the veterinary office. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Miley suffered from rays, parasites, bacterial infections and malnutrition. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 He needed baths and treatment for all the wounds. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Miley was exhausted. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Her body would take time to heal. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 But on the third day, he kissed me. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 After two weeks, she met Frankie. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 He was saved from a drain pipe and was scared of anything. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Miley took Frankie under his wing. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And they quickly became good friends. 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.700
 Put this clip on to help them find a home. 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.700
 Please make a donation of $ 5 to help us save lives. 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.700
