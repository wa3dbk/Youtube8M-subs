bit more nervous and now you can see how

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
bit more nervous and now you can see how
it's<00:01:00.090> leaping<00:01:00.390> what's<00:01:01.109> gonna<00:01:01.320> happen<00:01:01.680> next

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and then his whiskers are gonna come out

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.520 
and then his whiskers are gonna come out
of<00:01:04.619> these<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:04.949> dots<00:01:05.479> here<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.600> his<00:01:06.780> chest

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.950 
of these little dots here is his chest
and<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:08.400> course<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> female<00:01:09.119> has<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.570> little

and of course the female has a little
bit<00:01:10.080> larger<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.619> because<00:01:10.799> she<00:01:11.010> would<00:01:11.189> use

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
bit larger here because she would use

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.109 
bit larger here because she would use
that<00:01:11.729> fur<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.750> line<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.229> nest<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:13.920> she<00:01:14.189> has

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that fur to line the nest when she has

that fur to line the nest when she has
her<00:01:15.150> babies<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.590> puffs<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.250> little

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
her babies so that puffs out a little

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.880 
her babies so that puffs out a little
bit<00:01:17.670> even<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> male<00:01:18.509> rabbit<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.409> then

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
bit even in the male rabbit and then

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.550 
bit even in the male rabbit and then
surprisingly<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:21.060> legs<00:01:21.330> are<00:01:21.600> quite<00:01:21.840> sure<00:01:22.229> in

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
surprisingly the legs are quite sure in

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.200 
surprisingly the legs are quite sure in
the<00:01:22.680> front<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.150> bulges<00:01:24.930> out<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.210> I

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the front and then it's bulges out and I

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.100 
the front and then it's bulges out and I
can't<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> same

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
can't have that same

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.780 
can't have that same
kind<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.470> fact<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:30.100> he's<00:01:30.250> gonna<00:01:30.400> be<00:01:30.580> holding

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
kind of fact that he's gonna be holding

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.070 
kind of fact that he's gonna be holding
a<00:01:31.060> basket

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
a basket

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.820 
a basket
so<00:01:32.680> I'll<00:01:32.830> just<00:01:33.040> drive<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.550> lightly<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.830> the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
so I'll just drive that lightly and the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.110 
so I'll just drive that lightly and the
reason<00:01:36.040> I'm<00:01:36.100> drawing<00:01:36.340> out<00:01:36.430> lightly<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:36.880> cuz<00:01:37.030> I

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
reason I'm drawing out lightly and cuz I

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.670 
reason I'm drawing out lightly and cuz I
might<00:01:37.240> show<00:01:37.480> some<00:01:37.540> flowers<00:01:38.050> or<00:01:38.200> something<00:01:38.380> can

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
might show some flowers or something can

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.680 
might show some flowers or something can

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
huge big back legs because that's the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.550 
huge big back legs because that's the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
and then trying to make this look like a

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.620 
and then trying to make this look like a
realistic<00:02:08.290> basket<00:02:09.030> now<00:02:10.030> if<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.270> didn't<00:02:10.510> want

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
realistic basket now if you didn't want

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.650 
realistic basket now if you didn't want
to<00:02:10.690> go<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.899> all<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.260> trouble<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:12.630> completed<00:02:13.630> a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
to go to all the trouble you completed a

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.690 
to go to all the trouble you completed a
basket<00:02:14.230> -<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.650> didn't<00:02:15.070> have<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.190> decorated

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
basket - I didn't have a decorated

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.550 
basket - I didn't have a decorated
basket<00:02:16.120> that's<00:02:16.270> that's<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.720> artist<00:02:17.110> and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
basket that's that's to the artist and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.310 
basket that's that's to the artist and
now<00:02:18.070> I'll<00:02:18.250> get<00:02:18.490> my<00:02:18.640> watercolors<00:02:19.270> ready<00:02:19.540> and

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
now I'll get my watercolors ready and

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.470 
now I'll get my watercolors ready and
he's<00:02:20.650> kind<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.070> grayish<00:02:21.370> brown<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.300> I<00:02:22.330> never

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
he's kind of a grayish brown so I never

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.660 
he's kind of a grayish brown so I never
used<00:02:22.870> black<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.320> just<00:02:23.530> used<00:02:23.709> blue<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.400> brown

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
used black I just used blue and brown

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.820 
used black I just used blue and brown
mixed<00:02:24.940> together<00:02:25.240> I<00:02:25.720> think<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.500> looks<00:02:26.650> more

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
mixed together I think it looks more

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.540 
mixed together I think it looks more
natural

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
natural

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.810 
natural

some eggs same thing I'm just gonna go

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.979 
some eggs same thing I'm just gonna go
around<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.290> edges<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.830> them<00:02:51.330> now<00:02:52.330> I'm<00:02:52.810> gonna

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
around the edges of them now I'm gonna

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.310 
around the edges of them now I'm gonna
mix<00:02:53.260> my<00:02:53.560> color<00:02:54.060> for<00:02:55.060> his<00:02:55.209> body<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:56.080> there's

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
there so just using a lots of big wide

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.750 
there so just using a lots of big wide
strokes<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.019> if<00:03:02.410> I<00:03:02.650> were<00:03:02.800> doing<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.190> for<00:03:03.459> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
strokes and if I were doing this for the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.370 
strokes and if I were doing this for the
finished<00:03:04.150> page<00:03:04.360> for<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.690> book<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:05.110> would<00:03:05.200> take

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
finished page for the book it would take

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.650 
finished page for the book it would take
an<00:03:05.500> hour<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:06.040> do<00:03:06.190> an<00:03:06.310> inch<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.300> would<00:03:07.480> take

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
an hour to do an inch and I would take

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.250 
an hour to do an inch and I would take
probably<00:03:07.959> one<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.230> my<00:03:08.560> really<00:03:09.130> small<00:03:10.320> brushes

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
probably one of my really small brushes

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.210 
probably one of my really small brushes
I<00:03:12.290> would<00:03:12.890> put<00:03:13.129> in<00:03:13.280> some<00:03:13.489> of<00:03:13.519> those<00:03:13.730> for<00:03:14.629> like

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
I would put in some of those for like

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.250 
I would put in some of those for like
textures<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:17.269> there's<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.629> little<00:03:17.930> bit<00:03:18.049> of<00:03:18.140> an

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
textures so there's a little bit of an

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.869 
textures so there's a little bit of an
indication<00:03:18.709> of<00:03:18.890> what<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.129> first<00:03:19.459> gonna<00:03:19.730> look

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
indication of what the first gonna look
