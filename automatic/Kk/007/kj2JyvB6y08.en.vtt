00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.200
 and there is still hope that you guys will 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.820
 then we proceed to that says 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.040
 that we give earlier about the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.460
 support what some applications 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.460
 come on 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.920
 That's it, folks coming back, then it's 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.930
 showing two applications in here for 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.370
 support huck he reminds us that we did 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.290
 this huck bracket 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.120
 for those who did not go, I will leave the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.910
 link in the description and you can 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.920
 watch how do look good support 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.080
 Nice to meet you guys here. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.820
 line size are you going to say 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.910
 depending on the size of bait you 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.010
 for use ok so we can use it for 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.579
 example that an official statement 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.909
 This one is a poseidon staircase of 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.909
 deep well very good 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.970
 ok here is the model of 17 for those 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:16.110
 want to know the model ex 17 of poseidon 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.790
 Okay, here you can fall for you, so the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.799
 use that we can do is this one 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.670
 people here put it 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.740
 just get position that is maybe him 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.400
 stay a little too long from the pre for this 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.079
 is here but it's just for you to have the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.539
 idea is here 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.670
 he gets stuck that only the ideal is 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.310
 in this case it is that it is shorter or 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:51.929
 be the correct distance would it be 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:54.780
 to stay here or here, the most correct would be 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.390
 If you stay here then you 're not 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.340
 to blow the garate down there is that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.240
 I did here in the previous video without measuring 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.700
 practice no okay but you already know then 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.910
 Ideally you are to give a distance from the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.520
 gazzetta and it helps a lot there to 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.060
 until the fish arrives 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.120
 until it ends up getting the support hulk is and 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.130
 another and another 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:30.870
 another nice use too if I 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:33.390
 got out of here is also another 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.100
 well cool is also a shrimp 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.620
 artificial is here 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.090
 so here is a tide shrimp is 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.689
 people put it the same way they put it. 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.689
 on 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.200
 put what pulls here I do not know the 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.390
 size is good not only the guys 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.240
 Who I told you was made in the video. 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.390
 previous but does not practice any 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.400
 to demonstrate but he can also 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.900
 stay a little shorter than that 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.150
 here it is or it can not be due more 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.320
 or less at this distance here or fell 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.530
 more ideal 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.110
 It's just you guys arrested on top just passing 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.690
 and it has already been paid then this is it was there 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:22.510
 two ideas there for you to use your 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:25.460
