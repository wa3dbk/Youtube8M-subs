00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
there on the input shaft of the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.099 
there on the input shaft of the
transmission<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.820> sprayed<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.689> down<00:00:27.810> good

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
transmission and I sprayed it down good

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.480 
transmission and I sprayed it down good
but<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.349> got<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> break<00:00:29.250> loose

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
but I got it's going to break loose

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.209

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
unless I get in there physically work it

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.090 
unless I get in there physically work it
loose<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.290> this<00:00:34.290> thing<00:00:34.500> has<00:00:34.680> an<00:00:34.800> enclosed

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
