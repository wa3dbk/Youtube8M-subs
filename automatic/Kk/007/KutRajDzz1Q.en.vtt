I'm<00:00:00.210> over<00:00:00.480> at<00:00:00.510> Oakwood<00:00:00.930> Avenue<00:00:01.439> here<00:00:01.709> in

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
I'm over at Oakwood Avenue here in

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.160 
I'm over at Oakwood Avenue here in
Huntsville<00:00:02.040> Alabama<00:00:02.399> and<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.360> crossing<00:00:03.929> is

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
Huntsville Alabama and the crossing is

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.980 
Huntsville Alabama and the crossing is
malfunctioning<00:00:04.620> as<00:00:05.460> you<00:00:05.759> can<00:00:05.940> see<00:00:06.210> because

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
malfunctioning as you can see because

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.179 
malfunctioning as you can see because
they're<00:00:07.200> currently<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.500> direct<00:00:07.919> traffic

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189

they're currently on direct traffic
around<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.849> gate<00:00:11.269> the<00:00:12.269> eye<00:00:12.990> actually<00:00:13.620> is

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
around the gate the eye actually is

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.169 
around the gate the eye actually is
pulling<00:00:14.190> up<00:00:14.309> here<00:00:14.519> when<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.790> noticed<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
pulling up here when I noticed the

pulling up here when I noticed the
crossing<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.599> malfunctioning<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.770> train

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
crossing was malfunctioning so train

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
the gate mechanism safe chain over there

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.770 
the gate mechanism safe chain over there
too<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.920> right<00:01:27.370> there<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:28.180> gate<00:01:28.360> lights<00:01:28.600> are

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
too and right there the gate lights are

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.440 
too and right there the gate lights are
from<00:01:28.930> Rico<00:01:29.290> as<00:01:29.440> well<00:01:29.940> except<00:01:30.940> this<00:01:31.060> signor<00:01:31.420> I

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
from Rico as well except this signor I

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.360 
from Rico as well except this signor I
guess<00:01:31.720> West<00:01:31.990> :<00:01:32.230> haze<00:01:32.380> with<00:01:32.530> can't<00:01:32.740> go<00:01:32.860> bail<00:01:33.070> and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
guess West : haze with can't go bail and

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.130 
guess West : haze with can't go bail and
it's<00:01:33.610> really<00:01:34.000> it's<00:01:34.330> a<00:01:34.540> really<00:01:34.570> interesting

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
it's really it's a really interesting

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.740 
it's really it's a really interesting
Val<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:37.120> setup<00:01:37.450> over<00:01:37.630> here<00:01:37.960> is<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.490> bail

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
Val the setup over here is for the bail

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.890 
Val the setup over here is for the bail
because<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:41.290> bail<00:01:41.890> actually<00:01:42.670> rings<00:01:43.510> on<00:01:43.810> the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
because the bail actually rings on the

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.230 
because the bail actually rings on the
gates<00:01:44.110> rise<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:45.010> there's<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:45.700> little<00:01:45.940> sweet

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
gates rise and there's a little sweet

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.660 
gates rise and there's a little sweet
spot<00:01:46.510> I'd<00:01:46.960> like<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.830> call<00:01:47.980> it<00:01:48.220> on<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:50.670> crossing

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
spot I'd like to call it on the crossing

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.690 
spot I'd like to call it on the crossing
where<00:01:52.030> on<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.380> gate<00:01:53.770> mechanism<00:01:53.950> over<00:01:54.490> here<00:01:54.610> on

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
where on the gate mechanism over here on

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.180 
where on the gate mechanism over here on
that<00:01:54.850> signal<00:01:55.090> where<00:01:55.840> if<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:56.590> lowers<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:56.980> just

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
that signal where if it lowers to just

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.090 
that signal where if it lowers to just
that<00:01:57.370> spot<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.880> bail<00:01:58.030> keep<00:01:58.300> on<00:01:58.480> ringing<00:01:59.100> so

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
that spot the bail keep on ringing so

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.940 
that spot the bail keep on ringing so
yeah<00:02:00.480> I'm<00:02:01.480> going<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.690> show<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.230> few<00:02:02.530> more<00:02:02.680> shots

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
yeah I'm going to show a few more shots

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.200 
yeah I'm going to show a few more shots
is<00:02:03.220> across<00:02:03.520> and
