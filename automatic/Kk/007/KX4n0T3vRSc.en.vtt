00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:09.530
 in this case is the tower 93 60 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.500
 he is not giving camera 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.390
 but then doing an analysis to 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.860
 this card 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.590
 it seems that the problem is not d 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.310
 and here the socket of the camera ni 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.840
 nothing no voltage error because I already 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.940
 I 've reviewed it then I'm going to 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.650
 explain to them how how is it 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.900
 Handling the camera of this phone 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.610
 since it is good to handle three types of 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:41.239
 Two voltage of 2782 78 and a voltage 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:45.060
 of 1.8 and there is another voltage of three points 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.630
 12 volts or three points 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.210
 I know I get here in this I 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.579
 this is the report of three points that 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.550
 is the one that feeds this crystal 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.479
 the flight voltage of 1.8 are those that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.579
 come here to this position since they are 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:05.659
 one side of the camera are those 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.819
 they handle 1.8 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.320
 what are these here has approximately 

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:15.190
 gone one two three 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.340
 452 which two of these with these 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.979
 first two 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.829
 first pins here that feeds the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.200
 camera work with 1.8 have 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:29.009
 continuity with these two little ones that 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.750
 they're here below, everyone has a 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.900
 1.8 voltage 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.290
 and these three others who are here to 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.229
 wake also work with 1.8 and are 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.900
 those who feed the TV the third pin 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.790
 from the top part that is where it arrives 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.790
 the voltage of 1.8 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.990
 the one that is in the part of down here 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.320
 here next to him 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.570
 of the crystal there is a knot that has 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.050
 continuity with this second pin of the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.910
 camera 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.910
 is the 2 788 of the post ag that gives 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.340
 apparently all the voltage of this 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.790
 camera is fine I already changed the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.910
 crystal I have not had results or 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.000
 successes 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.440
 this phone goes back to the cameras after 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 to make detailed plans and 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.010
 everything that has to do with the camera 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.010
 the problem is already 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:41.030
 being here in this part 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.090
 is where alice the one who processes the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.629
 process of the image what 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.530
 that the one who processes the image of the 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:53.290
 camera here where the problem of 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.360
 this phone you could discard 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.450
 first to know when a phone is 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.190
 or not voltage have an idea of ​​a 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.730
 where more or less well the problem 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:10.490
 if it can be voltage or it can be that 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:14.470
 because it is that the other pins 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.780
 of the camera they no longer have 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.470
 they have continuity but already directly 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:25.580
 they come to give here 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.010
 from the process of 3 to 2 already when the 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.560
 camera is no longer the only solution 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.040
 would be 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.750
 raise and change the index but for a 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.470
 well I do not dare this phone 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.020
 I would lend myself to speak with the client 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.920
 because you can turn it off 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:47.099
 another thing is that this phone 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.569
 here is only going to provide this voltage 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.599
 which is 1.8 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:57.989
 what is in the other voltages that is 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:04:02.620
 of 278 and the 3-point is not going to vote 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:05.810
 until you do not activate the cameras 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.480
 when you put on the tester at 20 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.620
 to 20 to measure the voltage in the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.920
 phone 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.440
 and apparently it 's something they have 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.370
 to keep in mind first of all 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.979
 they have to activate the camera so that the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.410
 voltage when they go to measure the voltage 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.410
 come here to these 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.750
 to Christians who have cost the 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.340
 camera and here that here the other one helped 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.990
 here that is 278 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.139
 all these three pepper 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.979
 they have continuity 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.470
 and they have the same voltage value of 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:50.370
 1.8 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.460
 this other this one that I already told you that 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.590
 is the 2.78 has to have 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.600
 continuity with this little me that is 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.370
 there 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.740
 that is here and has to have 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.500
 continuity with this other iodine that is the 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.960
 that is next to the glass all this 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.730
 all this has a continuity of 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.410
 boats that there is no continuity by 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.410
 the faults of the easiest to find 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:20.329
 I leave here this a brief explanation 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.539
 of how the camera works and how it was and 

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:25.159
 the portals remember you already know that 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.869
 these voltage from here only have to 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.149
 activate the camera to get them 

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:30.889
 because otherwise they will not arrive and 

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:32.739
 they're going to think that it's where they are 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.239
 everything there is where the problem is 

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:38.529
 then he activates it at the Haitian level 

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:42.319
 you can check the voltage for more 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:45.139
 of each decade components and having 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:48.300
 the continuity not to explode I'll see 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:52.770
 if I can give you an image 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.370
 a url of an image that I'm going to see if 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.540
 I go up so that you have the idea 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.360
 and have the 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:04.280
 you get the plane of the voltages from 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.280
 the continuity of the camera
