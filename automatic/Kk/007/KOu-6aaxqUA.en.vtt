00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
today I will be unboxing the I carbons

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.259 
today I will be unboxing the I carbons
carbon<00:00:07.350> fiber<00:00:07.560> skin<00:00:07.890> for<00:00:08.250> my<00:00:08.429> macbook<00:00:08.760> pro<00:00:08.790> 13

so<00:00:10.080> before<00:00:10.500> we<00:00:10.620> start<00:00:10.650> unboxing<00:00:10.950> let's<00:00:11.460> go

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
so before we start unboxing let's go

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.480 
so before we start unboxing let's go
through<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> basics<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.230> got<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
through the basics of this so I got the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.689 
through the basics of this so I got the
black<00:00:15.059> eye<00:00:15.299> carbons<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.590> back<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.490> my

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
black eye carbons for the back of my

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.370 
black eye carbons for the back of my
macbook<00:00:18.029> pro<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:19.050> cost<00:00:19.350> me<00:00:20.390> 1996<00:00:22.880> this<00:00:24.380> it

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
macbook pro and it cost me 1996 this it

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.250 
macbook pro and it cost me 1996 this it
was<00:00:25.769> um<00:00:26.449> shipped<00:00:27.449> from<00:00:27.779> Florida<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.630> it<00:00:30.630> took

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
was um shipped from Florida and it took

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.569 
was um shipped from Florida and it took
them<00:00:31.679> two<00:00:32.189> weeks<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.880> send<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.829> it<00:00:34.829> came

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
them two weeks to send here and it came

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.930 
them two weeks to send here and it came
in<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.180> flat<00:00:36.540> rate<00:00:36.750> pack<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:38.280> been<00:00:38.550> thrown

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
in a flat rate pack but it's been thrown

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.940 
in a flat rate pack but it's been thrown
around<00:00:39.090> pretty<00:00:39.600> badly

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
around pretty badly

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.400

USPS<00:00:41.730> does<00:00:42.149> take<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> long<00:00:43.050> time<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.149> they're

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
USPS does take a long time and they're

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
USPS does take a long time and they're
tracking<00:00:46.410> isn't<00:00:47.160> really<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> best<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.210> you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
tracking isn't really the best so you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.330 
tracking isn't really the best so you
have<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:49.020> rate<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> wait<00:00:49.860> around<00:00:50.070> for

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
have to really rate it wait around for

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.319 
have to really rate it wait around for
it<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.649> not<00:00:52.649> rely<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.610> tracking<00:00:53.940> system

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
it and not rely on the tracking system

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.790 
it and not rely on the tracking system
because<00:00:55.219> it's<00:00:56.219> quite<00:00:56.789> unreliable<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:58.140> now

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
because it's quite unreliable so now

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
because it's quite unreliable so now
let's<00:00:59.629> get<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.760> there's<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.969> pull<00:01:03.660> tab
