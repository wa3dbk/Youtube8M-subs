in your book heal yourself with sunlight

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.130 
in your book heal yourself with sunlight
you<00:00:03.750> talk<00:00:03.990> about<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.650> fat<00:00:05.520> connection<00:00:06.270> what

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
you talk about the fat connection what

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.049 
you talk about the fat connection what
does<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.290> mean<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.919> fats<00:00:08.160> we<00:00:08.429> eat<00:00:08.639> or<00:00:08.940> does

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
does that mean the fats we eat or does

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.610 
does that mean the fats we eat or does
that<00:00:09.150> mean<00:00:09.240> if<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.510> are<00:00:09.630> fat<00:00:10.139> that's<00:00:10.440> gonna

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
that mean if we are fat that's gonna

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.669 
that mean if we are fat that's gonna
pose<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> problem<00:00:11.420> no<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:12.570> mostly<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.349> fats

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
pose a problem no it's mostly the fats

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.849 
pose a problem no it's mostly the fats
that<00:00:14.009> we<00:00:14.190> eat<00:00:14.429> oh<00:00:14.730> that's<00:00:15.089> good<00:00:15.269> news<00:00:15.420> yes<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
that we eat oh that's good news yes the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.220 
that we eat oh that's good news yes the
you<00:00:17.430> know<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.640> fat<00:00:17.850> itself<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> protection

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
you know the fat itself is a protection

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.000 
you know the fat itself is a protection
you<00:00:19.710> know<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.490> any<00:00:20.760> case<00:00:21.140> why<00:00:22.140> do<00:00:22.199> people

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
you know in any case why do people

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.980 
you know in any case why do people
accumulate<00:00:23.460> fat<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.150> because<00:00:24.539> then<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.960> have

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
accumulate fat is because then you have

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.070 
accumulate fat is because then you have
to<00:00:25.199> accommodate<00:00:26.180> certain<00:00:27.180> substances<00:00:27.869> in

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
to accommodate certain substances in

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.460 
to accommodate certain substances in
your<00:00:28.260> toxic<00:00:28.890> material<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:30.300> otherwise<00:00:30.900> would

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
your toxic material that otherwise would

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.400 
your toxic material that otherwise would
damage<00:00:31.940> you<00:00:32.940> know<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> body<00:00:33.360> by<00:00:33.660> entering<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
damage you know the body by entering the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
damage you know the body by entering the
bloodstream<00:00:34.649> now<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> fat<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.550> protecting

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
bloodstream now the fat is protecting

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.150 
bloodstream now the fat is protecting
you<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.510> sense<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.140> absurd<00:00:37.440> absorbs

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
you in that sense it's absurd absorbs

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.260 
you in that sense it's absurd absorbs
poisons<00:00:38.670> toxins<00:00:38.940> okay<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.219> you<00:00:41.219> may<00:00:41.790> need<00:00:41.969> more

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
poisons toxins okay so you may need more

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.209 
poisons toxins okay so you may need more
fat<00:00:42.540> cells<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.530> because<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.010> make

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
fat cells to do that because you make

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.700 
fat cells to do that because you make
more<00:00:44.460> poisons<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.090> toxins<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.289> serving<00:00:46.620> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
more poisons or toxins so it's serving a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.680 
more poisons or toxins so it's serving a
role<00:00:46.920> there<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.340> said<00:00:47.520> oh<00:00:47.700> yes<00:00:48.000> definitely

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
role there they said oh yes definitely

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.229 
role there they said oh yes definitely
again<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.469> these<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.250> know<00:00:50.340> determined<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
again what these you know determined to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.450 
again what these you know determined to
be<00:00:51.390> an<00:00:51.660> illness<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:52.050> obesity<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
be an illness like obesity it's a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.670 
be an illness like obesity it's a
survival<00:00:53.969> mechanism<00:00:54.170> it's<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.260> protection

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
survival mechanism it's a protection

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.389 
survival mechanism it's a protection
yeah<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> body<00:00:57.329> trying<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
yeah it's the body trying to and

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
yeah it's the body trying to and
surround<00:00:59.399> toxins<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.320> fluids<00:01:01.320> like<00:01:01.620> lymph

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
surround toxins with fluids like lymph

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.820 
surround toxins with fluids like lymph
fluids<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.879> eventually<00:01:03.539> your<00:01:04.140> fat<00:01:04.500> cells

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
fluids and eventually your fat cells

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.550 
fluids and eventually your fat cells
that<00:01:05.189> will<00:01:05.939> almost<00:01:06.479> serve<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> butter

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
that will almost serve like a butter

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.690 
that will almost serve like a butter
buffer<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> protection<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:10.130> make<00:01:11.130> sure<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
buffer a protection to make sure that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.149 
buffer a protection to make sure that
the<00:01:11.970> blood<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:12.869> least<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.439> healthy<00:01:13.830> as<00:01:13.979> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the blood is at least as healthy as it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.450 
the blood is at least as healthy as it
can<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.470> that's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.830> protection<00:01:17.040> right

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
can be and so that's a protection right

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.289 
can be and so that's a protection right
now<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:18.060> eating<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.110> fats<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.130> are

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
now with eating the fats that are

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.760 
now with eating the fats that are
damaging<00:01:21.299> fats<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:22.530> are<00:01:22.590> plenty

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
damaging fats and there are plenty

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.420 
damaging fats and there are plenty
around<00:01:23.750> most<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> fats<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.500> are<00:01:25.650> used<00:01:26.040> in

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
around most of the fats that are used in

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.260 
around most of the fats that are used in
modern<00:01:26.790> cooking<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:28.340> pads<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.579> are<00:01:29.759> refined

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
modern cooking are pads that are refined

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.490 
modern cooking are pads that are refined
oils<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.799> are<00:01:32.070> already<00:01:32.850> heat<00:01:33.450> treated<00:01:34.079> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
oils that are already heat treated that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.069 
oils that are already heat treated that
have<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:35.159> fair<00:01:35.460> amount<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.689> known<00:01:36.869> as

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
have a fair amount of what is known as

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.609 
have a fair amount of what is known as
trans<00:01:37.380> fatty<00:01:37.710> acids<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> these<00:01:39.360> are<00:01:39.600> 40<00:01:40.079> acids

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
trans fatty acids and these are 40 acids

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.149 
trans fatty acids and these are 40 acids
the<00:01:40.920> body<00:01:41.159> has<00:01:41.430> no<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:42.119> no<00:01:42.450> way<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> get<00:01:43.860> rid<00:01:43.890> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the body has no of no way to get rid of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.510 
the body has no of no way to get rid of
them<00:01:44.520> or<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.000> digest<00:01:45.600> them<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.770> will<00:01:46.979> slip

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
them or to digest them so they will slip

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.690 
them or to digest them so they will slip
into<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.140> bloodstream<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.860> they<00:01:50.159> will<00:01:50.369> get

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
into the bloodstream and they will get

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.450 
into the bloodstream and they will get
into

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
into

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.210 
into

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
tissues and they will embed themselves

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.270

in<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.000> cellular<00:01:55.480> membranes<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:57.010> makes

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
in the cellular membranes and that makes

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.050 
in the cellular membranes and that makes
the<00:01:57.490> cellular<00:01:57.970> membranes<00:01:58.480> very<00:01:59.610> slippery<00:02:00.610> or

drop its metabolic metabolic rate or it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.140 
drop its metabolic metabolic rate or it
will<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.630> know<00:02:16.690> if<00:02:16.960> necessary<00:02:17.880> convert<00:02:18.880> into

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
will you know if necessary convert into

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.720 
will you know if necessary convert into
a<00:02:19.180> cancer<00:02:19.660> cell<00:02:19.870> in<00:02:20.110> order<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.530> deal<00:02:20.740> with<00:02:20.800> that

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
a cancer cell in order to deal with that

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.980 
a cancer cell in order to deal with that
now<00:02:22.030> very<00:02:22.420> toxic

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
now very toxic

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.240 
now very toxic
you<00:02:23.709> know<00:02:23.800> encasement<00:02:24.550> Satomi<00:02:25.150> chain<00:02:26.250> you

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
you know encasement Satomi chain you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.180 
you know encasement Satomi chain you
need<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.640> mutate<00:02:28.090> now<00:02:28.720> when<00:02:28.990> you're<00:02:29.680> exposed

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
need to mutate now when you're exposed

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.080 
need to mutate now when you're exposed
to<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> Sun<00:02:30.900> then<00:02:31.900> fats<00:02:32.709> like<00:02:33.040> fats<00:02:33.850> are

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
to the Sun then fats like fats are

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.600 
to the Sun then fats like fats are
lighter<00:02:34.330> than<00:02:34.600> water<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.620> they<00:02:35.920> rise<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.520> the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
lighter than water so they rise to the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.770 
lighter than water so they rise to the
surface<00:02:36.820> of<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.330> skin<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:39.580> then<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.480> can

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
surface of the skin and so then that can

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.020 
surface of the skin and so then that can
cause<00:02:41.050> more<00:02:41.350> damage<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.070> skin<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.940> you

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
cause more damage to the skin so you

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.660 
cause more damage to the skin so you
don't<00:02:43.180> want<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.540> eat<00:02:43.750> fats<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.500> are<00:02:44.670> refined

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
don't want to eat fats that are refined

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.690 
don't want to eat fats that are refined
like<00:02:46.480> french<00:02:46.900> fries<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.740> the<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.310> oil<00:02:48.520> that

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
like french fries that the the oil that

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.449 
like french fries that the the oil that
they<00:02:48.910> use<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.510> use<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.290> often<00:02:50.650> over<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.160> over

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
they use and use it often over and over

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.770 
they use and use it often over and over
again<00:02:51.640> until<00:02:52.510> it's<00:02:52.810> gone<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.760> have<00:02:55.180> your

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
again until it's gone and you have your

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.080 
again until it's gone and you have your
these<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:56.350> fats<00:02:56.890> which<00:02:57.190> are<00:02:57.430> heated<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.910> a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
these you fats which are heated to a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.110 
these you fats which are heated to a
point<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.900> they<00:02:59.410> were<00:02:59.470> all<00:02:59.769> developed<00:03:00.700> very

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
point that they were all developed very

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.930 
point that they were all developed very
very<00:03:01.420> highly<00:03:01.690> damaging<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.620> trans<00:03:02.890> fats<00:03:03.190> so

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
very highly damaging and trans fats so

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.600 
very highly damaging and trans fats so
eating<00:03:04.300> heating<00:03:04.989> oil<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:05.980> dangerous

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
eating heating oil is it is a dangerous

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.259 
eating heating oil is it is a dangerous
thing<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:07.510> don't<00:03:07.690> want<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.050> heat<00:03:08.290> oils<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:10.150> the

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
thing you don't want to heat oils to the

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.509 
thing you don't want to heat oils to the
point<00:03:10.570> that<00:03:10.810> they<00:03:11.080> are<00:03:11.380> like<00:03:11.590> in<00:03:11.890> fried<00:03:12.190> food

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
point that they are like in fried food

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.390 
point that they are like in fried food
and<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:13.360> many<00:03:13.540> people<00:03:14.050> eat<00:03:14.350> fried<00:03:14.709> foods<00:03:15.040> and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
and so many people eat fried foods and

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.300 
and so many people eat fried foods and
you<00:03:15.489> see<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.450> their<00:03:17.140> appearance<00:03:17.980> in

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
you see that in their appearance in

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.310 
you see that in their appearance in
their<00:03:18.550> tummies<00:03:19.510> they're<00:03:19.810> all<00:03:19.930> getting

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
their tummies they're all getting

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.370 
their tummies they're all getting
swollen<00:03:20.680> tummies<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.720> they<00:03:22.720> get<00:03:22.989> you<00:03:23.320> know

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
swollen tummies and they get you know

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.650 
swollen tummies and they get you know
lymph<00:03:23.890> congestion<00:03:24.519> in<00:03:24.670> their<00:03:24.880> sister

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
lymph congestion in their sister

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.570 
lymph congestion in their sister
naturally<00:03:26.200> vessel<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.800> main<00:03:26.950> main<00:03:27.310> lymph

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
naturally vessel and the main main lymph

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.970 
naturally vessel and the main main lymph
drainage<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:28.239> know<00:03:28.690> station<00:03:29.530> in<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.769> body

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
drainage you know station in the body

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.410 
drainage you know station in the body
and<00:03:30.280> then<00:03:30.880> from<00:03:31.570> there<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:32.080> body<00:03:32.290> starts<00:03:32.709> yep

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
and then from there the body starts yep

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.520 
and then from there the body starts yep
contrasting<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.510> rest<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.019> lungs<00:03:35.230> and

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
contrasting the rest of the lungs and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.949 
contrasting the rest of the lungs and
then<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.610> start<00:03:36.880> putting<00:03:37.150> on<00:03:37.450> weight<00:03:37.690> and

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
then you start putting on weight and

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.270 
then you start putting on weight and
then<00:03:38.680> fat

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
then fat

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.699 
then fat
you<00:03:39.400> obviously<00:03:39.970> can<00:03:40.630> no<00:03:40.720> longer<00:03:40.959> be<00:03:41.230> broken

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
you obviously can no longer be broken

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.220 
you obviously can no longer be broken
down<00:03:41.890> properly<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.880> eliminated<00:03:43.600> by<00:03:44.170> the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
down properly and eliminated by the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.650 
down properly and eliminated by the
lymphatic<00:03:44.920> system<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.640> then<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.330> body<00:03:46.510> is

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
lymphatic system and then the body is

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.380 
lymphatic system and then the body is
just<00:03:46.920> accumulating<00:03:47.920> becoming<00:03:48.280> bigger<00:03:48.580> right

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
just accumulating becoming bigger right

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.060 
just accumulating becoming bigger right
but<00:03:49.570> in<00:03:49.660> terms<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.170> your<00:03:50.350> skin<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:50.980> the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
but in terms of your skin and the

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.000 
but in terms of your skin and the
sunlight<00:03:51.519> is<00:03:52.239> it<00:03:52.510> like<00:03:52.660> if<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.110> eat<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.709> kind

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
sunlight is it like if you eat that kind

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.130 
sunlight is it like if you eat that kind
of<00:03:54.100> fat<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.640> trans<00:03:54.880> fatty<00:03:55.150> acids<00:03:55.600> it's<00:03:55.720> kind

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
of fat the trans fatty acids it's kind

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.330 
of fat the trans fatty acids it's kind
of<00:03:56.170> like<00:03:56.320> frying<00:03:56.590> your<00:03:56.799> skin<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.280> will

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
of like frying your skin it will

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.559 
of like frying your skin it will
basically<00:03:57.760> go<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.540> skin<00:03:58.840> on<00:03:58.870> your<00:03:58.989> skin

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
basically go to the skin on your skin

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.589 
basically go to the skin on your skin
become<00:03:59.930> susceptible<00:04:00.409> to<00:04:00.890> damage<00:04:01.249> much<00:04:02.120> faster

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
become susceptible to damage much faster

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.319 
become susceptible to damage much faster
any<00:04:03.319> kind<00:04:03.680> of<00:04:03.799> highly<00:04:04.219> acid-forming<00:04:04.819> food

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
any kind of highly acid-forming food

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.739 
any kind of highly acid-forming food
like<00:04:05.540> trans<00:04:05.840> fatty<00:04:06.109> acids<00:04:06.650> or<00:04:07.299> animal<00:04:08.299> protein

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:08.749 
like trans fatty acids or animal protein

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.369 
like trans fatty acids or animal protein
like<00:04:09.049> meat<00:04:09.319> chicken<00:04:09.980> fish<00:04:10.010> eggs<00:04:11.109> they<00:04:12.109> will

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
like meat chicken fish eggs they will

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.920 
like meat chicken fish eggs they will
because<00:04:13.310> they're<00:04:13.489> highly<00:04:13.819> acid<00:04:14.060> form<00:04:14.450> so<00:04:14.749> they

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
because they're highly acid form so they

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.920 
because they're highly acid form so they
are<00:04:15.469> causing<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.459> body<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.910> become<00:04:17.060> a<00:04:17.539> pool<00:04:17.870> of

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
are causing the body to become a pool of

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.469 
are causing the body to become a pool of

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
a form of acidosis all right so if

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.920 
a form of acidosis all right so if
you're<00:04:58.310> eating<00:04:58.460> those<00:04:58.759> kind<00:04:59.030> of<00:04:59.120> fats<00:04:59.419> you're

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
you're eating those kind of fats you're

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.140 
you're eating those kind of fats you're
exposed<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.560> Sun<00:05:00.919> you<00:05:01.340> can<00:05:01.610> get<00:05:01.849> skin

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
exposed to the Sun you can get skin

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.779 
exposed to the Sun you can get skin
cancer<00:05:02.180> yes<00:05:02.870> yes<00:05:03.440> but<00:05:04.039> it's<00:05:04.190> not<00:05:04.340> because<00:05:04.520> of

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
cancer yes yes but it's not because of

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.850 
cancer yes yes but it's not because of
the<00:05:04.909> Sun<00:05:05.150> it's<00:05:05.750> because<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.259> fat<00:05:06.470> connect

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
the Sun it's because of the fat connect

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.800 
the Sun it's because of the fat connect
clothes<00:05:07.039> the<00:05:07.400> fat<00:05:07.610> connection<00:05:08.180> and<00:05:08.389> the

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
clothes the fat connection and the

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.439 
clothes the fat connection and the
reaction<00:05:09.409> between<00:05:09.560> UVA<00:05:10.150> particularly<00:05:11.150> and

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
reaction between UVA particularly and

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.110 
reaction between UVA particularly and
these<00:05:11.990> trans<00:05:12.349> fatty<00:05:12.620> acids<00:05:13.220> so<00:05:13.820> there<00:05:14.030> are

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
these trans fatty acids so there are

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.629 
these trans fatty acids so there are
biochemical<00:05:14.960> changes<00:05:15.440> occurring<00:05:16.099> that

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
biochemical changes occurring that

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.749 
biochemical changes occurring that
produce<00:05:16.990> your<00:05:17.990> byproducts<00:05:18.860> when<00:05:19.039> fats<00:05:19.520> are

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
produce your byproducts when fats are

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.990 
produce your byproducts when fats are
broken<00:05:20.180> down<00:05:20.590> bad<00:05:21.590> fats<00:05:22.009> are<00:05:22.370> broken<00:05:22.520> down

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
broken down bad fats are broken down

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.189 
broken down bad fats are broken down
they<00:05:23.750> leave<00:05:24.020> your<00:05:25.120> chemicals<00:05:26.120> behind<00:05:26.570> that

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
they leave your chemicals behind that

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.560 
they leave your chemicals behind that
are<00:05:27.349> extremely<00:05:27.830> cus<00:05:28.159> energetic<00:05:28.669> alright<00:05:29.419> and

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
are extremely cus energetic alright and

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.110 
are extremely cus energetic alright and
so<00:05:29.599> you<00:05:30.020> don't<00:05:30.409> want<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:31.130> have<00:05:31.580> those<00:05:31.789> fats

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
so you don't want to have those fats

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.360 
so you don't want to have those fats
you're<00:05:32.539> coming<00:05:32.900> into<00:05:33.050> the<00:05:33.229> body<00:05:33.409> if<00:05:33.620> you<00:05:34.130> can

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
you're coming into the body if you can

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.969 
you're coming into the body if you can
avoid<00:05:34.759> it<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.810> actually<00:05:36.349> should<00:05:36.530> stay<00:05:36.770> out<00:05:36.830> the

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
avoid it so actually should stay out the

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.370 
avoid it so actually should stay out the
sunlight<00:05:37.370> if<00:05:37.580> you're<00:05:37.880> eating<00:05:38.060> yes<00:05:38.990> and<00:05:39.229> none

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
sunlight if you're eating yes and none

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.080 
sunlight if you're eating yes and none
of<00:05:39.470> your<00:05:39.590> vitamin<00:05:39.949> D<00:05:40.070> goes<00:05:40.400> down<00:05:40.669> and<00:05:40.970> then

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
of your vitamin D goes down and then

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.700 
of your vitamin D goes down and then
you're<00:05:41.330> again<00:05:41.630> prone<00:05:42.050> to<00:05:42.289> many<00:05:42.469> other

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
you're again prone to many other

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.040 
you're again prone to many other
illnesses<00:05:42.949> and<00:05:43.759> you<00:05:44.060> really<00:05:44.360> need<00:05:44.570> to<00:05:44.690> be<00:05:44.840> less

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
illnesses and you really need to be less

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.600 
illnesses and you really need to be less
acidic<00:05:45.650> yes<00:05:46.580> so<00:05:47.300> it's<00:05:47.570> a<00:05:47.690> win-win<00:05:48.139> situation

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
acidic yes so it's a win-win situation

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.770 
acidic yes so it's a win-win situation
