00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:10.230
 29 may 2015 21 07 before one 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.000
 spectacular backdrop was the vfl 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.530
 wittekind wildeshausen 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.520
 district hunter master and the fans 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.500
 their players celebrated frenetically the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990
 Wildeshauser handed on the last day of play 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.240
 the district league 2 1 1 0 1 draw 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.539
 against the second table atlas 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.070
 delmenhorst with this game became the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.430
 rising to the national league perfect 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.140
 made at the same time was 4000 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.600
 spectators in the frankenstadion 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.710
 visitor record for district league games in 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.710
 Germany 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.420
 punctually at 18 15 they opened 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.090
 gates to a fantastic season finale 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.870
 it would have an exciting constellation 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.010
 can hardly give for this game 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.140
 Atlas traveled with only one point 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.030
 residue and thus had even in 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.970
 hand with a victory the title 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.430
 to be welcomed by the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.410
 club chairman of the vfl wolfgang 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.270
 The happy ones were feverishly feverish 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.500
 cardholder and about 40 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.600
 press representatives against the impulse 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.280
 champion coach marcel bragulla vom vfl 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.700
 Wildeshausen had in the past 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.940
 already meet at NDR2 Bremen four FFN 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.560
 and antenna talk and answer 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.180
 according to information of the club one would have probably 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.130
 also six or seven thousand cards 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.200
 can sell 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.880
 it will probably remain a novelty for now 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.770
 that tickets for the krandel 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.770
 stadium to be traded on ebay 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.619
 At 7:15 it was finally over 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.969
 as far as the impartial henrik bramlage 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.969
 for atlas for the first half 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.979
 the first half did not offer much 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.649
 playful highlights but the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.600
 tactics dominated numerous bad passes 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.880
 on both sides and some 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.200
 These little play flow in 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.090
 pay a lot, 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.709
 the always sovereign of 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.790
 umpire harnessed to bramlage 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.709
 it was led the fans of both 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.450
 camp, however, does not depend on her 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.450
 to support vocally 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.140
 Both more and more often put both 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.860
 teams on long balls however 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.450
 seldom found your customer 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.480
 so were in the first passage only a few 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.790
 opportunities 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.260
 without loathing forced in the 29 minute the 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.260
 delmenhorster keeper to intervene 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.690
 just before the half time whistle seidel came in 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.230
 However, Penal Area shot hit the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.230
 ball not full 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:00.810
 the vfl did not have to risk everything 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.900
 the 0 0 was enough for the climb and so on 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.830
 Then it went into the cabin 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.510
 probably atlas had trainer 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.760
 jÃ¼rgen rooster his boys in the cabin 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.550
 once again made it clear that only one 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.170
 then win the champion title can bring 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.460
 made after the page change 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.460
 delmenhorst right pressure 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.420
 Hauser also tried in this 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.100
 Pressure phase of atlas rest in her game 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.900
 to get and won more and more 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.250
 security 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.260
 Unfortunately, one or the other was good 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.840
 not consistently played to the end 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.730
 to the local audience had to continue 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.680
 tremble 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.810
 in the 66 minute he stopped 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.630
 Wildeshauser the first time right the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.520
 breath as musa karli a free kick only 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.510
 close to the case of sebastian pundsack 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.510
 vorbeischlenzte 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.790
 Eight minutes later, it was again the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.709
 delmenhorster karl i 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.980
 who at his free kick this time right 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.360
 measures and in the 75 minute the 0 2 1 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.360
 for Delmenhorst scored 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.900
 Atlas was at this time 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.520
 district league champion and newcomer in 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.470
 the national league 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.620
 the traveling fans were from the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.620
 lodge 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.630
 the vfl trainer bragulla and 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.910
 elia had to react 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.770
 they brought with them for care and lehmkuhl 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.380
 kai meyer and kai narrow two 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.990
 routiniers had narrow in this 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.970
 season already hit 13 times and has 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.310
 in the course of his career often enough 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.460
 unmistakable goal instinct proved that 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.800
 the team needed now in the 80 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.870
 minute redeemed the narrow header after 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.760
 bockhorn corner into the delmenhorster housing 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.250
 not only team and coach but 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.640
 also the two and a half thousand wildeshauser 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.640
 fans 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.560
 in the 87 minute jann jakobs would have everything 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:27.849
 can make clear for the vfl 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.849
 but failed at the atlas 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.800
 so the vfl trailer had one more 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.290
 dramatic closing phase through life 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.400
 before schiri bramlage after endless 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.930
 shining four and a half minutes 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.000
 replay time finally 100 of the vfl fans 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.060
 stormed the lawn to in their team 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.060
 celebrate 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.790
 you can not prevent that but would be 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.950
 national league and we still have one 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.510
 narrow band always knows where that 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.660
 Tor is always on the turnip 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.680
 but I have to say 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.850
 championships symphony is 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.010
 also OK 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.810
 in the end wolfgang was sitting as 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.850
 Organizer of this huge 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.840
 family party all hands full to do 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:31.020

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.020

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.889

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.400

 and from Munich pte 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.620
 national league-climber 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.819
 At this event you will be in Wildeshausen 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.530
 talk for a long time, especially because of 

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:52.680
 the sporty fair fans of atlas 

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.680
 delmenhorst
