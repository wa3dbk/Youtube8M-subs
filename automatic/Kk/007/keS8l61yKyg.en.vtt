00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.140
 Hello dear friends with you cube and 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.980
 today I would like to tell and show 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:24.880
 how to lay mines for the right 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.250
 a hero like technician miner just 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.800
 People call him let's you 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:37.420
 I will show by example 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.870
 forces of light I like to put mines in 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.430
 following places since now me 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.430
 respects quite a popular hero 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.970
 many take it but not many put 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.170
 fireplaces 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.630
 where necessary there is clearly such an error 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.180
 many players for venus 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.180
 sat wallet that they put mines 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.370
 It is here that you can not do this 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.340
 as you can see already missed they know that 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.890
 if the menu is against them 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.490
 they know that he is exactly in these 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.490
 places he certainly put mines 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.270
 it is here in these therefore we do so 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:23.170
 we have to put mine or here 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.719
 if we play for the light or if we 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.940
 play for darkness we put mines a year 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:32.300
 about here 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.570
 what on the enemy when he came he already 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.430
 can be purchased somewhere here here 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.490
 shop it opens right here and he 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.760
 when will he come here 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.810
 safely explodes in the same way for strength 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.230
 of light the enemy goes head 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.080
 like 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.420
 explodes we go on still popular 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.270
 the place where I like to put mines is this 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.420
 here against the gangs we put a couple of mines 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.790
 here here here is an opponent with mida when he 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.760
 comes let's say here to vaz gun 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.090
 he explodes just put mines 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.420
 About here I usually put on 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:16.480
 three or four at the beginning of the game he too 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.020
 explodes and here the enemy can 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.630
 go around with mida 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.640
 if you are standing here or here to him 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.290
 it remains to go in a straight line and only then 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.160
 he does not have to turn here 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.920
 nothing but explode like this 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.090
 and last place find territory from 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.200
 gangs it's somewhere around here 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.690
 the enemy may have turned right here 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.959
 and also with mida can get around here 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.379
 also explodes we go on here 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.980
 basically wish you can become can 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.930
 to force 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:57.989
 on us the people we put on the runes 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.640
 mines of course here but if 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.860
 the enemy has already exploded once on your 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.530
 minutes do not put no more stage 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.660
 put a stupid mistake if you play for 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:13.120
 forces of darkness put mines right here 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.950
 put me here right here this is very 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.790
 helps because the opponent goes with 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.190
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs he always comes here and so here it is 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:28.620
 goes he buries everything he exploded but 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:31.120
 will not work if you play for the power of light 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.329
 you have to put mines 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.069
 here somewhere here now I will say 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.879
 suspiciously here somewhere will be here 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:44.389
 the enemy goes he himself will not give he goes here he 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:47.930
 can people it goes well, that's all he 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.849
 explodes received we go on also 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.870
 if you play sim light you can 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:58.549
 defend 2 3 put mines and sow 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:03.349
 we also here go on to another 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:09.379
 I 'll teleport and show further 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:11.389
 here we put them necessarily in 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.519
 pour deep and 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:16.699
 in the middle of the game we put it here 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.709
 always put independence 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.389
 the enemy exploded mattresses recognize us even 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.800
 if here in mines we don't care 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.740
 put here next put the first minutes 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.320
 here to the people on the runes 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.099
 on these here and if the enemy in a row 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.490
 exploded 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.570
 if we play for the forces of light we set 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.840
 mines 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.720
 here here here we put mines 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.199
 the enemy goes a couple but he broadsheets 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.810
 if you play all this 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:50.570
 let's set it right over here if the enemy 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:55.639
 still exploded here we put mines here 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:57.979
 here he goes with mida he will not 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.930
 so here to bypass why washing on drone 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:04.190
 just click on the rune button and 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:09.229
 go broads he rushed also we can 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:12.530
 make this place this place is very 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:15.250
 good places here too exploded too 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.250
 ends here 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.810
 Here in this place it is in the future 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.760
 at your discretion 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.920
 shop here is better not to mine because 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.930
 Well, it's clear that everything will be dealt with. 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.480
 guess what you should in theory 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.150
 stand mines and you can trick them 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.560
 put them here here because you 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.970
 a recent update appeared here 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.080
 passes so small 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.910
 well and also such narrow little ones 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.560
 spaces 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:50.020
 here we go further from this side if you 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.820
 play for the power of light because of the power of darkness in 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.200
 principle, the same should deliver 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.700
 I have vodka opposite 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.310
 these two programs are very helpful 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:03.370
 any giants situations when 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.680
 running them from the opponent there at all 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.590
 any situation will help you these mines if 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:14.050
 you put them here and because worse 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:17.160
 will not go further if you play 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:21.760
 also for the strength of the retinue for the power of darkness 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:25.330
 similarly we have to put mine 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:30.640
 if for the power of light to expose exactly 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:32.530
 here here is the enemy is broads 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:37.580
 dying for darkness 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:41.449
 here is broads die loss 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.240
 I think I talked about all the popular. 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:47.060
 such places where you need to put mines even 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.270
 not popular about which i put where i am 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:54.560
 put i showed it to me the most 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:56.090
 such important places replaced, in principle, I 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.699
 play already learned 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.939
 and I can say that all these places they 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:04.520
 act and people forget what exactly 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:06.889
 these places I can put they know 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.620
 that primitiveness is this of the people and on 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:10.250
 I was not allowed to buy goods 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.949
 showed and 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:16.729
 but about such here somewhere on the side 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:19.340
 they forget don't think also not 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:22.310
 forget to put had which are given 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.009
 the sixth level of amethyst mine 8 minutes 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:28.430
 they help very quantic too and then 

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:29.090
 pushes opponents they suit you 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.580
 are starting 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.879
 touch your goods were push 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.840
 explode do -5 unless of course we 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:42.229
 cost quite a lot 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:45.550
 also nominated everywhere here right here 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:48.129
 thats all i think i told showed 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.389
 to all whom I helped put thumbs up 

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:55.120
 subscribe to the channel who is not yet 

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:55.120
 made and look forward to new videos all while
