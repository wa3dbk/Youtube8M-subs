in this series of podcasts we're going
to<00:00:07.290> talk<00:00:07.470> about<00:00:07.620> strategy<00:00:08.460> as<00:00:08.670> simple<00:00:09.269> rules

now everyone knows every manager every
entrepreneur<00:00:12.630> knows<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.170> world<00:00:13.380> is

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
entrepreneur knows that the world is

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.530 
entrepreneur knows that the world is
very<00:00:13.740> complex<00:00:14.190> there<00:00:14.820> are<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.910> lot<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.089> moving

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
very complex there are a lot of moving

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.599 
very complex there are a lot of moving
parts<00:00:15.870> things<00:00:16.260> keep<00:00:16.560> changing<00:00:17.070> quickly<00:00:17.279> and

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
parts things keep changing quickly and

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.179 
parts things keep changing quickly and
the<00:00:18.180> temptation<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.170> these<00:00:19.289> circumstances<00:00:19.650> is

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the temptation in these circumstances is

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.390 
the temptation in these circumstances is
often<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> try<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:20.970> make<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> very<00:00:21.420> complicated

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400

often to try to make a very complicated
strategy<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.699> respond<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> very

the approach we're going to talk about

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.410 
the approach we're going to talk about
today<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:31.439> around<00:00:31.920> dealing<00:00:32.820> with<00:00:33.300> the

today is around dealing with the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.360 
today is around dealing with the
complexity<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> world<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> simple

rules<00:00:38.040> now<00:00:39.030> before<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.960> dive<00:00:40.170> into<00:00:40.469> our

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
rules now before we dive into our

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.250 
rules now before we dive into our
discussion<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.600> strategy<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.719> simple<00:00:43.079> rules

discussion of strategy as simple rules

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.799 
discussion of strategy as simple rules
let's<00:00:43.590> dig<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.520> little<00:00:44.789> bit<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.180> strategy

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
let's dig in a little bit into strategy

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.119 
let's dig in a little bit into strategy
now<00:00:46.020> there's<00:00:46.200> been<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> lot<00:00:46.649> written<00:00:46.829> about

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
now there's been a lot written about

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.069 
now there's been a lot written about
strategy<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> terms<00:00:47.969> bandied<00:00:48.480> about<00:00:48.600> quite<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
strategy the terms bandied about quite a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.229 
strategy the terms bandied about quite a
bit<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.350> covers<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> wide<00:00:50.100> variety<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.879> sins

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
bit and covers a wide variety of sins

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.000 
bit and covers a wide variety of sins
but<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.780> turns<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.379> dig<00:00:52.620> through<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
but it turns out if you dig through the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.910 
but it turns out if you dig through the
literature<00:00:53.690> strategy<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.899> defined<00:00:55.590> quite

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
literature strategy is defined quite

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.889 
literature strategy is defined quite
crisply<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:57.000> about<00:00:57.180> how<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.390> create<00:00:57.600> value

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
crisply it's about how you create value

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.410 
crisply it's about how you create value
capture<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.010> sustain<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.850> if<00:01:00.329> you

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
capture it and sustain it and if you

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.209 
capture it and sustain it and if you
focus<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> cap<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> creation<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
focus on the cap of the creation of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.729 
focus on the cap of the creation of
value<00:01:02.340> which<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> first<00:01:03.090> step<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.510> course

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
value which is the first step of course

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.170 
value which is the first step of course
basically<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.549> things<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:06.000> been

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
basically all the things that have been

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.450 
basically all the things that have been
written<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.470> different<00:01:07.770> ideas<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
written all the different ideas all the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.039 
written all the different ideas all the
different<00:01:08.760> terminology<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.510> reduced<00:01:09.930> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
different terminology can be reduced to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.850 
different terminology can be reduced to
three<00:01:10.650> core<00:01:11.369> logics<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.390> value<00:01:13.110> creation<00:01:13.470> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
three core logics of value creation and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.039 
three core logics of value creation and
we'll<00:01:14.070> talk<00:01:14.250> about<00:01:14.400> each<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.850> those<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.720> inform

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
we'll talk about each of those to inform

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719 
we'll talk about each of those to inform
our<00:01:16.200> discussion<00:01:16.650> about<00:01:16.799> strategy<00:01:17.280> as<00:01:17.369> simple

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
our discussion about strategy as simple

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.590 
our discussion about strategy as simple
rules<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> first<00:01:19.110> approach<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:20.600> value

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
rules so the first approach is value

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.469 
rules so the first approach is value
creation<00:01:22.170> through<00:01:22.560> position<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> idea

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
creation through position so the idea

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.149 
creation through position so the idea
here<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> identify<00:01:25.200> an<00:01:25.650> attractive

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
here is you identify an attractive

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.039 
here is you identify an attractive
market<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.700> stake<00:01:27.119> out<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> position<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.930> that

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
market you stake out a position in that

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.990 
market you stake out a position in that
market<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.680> build<00:01:28.920> high<00:01:29.220> barriers<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
market and you build high barriers to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.120 
market and you build high barriers to
entry<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.990> keep<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.350> competitors<00:01:31.890> out

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
entry to keep your competitors out

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
entry to keep your competitors out
barriers<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> entry<00:01:33.030> might<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.420> regulatory

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
barriers to entry might be regulatory

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050 
barriers to entry might be regulatory
patents<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.740> pharmaceutical<00:01:35.490> industry<00:01:35.880> for

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
keeps competitors out but the key idea

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.139 
keeps competitors out but the key idea
is<00:01:42.990> those<00:01:43.200> high<00:01:43.470> barriers<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.130> entry<00:01:44.340> keep

is those high barriers to entry keep

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.880 
is those high barriers to entry keep
your<00:01:45.360> rivals<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.079> allow<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.680> create

your rivals out and allow you to create
value<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.600> military<00:01:48.899> has<00:01:49.380> also<00:01:49.590> thought

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
value now the military has also thought

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.770 
value now the military has also thought
about<00:01:50.159> different<00:01:51.000> views<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.180> strategy<00:01:51.720> and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
about different views of strategy and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.330 
about different views of strategy and
there's<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.020> military<00:01:52.290> equivalent<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.250> this

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
there's a military equivalent of this

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.550 
there's a military equivalent of this
that<00:01:53.549> illustrates<00:01:54.119> positional<00:01:54.780> strategy<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
that illustrates positional strategy and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.719 
that illustrates positional strategy and
that's<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> notion<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.850> finding<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.869> high<00:01:58.049> hill

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
that's the notion of finding a high hill

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.700 
that's the notion of finding a high hill
taking<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.880> hill<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.240> building<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.079> fortress

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
taking that hill and building a fortress

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.889 
taking that hill and building a fortress
around<00:02:01.920> impenetrable<00:02:02.790> fortress<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.450> barbed

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
around impenetrable fortress with barbed

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
wire and machine-gun turrets out to keep

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.279 
wire and machine-gun turrets out to keep
all<00:02:06.210> comers<00:02:06.509> out<00:02:07.009> so<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.520> first<00:02:09.140> logic<00:02:10.140> of

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
all comers out so the first logic of

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.920 
all comers out so the first logic of
value<00:02:10.860> creation<00:02:11.190> is

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
value creation is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.619 
value creation is
positional<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:13.220> second<00:02:13.760> is<00:02:13.909> the<00:02:14.120> resource

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
positional the second is the resource

have a certain set of characteristics
first<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.629> all<00:02:29.750> they're<00:02:29.930> rare<00:02:30.230> not<00:02:30.680> everyone

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
first of all they're rare not everyone

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.630 
first of all they're rare not everyone
has<00:02:31.280> them

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
has them

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.220 
has them
so<00:02:31.849> you're<00:02:32.090> owning<00:02:32.329> them<00:02:32.569> means<00:02:32.810> something

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
so you're owning them means something

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.080 
so you're owning them means something
they're<00:02:33.799> valuable<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.579> the<00:02:34.700> sense<00:02:34.939> they

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
they're valuable in the sense they

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.119 
they're valuable in the sense they
create<00:02:35.420> value<00:02:35.689> for<00:02:36.140> your<00:02:36.230> customers<00:02:36.769> so<00:02:36.920> think

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
create value for your customers so think

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.009 
create value for your customers so think
of<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.310> Kate<00:02:37.519> Spade<00:02:37.549> handbag<00:02:38.180> or<00:02:38.629> a<00:02:38.659> Gucci

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
of a Kate Spade handbag or a Gucci

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.690 
of a Kate Spade handbag or a Gucci
handbag<00:02:39.230> for<00:02:39.590> instance<00:02:39.920> people<00:02:40.310> will<00:02:40.519> pay<00:02:40.670> a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
handbag for instance people will pay a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.910 
handbag for instance people will pay a
big<00:02:40.909> premium<00:02:41.209> for<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:41.959> bag<00:02:42.170> because<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.769> has

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
big premium for that bag because it has

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.500 
big premium for that bag because it has
that<00:02:43.099> brand<00:02:43.280> on<00:02:43.519> there<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:43.879> that<00:02:43.909> resource

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
that brand on there so that resource

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.270 
that brand on there so that resource
adds<00:02:44.750> value<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.379> from<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.739> consumers

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
adds value to the from the consumers

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.920 
adds value to the from the consumers
point<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.549> view<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.909> finally<00:02:47.780> they're

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
point of view and finally they're

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.660 
point of view and finally they're
difficult<00:02:48.109> to<00:02:48.379> imitate<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:49.069> competitors

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
difficult to imitate so competitors

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.210 
difficult to imitate so competitors
can't<00:02:49.909> quickly<00:02:50.299> build<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.629> brand<00:02:50.900> like<00:02:51.829> a<00:02:51.859> Kate

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
can't quickly build a brand like a Kate

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.789 
can't quickly build a brand like a Kate
Spade<00:02:52.250> or<00:02:52.730> or<00:02:53.420> like<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.720> Gucci<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.260> takes<00:02:54.500> time

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
Spade or or like a Gucci it takes time

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.099 
Spade or or like a Gucci it takes time
and<00:02:55.010> effort<00:02:55.129> to<00:02:55.400> build<00:02:55.549> that<00:02:55.760> if<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.870> have<00:02:57.079> a

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
and effort to build that if you have a

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.960 
and effort to build that if you have a
resource<00:02:57.530> with<00:02:57.709> these<00:02:57.859> characteristics<00:02:58.400> and

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
resource with these characteristics and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.539 
resource with these characteristics and
you<00:02:59.480> own<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.930> control<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.439> resource<00:03:00.920> again

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
you own and control that resource again

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.160 
you own and control that resource again
it's<00:03:01.879> very<00:03:02.060> hard<00:03:02.720> for<00:03:03.019> competitors<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:05.170> grab

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
it's very hard for competitors to grab

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.349 
it's very hard for competitors to grab
the<00:03:06.530> value<00:03:06.859> that<00:03:07.010> you've<00:03:07.189> created<00:03:07.609> ok<00:03:08.299> so

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
the value that you've created ok so

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.720 
the value that you've created ok so
you've<00:03:08.599> created<00:03:08.810> value<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:09.739> it's<00:03:10.189> again<00:03:10.609> you

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
you've created value and it's again you

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.399 
you've created value and it's again you
keep<00:03:10.879> competitors<00:03:11.510> out<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.049> that's<00:03:12.200> the

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
keep competitors out so that's the

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.589 
keep competitors out so that's the
second<00:03:12.769> logic<00:03:13.069> resource<00:03:13.489> base<00:03:13.760> again<00:03:14.420> if<00:03:14.510> you

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
second logic resource base again if you

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.640 
second logic resource base again if you
want<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.780> think<00:03:14.930> about<00:03:15.139> it<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.439> kind<00:03:15.560> of

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
want to think about it the kind of

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.099 
want to think about it the kind of
military<00:03:15.889> analogy<00:03:16.730> just<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:17.060> fix<00:03:17.299> ideas<00:03:17.510> it's

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
military analogy just to fix ideas it's

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.069 
military analogy just to fix ideas it's
around<00:03:18.560> having<00:03:19.010> better<00:03:19.669> military<00:03:20.079> technology

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
around having better military technology

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.569 
around having better military technology
so<00:03:21.290> think<00:03:21.500> about<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.799> United<00:03:21.949> States<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.519> the

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
so think about the United States and the

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.270 
so think about the United States and the
Soviet<00:03:22.760> Union<00:03:23.030> having<00:03:23.739> nuclear<00:03:24.739> weapons<00:03:25.129> and

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
Soviet Union having nuclear weapons and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.069 
Soviet Union having nuclear weapons and
keeping<00:03:25.669> other<00:03:25.879> countries<00:03:26.480> from<00:03:26.660> having

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
keeping other countries from having

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.680 
keeping other countries from having
those<00:03:27.199> weapons<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:28.159> superior<00:03:28.730> resources<00:03:29.180> is

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
those weapons the superior resources is

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.439 
those weapons the superior resources is
the<00:03:30.199> approach<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.709> strategy<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.370> case<00:03:31.699> so

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
the approach to strategy in that case so

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:33.970 
the approach to strategy in that case so
these<00:03:32.569> are<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.840> two<00:03:33.019> common<00:03:33.349> views<00:03:33.799> of

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
these are the two common views of

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.849 
these are the two common views of
strategy<00:03:34.459> true<00:03:34.970> common<00:03:35.599> notions<00:03:36.349> of<00:03:36.530> value

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
strategy true common notions of value
