00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.420
 so that may be part of his 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.070
 back to school resolutions you have 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.049
 decided to go sporting tidy 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.299
 the whole album all the blog pictures of what 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.830
 still do huy the vinyl package 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.080
 that you found in the cellar with 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.840
 the pockets or your strings we get 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.400
 is no longer anything we're going to buy 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.330
 giving does not do it do not do it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.670
 because precisely 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.930
 do you think it can serve you yes 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.609
 it can serve you william and then 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.189
 especially it's the return of the retro 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.890
 music in us who have vinyls 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 at us to happen according to time for 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.570
 nerdy vis-Ã -vis our children a 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.440
 suddenly found some interested blow 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.239
 look at it our 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.260
 So not to re obviously are 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.520
 so many other reasons for 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.350
 which we can pass for 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.550
 tacky but then suddenly we become 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.059
 a little bit modern 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.610
 vinyl rose 17% on the market 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.829
 vinyl in France last year and the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.449
 cd dropped him by 44% 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.559
 that does not mean he sold himself more 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.520
 of vinyls than to yield but in any case 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.440
 both markets are completely 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.890
 opposite is the return to the retro 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.350
 music 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.549
 so we were interested in who 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.049
 made the stop too much music finds that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.040
 it is rather a website that is in 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.990
 Britain 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.310
 and then he proposes several things of 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.900
 the bank they have a lot of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.520
 references a lot a lot of vinyl 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.590
 and especially he takes care of turntables 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 our old platinum gold is set 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.280
 what they reissue then they reissue 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.810
 should indeed they have the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.610
 peasant vinyls sell an old 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:33.229
 rivers not tonight but there are these jo 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:35.759
 thin white duke illegal illegal rivers and 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.220
 is high and the decks also during 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.079
 they do they remake turntables 9 may 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.090
 old if you want and then especially he 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.729
 restore your turntables if they ever 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.310
 are damaged an old you're not an old 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.570
 goes beyond for example and that's when 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.770
 even formidable because we thought that 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.759
 it was dead, what are we 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.380
 had at home we said we do not 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.509
 will never be able to use it again 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.360
 bring all this back to life and we are 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.479
 went to brittany met in front of 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.479
 microphones 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:13.300
 wrong with your concept it's about being able to 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.130
 offer the best products the most 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.239
 great brands of turntable because 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.720
 that we realized that there is a 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.150
 return of the turntable 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.830
 we propose more than 700 references of 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.850
 products that it's platinum and 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:33.030
 accessories in total we are new 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.769
 but all our appliances parts 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.390
 perfectly set up this is the 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.110
 of course not set up like have a 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.209
 technical threshold 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.470
 we also make airlock after sale if 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.670
 renewed under subcontractors nothing is done 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.870
 also material recovery so we 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.190
 puts them in the state have air conditioning 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.000
 so obviously it takes to sluggish 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.709
 do it 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.420
 and also we have another part that the 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.709
 rather vintage part all devices 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.540
 we need restoration of 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:58.519
 repair is almost 100% sure of 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.519
 of these repairs within it was 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.489
 there is a strong tendency 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.560
 he had put an end to the fashion aspect 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.599
 around the vintage but also a side a 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.700
 little crazy I think too much wrong and it's a 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.959
 reappropriation of the object do in a 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.970
 dematerialized world 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.810
 we're getting back to Orchard and that's 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.810
 something extremely important 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.819
 they were twenty thousand record stores in 91 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.620
 with white and gold explains 200 that the 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.260
 united states it's a good indicator 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.909
 and the kids only buy vinyl is 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.799
 simple usb key that is the only one and 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.349
 it's over for them in France me I 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.760
 sell dead or for a cd since 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.440
 about a year when it's a big 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.299
 back to vinyl on rock classic 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.299
 doors and where that stuff 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.030
 it is difficult today to answer 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.920
 current albertine are better or 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.230
 worse than the vintage patina 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.069
 that said on equal terms and at the same price 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.069
 the 60 scooters say 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.000
 we just released a new site that 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.099
 my name is called my audio server as 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.980
 and aulas or to propose all 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.970
 devices to be able to read his music 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.190
 dematerialized in bonds 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.750
 optimal audiophiles and besides this 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.950
 we currently see in cities 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.930
 that is to say that more and more 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.690
 vinyls are accompanied by a baby 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.090
 to be able to access the version 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.040
 digital dematerialized so in fact 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.590
 a real consistency around these two 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.660
 supports on the dematerialized and Latin 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.340
 it's quite interesting if I go 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.370
 cheapest 300 euros the most expensive 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.860
 12000 away 12000 but in average price 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.270
 it's between 2 and 3000 euros to have 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.830
 a turntable in any case 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.850
 congratulations to these young bretons there 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.850
 it's very good to count
