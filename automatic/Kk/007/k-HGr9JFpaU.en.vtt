00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
neat let's step down and take a look at

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.250 
neat let's step down and take a look at
the<00:01:14.760> console<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> things<00:01:16.140> that's

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
the console one of the things that's

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.660 
the console one of the things that's
very<00:01:16.680> important<00:01:17.190> is<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.370> got<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> have

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
very important is you got to have

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.310 
very important is you got to have
electronics<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> console<00:01:18.780> level<00:01:19.140> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
electronics at the console level I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
electronics at the console level I
happen<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.370> like<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.820> fact<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.150> you've<00:01:21.330> got

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
happen to like the fact that you've got

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.899 
happen to like the fact that you've got
the<00:01:21.930> capability<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.620> network<00:01:23.190> my<00:01:23.460> unit<00:01:23.790> from

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the capability to network my unit from

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
the capability to network my unit from
front<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> back<00:01:24.420> what<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.259> allows<00:01:25.590> me<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> do

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
front to back what that allows me to do

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.010 
front to back what that allows me to do
is<00:01:26.189> set<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.399> waypoint<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.329> I<00:01:27.360> sight<00:01:27.689> imaged

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
is set a waypoint here as I sight imaged

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.050 
is set a waypoint here as I sight imaged
then<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.770> able<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.369> same<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:29.790> point

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
then be able to have that same way point

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
then be able to have that same way point
in<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> front<00:01:30.570> when<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> go<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.649> front

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
in the front when I go up to the front

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.889 
in the front when I go up to the front
you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.729> see<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> larger<00:01:33.479> unit<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
you can see I have a larger unit in the

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.030 
you can see I have a larger unit in the
front<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.170> that's<00:01:34.320> because<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.680> spend<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.009> lot

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
front and that's because I spend a lot

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.770 
front and that's because I spend a lot
of<00:01:35.460> my<00:01:35.579> time<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.420> front<00:01:36.539> of<00:01:36.719> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
of my time up here in the front of the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.160 
of my time up here in the front of the
boat

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
boat

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.810 
boat
the<00:01:37.530> other<00:01:37.649> thing<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.219> believe<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the other thing I really believe in is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.940 
the other thing I really believe in is
the<00:01:38.909> Hydra<00:01:39.240> wave<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> Hydra<00:01:39.899> wave<00:01:40.049> whether

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the Hydra wave the Hydra wave whether

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.740 
the Hydra wave the Hydra wave whether
