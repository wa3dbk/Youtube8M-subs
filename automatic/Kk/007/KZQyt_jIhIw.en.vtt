subframe there were suffering me did be

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.750 
subframe there were suffering me did be
replaced<00:01:18.430> sooner<00:01:19.060> or<00:01:19.150> later

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
put the jack under here and simulate

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.760 
put the jack under here and simulate
suspension<00:01:58.330> travel

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
suspension travel

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.010 
suspension travel
look<00:01:59.770> right<00:01:59.950> here<00:02:01.770> son<00:02:02.770> here<00:02:03.690> all<00:02:04.690> right

sitting on the on the subframe right

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.560 
sitting on the on the subframe right
here<00:02:42.840> should<00:02:43.590> actually<00:02:43.770> be<00:02:44.100> up<00:02:44.430> here<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.180> not

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
here should actually be up here and not

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.330 
here should actually be up here and not
touching<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.050> even<00:02:46.320> close<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.709> touching<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:47.160> so

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
touching it even close to touching it so

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.820 
touching it even close to touching it so
that<00:02:48.330> means<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.690> whole<00:02:48.930> portion<00:02:49.290> right<00:02:49.590> here

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
that means this whole portion right here

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.180 
that means this whole portion right here
on<00:02:49.950> my<00:02:50.070> current<00:02:50.610> subframe<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:52.160> rusted<00:02:53.160> and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
on my current subframe is rusted and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:02.810 
on my current subframe is rusted and
gave<00:02:53.400> out<00:02:58.880> so<00:03:00.950> that's<00:03:01.950> gonna<00:03:02.190> be<00:03:02.310> my<00:03:02.400> first

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
gave out so that's gonna be my first

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.220 
gave out so that's gonna be my first
project<00:03:03.300> with<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.540> camera<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:03.989> with<00:03:04.110> this

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
project with this camera and with this

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.430 
project with this camera and with this
video<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:05.220> wish<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.150> had<00:03:06.239> more<00:03:06.390> videos<00:03:06.780> as<00:03:07.080> I've

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
video I wish I had more videos as I've

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.030 
video I wish I had more videos as I've
done<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> lot<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.010> cars<00:03:08.220> already<00:03:09.110> but<00:03:10.110> this

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
done a lot of the cars already but this

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.860 
done a lot of the cars already but this
will<00:03:11.250> be<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:12.739> fun<00:03:13.739> project<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.489> one<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.150> them<00:03:15.330> one

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
will be a fun project is one of them one

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.930 
will be a fun project is one of them one
of<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.019> bigger<00:03:16.170> ones<00:03:16.260> other<00:03:17.190> than<00:03:17.310> rebuilding

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
of the bigger ones other than rebuilding

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.970 
of the bigger ones other than rebuilding
the<00:03:18.030> engine<00:03:18.620> but<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.650> haven't<00:03:19.769> done<00:03:19.920> anything

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
the engine but I haven't done anything

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.550 
the engine but I haven't done anything
to<00:03:20.310> back<00:03:20.700> into<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.090> car<00:03:21.269> yet<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.230> some<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.440> you

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
to back into the car yet so some of you

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.900 
to back into the car yet so some of you
might<00:03:22.709> first<00:03:22.920> go<00:03:23.100> with<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.549> see<00:03:23.760> how

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
might first go with that and see how

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.870 
might first go with that and see how
what<00:03:24.750> condition<00:03:25.200> things<00:03:25.440> are<00:03:25.620> back<00:03:25.860> here<00:03:26.100> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
what condition things are back here the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.120 
what condition things are back here the
front<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.239> pretty<00:03:27.450> good<00:03:30.500> some<00:03:31.500> some<00:03:31.920> things

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
front is pretty good some some things

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.539 
front is pretty good some some things
here<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.430> there<00:03:32.670> but<00:03:34.010> I'm<00:03:35.010> gonna<00:03:35.100> adjust<00:03:35.370> the

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
here and there but I'm gonna adjust the

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.370 
here and there but I'm gonna adjust the
suspension<00:03:35.760> on<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.239> front<00:03:36.510> well<00:03:36.720> after<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.320> do

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
suspension on the front well after I do

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.030 
suspension on the front well after I do
the<00:03:37.530> subframe<00:03:37.829> as<00:03:38.040> well<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:39.829> when<00:03:40.829> I<00:03:40.860> go<00:03:40.980> to

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
the subframe as well so when I go to

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.940 
the subframe as well so when I go to
take<00:03:41.190> this<00:03:41.310> apart<00:03:42.170> its<00:03:43.170> screw<00:03:43.470> missing<00:03:43.620> right

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
take this apart its screw missing right

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.729 
take this apart its screw missing right
here<00:03:44.130> I'll<00:03:45.090> do<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.329> when<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.290> go<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.470> take<00:03:46.620> this

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
here I'll do that when I go to take this

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.720 
here I'll do that when I go to take this
apart<00:03:48.049> we'll<00:03:49.049> do<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.290> brakes<00:03:49.530> I'll<00:03:50.280> do<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.880> new

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
apart we'll do the brakes I'll do a new

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.259 
apart we'll do the brakes I'll do a new
shock<00:03:53.730> absorbers<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:55.829> cones<00:03:56.130> I'm<00:03:56.940> gonna<00:03:57.090> keep

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
shock absorbers the cones I'm gonna keep

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.509 
shock absorbers the cones I'm gonna keep
those<00:03:57.480> original<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.140> reason<00:03:58.470> being<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.950> that

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
those original the reason being is that

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.699 
those original the reason being is that
competition<00:04:00.120> cones<00:04:00.510> which<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:00.930> gives<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.680> a

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
competition cones which is gives you a

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.280 
competition cones which is gives you a
stiffer<00:04:02.130> ride<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.930> stiffer<00:04:03.930> ride<00:04:04.110> is

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
stiffer ride and stiffer ride is

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.970 
stiffer ride and stiffer ride is
actually<00:04:04.709> they<00:04:05.430> simulate<00:04:06.120> old<00:04:06.630> cones<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.769> that

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
actually they simulate old cones so that

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.680 
actually they simulate old cones so that
means<00:04:08.160> these<00:04:08.370> are<00:04:08.430> gonna<00:04:09.060> be<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.299> stiffest

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
means these are gonna be the stiffest

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.539 
means these are gonna be the stiffest
you<00:04:10.019> can<00:04:10.170> get<00:04:10.350> which<00:04:10.890> is<00:04:10.920> gonna<00:04:11.130> be<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.400> best

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
you can get which is gonna be the best

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.320 
you can get which is gonna be the best
for<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.850> handling<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:14.160> trumpet<00:04:14.549> looks<00:04:14.760> okay

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
for the handling the trumpet looks okay

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.699 
for the handling the trumpet looks okay
but<00:04:15.599> we'll<00:04:15.780> take<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.049> off<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.260> take<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.440> look<00:04:16.620> at

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
but we'll take it off and take a look at

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.490 
but we'll take it off and take a look at
it<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.609> we<00:04:17.700> got<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.910> brake<00:04:18.090> lines

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
it and we got the brake lines

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.219 
it and we got the brake lines
which<00:04:20.500> are<00:04:20.650> always<00:04:20.769> fun<00:04:22.050> hopefully<00:04:23.050> those

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
which are always fun hopefully those

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.809 
which are always fun hopefully those
don't<00:04:23.710> break<00:04:23.949> or<00:04:24.129> anything<00:04:24.340> when<00:04:24.610> we<00:04:24.669> take

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:24.819 
don't break or anything when we take

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.399 
don't break or anything when we take
them<00:04:24.970> off<00:04:25.060> if<00:04:25.240> they<00:04:25.360> do<00:04:25.479> play<00:04:25.900> some<00:04:26.110> no<00:04:26.259> big

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
them off if they do play some no big

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:27.360 
them off if they do play some no big
deal

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
deal

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.040 
deal
cable<00:04:27.969> let's<00:04:28.300> see<00:04:28.449> if<00:04:28.569> that<00:04:28.719> needs<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:29.020> be

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
cable let's see if that needs to be

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.240 
cable let's see if that needs to be
replaced<00:04:29.759> but<00:04:30.759> all<00:04:30.909> this<00:04:31.180> is<00:04:31.479> gonna<00:04:32.439> go<00:04:32.680> go

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
replaced but all this is gonna go go

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.790 
replaced but all this is gonna go go
away<00:04:33.599> so<00:04:34.599> I'm<00:04:34.810> pretty<00:04:34.960> excited<00:04:35.259> about<00:04:35.590> that

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
away so I'm pretty excited about that

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.010 
away so I'm pretty excited about that
and<00:04:35.919> having<00:04:36.159> a<00:04:36.219> new<00:04:36.340> rear<00:04:36.610> subframe<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:37.840> not

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
and having a new rear subframe and not

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.360 
and having a new rear subframe and not
having<00:04:38.259> anything<00:04:38.469> to<00:04:38.860> worry<00:04:39.009> about<00:04:39.069> any

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
having anything to worry about any
