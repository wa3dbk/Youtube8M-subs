Middle Ages it's basically you take

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.890 
Middle Ages it's basically you take
ground<00:00:15.570> glass<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:17.000> mix<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.390> some<00:00:18.660> type

the glass and various methods it's
almost<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:27.990> bit<00:00:28.109> like<00:00:28.320> etching<00:00:28.859> it's

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
almost a little bit like etching it's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.910 
almost a little bit like etching it's
more<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.910> negative<00:00:30.689> process<00:00:31.560> where<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
more of a negative process where you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.900 
more of a negative process where you
take<00:00:32.160> away<00:00:32.340> what<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.030> don't<00:00:33.149> want<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:34.640> got<00:00:35.640> into

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
take away what you don't want I got into

take away what you don't want I got into
glass<00:00:36.120> painting<00:00:36.690> back<00:00:36.899> several<00:00:37.440> years<00:00:37.680> ago<00:00:37.980> I

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
glass painting back several years ago I

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.880 
glass painting back several years ago I
had<00:00:39.390> been<00:00:39.420> familiar<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.469> ever<00:00:40.620> since

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
had been familiar with it ever since

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.979 
had been familiar with it ever since
getting<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.550> high<00:00:41.730> school<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.390> knew<00:00:42.719> some

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
getting out of high school I knew some

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.330 
getting out of high school I knew some
other<00:00:43.140> people<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.649> did<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.309> was

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
other people that did it but I was

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.760 
other people that did it but I was
always<00:00:44.640> afraid<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.649> was<00:00:46.739> just

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
always afraid of it because it was just

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.979 
always afraid of it because it was just
so<00:00:47.100> different<00:00:47.370> from<00:00:47.879> any<00:00:48.329> other<00:00:48.629> type<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
so different from any other type of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.180 
so different from any other type of
painting<00:00:49.760> comes<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.030> us<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.510> power<00:00:52.199> they

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
painting comes to us as power they

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.410 
painting comes to us as power they
always<00:00:53.520> write<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.180> what<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
always write on here what the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.750 
always write on here what the
temperature<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.739> needs<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.100> fire<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
temperature is that it needs to fire to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.340 
temperature is that it needs to fire to
so<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.360> get<00:00:57.510> them<00:00:57.629> mixed<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:58.109> with

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so I don't get them mixed up with

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.500 
so I don't get them mixed up with
anything<00:00:58.620> else

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
anything else

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.970 
anything else
so<00:01:00.510> anyway<00:01:00.899> I'd<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.350> take<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> little<00:01:01.770> bit<00:01:01.920> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
so anyway I'd just take a little bit of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.760 
so anyway I'd just take a little bit of
water<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.690> add<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.970> know<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
water I add with this you know to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.800 
water I add with this you know to
reconstitute<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.979> paint<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> just

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
reconstitute the paint and then you just

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.640 
reconstitute the paint and then you just
take<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.650> brush<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:12.080> they<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> brush

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
take your brush and they have the brush

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.590 
take your brush and they have the brush
into<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.280> there's<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.360> certain

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
into it and there's a certain

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719 
into it and there's a certain
consistency<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.770> lay<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.100> over<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> glass

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
consistency and lay it over the glass

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.160 
consistency and lay it over the glass
then<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.990> take<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> blender<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.040> blend

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
then I just take the blender and blend

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.620 
then I just take the blender and blend
it<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.320> after<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.280> dries<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:24.180> looks

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
it out after that dries it looks

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.390 
it out after that dries it looks
something<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.080> what<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.830> here<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.250> this

start out with a drawing this is a small
scale<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.860> course<00:02:08.280> once<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.910> drawing<00:02:09.509> is

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
scale of course once this drawing is

brought<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.099> larger<00:02:11.640> scale<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.270> take<00:02:12.510> it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
brought up to a larger scale we take it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.460 
brought up to a larger scale we take it
and<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.050> lay

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
and we lay

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.610 
and we lay
the<00:02:13.530> glass<00:02:13.770> over<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.730> top<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:16.500> we

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
the glass over on top of it so that we

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.140 
the glass over on top of it so that we
can<00:02:16.860> trace<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> actually<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> finished

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
can trace this is a actually a finished

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.050 
can trace this is a actually a finished
piece<00:02:21.150> right<00:02:21.600> here<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:22.110> you're<00:02:22.290> seeing

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
totally completed I just got through

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.050 
totally completed I just got through
adding<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.710> little<00:02:25.950> holes<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.640> darker

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
adding the little holes in the darker

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.600 
adding the little holes in the darker
areas<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.080> face<00:02:28.320> that's<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.340> whole

difference in this and any other art

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.530 
difference in this and any other art
form<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.400> way<00:02:32.580> light<00:02:32.850> interacts

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
form is just the way light interacts

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.380 
form is just the way light interacts
with<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.440> shines<00:02:35.010> through<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.610> my<00:02:36.000> hopes

with it and shines through it my hopes
for<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> future<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.250> stained<00:02:38.250> glass<00:02:38.610> is

for the future of stained glass is

for the future of stained glass is
partly<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:40.200> hope<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.620> don't<00:02:40.740> become<00:02:41.130> so

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
partly I hope it don't become so
