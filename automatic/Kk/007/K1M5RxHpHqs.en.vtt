informed<00:02:16.900> silver<00:02:17.260> centre-back<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.950> when<00:02:18.280> I

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
informed silver centre-back and when I

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.160 
informed silver centre-back and when I
bought<00:02:18.610> him<00:02:18.670> he<00:02:18.850> had<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:18.970> plus-10<00:02:19.570> card<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:20.050> him

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
so those stats obviously way heightened

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.700

after<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.690> first<00:02:22.930> game<00:02:23.200> obviously<00:02:23.470> that

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
after the first game obviously that

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.800 
after the first game obviously that
removes<00:02:24.130> itself<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.580> think<00:02:24.640> he<00:02:24.850> has<00:02:24.940> like<00:02:25.150> 73

into<00:03:22.330> his<00:03:22.480> own<00:03:22.600> net<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:23.260> fair<00:03:23.500> enough<00:03:23.770> drees

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760

mertens<00:03:25.180> actually<00:03:25.540> played<00:03:25.750> provider<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.590> me

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
mertens actually played provider for me

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.710 
mertens actually played provider for me
he<00:03:26.770> didn't<00:03:27.010> actually<00:03:27.130> score<00:03:27.520> any<00:03:27.730> goals<00:03:27.850> but<00:03:28.690> I

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
he didn't actually score any goals but I

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.870 
he didn't actually score any goals but I
was<00:03:29.110> kind<00:03:29.830> of<00:03:29.950> expecting<00:03:30.160> that<00:03:30.520> actually

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
was kind of expecting that actually

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.550 
was kind of expecting that actually
because<00:03:31.209> if<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:31.720> think<00:03:31.750> about<00:03:31.990> it<00:03:32.140> he's<00:03:32.350> more

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
because if you think about it he's more

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.670 
because if you think about it he's more
of<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.709> cam<00:03:33.010> than<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.430> striker<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.440> benteke<00:03:35.440> is

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
of a cam than a striker and benteke is

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.110 
of a cam than a striker and benteke is
the<00:03:35.830> finisher<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:36.430> it's<00:03:36.580> just<00:03:36.730> sort<00:03:36.910> of<00:03:36.940> worked

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
the finisher so it's just sort of worked

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.970

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
out quite well that he plays the ball

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.980 
out quite well that he plays the ball

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
through to benteke been decades through

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.810 
through to benteke been decades through
and<00:03:41.320> he's<00:03:41.650> gonna<00:03:41.830> knit<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.250> ball<00:03:42.430> as<00:03:42.580> you<00:03:42.700> can
