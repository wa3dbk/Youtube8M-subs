was<00:01:25.290> Roman<00:01:25.740> reigns<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.759> bit<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
was Roman reigns and have a bit of a

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.210 
was Roman reigns and have a bit of a
summer<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.869> Roman<00:01:28.259> reigns<00:01:28.409> summer<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.979> reigns

summer of Roman reigns summer of reigns

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.880 
summer of Roman reigns summer of reigns
that<00:01:30.150> would<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.420> pretty<00:01:30.630> sweet<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.930> mean<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that would be pretty sweet I mean the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.380 
that would be pretty sweet I mean the
only<00:01:32.070> problem<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> think<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.210> is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
only problem I think with that is is

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.960 
only problem I think with that is is
Roman<00:01:33.840> reigns<00:01:33.869> ready<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.700> same

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
Roman reigns ready for that and the same

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.310 
Roman reigns ready for that and the same
could<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.180> over<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> Bray<00:01:36.780> why<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.229> think

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
could be over the Bray why but I think

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.690 
could be over the Bray why but I think
Bray<00:01:37.530> Wyatt's<00:01:37.920> more<00:01:38.130> ready<00:01:38.340> than<00:01:38.400> running

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
Bray Wyatt's more ready than running

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.999 
Bray Wyatt's more ready than running
reigns<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.329> think<00:01:39.810> I'd<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.140> saving<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.650> Roman

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
reigns I think I'd be saving the Roman

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.450 
reigns I think I'd be saving the Roman
reigns<00:01:41.509> big<00:01:42.509> push<00:01:42.869> for<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.770> little<00:01:44.070> longer<00:01:44.220> I

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
reigns big push for a little longer I

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.130 
reigns big push for a little longer I
think<00:01:44.549> WrestleMania<00:01:45.360> would<00:01:45.600> suit<00:01:45.840> Roman

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
think WrestleMania would suit Roman

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.350 
think WrestleMania would suit Roman
reigns<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.439> little<00:01:46.649> bit<00:01:46.740> more<00:01:46.920> I'm<00:01:47.009> thinking

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
reigns a little bit more I'm thinking

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.929 
reigns a little bit more I'm thinking
Royal<00:01:48.360> Rumble<00:01:48.720> victory<00:01:49.110> I'm<00:01:49.259> thinking<00:01:49.939> 2005

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939

WrestleMania<00:01:59.960> again

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
WrestleMania again

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.180 
WrestleMania again
some<00:02:02.480> I<00:02:02.870> don't<00:02:02.990> know<00:02:03.140> who<00:02:03.320> who<00:02:03.560> would<00:02:03.680> it<00:02:03.800> be

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
some I don't know who who would it be

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.880 
some I don't know who who would it be
who<00:02:04.370> knows<00:02:04.550> but<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:06.170> know<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.560> know<00:02:06.680> what<00:02:06.800> I'm

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
who knows but you know you know what I'm

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.290 
who knows but you know you know what I'm
saying<00:02:07.159> so<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.400> think<00:02:07.610> Roman<00:02:07.820> reigns<00:02:07.940> should

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
saying so I think Roman reigns should

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.820 
saying so I think Roman reigns should
probably<00:02:08.450> go<00:02:08.630> down<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:09.080> route<00:02:09.259> said<00:02:09.619> if<00:02:09.709> you

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
probably go down that route said if you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.520 
probably go down that route said if you
know<00:02:09.950> winning<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.820> now<00:02:11.000> but<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:12.020> rumors<00:02:12.350> is

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
know winning it now but the rumors is

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.770 
know winning it now but the rumors is
that<00:02:12.950> John<00:02:13.370> Cena<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:14.000> gonna<00:02:14.120> win<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.510> match

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
that John Cena is gonna win this match

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.230 
that John Cena is gonna win this match
and<00:02:14.959> I<00:02:15.050> think<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.920> Cena<00:02:16.190> wins<00:02:16.459> that'll<00:02:16.850> almost

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
and I think the Cena wins that'll almost

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.590 
and I think the Cena wins that'll almost
make<00:02:17.450> me<00:02:17.480> sick<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.670> mean<00:02:19.670> don't<00:02:19.940> get<00:02:20.030> me<00:02:20.090> wrong<00:02:20.209> I

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
make me sick I mean don't get me wrong I

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.570 
make me sick I mean don't get me wrong I
I<00:02:20.630> think<00:02:21.140> Cena's<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> great<00:02:21.830> competitor<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.280> do

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
I think Cena's a great competitor I do

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.330 
I think Cena's a great competitor I do
like<00:02:22.940> Cena<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:23.660> I'm<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.260> tired<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.860> seeing<00:02:25.040> him

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
like Cena but I'm so tired of seeing him

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.060 
like Cena but I'm so tired of seeing him
with<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.270> championship<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:27.110> am<00:02:27.200> over<00:02:27.860> seeing

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
with the championship I am over seeing

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.640 
with the championship I am over seeing
him<00:02:28.280> at<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.370> belt<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.820> just<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.410> don't<00:02:30.410> want<00:02:30.590> to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
him at the belt I just I don't want to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.230 
him at the belt I just I don't want to
see<00:02:30.800> Cena<00:02:31.070> this<00:02:31.310> champion<00:02:31.760> anymore<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:32.090> think

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
see Cena this champion anymore I think

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.180 
see Cena this champion anymore I think
we<00:02:32.510> three<00:02:32.780> steps<00:02:33.080> back<00:02:33.380> if<00:02:33.590> they<00:02:33.680> do<00:02:33.739> go<00:02:34.010> that

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
we three steps back if they do go that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.699 
we three steps back if they do go that
way<00:02:34.570> another<00:02:35.570> man<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.080> think<00:02:36.290> has<00:02:36.560> an

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
way another man that I think has an

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.290 
way another man that I think has an
opportunity<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.250> win<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.520> Cesaro

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
opportunity to win is Cesaro

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.660 
opportunity to win is Cesaro
I<00:02:38.330> think<00:02:38.930> Cesaro<00:02:39.680> has<00:02:39.800> been<00:02:39.950> derailed<00:02:40.340> he's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
I think Cesaro has been derailed he's

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.070 
I think Cesaro has been derailed he's
lost<00:02:40.820> so<00:02:41.090> much<00:02:41.239> momentum<00:02:41.540> since<00:02:41.870> WrestleMania

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
lost so much momentum since WrestleMania

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.740 
lost so much momentum since WrestleMania
I<00:02:42.950> think<00:02:43.610> that's<00:02:43.730> almost<00:02:43.910> out<00:02:44.239> of<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.390> picture

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
I think that's almost out of the picture

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.260 
I think that's almost out of the picture
and<00:02:45.739> then<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:45.920> have<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.130> other<00:02:46.220> guys<00:02:46.430> Kane<00:02:46.940> no

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
and then you have the other guys Kane no

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.340 
and then you have the other guys Kane no
way<00:02:47.480> Sheamus<00:02:48.050> no<00:02:48.550> del<00:02:49.550> rio's<00:02:49.940> no<00:02:50.239> way<00:02:50.570> I<00:02:50.989> think

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
way Sheamus no del rio's no way I think

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.340 
way Sheamus no del rio's no way I think
that's<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.190> everyone<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.730> Randy<00:02:53.060> Orton

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
that's is that everyone and Randy Orton

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.900 
that's is that everyone and Randy Orton
Rennie<00:02:54.350> one<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.709> lost<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.070> belt<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:55.519> that's

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
Rennie one just lost the belt so that's

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.970 
Rennie one just lost the belt so that's
not<00:02:56.030> gonna<00:02:56.150> happen<00:02:56.330> either<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.650> really<00:02:57.890> is

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
not gonna happen either so it really is

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.479 
not gonna happen either so it really is
coming<00:02:58.340> down<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.810> reigns<00:02:59.810> Wyatt<00:03:00.500> or<00:03:00.769> Cena<00:03:01.100> in

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
coming down to reigns Wyatt or Cena in

decent<00:03:22.280> way<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.269> go<00:03:23.570> about<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:24.260> think<00:03:24.500> if

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
decent way to go about it I think if

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.949 
decent way to go about it I think if
that<00:03:25.040> was<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.370> case<00:03:25.549> if<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:25.910> happened<00:03:26.390> I'd

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
that was the case if that happened I'd

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.110 
that was the case if that happened I'd
be<00:03:27.230> okay<00:03:27.530> with<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.860> have<00:03:28.400> Lesnar<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:28.940> Cena

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
be okay with that have Lesnar and Cena

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.580 
be okay with that have Lesnar and Cena
go<00:03:29.390> at<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.660> again<00:03:29.750> because<00:03:30.170> I've<00:03:30.260> been<00:03:30.350> wanting

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
go at it again because I've been wanting

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.020 
go at it again because I've been wanting
to<00:03:30.739> see<00:03:30.890> those<00:03:31.070> two<00:03:31.220> guys<00:03:31.400> have<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.700> rematch

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
to see those two guys have a rematch

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.699 
to see those two guys have a rematch
that<00:03:32.269> would<00:03:32.360> be<00:03:32.420> a<00:03:32.450> hell<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.840> match<00:03:33.019> once

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
that would be a hell of a match once

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.319 
that would be a hell of a match once
again<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.130> first<00:03:34.280> match<00:03:34.549> was<00:03:34.670> epic<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:35.269> I

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
again the first match was epic so I

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.550 
again the first match was epic so I
would<00:03:35.480> love<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.780> see<00:03:35.900> those<00:03:36.019> two<00:03:36.200> guys<00:03:36.320> have

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
would love to see those two guys have

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.490 
would love to see those two guys have
another<00:03:36.829> match<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.579> have<00:03:38.150> Cena<00:03:39.110> this<00:03:39.230> time

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
another match and have Cena this time

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.770 
another match and have Cena this time
put<00:03:39.739> Lesnar<00:03:40.430> over<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.390> would<00:03:41.540> be<00:03:41.630> the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
put Lesnar over and that would be the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.780 
put Lesnar over and that would be the
way<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:41.930> go<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.560> then<00:03:42.980> have<00:03:43.160> Daniel<00:03:43.459> Bryan<00:03:43.700> and

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
way to go and then have Daniel Bryan and

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.729 
way to go and then have Daniel Bryan and
Lesnar<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.360> match<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:45.049> I<00:03:45.260> don't<00:03:45.410> know<00:03:45.500> if<00:03:45.650> I

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.440 
Lesnar a match so I don't know if I
really<00:03:46.130> want<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.400> see<00:03:46.610> but<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:46.970> think<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.269> could

really want to see but I think it could

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.660 
really want to see but I think it could
be<00:03:47.540> good<00:03:47.690> so<00:03:48.049> I<00:03:48.380> don't<00:03:49.070> know<00:03:49.160> let<00:03:49.310> me<00:03:49.340> let<00:03:49.640> me
