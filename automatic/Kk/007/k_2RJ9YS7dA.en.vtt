specifically<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.550> MSH<00:00:20.910> Protoss<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.020> they

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
specifically for the MSH Protoss so they

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.840 
specifically for the MSH Protoss so they
fit<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> swash<00:00:22.830> plate<00:00:23.010> accurately<00:00:23.640> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
fit on the swash plate accurately and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.689 
fit on the swash plate accurately and
they've<00:00:24.750> also<00:00:24.960> been<00:00:25.230> designed<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.890> another

get a bit messy now the first step to
leveling<00:01:00.030> your<00:01:00.149> swash<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:01.410> set<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:01.949> your

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
leveling your swash is to set up your

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.050 
leveling your swash is to set up your
transmitter<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.149> get<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> correct

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
transmitter so we get the correct

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:12.289 
transmitter so we get the correct
outputs<00:01:08.270> okay<00:01:10.549> firstly<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.880> want<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.150> make

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
outputs okay firstly you want to make

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.539 
outputs okay firstly you want to make
sure<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.400> no<00:01:14.400> sub<00:01:14.670> trims<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.200> no

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
sure that you have no sub trims and no

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.580 
sure that you have no sub trims and no
trims<00:01:17.549> at<00:01:17.759> all<00:01:17.939> set<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:18.930> radio<00:01:19.290> because

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
trims at all set in your radio because

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.520 
trims at all set in your radio because
we<00:01:19.710> are<00:01:19.860> setting<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.310> up<00:01:20.369> from<00:01:20.790> scratch<00:01:21.530> next

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
we are setting this up from scratch next

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.020 
we are setting this up from scratch next
we<00:01:22.740> want<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> make<00:01:23.040> sure<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.729> we're<00:01:23.909> getting

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
we want to make sure that we're getting

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.670 
we want to make sure that we're getting
the<00:01:24.650> full<00:01:25.650> pitch<00:01:26.640> range<00:01:27.290> signal<00:01:28.290> coming<00:01:28.560> from

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the full pitch range signal coming from

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.999 
the full pitch range signal coming from
our<00:01:28.950> transmitter<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.790> I've<00:01:30.600> set<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.140> pitch

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
our transmitter so I've set up a pitch

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.910 
our transmitter so I've set up a pitch
curve<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.420> our<00:01:33.570> setup<00:01:33.960> now<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.680> pitch

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
curve to do our setup now the pitch

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.730 
curve to do our setup now the pitch
curve<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.340> using<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.270> zero<00:01:37.430> 50<00:01:38.430> 50<00:01:39.180> 50<00:01:39.750> 100

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
curve I'm using is a zero 50 50 50 100

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.950 
curve I'm using is a zero 50 50 50 100
pitch<00:01:40.950> curve<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:42.090> allows<00:01:42.360> me<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.659> get<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
pitch curve this allows me to get the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.530 
pitch curve this allows me to get the
minimum<00:01:43.259> pitch<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.100> maximum<00:01:44.520> pitch<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.000> my

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
minimum pitch the maximum pitch and my

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.350 
minimum pitch the maximum pitch and my
mid<00:01:45.750> stick<00:01:45.990> 50%<00:01:46.829> position<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:48.000> reason<00:01:48.270> why

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
mid stick 50% position the reason why

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.399 
mid stick 50% position the reason why
I've<00:01:48.479> flattened<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.930> curve<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.380> middle

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
I've flattened the curve in the middle

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.620 
I've flattened the curve in the middle
there<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.360> sensitive

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
there is so that it's not so sensitive

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.420 
there is so that it's not so sensitive
in<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> middle<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:53.009> I'm<00:01:53.280> getting

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
in the middle so I know I'm getting

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.780 
in the middle so I know I'm getting
exactly<00:01:54.000> 50%<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.780> that's<00:01:54.960> minimum<00:01:55.320> 50%<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
exactly 50% so that's minimum 50% and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.030 
exactly 50% so that's minimum 50% and
100<00:02:00.170> now<00:02:01.170> once<00:02:01.469> we've<00:02:01.649> set<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:01.860> our

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
100 now once we've set up our

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.850 
100 now once we've set up our
transmitter<00:02:02.570> we<00:02:03.570> want<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.990> make<00:02:04.409> sure<00:02:04.649> that

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
transmitter we want to make sure that

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.960 
transmitter we want to make sure that
the<00:02:05.070> servo<00:02:05.790> horns<00:02:06.210> are<00:02:06.420> level<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:07.710> what<00:02:08.610> we<00:02:08.759> do

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the servo horns are level now what we do

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.370 
the servo horns are level now what we do
is<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.750> need<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.200> put<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
is we need to put it in the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.430 
is we need to put it in the
50<00:02:11.620> %<00:02:12.010> 0<00:02:12.280> pitch<00:02:12.490> position<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:13.750> that's<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.080> 0

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
50 % 0 pitch position so that's a 0

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440 
50 % 0 pitch position so that's a 0
pitch<00:02:14.680> middle<00:02:14.980> stick<00:02:15.160> position<00:02:15.580> put<00:02:16.420> your

swash plate is not level and as you can
see<00:03:06.090> there<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:07.330> gap<00:03:07.780> right<00:03:08.530> there<00:03:08.940> now<00:03:09.940> what

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
see there is a gap right there now what

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.970 
see there is a gap right there now what
we<00:03:10.270> do<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.690> that<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.960> 0<00:03:11.170> pitch<00:03:11.380> position<00:03:11.860> we

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
we do is that the 0 pitch position we

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.590 
we do is that the 0 pitch position we
want<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.520> get<00:03:12.640> rid<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.790> those<00:03:13.030> gaps<00:03:13.300> by

want to get rid of those gaps by

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.510 
want to get rid of those gaps by

it's<00:04:17.049> too<00:04:17.350> high<00:04:17.530> or<00:04:17.590> too<00:04:17.739> low

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
it's too high or too low

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.860 
it's too high or too low
you'd<00:04:18.280> adjust<00:04:18.609> all<00:04:18.820> three<00:04:19.090> linkages<00:04:19.419> equally

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
you'd adjust all three linkages equally

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.200 
you'd adjust all three linkages equally
to<00:04:20.440> get<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.859> level<00:04:21.130> now<00:04:21.790> what<00:04:22.030> we're<00:04:22.180> looking

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
to get that level now what we're looking

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.550 
to get that level now what we're looking
at<00:04:22.540> now<00:04:22.780> you

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
at now you

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.510 
at now you
the<00:04:23.980> pound<00:04:24.970> level<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.480> swashplate<00:04:25.720> is<00:04:26.050> at<00:04:26.230> the

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
the pound level the swashplate is at the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.659 
the pound level the swashplate is at the
top<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.730> bottom<00:04:27.880> as<00:04:28.780> you<00:04:28.840> can<00:04:29.110> see<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.340> gap

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
top and bottom as you can see is a gap

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.090 
top and bottom as you can see is a gap
there<00:04:30.970> at<00:04:31.389> minimum<00:04:32.020> pitch<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:34.030> there's<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.870> gap

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
there at minimum pitch and there's a gap

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.950 
there at minimum pitch and there's a gap
and<00:04:36.100> we<00:04:36.130> elevate<00:04:36.760> a<00:04:36.790> server<00:04:37.090> at<00:04:37.360> maximum<00:04:37.780> pitch

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
and we elevate a server at maximum pitch

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.800 
and we elevate a server at maximum pitch
now<00:04:38.680> how<00:04:38.830> do<00:04:38.889> we<00:04:38.980> get<00:04:39.130> rid<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.630> so<00:04:40.630> it's

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
now how do we get rid of that so it's

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.420 
now how do we get rid of that so it's
level<00:04:40.990> in<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.260> middle<00:04:41.530> perfectly<00:04:42.130> level<00:04:42.340> in

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
level in the middle perfectly level in

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.980 
level in the middle perfectly level in
the<00:04:42.490> middle<00:04:42.760> at<00:04:43.060> minimum<00:04:43.480> pitch<00:04:43.690> we<00:04:43.840> have<00:04:43.960> a

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
the middle at minimum pitch we have a

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.990 
the middle at minimum pitch we have a
gap<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:44.830> way<00:04:44.950> we<00:04:45.100> get<00:04:45.220> rid<00:04:45.280> of<00:04:45.430> this<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:45.850> we

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
gap the way we get rid of this is we

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.730 
gap the way we get rid of this is we
need<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.270> adjust<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.990> end<00:04:47.200> points<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.830> the

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
need to adjust the end points of the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.250 
need to adjust the end points of the
corresponding<00:04:50.740> servo<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:52.540> I'll<00:04:52.690> go<00:04:52.840> ahead<00:04:52.960> and

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
corresponding servo so I'll go ahead and

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.470 
corresponding servo so I'll go ahead and
I'll<00:04:53.320> adjust<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.680> end<00:04:53.889> point<00:04:54.130> you<00:04:55.120> can<00:04:55.240> see

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
I'll adjust the end point you can see

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.180 
I'll adjust the end point you can see
wrong<00:04:56.229> way<00:04:56.440> I'm<00:04:57.130> adjusting<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.669> end<00:04:57.760> point<00:04:57.970> so

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
wrong way I'm adjusting the end point so

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.650 
wrong way I'm adjusting the end point so
we<00:05:00.190> have<00:05:00.400> no<00:05:00.610> gap<00:05:01.620> beautiful<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:04.210> you<00:05:04.270> can<00:05:04.479> see

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
we have no gap beautiful so you can see

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.040 
we have no gap beautiful so you can see
from<00:05:04.900> 0<00:05:05.200> pitch<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.440> minimum<00:05:05.950> pitch<00:05:06.130> we<00:05:06.400> have<00:05:07.050> no

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
from 0 pitch to minimum pitch we have no

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.770 
from 0 pitch to minimum pitch we have no
interactions<00:05:09.000> now<00:05:10.000> I'll<00:05:10.150> go<00:05:10.270> ahead<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:10.690> all

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
interactions now I'll go ahead and all

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.040 
interactions now I'll go ahead and all
off<00:05:11.020> I'll<00:05:11.590> adjust<00:05:11.950> all<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.310> other<00:05:12.430> end<00:05:13.150> points

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
off I'll adjust all the other end points

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.409 
off I'll adjust all the other end points
so<00:05:14.710> that<00:05:14.919> the<00:05:15.100> swash<00:05:15.370> is<00:05:15.400> level<00:05:15.820> throughout

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
so that the swash is level throughout

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.700 
so that the swash is level throughout
and<00:05:16.600> tight<00:05:16.870> its<00:05:17.169> entire<00:05:17.560> range<00:05:19.500> okay

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
and tight its entire range okay

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.670 
and tight its entire range okay
I've<00:05:21.540> adjusted<00:05:22.540> all<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:22.960> end<00:05:23.200> points<00:05:23.500> so<00:05:23.530> that

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
I've adjusted all the end points so that

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.779 
I've adjusted all the end points so that
it's<00:05:24.160> level<00:05:24.400> at<00:05:24.729> both<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.090> top<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:26.430> bottom<00:05:27.430> so

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
it's level at both the top and bottom so

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.940 
it's level at both the top and bottom so
minimum<00:05:28.180> maximum<00:05:28.390> pitch<00:05:28.810> so<00:05:29.440> as<00:05:29.590> you<00:05:29.800> can<00:05:29.890> see

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
minimum maximum pitch so as you can see

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.040 
minimum maximum pitch so as you can see
now<00:05:30.310> there's<00:05:30.760> no<00:05:31.000> gaps<00:05:31.270> through<00:05:31.539> the<00:05:31.720> entire

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
now there's no gaps through the entire

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.340 
now there's no gaps through the entire
range<00:05:32.500> of<00:05:32.800> movement<00:05:33.640> and<00:05:33.850> as<00:05:34.750> you<00:05:34.870> can<00:05:34.990> see<00:05:35.050> the

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
range of movement and as you can see the

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.290 
range of movement and as you can see the
swash<00:05:35.620> is<00:05:35.830> traveling<00:05:36.310> up<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.550> down<00:05:36.669> perfectly

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
swash is traveling up and down perfectly

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.000 
swash is traveling up and down perfectly
smoothly<00:05:37.600> in<00:05:37.900> interaction<00:05:38.380> free<00:05:38.620> this<00:05:38.830> is

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
smoothly in interaction free this is

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.250 
smoothly in interaction free this is
what<00:05:39.160> you<00:05:39.310> want<00:05:39.520> so<00:05:40.419> this<00:05:40.630> is<00:05:40.750> how<00:05:40.870> you<00:05:40.930> set<00:05:41.229> up

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
what you want so this is how you set up

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.090 
what you want so this is how you set up
a<00:05:41.590> swash<00:05:41.979> plate<00:05:42.419> on<00:05:43.419> an<00:05:43.900> MS<00:05:44.110> Age<00:05:44.260> Protoss<00:05:44.770> with
