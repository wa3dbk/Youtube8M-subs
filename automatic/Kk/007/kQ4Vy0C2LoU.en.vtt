00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.730
 Today is a teacher who is familiar with anatomy 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.330
 today 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.370
 I would like to explain nutrition without hearing traders 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:19.360
 People who are pressed equally often ask if it is better to take some supplements 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:23.810
 But today is the most supplement among the levers 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:27.430
 I would like to describe the professional fees 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.430
 Han 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.140
 Then I want to live and explain to Pro 10 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.910
 With this clerk 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.960
 It is a form that has been converted to protein and English 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.440
 It is a protein that I have singled out in English 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.600
 If it is a recent product 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.239
 bca Contains glutamine might like contains but also of the amino acid 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.230
 It is a kind and is included in a part of protein 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:56.730
 In addition, there are many types such as those to which vitamins are added 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:02.100
 Also check it by looking at the ingredient list on the back 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.690
 It is said that it is better to drink this protein which is generally shared a lot today 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.409
 I will describe it 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.980
 Oh, from my point of view 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.600
 We do muscle training , but let's drink by all means 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.550
 By doing muscle training 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:22.130
 You will use more power than usual 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.610
 Contracting and relaxing muscles is a way to get units away in everyday life 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.050
 It is that tough real 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.640
 Repeating it will encourage interest rates and damage 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:35.580
 See you again 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.400
 Moving I think it a lot and can be seen if the person who had inosine to at club activities of high school junior high school 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.320
 I thought that prefecture would participate in the shooting 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.920
 It may be that the person who falls inside without absorption of the internal organs might come such 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.020
 Type too 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.230
 pro paint say is quickly reached and the length good you can become a nutrition 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.620
 I did a lot of muscle training 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:02:00.170
 If you don't take nutrition, the interest rate must be large 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:06.710
 Muscle training is a means to turn on the switch to build muscle from now on 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:09.880
 Moxibustion combination is still by such as this protein and meal for making the muscles from there there 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.880
 I think it will be 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:24.750
 In is attached to maybe go timing of protein I would like to 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:30.300
 Most is while you are still a muscle training I muscle training right after is advancing decomposition of the best muscle 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:33.720
 The Sodatsuko and user interest rates out a lot of growth hormone in together and end the muscle training from now 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:38.430
 I'm going to ring so this pro dao there 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.850
 Drive into power Make your muscles fatter and thicker 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.040
 I will 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:47.420
 Also 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:52.840
 Someone breaks down the muscles more easily for six hours between meals 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:58.330
 To increase's the muscles there and let's compete in roughly every three hours 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:01.209
 However, it is the one who is doing the usual work how to take such kind of meal quite 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.930
 I think it's difficult so if you can 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.069
 If you feel like eating for more than 6 hours , drink protein 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.069
 Please be ao breathing 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:18.230
 Then I will explain how to drink protein last 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:23.210
 Is it better to drink protein with milk 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:26.010
 Then you are asked if you should mix it with percent juice and drink it 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.659
 After all I think water is the most horrible 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.890
 Because I think that I will be taken into the body quickly by doing Mizue shake 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:37.780
 Also, if you need to go far from there 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.560
 I think that you should take it with other supplements etc. 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.640
 mother water 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.640
 Please remember this 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:52.140
 This time, I explained the proffes, which is a staple of supplements 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:57.260
 Bread is a pop and later protein 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.430
 You too please take the protein and make the muscle stronger than ever 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.870
 More than a little post-teacher 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.620
 Today was a nutrition course 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.620
