00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.030
 was recently approved third 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.250
 place in the contest of iss são paulo and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.290
 I'm here to talk a little today 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.870
 with you about the importance of 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.900
 course materials in my 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.980
 high capacity approval of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.689
 teachers 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.970
 together with a material aimed at 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.340
 public procurement procedures have made it 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.930
 a little more than two years and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.260
 excellent result 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.700
 for example the economy the teacher is to see 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.980
 oak is the face 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.930
 his didactic allied battery of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.120
 exercises at the end of each subject 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.390
 have made this discipline one of my 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.270
 strengths and general administration and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.860
 public health professor rodrigo rennó 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.440
 they are fantastic 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.090
 although the discipline is very broad it 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.059
 can focus on the main subjects 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.840
 of her doing that in any test 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.579
 you hit more than 80 percent already in 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.590
 afuá and public finances 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.229
 the teacher's outlined classes 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.150
 sérgio mendes and the hundreds of exercise 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.010
 in each of them make you 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.340
 learn this subject almost by 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.530
 osmosis in business law 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.049
 professor gabriel rabelo manages to focus 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.500
 the main subjects of the subject without 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.840
 extending further is important 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.119
 emphasize that exercises are 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.390
 to consolidate all this 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.240
 studied content so I used the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.369
 strategy in the following disciplines 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.799
 Portuguese Constitutional Law 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.930
 administrative and tax audit 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.659
 accounting and mathematics 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.590
 statistical analysis and rationale 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.990
 logical 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.360
 so if you want to prepare yourself 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.490
 objective way for public tenders 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 I recommend the use of materials 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.390
 course with discipline and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.409
 focus and the correct materials you too 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.409
 get its approval
