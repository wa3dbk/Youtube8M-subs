00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.290
 the battle for 3d televisions has burst out in full 11 10 days a new one 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.290
 Also along with this series the LP 650 it is a 3D television that is very different 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.679
 works than others 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.449
 the holiday with this, the 3d market finally falls 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.150
 not a good idea to play and the television will follow 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.910
 refresh rate are shared this 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.100
 the ancien rÃ©gime 200ex technology on board 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.790
 NRG suits the customer with our processing to adapt as much as you can 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.640
 everything set of course the contrast brightness of the shipping and the 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.660
 colors and stuff 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.660
 but also new technologies such as such a motion 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.609
 not that I want to get better from it 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.039
 TV characterized by very clean lines very high contrast that is it 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.039
 lies a little artificial image 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.210
 the sound, incidentally, is fairly follow 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.330
 who one 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.410
 the 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.880
 Mr. 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.670
 if you use cinema 3d technology one like me the technological 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.590
 If they come this is unlike other manufacturers who have an active one 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.070
 technology 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.970
 Thereby it does not use Steve the Knight who is constantly the best 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.320
 his left buttock then became the image of the population 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.300
 the passive system 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.630
 this is not a problem, but on the one hand the image becomes polarized on the left 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.750
 polarized with ex 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 and that creates the depth effect 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.010
 And it must be said the cinema 3D technology is a nonsense again 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.740
 you have a nice 3d printing the plans are comfortable and are not 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.740
 always on 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.820
 but the television assessment does not play that outside the internet 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.229
 every jury member so-called home of the word where you can easily get on very quickly 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.980
 can quickly access the internet in a well-organized manner 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.220
 for example, do you ever click through after or theo 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.299
 there will be a new overview 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.389
 he says 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.389
 I want to be able to be that program 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.089
 had a course 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:24.799
 if you deliver with the lp 650 4 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.939
 pretty sleek finished between mag television of course all 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.639
 functionalities on board 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.689
 and although a bit of an artificial bild but a better idea a display 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.149
 poet charles a nice time box experience 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.389
 extra advantage 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.439
 You get five 3D glasses and you can look with all your friends
