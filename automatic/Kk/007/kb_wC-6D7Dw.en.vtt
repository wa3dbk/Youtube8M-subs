alright a lot of people are doing this
through<00:00:30.210> their<00:00:30.510> router<00:00:31.230> even<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.610> firewall

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
through their router even the firewall

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.810 
through their router even the firewall
I'm<00:00:33.780> not<00:00:34.020> positive<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.829> that's<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.399> answer

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
I'm not positive that that's the answer

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.370 
I'm not positive that that's the answer
because<00:00:36.149> I've<00:00:36.390> actually<00:00:36.690> done<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
because I've actually done it with a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.900 
because I've actually done it with a
friend<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.739> mine<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.100> particular<00:00:38.460> friend

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
friend of mine this particular friend

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.880 
friend of mine this particular friend
right<00:00:39.090> here<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:40.700> it<00:00:41.700> hasn't<00:00:41.940> worked<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.410> was

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
right here and it hasn't worked so I was

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.150 
right here and it hasn't worked so I was
doing<00:00:44.160> some<00:00:44.399> research<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.129> I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
doing some research and this is what I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279 
doing some research and this is what I
found<00:00:47.430> out<00:00:47.750> there's<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.899> couple<00:00:49.110> different

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
found out there's a couple different

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.279 
found out there's a couple different
ways<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.980> first<00:00:50.010> way<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.870> most<00:00:52.079> logical

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
ways the first way and the most logical

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.319 
ways the first way and the most logical
would<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> right-click<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:53.670> game<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
would be to right-click on your game and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.590 
would be to right-click on your game and
repair<00:00:55.219> try<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.430> first<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.480> it

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
repair try that first just to see if it

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.930 
repair try that first just to see if it
works<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:57.960> anything<00:00:58.309> another<00:00:59.309> thing<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.820> would

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
works out anything another thing I would

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.200 
works out anything another thing I would
recommend<00:01:00.539> doing<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.859> start<00:01:02.730> go

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
recommend doing is going in to start go

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.620 
recommend doing is going in to start go

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
works like this if you were to run a

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.960 
works like this if you were to run a
trace<00:03:23.209> from<00:03:23.769> where<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:24.950> actually<00:03:25.160> live<00:03:25.610> to

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
trace from where you actually live to

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.339 
trace from where you actually live to
the<00:03:26.090> server<00:03:26.329> you're<00:03:26.540> actually<00:03:26.930> kinetic

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
the server you're actually kinetic

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.050 
the server you're actually kinetic
connecting<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.190> it<00:03:28.340> goes<00:03:28.519> through<00:03:28.760> all<00:03:28.910> these

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
connecting to it goes through all these

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.509 
connecting to it goes through all these
different<00:03:29.269> hubs<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.110> what<00:03:31.010> we<00:03:31.129> did<00:03:31.310> was<00:03:31.489> we

ran a trace on my friend and he was

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.379 
ran a trace on my friend and he was
connecting<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.889> server<00:03:34.100> but<00:03:35.030> when<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.269> was

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
connecting to the server but when it was

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.340 
connecting to the server but when it was
coming<00:03:35.569> back<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:35.959> him

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350
