00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.080 
phone this one is not quite the right
dimensions<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.530> doesn't<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.130> very

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
dimensions so it doesn't have the very

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.559 
dimensions so it doesn't have the very
top<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.479> its<00:02:06.630> black<00:02:07.849> so<00:02:08.849> if<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.239> take<00:02:09.420> one

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
top of its black so if you do take one

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.330 
top of its black so if you do take one
with<00:02:09.690> your<00:02:09.810> phone<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.739> keep<00:02:10.979> your
