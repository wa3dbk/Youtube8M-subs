00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello girls today I you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.830
 give an appointment for a step by step 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:16.890
 color gradations I recommend you 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:19.680
 strongly to do training for 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.990
 this break I will use the gel 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.570
 french white and imperial gel fuchsia 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.970
 I take the color on my brush 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.480
 the way I use the technique or a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.279
 hit rock 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620
 in fact I take a little bit of 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.440
 white color on one edge of my brush 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.570
 and a little pink color on our edge 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.800
 of my brush doing it like that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.300
 allows to spread the gel have degraded and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.070
 melt colors we do not hesitate to 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:57.840
 to pass and to return is really what 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:01:02.730
 created him degrade him do not forget to 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:07.100
 do your side game catalysis of minutes 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.100
 then I will spend a second layer 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.470
 always the same 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.390
 a little white on the edge of a what 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.210
 finally on the corner of a brush and then 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.280
 a little pink on the other side you 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.960
 do well degraded we pass we go back 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.340
 and if you want you can do it even 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.530
 even more degraded then in 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.310
 flipping your brush do you see 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.380
 will make pink white pink white and you 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.810
 do the same on the other side we see 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.990
 not our side well but here we go 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.970
 on the one hand we fall his game catalysis 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.729
 here we go via our backgrounds then 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.270
 we will turn his brush to do the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.430
 gradient on the other side we can do 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.759
 waves like a woodstock for good 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.350
 melt the degrade because on the other side 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.700
 I still turn my full jump 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.960
 the other side you do not see well there 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.270
 but it's blonde and really the ross 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.880
 technique to make a nice gradient 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.460
 it's really paris is ironed 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.670
 to pass and to pass passed 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.790
 really that will give me this gradient 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.930
 of colors we are looking for 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.239
 and again I find 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.239
 we can do a lot better 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.909
 then I will close my construction 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.760
 so you see that I always apply 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.849
 a thin layer and then I'm not going to 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.190
 place a big ball of gel on 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.690
 the apex and then I'm going slightly 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.819
 and lmh then you see I stay when 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.170
 even the biggest of the material is 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.129
 really all the way down 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:03.239
 the nail is barely frost on the edges 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:05.730
 really hardly we are formatting so 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.760
 here not a lot of picture it was a 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.879
 little construction when I use I 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.200
 will be a plastic when it's me 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.459
 itches to make nails but that 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:22.680
 I do not want to do both 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:25.379
 break in there I decided to try 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.410
 liners this will be the first time I 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.940
 wanted to see if it was to be f1 I 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.730
 I'm pretty happy because it's the 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.640
 case the traits are to his ends it's 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.910
 well pigmented I'm pretty happy 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.910
 result 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:52.790
 I apply a thin layer of gel my 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.620
 humor phase able to seal mestras and 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.350
 then bunge would apply a thin 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.400
 schiller layer for shine 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.720
 I like the finishes without residue 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.700
 so this one is nice because in 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.700
 the more she does not appear and the league 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.800
 when you apply your shot I so 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.959
 their not especially it's good around 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.230
 rhinestones so try not to do any 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.910
 big big packets angel must 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.739
 really try to go to the turn for 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.460
 it's rhinestones but be careful 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.380
 that it does not make you bumps I you 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.180
 thanks for watching my video you 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:34.600
 can you find me on youtube facebook 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.600
