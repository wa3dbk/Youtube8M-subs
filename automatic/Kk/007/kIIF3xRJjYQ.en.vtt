00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
to find something that was actually

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.200

difference between this build and the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.490 
like to do I like to come up with
something<00:02:34.760> that's<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.239> little<00:02:35.569> bit<00:02:35.930> different

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
something that's a little bit different

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.440 
something that's a little bit different
and<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:38.110> not<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.380> different<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:40.450> still

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
and this is not that different you still

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.910 
and this is not that different you still
play<00:02:41.630> like<00:02:41.840> Nautilus<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.590> do<00:02:42.709> less<00:02:42.890> damage

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
play like Nautilus you do less damage

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.199 
play like Nautilus you do less damage
with<00:02:43.370> abilities<00:02:43.819> than<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.030> would<00:02:44.180> otherwise

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
with abilities than you would otherwise

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.059 
with abilities than you would otherwise
but<00:02:45.019> you've<00:02:45.140> probably<00:02:45.350> got<00:02:45.590> more<00:02:45.620> health<00:02:45.980> than

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
but you've probably got more health than

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.640 
but you've probably got more health than
an<00:02:46.340> AP<00:02:46.610> health<00:02:46.940> bill<00:02:47.239> does<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:48.230> your<00:02:48.440> shield

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
an AP health bill does so your shield

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.509 
an AP health bill does so your shield
becomes<00:02:49.190> fantastic<00:02:50.739> saves<00:02:51.739> your<00:02:51.950> life<00:02:52.010> all

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
becomes fantastic saves your life all

becomes fantastic saves your life all
the<00:02:52.610> time<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.420> found<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.260> Nautilus<00:02:54.799> once<00:02:55.790> you

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
the time I found that Nautilus once you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.360 
the time I found that Nautilus once you
get<00:02:56.239> one<00:02:57.820> usually<00:02:58.820> two<00:02:59.060> but<00:02:59.269> one<00:02:59.630> is<00:03:00.370> probably

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
get one usually two but one is probably

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.699 
get one usually two but one is probably
good<00:03:01.640> enough<00:03:02.560> giant's<00:03:03.560> belt<00:03:03.739> item<00:03:05.320> you<00:03:06.320> stop

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
good enough giant's belt item you stop

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.620 
good enough giant's belt item you stop
being<00:03:07.130> able<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.760> die<00:03:08.890> don't<00:03:09.890> know<00:03:10.010> why<00:03:10.160> it<00:03:10.220> is

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
being able to die don't know why it is

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.660 
being able to die don't know why it is
iffy<00:03:11.709> kind<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.769> feels<00:03:12.980> like<00:03:13.100> you<00:03:13.220> get<00:03:13.400> more

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
iffy kind of feels like you get more

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.670 
iffy kind of feels like you get more
health<00:03:14.090> for<00:03:14.450> those<00:03:14.570> items<00:03:14.810> than<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.350> really

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
health for those items than you really

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.370 
health for those items than you really
bought<00:03:15.950> too<00:03:16.570> but

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.860 

yeah<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:22.310> just<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:22.850> stop<00:03:23.180> being<00:03:23.390> able<00:03:23.750> today

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
yeah you just you stop being able today

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.020 
yeah you just you stop being able today
once<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.350> get<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:25.040> Giants<00:03:25.580> belt<00:03:25.790> you

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
once you get that that Giants belt you

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.010 
once you get that that Giants belt you
can<00:03:26.920> start<00:03:27.920> doing<00:03:28.610> nautilus<00:03:29.390> things<00:03:29.660> but<00:03:29.930> you

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
can start doing nautilus things but you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.830 
can start doing nautilus things but you
got<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.170> be<00:03:30.290> really<00:03:30.560> careful<00:03:30.590> before<00:03:31.100> then<00:03:31.460> I

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
got to be really careful before then I

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.230 
got to be really careful before then I
played<00:03:32.840> this<00:03:32.990> building<00:03:33.410> top<00:03:33.620> lane<00:03:37.150> don't<00:03:38.150> know

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
played this building top lane don't know

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.100 
played this building top lane don't know
why<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:38.420> didn't<00:03:38.750> try<00:03:39.080> a<00:03:39.110> jungle<00:03:39.710> but<00:03:40.690> I'm<00:03:41.690> not

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
why I didn't try a jungle but I'm not

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.260 
why I didn't try a jungle but I'm not
familiar<00:03:42.410> with<00:03:42.890> nautilus<00:03:43.340> as<00:03:43.490> a<00:03:43.520> champion<00:03:43.820> and

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
familiar with nautilus as a champion and

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.170 
familiar with nautilus as a champion and
his<00:03:44.480> natural<00:03:45.050> armor<00:03:45.320> is<00:03:45.970> phenomenally<00:03:46.970> low

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
his natural armor is phenomenally low

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.460 
his natural armor is phenomenally low
like<00:03:49.270> timos<00:03:50.270> got<00:03:50.510> better<00:03:50.690> base<00:03:50.960> armor<00:03:51.320> than

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
like timos got better base armor than

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.590 
like timos got better base armor than
Nautilus<00:03:51.830> does<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:53.650> it's<00:03:54.650> really<00:03:55.190> it<00:03:56.180> wasn't

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
Nautilus does so it's really it wasn't

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.270 
Nautilus does so it's really it wasn't
something<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:56.960> was<00:03:57.050> willing<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.380> try<00:03:57.800> out<00:03:58.040> being

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
something I was willing to try out being

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.920 
something I was willing to try out being
new<00:03:58.580> to<00:03:58.610> nautilus<00:03:59.150> so<00:03:59.300> I<00:03:59.330> figured<00:03:59.660> I'd<00:03:59.750> take

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
new to nautilus so I figured I'd take

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.980 
new to nautilus so I figured I'd take
him<00:04:00.080> top<00:04:00.320> lane<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.480> some<00:04:02.480> people<00:04:02.780> seem<00:04:02.960> to

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
him top lane and some people seem to

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.560 
him top lane and some people seem to
think<00:04:03.140> I<00:04:03.410> should<00:04:03.560> be<00:04:03.680> jungling<00:04:04.130> others<00:04:05.090> people

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
think I should be jungling others people

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.680 
think I should be jungling others people
seem<00:04:06.320> to<00:04:06.350> think<00:04:06.500> that<00:04:07.030> tryndamere<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.270> wukong

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
seem to think that tryndamere and wukong

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.620 
seem to think that tryndamere and wukong
was<00:04:08.930> a<00:04:08.960> good<00:04:09.200> top<00:04:09.440> lane<00:04:09.710> and<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.910> tower<00:04:11.150> diving

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
was a good top lane and the tower diving

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.930 
was a good top lane and the tower diving
against<00:04:12.170> me<00:04:12.350> was<00:04:12.590> kind<00:04:12.890> of<00:04:12.980> clever<00:04:13.160> but<00:04:13.610> now<00:04:13.910> I

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
against me was kind of clever but now I

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.250 
against me was kind of clever but now I
stop<00:04:14.330> you<00:04:14.360> moving<00:04:14.810> so<00:04:15.050> I<00:04:15.080> won<00:04:15.410> that<00:04:15.560> round<00:04:17.260> it's

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
stop you moving so I won that round it's

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.900 
stop you moving so I won that round it's
kind<00:04:18.620> of<00:04:18.739> an<00:04:18.890> interesting<00:04:19.160> game<00:04:19.610> when

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
kind of an interesting game when

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.130 
kind of an interesting game when
tryndamere<00:04:20.540> is<00:04:20.720> feeding<00:04:21.290> a<00:04:21.700> low<00:04:22.700> armored<00:04:23.120> tank

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.850 

but<00:04:27.140> I<00:04:27.170> digress<00:04:28.780> there's<00:04:29.780> very<00:04:30.260> little<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.680> say

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
but I digress there's very little to say

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.100 
but I digress there's very little to say
about<00:04:30.890> this<00:04:31.220> building<00:04:31.490> other<00:04:31.910> than<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.750> works

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
about this building other than it works

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.530 
about this building other than it works
once<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:33.590> start<00:04:33.860> getting<00:04:33.980> health<00:04:34.340> but<00:04:35.180> most

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
once you start getting health but most

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.180 
once you start getting health but most
games<00:04:35.840> don't<00:04:36.140> go<00:04:36.320> long<00:04:36.620> enough<00:04:36.650> for<00:04:37.040> you<00:04:37.160> to

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
games don't go long enough for you to

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.010 
games don't go long enough for you to
start<00:04:37.490> getting<00:04:37.610> things<00:04:37.910> other<00:04:38.270> than<00:04:38.570> health

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
start getting things other than health

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.960 
start getting things other than health
those<00:04:39.560> three<00:04:39.980> items<00:04:40.010> are<00:04:40.550> very<00:04:40.850> expensive<00:04:41.210> and

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
those three items are very expensive and

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.840 
those three items are very expensive and
getting<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.900> rest<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.440> build<00:04:45.730> like<00:04:46.730> I

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
getting the rest of the build like I

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.290 
getting the rest of the build like I
didn't<00:04:47.210> even<00:04:47.300> have<00:04:47.600> time<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.020> figure<00:04:48.740> out<00:04:49.300> what

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
didn't even have time to figure out what

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.830 
didn't even have time to figure out what
I<00:04:50.650> would<00:04:51.650> want<00:04:51.920> to<00:04:52.190> get<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.640> looked<00:04:53.000> at<00:04:53.210> attack

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
I would want to get I looked at attack

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.930 
I would want to get I looked at attack
speed<00:04:54.040> like<00:04:55.040> Triforce<00:04:56.830> yeah<00:04:57.830> it<00:04:58.730> wasn't

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
speed like Triforce yeah it wasn't

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.800 
speed like Triforce yeah it wasn't
highly<00:04:59.390> effective<00:05:00.490> I'd<00:05:01.490> still<00:05:02.030> look<00:05:02.330> at<00:05:02.510> a<00:05:02.570> tax

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
highly effective I'd still look at a tax
