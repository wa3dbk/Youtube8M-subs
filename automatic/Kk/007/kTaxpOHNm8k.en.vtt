a lot of people out
rotation<00:02:15.370> which<00:02:15.550> is

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
rotation which is

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.100 
rotation which is
reverse<00:02:17.650> rotation<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.150> in<00:02:19.330> almost<00:02:19.690> every

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
reverse rotation and in almost every

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.800 
reverse rotation and in almost every

top<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.480> good<00:02:26.810> spread<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.470> door<00:02:27.680> or

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
top like a good spread the door or

top like a good spread the door or
fertilize<00:02:29.060> out<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.870> want<00:02:30.080> all<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.470> debris

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
fertilize out you want all the debris

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.650 
fertilize out you want all the debris
that's<00:02:31.100> own<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.970> go<00:02:32.120> down<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:35.330> as<00:02:35.480> you

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
that's own to go down and as you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.120 
that's own to go down and as you
can<00:02:35.870> see<00:02:36.110> this<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.470> going<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.740> make<00:02:36.920> some

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
can see this is going to make some

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.670 
can see this is going to make some
really<00:02:37.430> good<00:02:37.610> planning<00:02:38.300> after<00:02:38.990> this<00:02:39.500> is

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
really good planning after this is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.830 
really good planning after this is
tilled<00:02:40.010> because<00:02:40.520> we<00:02:40.730> plowed<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.750> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
tilled because we plowed this in the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.590 
tilled because we plowed this in the
fall<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.440> let<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.710> freeze<00:02:43.040> all<00:02:43.400> year<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.480> it

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
fall and let it freeze all year so it

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.810 
fall and let it freeze all year so it
just<00:02:44.840> kind<00:02:45.050> of<00:02:45.140> melts<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:45.830> red<00:02:46.130> clay<00:02:46.490> which

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
just kind of melts this red clay which

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.610 
just kind of melts this red clay which
is<00:02:46.850> usually<00:02:47.450> hard<00:02:47.690> as<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.960> rock

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
is usually hard as a rock

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.740 
is usually hard as a rock
and<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.430> will<00:02:49.580> be<00:02:49.820> hard<00:02:50.090> up<00:02:50.300> there<00:02:50.510> at<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.690> end

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
and it will be hard up there at the end

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.590 
and it will be hard up there at the end
where<00:02:51.200> we<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.560> plowed<00:02:51.860> right<00:02:52.270> about<00:02:53.270> there

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
where we just plowed right about there

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.390 
where we just plowed right about there
where<00:02:53.840> where<00:02:54.200> peanut<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.190> fur

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
where where peanut is so this is the fur

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.790 
where where peanut is so this is the fur
it's<00:02:58.760> kind<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.180> double<00:02:59.810> ditch<00:03:00.050> right<00:03:00.080> here

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
it's kind of a double ditch right here

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.470 
it's kind of a double ditch right here
this<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.040> where<00:03:01.430> peanut<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.000> came<00:03:02.300> over

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
this is where peanut and I came over

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.200 
this is where peanut and I came over
here<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.780> couple<00:03:02.810> weeks<00:03:03.320> ago<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:04.010> try<00:03:04.670> out<00:03:04.940> the

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
here a couple weeks ago to try out the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.150 
here a couple weeks ago to try out the
new<00:03:05.390> mow<00:03:05.630> board<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.200> we<00:03:06.320> had<00:03:06.530> built<00:03:06.830> for<00:03:06.920> our

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
new mow board that we had built for our

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.210 
new mow board that we had built for our
compact<00:03:07.820> plow<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.110> just<00:03:09.320> ended<00:03:09.680> up<00:03:09.890> this

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
compact plow and it just ended up this

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.360 
compact plow and it just ended up this
is<00:03:10.460> solid<00:03:10.760> sod<00:03:11.360> underneath<00:03:12.080> here<00:03:12.470> it's<00:03:12.680> twice

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
is solid sod underneath here it's twice

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.120 
is solid sod underneath here it's twice
as<00:03:13.670> high<00:03:13.850> as<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.180> normally<00:03:14.420> would<00:03:14.750> be<00:03:14.990> so<00:03:15.950> on

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
as high as it normally would be so on

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.760 
as high as it normally would be so on
the<00:03:16.280> first<00:03:16.550> pass<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:17.210> the<00:03:17.300> tiller<00:03:17.630> we're<00:03:18.530> going

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
the first pass of the tiller we're going

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.550 
the first pass of the tiller we're going
to<00:03:18.830> see<00:03:19.210> just<00:03:20.210> what<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.570> does<00:03:20.810> with<00:03:21.140> it<00:03:21.410> because

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
to see just what it does with it because

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.650 
to see just what it does with it because
this<00:03:21.920> is<00:03:22.100> more<00:03:22.400> than<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:22.760> would<00:03:22.910> normally<00:03:23.150> be

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
this is more than you would normally be

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.140 
this is more than you would normally be
doing<00:03:24.050> before<00:03:24.830> this<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.190> over<00:03:25.580> at<00:03:25.700> least<00:03:25.880> on

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
doing before this is over at least on

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.910 
doing before this is over at least on
the<00:03:26.270> second<00:03:26.690> pass<00:03:26.900> you'll<00:03:27.260> never<00:03:27.500> know<00:03:27.709> this

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
the second pass you'll never know this

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.190 
the second pass you'll never know this
was<00:03:28.160> here<00:03:28.610> but<00:03:29.060> we'll<00:03:29.239> see<00:03:29.420> what<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:29.750> does<00:03:29.930> in

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
was here but we'll see what it does in

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.400 
was here but we'll see what it does in
just<00:03:30.320> one<00:03:30.620> pass<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.190> keep<00:03:31.370> going<00:03:31.550> from<00:03:31.850> there

that<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.420> bobcat<00:04:23.110> 450<00:04:24.070> by<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.310> way<00:04:24.610> that's

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
that is a bobcat 450 by the way that's

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.030 
that is a bobcat 450 by the way that's
their<00:04:25.120> largest<00:04:25.540> model<00:04:25.990> at<00:04:26.290> this<00:04:26.470> time<00:04:26.770> in<00:04:26.980> a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
their largest model at this time in a

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.580 
their largest model at this time in a
compact<00:04:27.550> tractor<00:04:28.060> so<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.720> good<00:04:28.900> thing<00:04:28.930> is<00:04:29.350> the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
compact tractor so the good thing is the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.920 
compact tractor so the good thing is the
more<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:30.100> do<00:04:30.430> your<00:04:30.760> plowing<00:04:31.420> and<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.690> more

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
more you do your plowing and the more

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.230 
more you do your plowing and the more
it's<00:04:32.080> been<00:04:32.350> tilled<00:04:32.680> and<00:04:32.980> you<00:04:33.610> stay<00:04:33.880> with<00:04:34.090> the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
it's been tilled and you stay with the

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.330 
it's been tilled and you stay with the
same<00:04:34.450> gardening<00:04:35.080> spot<00:04:35.440> it<00:04:35.800> just<00:04:35.860> keeps

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
same gardening spot it just keeps

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.190 
same gardening spot it just keeps
getting<00:04:36.580> better<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.120> better<00:04:37.420> as<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:37.840> keep

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
getting better and better as you keep

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.050 
getting better and better as you keep
turning<00:04:38.440> under<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:39.100> crops<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.610> you<00:04:39.760> had

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
turning under the crops that you had

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.440 
turning under the crops that you had
from<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.420> year<00:04:40.630> before<00:04:40.810> and<00:04:41.380> it's<00:04:41.890> decaying

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
from the year before and it's decaying

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.730 
from the year before and it's decaying
your<00:04:43.450> ground<00:04:43.750> just<00:04:44.020> keeps<00:04:44.260> getting<00:04:44.590> better

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
your ground just keeps getting better

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.640 
your ground just keeps getting better
and<00:04:44.980> better<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:45.670> this<00:04:46.120> old<00:04:46.360> red<00:04:46.570> clay<00:04:46.870> grows<00:04:47.290> a

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
and better and this old red clay grows a

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.570 
and better and this old red clay grows a
garden<00:04:48.220> about<00:04:48.310> as<00:04:48.610> good<00:04:48.790> as<00:04:48.970> anything<00:04:49.480> I<00:04:49.630> know

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
garden about as good as anything I know

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.860 
garden about as good as anything I know
it's<00:04:51.580> going<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:51.820> get<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.000> little<00:04:52.270> tougher<00:04:52.720> up

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
it's going to get a little tougher up

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.750 
it's going to get a little tougher up
here<00:04:53.170> in<00:04:53.260> this<00:04:53.350> new<00:04:53.620> area<00:04:53.890> that's<00:04:54.280> just<00:04:54.520> been

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
here in this new area that's just been

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:11.700 
here in this new area that's just been
plowed

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:27.440 

[Music]

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.200 

so<00:05:27.990> just<00:05:28.260> after<00:05:28.470> one<00:05:28.830> pass<00:05:29.100> of<00:05:29.490> this<00:05:29.670> red<00:05:29.910> clay

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
so just after one pass of this red clay

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.360 
so just after one pass of this red clay
you<00:05:30.270> can<00:05:30.630> see<00:05:30.840> how<00:05:31.020> easy<00:05:31.380> this<00:05:31.740> is<00:05:31.980> going<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.250> be

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
you can see how easy this is going to be

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.150 
you can see how easy this is going to be
the<00:05:32.460> plant<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:33.170> heal<00:05:34.170> and<00:05:34.440> so<00:05:34.620> forth<00:05:34.920> so<00:05:35.100> if

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
the plant and heal and so forth so if

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.460 
the plant and heal and so forth so if
you<00:05:35.310> have<00:05:35.490> to<00:05:35.670> use<00:05:35.820> a<00:05:35.850> garden<00:05:36.390> hoe<00:05:36.570> it's<00:05:37.230> not

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
you have to use a garden hoe it's not

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.290 
you have to use a garden hoe it's not
going<00:05:37.650> to<00:05:37.710> be<00:05:37.830> too<00:05:38.040> bad<00:05:38.220> to<00:05:38.280> make<00:05:38.670> a<00:05:38.700> heal<00:05:39.030> but

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
going to be too bad to make a heal but

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.270 
going to be too bad to make a heal but
we're<00:05:39.510> going<00:05:39.630> to<00:05:39.690> use<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:39.840> garden<00:05:40.230> batter<00:05:40.620> and

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
we're going to use a garden batter and

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.160 
we're going to use a garden batter and
show<00:05:41.490> you<00:05:41.550> some<00:05:41.850> really<00:05:42.180> pretty<00:05:42.360> rows<00:05:42.690> here<00:05:43.020> in

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
show you some really pretty rows here in

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.280 
show you some really pretty rows here in
just<00:05:43.320> a<00:05:43.470> little<00:05:43.500> bit<00:05:44.030> now<00:05:45.030> if<00:05:45.210> I<00:05:45.480> put<00:05:45.870> a<00:05:45.900> lot<00:05:46.140> of

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
just a little bit now if I put a lot of

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.320 
just a little bit now if I put a lot of
manure<00:05:46.620> or<00:05:46.860> something<00:05:47.340> out<00:05:47.520> on<00:05:47.700> top<00:05:47.940> of<00:05:48.210> this

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
manure or something out on top of this

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.600 
manure or something out on top of this
or<00:05:48.570> fertilizer<00:05:49.110> before<00:05:49.710> we<00:05:49.860> were<00:05:50.010> dealing<00:05:50.280> it

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
or fertilizer before we were dealing it

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.730 
or fertilizer before we were dealing it
I<00:05:50.790> probably<00:05:51.420> would<00:05:51.840> have<00:05:51.870> plowed<00:05:52.200> it<00:05:52.440> again

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
I probably would have plowed it again

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.830 
I probably would have plowed it again
just<00:05:53.010> to<00:05:53.130> turn<00:05:53.370> it<00:05:53.550> completely<00:05:53.700> upside<00:05:54.120> down

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
just to turn it completely upside down

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.440 
just to turn it completely upside down
and<00:05:55.110> under<00:05:55.500> so<00:05:56.220> with<00:05:56.430> all<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.760> new<00:05:56.880> compact

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
and under so with all the new compact

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.910 
and under so with all the new compact
tractors<00:05:57.990> getting<00:05:58.380> more<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:58.800> more

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
tractors getting more and more

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.490 
tractors getting more and more
horsepower<00:05:59.670> and<00:06:00.090> the<00:06:00.660> tractors<00:06:01.140> getting

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
horsepower and the tractors getting

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.490 
horsepower and the tractors getting
smaller<00:06:01.920> then<00:06:02.880> we're<00:06:03.570> just<00:06:03.600> now<00:06:04.050> -<00:06:04.110> we're

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
smaller then we're just now - we're

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.860 
smaller then we're just now - we're
almost<00:06:04.770> every<00:06:05.430> compact<00:06:05.970> tractor<00:06:06.510> can<00:06:06.750> at

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
almost every compact tractor can at

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.930 
almost every compact tractor can at
least<00:06:07.080> pull<00:06:07.530> out<00:06:07.740> its<00:06:07.980> full<00:06:08.220> width<00:06:08.550> and

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
least pull out its full width and

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.480 
least pull out its full width and
offsetting<00:06:09.930> a<00:06:10.170> tiller<00:06:10.440> is<00:06:10.710> becoming<00:06:11.250> less<00:06:11.460> and

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
offsetting a tiller is becoming less and

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.520 
offsetting a tiller is becoming less and
less<00:06:11.760> important<00:06:12.570> because<00:06:12.720> if<00:06:13.020> you<00:06:13.140> can<00:06:13.320> pull

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
less important because if you can pull

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.130 
less important because if you can pull
out<00:06:13.740> your<00:06:13.770> full<00:06:14.280> trip<00:06:14.640> out<00:06:14.940> then<00:06:15.660> there's<00:06:15.930> no

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
out your full trip out then there's no

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.810 
out your full trip out then there's no
reason<00:06:16.590> at<00:06:16.710> all<00:06:16.830> need<00:06:17.340> to<00:06:17.550> offset<00:06:17.720> utility<00:06:19.820> so

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
reason at all need to offset utility so

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.220 
reason at all need to offset utility so
it<00:06:20.910> looks<00:06:21.120> like<00:06:21.300> we're<00:06:21.450> just<00:06:21.600> one<00:06:21.810> more<00:06:21.960> pass

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
it looks like we're just one more pass

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.320 
it looks like we're just one more pass
that<00:06:22.680> means<00:06:22.890> we've<00:06:23.100> made<00:06:23.340> about<00:06:23.640> a<00:06:23.700> total<00:06:24.240> of

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
that means we've made about a total of

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.080 
that means we've made about a total of
six<00:06:24.600> passes<00:06:25.170> there<00:06:25.530> one<00:06:26.310> more<00:06:26.490> pass<00:06:26.760> we'll

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
six passes there one more pass we'll

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.480 
six passes there one more pass we'll
have<00:06:27.210> the<00:06:27.360> garden<00:06:27.690> completely<00:06:28.320> done<00:06:28.560> and<00:06:28.950> then

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
have the garden completely done and then

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.580 
have the garden completely done and then
we'll<00:06:29.610> go<00:06:29.850> back<00:06:30.090> over<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.750> side<00:06:30.990> over<00:06:31.230> on<00:06:31.470> the

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
we'll go back over the side over on the

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.380 
we'll go back over the side over on the
left<00:06:31.860> it's<00:06:32.160> a<00:06:32.250> little<00:06:32.490> extra<00:06:32.640> high<00:06:33.060> we're

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
left it's a little extra high we're

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.130 
left it's a little extra high we're
peanut<00:06:33.780> nitride<00:06:34.320> out<00:06:34.500> our<00:06:34.680> new<00:06:34.830> compact<00:06:35.340> plow

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:50.450 
peanut nitride out our new compact plow
and<00:06:37.140> squaring<00:06:37.800> up<00:06:38.010> all<00:06:38.220> the<00:06:38.400> edges

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.430 

you<00:06:51.060> can<00:06:51.180> get<00:06:51.300> a<00:06:51.330> good<00:06:51.509> idea<00:06:51.569> where<00:06:52.229> it's<00:06:52.350> a

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
you can get a good idea where it's a

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.290 
you can get a good idea where it's a
little<00:06:52.710> chunkier<00:06:53.250> that's<00:06:53.490> just<00:06:53.759> been<00:06:53.970> plowed

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
little chunkier that's just been plowed

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.360 
little chunkier that's just been plowed
and<00:06:54.720> that's<00:06:55.259> why<00:06:55.470> I<00:06:55.500> say<00:06:55.800> if<00:06:55.860> it<00:06:56.069> was<00:06:56.190> all

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
and that's why I say if it was all

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.400 
and that's why I say if it was all
plowed<00:06:56.759> area<00:06:57.270> I<00:06:57.330> probably<00:06:57.810> would<00:06:58.139> have<00:06:58.229> gone

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
plowed area I probably would have gone

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.980 
plowed area I probably would have gone
over<00:06:58.470> it<00:06:58.860> twice<00:06:59.190> because<00:06:59.940> as<00:07:00.389> you<00:07:00.539> can<00:07:00.720> see

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
over it twice because as you can see

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.409 
over it twice because as you can see
with<00:07:01.889> these<00:07:02.099> hard<00:07:02.400> chunks<00:07:02.729> there's<00:07:03.180> still

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 
with these hard chunks there's still

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.480 
with these hard chunks there's still
some<00:07:03.720> good<00:07:03.870> hunks<00:07:04.319> of<00:07:04.440> clay<00:07:04.710> in<00:07:04.979> here<00:07:05.310> that<00:07:05.460> I

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
some good hunks of clay in here that I

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.300 
some good hunks of clay in here that I
would<00:07:05.819> want<00:07:06.120> to<00:07:06.210> be<00:07:06.449> smaller<00:07:06.780> if<00:07:07.740> that's<00:07:08.099> all

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
would want to be smaller if that's all

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.050 
would want to be smaller if that's all
