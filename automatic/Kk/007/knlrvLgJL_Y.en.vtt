00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:12.540
 good afternoon friends with you top of i 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.480
 I will update the database ; 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.310
 tournament maximum weight and now we 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.619
 let's try to play a tournament with you 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.650
 maximum weight but not enough gear 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.449
 flimsy for such a tournament 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.439
 that is, I have a little bit more than a ton 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.050
 not power but in my opinion here 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.630
 four catch applicants to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.600
 win the tournament the maximum weight is 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.290
 carharodon great white shark fish moon 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:46.129
 6 gill shark and, in general, beluga 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.469
 when I did a fishing trip, I saw these locations 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.390
 that means all the goals we are still fishing with you 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.289
 did not but exactly here is located 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.360
 carharodon 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.820
 it is here that is in general 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.829
 moon fish tournaments maximum weight and 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:09.890
 with you we will catch on such a location as 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.890
 sicily well such fish as karharodon 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.090
 it means you need to catch it 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.690
 there are sharks all peck at us for your meat 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.580
 on strengthen carharodon and catch him 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.370
 can be in the water floor or from the surface 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.540
 let's hope the water floor also he spits 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.630
 on squid and fish the moon, too, we bite 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.830
 on squid means you can feed 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.620
 our carcharodon and meat is ground blood 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.970
 add here the nozzle croaked meat 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.880
 add it will activate well 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.190
 let's make you a lure 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.400
 cook here let 's root 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.500
 float well here I think so somewhere 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.360
 in the region of 400 kilograms and will be with us 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.119
 some opportunity to declare prizes 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.479
 But in general it is of course on the form 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:08.390
 scant information about such a database as 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.369
 Italy Great Britain has not looked well 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.700
 either you in general is rather poor 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.720
 information to the full line and forget 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.550
 about food here bite you 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.350
 good bite weight good friends well 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.200
 although in principle with sharks hard 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.100
 determine weight but judging because of yourself 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.239
 leads the rod to 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.120
 we have here and here 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:39.830
 but this is something small pecked let's 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:44.330
 let's see what we pecked there is well 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.930
 as you can see, yes, very crumbly active 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.709
 she is with you so we look right to us 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.709
 but Krasnoperov era of Apollo in the Crimea 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.709
 OK 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.349
 the shark here is full of all sorts of different 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.319
 that's a good move when we just 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:10.829
 throw fishing rods they cost fish 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.829
 every bite calms down again 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.830
 you see how gorgeous it works 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.720
 prikorm and prikorm works well very 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:26.300
 all a pendant collected this lure 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:30.440
 rainbow mackerel from all over the sea 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.100
 us right in the meantime with one weight we 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.320
 coped 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.680
 well here's to charades four sixty 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:41.240
 kilogram I think so we have with you 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:45.290
 application for prizes in the first place we can 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:52.460
 yourself count on the second just now 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:57.500
 2 there we have a pity that we have with you 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:59.120
 there was a gathering at this fish and at the hour 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.800
 spinning trick we can now 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.750
 get with you on the fine on the capital 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.820
 because just the time the fine comes 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.330
 and penalized every hour as you remember 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.690
 we kind of go through I shot for 10 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.250
 minutes of the first 10 minutes really got 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:22.490
 penalty for any violation of prohibitions and 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:26.900
 so the trick is probably spinning with it 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.000
 Now, as you can see, evening 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.050
 dawn we had a fruitful morning 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.050
 charging 1 so 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.800
 now as soon as it is exactly nine 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.090
 hours I myself lived runner base 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.990
 maybe save me from stanzas 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.979
 I managed to play 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:53.840
 tournament maximum weight closed received 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:58.370
 its put 334 thousand experience points 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.550
 gave me a spinning gave me a ticket and him 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.740
 we did not hit you on a fine to 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.260
 actually everything I keep updating 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.110
 base and so we'll see you soon 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.729
