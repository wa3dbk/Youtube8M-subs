this video is just gonna be about some
basically<00:00:17.369> on<00:00:17.539> installation<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.930> these<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
basically on installation of these and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.500 
basically on installation of these and
everything<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.090> get<00:00:21.210> started

everything like that so it's get started

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.300 
everything like that so it's get started
let's<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:21.930> start<00:00:22.050> unboxing<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.890> friend

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
let's first start unboxing the friend

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.040 
let's first start unboxing the friend
chamber<00:00:23.820> links<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:24.930> is

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
chamber links so all you have to do is

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.170 
chamber links so all you have to do is
just<00:00:25.230> peel<00:00:25.410> back<00:00:25.470> packaging<00:00:26.130> already<00:00:27.029> done

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
just peel back packaging already done

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.220 
just peel back packaging already done
this<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.439> see<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.160> get

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
this and what you see is you get

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.910 
this and what you see is you get
instructions<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.470> how<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.740> install<00:00:32.309> them<00:00:32.700> and

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
instructions on how to install them and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.170 
instructions on how to install them and
if<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:36.260> just<00:00:37.260> some<00:00:37.410> extra<00:00:37.710> foam<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.969> there

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
if you just some extra foam and there

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.639 
if you just some extra foam and there
they<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:41.219> front<00:00:41.760> Chamberlain's<00:00:45.649> so

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
they are the front Chamberlain's so

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.810 
they are the front Chamberlain's so
let's<00:00:46.800> get<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> installing<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:47.550> first

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
let's get to installing these first

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.069 
let's get to installing these first
thing<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.270> remove<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> tires<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.960> both

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
thing to do is remove the tires on both

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.279 
thing to do is remove the tires on both
sides<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:50.820> at<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.480> caster

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
sides so then we can get at the caster

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.139 
sides so then we can get at the caster
blocks<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:52.949> hold<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> screws<00:00:53.699> feel<00:00:53.910> so

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
blocks which hold in the screws feel so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.479 
blocks which hold in the screws feel so
the<00:00:54.300> screws<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.750> been<00:00:54.809> removed<00:00:55.129> or<00:00:56.129> both

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the screws have been removed or both

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
the screws have been removed or both
tires<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.940> guess<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.390> now<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.440> do

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
tires I guess and now what we have to do

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.950 
tires I guess and now what we have to do
is<00:00:58.829> undo<00:00:59.219> those<00:00:59.399> two<00:00:59.760> screws<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.480> either<00:01:00.629> side

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
is undo those two screws on either side

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.740 
is undo those two screws on either side
those<00:01:01.859> screws<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.340> been<00:01:02.399> removed<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:03.539> you

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
those screws have been removed as you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.070 
those screws have been removed as you
can<00:01:03.960> tell<00:01:04.170> now<00:01:04.949> next<00:01:05.760> step<00:01:05.909> would<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> just

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
can tell now next step would be to just

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.320 
can tell now next step would be to just
remove<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:07.830> screw<00:01:08.189> down<00:01:08.340> there<00:01:08.610> however

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
remove the one screw down there however

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.250 
remove the one screw down there however
the<00:01:10.229> top<00:01:10.560> place<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.640> told<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.630> servo<00:01:13.020> is

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the top place here told the servo is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.140 
the top place here told the servo is
blocking<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> way<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.060> we

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
blocking the way so we have to do is we

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.330 
blocking the way so we have to do is we
have<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.270> take<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> servo<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.439> unscrew

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
have to take out the servo and unscrew

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.760 
have to take out the servo and unscrew
this<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.180> completely<00:01:19.080> move<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.380> completely

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
this and completely move it completely

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.800 
this and completely move it completely
so<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.820> reach<00:01:20.970> these<00:01:21.210> screws<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.750> attach

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so we can reach these screws that attach

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.359 
so we can reach these screws that attach
the<00:01:22.229> front<00:01:22.380> roller<00:01:22.619> screws<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.130> been

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the front roller screws have been

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.109 
the front roller screws have been
removed

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
removed

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090 
removed
now<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.390> need<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.409> need<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> undo<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
now we need to do is we need to undo the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.780 
now we need to do is we need to undo the
nut<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:27.119> either<00:01:27.330> side<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.670> move

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
nut on either side here so you can move

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.730 
nut on either side here so you can move
the<00:01:29.939> servo<00:01:30.119> completely<00:01:30.689> off<00:01:30.780> those<00:01:30.990> screws<00:01:31.320> or

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the servo completely off those screws or

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.249 
the servo completely off those screws or
nuts<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.820> been<00:01:32.850> roof<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.869> remove

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
nuts have been roof so now we can remove

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.539 
nuts have been roof so now we can remove
the<00:01:34.409> servo<00:01:36.200> now<00:01:37.200> however<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.100> need<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the servo now however we do need to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.149 
the servo now however we do need to
remove<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.810> bottom<00:01:39.960> two<00:01:40.320> bottom<00:01:40.979> three

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
will have to adjust the size according

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.190 
will have to adjust the size according
to<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.070> chart<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.329> they<00:02:03.509> give<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.810> inside

to the chart that they give you inside

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.719 
to the chart that they give you inside
the<00:02:04.320> packaging<00:02:04.770> for<00:02:04.979> example<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.549> right

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the packaging for example the right

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.770 
the packaging for example the right
chamber<00:02:06.240> link

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
chamber link

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.969 
chamber link
as<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.979> tell<00:02:08.929> this<00:02:09.929> one's<00:02:10.229> too<00:02:10.410> big<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.950> we

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
as you can tell this one's too big so we

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.580 
as you can tell this one's too big so we
have<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.490> adjust<00:02:11.930> little<00:02:12.930> black<00:02:13.140> pieces

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
have to just adjust little black pieces

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.020 
have to just adjust little black pieces
on<00:02:13.740> here<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.250> move<00:02:14.370> them<00:02:14.490> closer<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
on here just to move them closer to the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.480 
on here just to move them closer to the
middle<00:02:15.500> just<00:02:16.500> decide<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:17.100> have<00:02:17.280> been

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
middle just decide that we have been

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.250 
middle just decide that we have been
installed<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.209> think<00:02:18.480> they<00:02:18.660> look<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.990> lot

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
installed and I think they look a lot

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.100 
installed and I think they look a lot
better<00:02:21.050> than<00:02:22.050> these<00:02:23.690> now<00:02:24.690> it's<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:24.870> time<00:02:25.080> to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
better than these now it's just time to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.390 
better than these now it's just time to
do<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.380> reverse<00:02:25.650> process<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.280> put

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
do the reverse process and put

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.590 
do the reverse process and put
everything<00:02:26.610> back<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:26.970> other<00:02:27.120> things<00:02:27.390> put

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
everything back to the other things put

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.800 
everything back to the other things put
back<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.100> open<00:02:29.370> up<00:02:29.459> these<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.239> put

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
back on you can open up these and put

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.170 
back on you can open up these and put
them<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.110> new<00:02:31.230> tires<00:02:31.489> look<00:02:32.489> very<00:02:32.819> similar

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
them on the new tires look very similar

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.059 
them on the new tires look very similar
and<00:02:33.450> at<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.690> top<00:02:33.870> they<00:02:34.050> are<00:02:34.080> however<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.920> main

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
and at the top they are however the main

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.309 
and at the top they are however the main
difference<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.610> when<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.819> turn<00:02:36.060> them<00:02:36.180> around

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
difference is when you turn them around

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.259 
difference is when you turn them around
you<00:02:37.319> turn<00:02:37.500> around<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.830> stock<00:02:38.040> ones<00:02:38.310> they<00:02:39.030> have

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
you turn around the stock ones they have

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.930 
you turn around the stock ones they have
a<00:02:39.709> relatively<00:02:40.709> small<00:02:41.269> tread<00:02:42.269> or<00:02:43.940> threating

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
a relatively small tread or threating

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.820 
a relatively small tread or threating
around<00:02:45.209> them<00:02:45.360> but<00:02:45.630> whereas<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.350> turn<00:02:46.560> around

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
around them but whereas you turn around

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.949 
around them but whereas you turn around
the<00:02:46.950> blue<00:02:47.190> ones<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.330> notice<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.989> lot<00:02:49.680> bigger

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
the blue ones you notice a lot bigger

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.520 
the blue ones you notice a lot bigger
stronger<00:02:52.430> tread<00:02:53.430> sort<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.569> um<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.500> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
stronger tread sort of so um the the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.430 
stronger tread sort of so um the the
blue<00:02:56.100> ones<00:02:56.310> will<00:02:56.489> help<00:02:56.670> with<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.350> slipping<00:02:58.350> of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
blue ones will help with the slipping of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.780 
blue ones will help with the slipping of
the<00:02:58.530> tire<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.069> they<00:02:59.220> want<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.459> slip

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
the tire so that they want to slip

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.320 
the tire so that they want to slip
anymore

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
anymore

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.840 
anymore
and<00:03:00.470> yeah<00:03:01.470> just<00:03:01.709> because<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.430> tread<00:03:02.700> on

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
and yeah just because of the tread on

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.780 
and yeah just because of the tread on
the<00:03:02.940> inside<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:04.069> think<00:03:05.069> they<00:03:05.310> look<00:03:05.400> pretty<00:03:05.430> good

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
the inside I think they look pretty good

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.210 
the inside I think they look pretty good
these<00:03:06.030> should<00:03:06.209> help<00:03:06.360> with<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.260> don't<00:03:08.040> know

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
these should help with the I don't know

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.350 
these should help with the I don't know
I<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:08.370> hope<00:03:08.519> making<00:03:08.819> sure<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:09.060> your<00:03:09.180> tires

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.479 

rear<00:03:53.760> shock<00:03:54.690> tower<00:03:54.720> has<00:03:55.260> been<00:03:55.500> screwed<00:03:56.310> back

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
rear shock tower has been screwed back

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.890 
rear shock tower has been screwed back
in<00:03:56.670> so<00:03:56.880> now<00:03:57.000> all<00:03:57.150> we<00:03:57.239> have<00:03:57.359> to<00:03:57.420> do<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:57.690> just

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
in so now all we have to do is just

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.680 
in so now all we have to do is just
screw<00:03:58.140> this<00:03:58.640> island<00:03:59.640> alive<00:03:59.820> been<00:04:00.239> screwed<00:04:00.540> in

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
screw this island alive been screwed in

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.690 
screw this island alive been screwed in
and<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:00.989> think<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:03.030> looks<00:04:03.530> pretty<00:04:04.530> good<00:04:04.799> along

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
and I think it looks pretty good along

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.319 
and I think it looks pretty good along
with<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.910> front<00:04:06.090> ones<00:04:07.130> alright<00:04:08.130> so<00:04:08.459> now<00:04:09.269> we

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
with the front ones alright so now we

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.750 
with the front ones alright so now we
need<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.720> do<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:09.989> just<00:04:10.260> take<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.070> tires<00:04:11.310> screw

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
need to do is just take the tires screw

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.130 
need to do is just take the tires screw
them<00:04:11.910> back<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.530> with<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.739> new<00:04:13.859> wheel<00:04:14.130> nuts

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
them back in with the new wheel nuts

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.810 
them back in with the new wheel nuts
all<00:04:15.470> right<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:15.830> all<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:16.040> upgrades<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.580> got

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
all right so all the upgrades I got

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:24.040 
all right so all the upgrades I got
today<00:04:17.299> are<00:04:17.630> done<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.380> are<00:04:18.560> installed<00:04:18.980> I<00:04:23.050> think

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
today are done and are installed I think

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.440

it<00:04:24.140> looks<00:04:24.290> pretty<00:04:24.860> good

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450
