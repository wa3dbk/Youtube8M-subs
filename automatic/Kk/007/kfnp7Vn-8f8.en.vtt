00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello everyone beautiful of this brand new 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.700
 minecraft pocket video 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.030
 today I'm here on my channel for 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.190
 take you to the aid of the bild 4 version 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.259
 really come out of just a few hours 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.599
 today we are here immediately to manage it in 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.279
 direct have it splice in mind 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.650
 many things in this new bale 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.150
 they are really very new arrivals 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.070
 beautiful that we will now see in the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.350
 detail large hill start with the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.720
 first feature that would be that of 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.789
 cave spiders or all 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.949
 other mobs that give poison 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.320
 no I misunderstood all the mobs that 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.880
 give effect to this effect 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.440
 potions etc. 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.420
 so when we go we will undergo the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.840
 poison or we will take an effect 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.850
 when we're going to click on a spider 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.700
 some caverns when he gives us 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.390
 the effect to call stop the effect 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.920
 just drink the milk and the effect 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.539
 something will disappear will work with all 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.760
 types of function I have to run away now are 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.710
 strange kills me like he's doing 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.320
 they work with any effect what we do 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.809
 we will therefore assume type with the fetus of the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.299
 run the effect of strength and robe of 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.990
 so we just need to drink ours 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.630
 bucket of milk 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.790
 the effect will obviously disappear in this one 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.610
 builds cannot always miss i 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.250
 our beloved bugs in fact that they are 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.170
 some improved facts but in the same 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.299
 worse time we always keep with the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.979
 our usual boat you see in the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.200
 ballet 3 the boat on my device 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.330
 they were more shitty if you didn't 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.799
 I could go there in this version is 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.520
 been improved and when we go to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.619
 beat 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.600
 run no longer that bug that 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.220
 obviously very ugly then a thing 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.350
 let's say they improved it though 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.720
 obviously no other bug has come 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.360
 if we put ourselves in the third person now 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.979
 I take a moment and leave the world 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.110
 reduces for a moment see let's abandon the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.360
 play and come back as you just have 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.200
 we will return no orange I know nothing 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.210
 let's try again a moment here is how you have 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.159
 as soon as I entered the world though 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.890
 kind of fallen from the world stuff like that 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.610
 how you can also exploit this bug 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.159
 for type a new ex ray you could 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.079
 also do as obviously coherent thing 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.720
 I went out to the world and died like that 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.010
 miserable with bugs that happens not too much 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.200
 thick roma we find ourselves doing it again 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.599
 on the perfect boat we leave the world 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.810
 try again iamm if a network of. happens again 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.569
 new has fallen ugly again from 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.409
 see why I never play any bugs 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.750
 some find them again but then immediately 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.730
 they add other new non-gray ones 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.209
 with the abarth as we always are not 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.340
 yet 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.590
 one thing I'm noticing right now I don't know if 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.569
 it was already present in the last wilde but 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.879
 when type we pass the hand with the 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.849
 boat like you on the water are formed 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.859
 these kind of squares that we know 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.599
 where to place the boat that age does not 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.829
 it happens instead with other types of drums 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.030
 so something really very much 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.769
 intelligent 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.019
 I'm not sure it was already there 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.299
 scale bale therefore you tell me maybe 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.819
 I'm wrong, then something very very nice 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.560
 this stuff here at least we know where 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.569
 we can position our boat 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.010
 I found it very frequent was what 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.680
 you could not fish from the barrel from 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.400
 fishing with nets is now possible but it is 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.500
 today's crusader has crashed so by chance 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.359
 minecraft not just the reason anyway 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.799
 duty themes fishing hands fishing from 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.139
 another part then the fishing rod 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.840
 at the launch here to make you fear launches 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.790
 behind the boat with ugly stuff 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.410
 and very high book yet so let's say 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.160
 that even with the fishing rod there 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.930
 We still are 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.209
 then regarding the menu of the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.030
 creative below added of course 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.370
 milk below how you will find destinations 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.709
 can select and can also be selected 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.389
 drink when you have a need but the 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.250
 creative we did not need precisely 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.190
 and so here they were all reached by the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.230
 bild am risotto your mind many bugs his 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.139
 indeed this time indeed that bug 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.959
 where it sank half down to the earth 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.769
 so at random it was finally solved 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.209
 now we will no longer die in the blocks 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.739
 this will persist let me know if you 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.109
 so there is still always when 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.840
 will come new bytes type Bay 5 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.030
 I will do trade where I will show you all 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.739
 the joints that are all made then 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.720
 that's why I hope you are there 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.650
 liked remind you more of the classic 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.970
 still registered 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.970
 we close in a near me
