one of the biggest challenges of the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
original ravenica was finding the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.810 
original ravenica was finding the
keyboard<00:02:17.750> mechanic<00:02:18.170> for<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.890> vulgarity<00:02:19.250> we

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
keyboard mechanic for the vulgarity we

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.580 
keyboard mechanic for the vulgarity we
knew<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.570> graveyard<00:02:21.200> was<00:02:21.319> where<00:02:21.500> we

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
knew that the graveyard was where we

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.199 
knew that the graveyard was where we
wanted<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.890> go<00:02:22.099> because<00:02:22.580> green<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.000> blacks

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.390 
wanted to go because green and blacks
overlap<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.989> in<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.620> greater<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.069> two<00:02:25.160> colors

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
overlap is in the greater the two colors

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.540 
overlap is in the greater the two colors
are<00:02:25.489> cared<00:02:25.610> most<00:02:25.730> about<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.000> graveyard

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
are cared most about the graveyard

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.180 
are cared most about the graveyard
and<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.150> dredge<00:02:28.020> was<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.470> 40th<00:02:28.920> attempt

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
and so dredge was like the 40th attempt

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.100 
and so dredge was like the 40th attempt
to<00:02:29.310> find<00:02:29.490> mechanic<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.150> honestly<00:02:30.810> for<00:02:31.020> those

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
to find mechanic and honestly for those

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.930 
to find mechanic and honestly for those
in<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.290> little<00:02:31.440> bit<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.680> history<00:02:32.010> dredge<00:02:32.610> was

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
in a little bit of history dredge was

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.480 
in a little bit of history dredge was
the<00:02:33.360> craziest<00:02:33.900> most<00:02:34.020> broken<00:02:34.440> mechanic<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.950> red

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
the craziest most broken mechanic in red

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.220 
the craziest most broken mechanic in red
middle<00:02:35.730> block<00:02:35.880> but<00:02:36.240> we<00:02:36.360> did<00:02:36.540> know<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:36.870> wanted

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
middle block but we did know we wanted

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.830 
middle block but we did know we wanted
the<00:02:37.380> graveyard<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.610> 50<00:02:38.850> part<00:02:39.060> was<00:02:39.270> how

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the graveyard and so the 50 part was how

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.890 
the graveyard and so the 50 part was how
to<00:02:39.870> make<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.200> graveyard<00:02:40.560> relevant<00:02:41.160> but<00:02:41.640> not

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
to make the graveyard relevant but not

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.570 
to make the graveyard relevant but not
inherently<00:02:42.900> broken<00:02:43.170> because<00:02:43.650> as<00:02:44.100> dredge

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
inherently broken because as dredge

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.820 
inherently broken because as dredge
taught<00:02:44.880> us<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.720> graveyard<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.470> resource

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
taught us the graveyard is a resource

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.160 
taught us the graveyard is a resource
that<00:02:46.890> kind<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.370> comes<00:02:47.610> for<00:02:47.910> free<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.540> you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
that kind of comes for free and that you

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.530 
that kind of comes for free and that you
have<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.650> be<00:02:49.710> careful<00:02:50.160> about<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.490> because<00:02:50.760> you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
have to be careful about it because you

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.630 
have to be careful about it because you
can't<00:02:51.960> you<00:02:52.770> can't<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.040> kind<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.310> give<00:02:53.490> things

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
can't you can't just kind of give things

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.390 
can't you can't just kind of give things
away<00:02:54.170> scavenge<00:02:55.170> was<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.620> second<00:02:55.980> mechanic

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
away scavenge was the second mechanic

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.310 
away scavenge was the second mechanic
that<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.760> had<00:02:56.880> really<00:02:57.060> solidified<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.960> design

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
that we had really solidified in design

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.140 
that we had really solidified in design
the<00:02:58.560> first<00:02:58.740> being<00:02:59.010> populate<00:02:59.610> which<00:02:59.820> we<00:02:59.970> knew

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
the first being populate which we knew

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.300 
the first being populate which we knew
were<00:03:00.270> really<00:03:00.600> happy<00:03:00.810> with<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.560> idea<00:03:01.830> was<00:03:02.280> that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
were really happy with the idea was that

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.130 
were really happy with the idea was that
we<00:03:02.580> wanted<00:03:02.910> each<00:03:03.150> one<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.690> return<00:03:04.050> to

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
we wanted each one of the return to

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.290 
we wanted each one of the return to
Ravnica<00:03:04.290> mechanics<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.280> mesh<00:03:05.520> well<00:03:05.850> at<00:03:06.150> least

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
Ravnica mechanics to mesh well at least

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.290 
Ravnica mechanics to mesh well at least
in<00:03:06.540> principle<00:03:06.990> with<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.680> original<00:03:08.670> remnant

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
in principle with the original remnant

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.240 
in principle with the original remnant
of<00:03:09.390> mechanics<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.170> idea<00:03:10.440> was<00:03:10.740> that<00:03:10.770> okay

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
of mechanics so the idea was that okay

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.040 
of mechanics so the idea was that okay
if<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.460> add<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.640> deck<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.390> remember<00:03:12.870> from

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
if you add a deck that you remember from

if you add a deck that you remember from

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.970 
ramp if it was a dredge deck obviously
you'd<00:03:15.360> want<00:03:15.630> your<00:03:15.750> go<00:03:15.900> gari<00:03:16.140> mechanic<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.830> make

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
you'd want your go gari mechanic to make

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.190 
you'd want your go gari mechanic to make
use<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.520> graveyard<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:18.150> some<00:03:18.360> way<00:03:18.540> we<00:03:19.050> had

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
use of the graveyard in some way we had

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.170 
use of the graveyard in some way we had
the<00:03:19.320> idea<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.710> creatures<00:03:20.220> being<00:03:20.460> able<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.790> be

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
resources in your graveyard and we

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.070 
resources in your graveyard and we
played<00:03:23.190> around<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.610> lot<00:03:23.790> with<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.180> eventually

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
played around a lot with that eventually

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.470 
played around a lot with that eventually
what<00:03:25.230> we<00:03:25.350> realized<00:03:25.770> is<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.190> if<00:03:26.610> Celestia<00:03:27.270> was

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
what we realized is that if Celestia was

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.080 
what we realized is that if Celestia was
the<00:03:27.630> guild<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.990> went<00:03:28.230> wide<00:03:28.650> as<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.490> like<00:03:29.640> made

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
the guild that went wide as in like made

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.810 
the guild that went wide as in like made
a<00:03:30.330> big<00:03:30.959> army<00:03:31.350> full<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.800> smaller<00:03:32.070> creatures<00:03:32.550> and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
a big army full of smaller creatures and

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.610 
a big army full of smaller creatures and
killed<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.270> away<00:03:33.510> we<00:03:33.959> want<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.230> go<00:03:34.380> Gauri

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
killed you that away we want to go Gauri

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.479 
killed you that away we want to go Gauri
to<00:03:34.890> go<00:03:35.070> tall<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.150> make<00:03:36.420> like<00:03:36.560> big<00:03:37.560> single

to go tall so make like big single
threats<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.720> we<00:03:39.870> can<00:03:40.020> diversify<00:03:40.290> the

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
plays into the strategy of scavenge and

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.270 
plays into the strategy of scavenge and
the<00:05:29.570> entire<00:05:29.840> mechanic<00:05:30.289> he's<00:05:30.620> reliant<00:05:31.250> upon

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
the entire mechanic he's reliant upon

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.010 
the entire mechanic he's reliant upon
your<00:05:31.610> grave<00:05:31.699> and<00:05:31.910> he<00:05:31.970> wants<00:05:32.180> you<00:05:32.240> to<00:05:32.270> load<00:05:32.630> up

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
your graveyard to make him bigger but

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:36.879 
your graveyard to make him bigger but
then<00:05:35.600> once<00:05:35.810> you<00:05:35.900> do<00:05:36.110> that<00:05:36.139> you<00:05:36.440> can<00:05:36.590> scavenge

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
then once you do that you can scavenge

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.740 
then once you do that you can scavenge
onto<00:05:37.280> your<00:05:37.400> other<00:05:37.580> creatures<00:05:38.030> which<00:05:38.479> makes

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
his second ability more powerful but

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.110 
his second ability more powerful but
then<00:05:42.590> when<00:05:42.830> you're<00:05:42.919> scavenging<00:05:43.550> you<00:05:43.850> make<00:05:44.000> is

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
then when you're scavenging you make is

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.520 
then when you're scavenging you make is
first<00:05:44.419> to<00:05:44.539> go<00:05:44.660> you<00:05:44.780> know<00:05:44.870> make<00:05:45.080> it<00:05:45.110> you<00:05:45.349> make

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
first to go you know make it you make

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.520 
first to go you know make it you make
him<00:05:45.650> smaller<00:05:46.070> and<00:05:46.430> then<00:05:47.030> if<00:05:47.330> he<00:05:47.630> if<00:05:48.139> you<00:05:48.349> want

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
him smaller and then if he if you want

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.409

him<00:05:48.830> to<00:05:48.979> come<00:05:49.130> back<00:05:49.190> then<00:05:50.030> you're<00:05:50.210> sacrificing

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
him to come back then you're sacrificing

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.930 
him to come back then you're sacrificing
your<00:05:50.810> swamps<00:05:51.349> and<00:05:51.470> forests<00:05:52.250> which<00:05:52.610> makes<00:05:52.820> it

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
your swamps and forests which makes it

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.390 
your swamps and forests which makes it
harder<00:05:53.240> to<00:05:53.270> scavenge<00:05:53.750> so<00:05:53.930> some<00:05:54.830> of<00:05:54.860> the<00:05:55.160> things
