its watches blue red they presented it
in<00:00:27.179> April<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.990> actually<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.980> really<00:00:29.130> not

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
in April and actually it is really not

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.819 
in April and actually it is really not
easy<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.089> do<00:00:30.239> and<00:00:30.419> it's<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> result<00:00:31.409> of<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> long

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
easy to do and it's a result of a long

months precisely on the new colors the
first<00:00:59.940> new<00:01:00.359> colors<00:01:00.660> which<00:01:01.140> will<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.280> released

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
first new colors which will be released

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
first new colors which will be released
at<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> red<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.839> blue<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.650> is

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
at the red and the blue and this is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.040 
at the red and the blue and this is
taking<00:01:05.460> lots<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.760> time<00:01:06.000> basically<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.900> have

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
taking lots of time basically we have

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.679 
taking lots of time basically we have
developed<00:01:07.440> a<00:01:07.770> special<00:01:08.220> dye<00:01:08.430> going<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
developed a special dye going with a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.280 
developed a special dye going with a
special<00:01:10.430> fluid<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> make<00:01:13.079> sure

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
special fluid and we have to make sure

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.080 
special fluid and we have to make sure
by<00:01:13.500> developing<00:01:14.070> these<00:01:15.000> two<00:01:15.360> elements<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:17.090> we

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
by developing these two elements that we

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.649 
by developing these two elements that we
still<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.860> equilibrium<00:01:20.579> and<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.450> non

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
still have the equilibrium and the non

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.289 
still have the equilibrium and the non
visibility<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.649> two<00:01:22.829> fluids<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:24.210> have

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
visibility of the two fluids and we have

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.530 
visibility of the two fluids and we have
to<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.570> sure<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.229> dye<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.829> not<00:01:26.540> going

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
to make sure that the dye is not going

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
to make sure that the dye is not going
from<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.229> fluid<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.829> other<00:01:29.070> otherwise<00:01:29.790> we

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
from one fluid to the other otherwise we

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.429 
from one fluid to the other otherwise we
will<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:32.060> colored<00:01:33.060> solution<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
will have just the colored solution you

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.560 
will have just the colored solution you
know<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:36.030> development<00:01:36.180> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
know it's not just the development of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020 
know it's not just the development of
one<00:01:36.869> between<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.100> know<00:01:38.219> every<00:01:38.729> time<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
one between you know every time you

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.539 
one between you know every time you
develop<00:01:39.479> something<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> liquid<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
develop something in the liquid you

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.800 
develop something in the liquid you
developed<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.469> solution<00:01:43.469> of<00:01:44.810> interaction

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
developed a solution of interaction

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.170 
developed a solution of interaction
between<00:01:46.170> two<00:01:46.560> liquids<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.189> their

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
between two liquids and their

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.230 
between two liquids and their
environments<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> environment<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.369> also

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
environments and the environment is also

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.690 
environments and the environment is also
the<00:01:51.509> cotton<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.560> metals<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.520> are

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the cotton and the metals that are

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.270 
the cotton and the metals that are
inside<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:55.200> watch<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.710> other<00:01:55.950> components

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
inside the watch and other components

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.090 
inside the watch and other components
and<00:01:56.700> all<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.420> all<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.020> system<00:01:58.590> has<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:59.070> be

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and all that all the system has to be

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.270 
and all that all the system has to be
stable<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> time<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.590> not<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.100> to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
stable in the time so it's not just to

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.819 
stable in the time so it's not just to
plug<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.789> liquid<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.869> done<00:02:04.109> no<00:02:04.409> it's

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
plug in one liquid and it's done no it's

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.010 
plug in one liquid and it's done no it's
a<00:02:05.039> it's<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.579> complete<00:02:05.939> system<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> whole

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
a it's a complete system it's a whole

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.190 
a it's a complete system it's a whole
interaction<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.890> then<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.580> enter<00:02:08.789> into<00:02:09.300> a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
interaction and then we enter into a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.759 
interaction and then we enter into a
long<00:02:11.100> period<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:12.060> test<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.050> qualification

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
long period of test and qualification

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.880 
long period of test and qualification
which<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.810> aging<00:02:15.810> aging<00:02:16.410> tests

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
which is aging aging tests

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.440 
which is aging aging tests
it's<00:02:17.069> like<00:02:17.280> accelerating<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
it's like accelerating the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.320 
it's like accelerating the
time<00:02:18.599> in<00:02:18.989> order<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.470> make<00:02:19.620> sure<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:20.330> after

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
time in order to make sure that after

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.100 
time in order to make sure that after
let's<00:02:22.230> say<00:02:22.530> four<00:02:23.340> or<00:02:23.370> five<00:02:23.819> six<00:02:24.510> months<00:02:24.750> of

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
let's say four or five six months of

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.850 
let's say four or five six months of
aging<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:26.610> an<00:02:26.760> equivalent<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.660> three<00:02:28.170> four

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
aging it's an equivalent of three four

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.430 
aging it's an equivalent of three four
five<00:02:29.220> years<00:02:30.019> of<00:02:31.879> living<00:02:32.879> of<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.390> system<00:02:33.900> it's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
five years of living of the system it's

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.059 
five years of living of the system it's
not<00:02:34.590> as<00:02:35.190> easy<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:37.050> can<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.440> for<00:02:37.680> example<00:02:37.709> in

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
not as easy as you can do for example in

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.430 
not as easy as you can do for example in
watchmaking<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:39.360> change<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.690> color<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.930> dial

watchmaking to change the color of dial

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.949 
watchmaking to change the color of dial
in<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.040> fluids<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.790> much<00:02:42.269> more<00:02:42.540> complicated

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
in the fluids it's much more complicated

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.030 
in the fluids it's much more complicated
we<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.280> select<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:45.330> very<00:02:45.810> special<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.769> to

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
we have to select a very special and to

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.580 
we have to select a very special and to
develop<00:02:47.340> special<00:02:47.819> dyes<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:49.049> have<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.560> be

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
develop special dyes that have to be

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.150 
develop special dyes that have to be
very<00:02:50.040> very<00:02:50.280> stable<00:02:50.690> stable<00:02:51.690> means<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.769> do<00:02:52.980> not

very very stable stable means the do not

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.089 
very very stable stable means the do not

they cannot change of color of
brilliance<00:02:56.880> with<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.510> time<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.019> they<00:02:58.799> have

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
brilliance with the time and they have
