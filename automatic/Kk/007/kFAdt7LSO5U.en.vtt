00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
compression with the cotton wool there

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.340 
compression with the cotton wool there
now<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:17.440> cotton<00:03:17.739> wool<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:18.100> has<00:03:18.609> been<00:03:19.350> twisted

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
up nice and tight so it creates that

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.039 
up nice and tight so it creates that
wedge<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:24.190> there's<00:03:25.000> not<00:03:25.150> fluffy<00:03:25.630> bits<00:03:25.810> that

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
between your toenails and your skin then

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.360 
between your toenails and your skin then
we<00:03:45.040> get<00:03:45.130> our<00:03:45.280> band-aid<00:03:45.760> we<00:03:46.389> want<00:03:46.569> to<00:03:46.630> do<00:03:46.720> this

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
we get our band-aid we want to do this

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.849 
we get our band-aid we want to do this
nice<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.400> tight<00:03:49.200> we<00:03:50.200> want<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.440> try<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:50.650> get

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
nice and tight we want to try and get

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.849 
nice and tight we want to try and get
that<00:03:51.389> obviously<00:03:52.389> the<00:03:52.870> pad<00:03:53.139> bit<00:03:53.350> over<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.829> top

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
that obviously the pad bit over the top

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.360 
that obviously the pad bit over the top
as<00:03:54.190> well<00:03:54.340> so<00:03:54.870> we<00:03:55.870> line<00:03:56.139> that<00:03:56.440> up<00:03:56.620> as<00:03:56.859> best<00:03:57.100> as<00:03:57.340> we

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
as well so we line that up as best as we

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.809 
as well so we line that up as best as we
can<00:03:57.549> and<00:03:58.709> then<00:03:59.709> we<00:03:59.829> pull<00:04:00.069> down<00:04:00.220> nice<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.489> tight

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
can and then we pull down nice and tight

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.550 
can and then we pull down nice and tight
so<00:04:01.720> creates<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:03.190> pressure<00:04:03.579> on<00:04:03.880> top<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.329> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.530 

pressure<00:04:08.560> on<00:04:08.889> top<00:04:09.160> of<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.609> cotton<00:04:10.000> wool<00:04:10.180> to

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
pressure on top of that cotton wool to

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.039 
pressure on top of that cotton wool to
create<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.530> space<00:04:11.799> so<00:04:12.660> there's<00:04:13.660> no<00:04:13.840> pressure

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
create the space so there's no pressure

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.710 
create the space so there's no pressure
there<00:04:14.350> just<00:04:14.560> push<00:04:14.769> down<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:15.419> there<00:04:16.419> we<00:04:16.539> have
