00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.920 
it'll shrink up the Polish almost it's
hard<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.100> explain<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:42.150> will<00:01:42.360> kind<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.720> pull

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
hard to explain but it will kind of pull

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.690 
hard to explain but it will kind of pull
the<00:01:43.200> Polish<00:01:43.649> away<00:01:43.979> from<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> edges<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.610> your

nail and shrink it really in addition to

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.850 
nail and shrink it really in addition to
that<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.520> also<00:01:47.670> makes<00:01:47.970> them<00:01:48.090> more<00:01:48.299> prone<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
that that also makes them more prone to

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.620 
that that also makes them more prone to
peel<00:01:49.860> off<00:01:50.130> I'm<00:01:50.820> sure<00:01:50.880> you've<00:01:51.180> had<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.479> where

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
like one big piece a reason if that can

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.590 
like one big piece a reason if that can
be<00:01:55.470> applying<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.369> fast<00:01:56.850> drying<00:01:57.119> top<00:01:57.240> coat<00:01:57.390> to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
looked a little bit better when they

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.110 
looked a little bit better when they
have<00:02:46.720> like<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.960> thick<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:48.130> know<00:02:48.160> glaze<00:02:48.610> almost

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
over top of them so they look more like

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.950

they're<00:02:51.040> part<00:02:51.460> of<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.820> base<00:02:52.000> color<00:02:52.330> rather

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
they're part of the base color rather

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.360

which can also make it peel I like to
use<00:03:26.800> this<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.340> then<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.520> other<00:03:27.640> one<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.060> I

usually talk about it negatively because

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.300 
usually talk about it negatively because
I<00:03:46.720> had<00:03:47.050> a<00:03:47.080> really<00:03:47.320> really<00:03:47.440> bad<00:03:47.680> experience

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
I had a really really bad experience

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.860 
I had a really really bad experience
with<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:48.610> first<00:03:48.820> bottle<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.300> Seche<00:03:49.510> vite<00:03:49.690> that

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
with the first bottle of Seche vite that

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.130 
with the first bottle of Seche vite that
I<00:03:49.900> had<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:51.400> one<00:03:51.580> has<00:03:51.730> not<00:03:51.940> been<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:52.900> bad

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
I had and this one has not been so bad

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.930 
I had and this one has not been so bad
but<00:03:53.710> it<00:03:53.800> is<00:03:53.920> still<00:03:54.160> reminiscent<00:03:54.730> of<00:03:54.820> the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
but it is still reminiscent of the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.670 
but it is still reminiscent of the
problems<00:03:55.270> I<00:03:55.360> have<00:03:55.510> with<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.750> first<00:03:55.960> one<00:03:56.200> which

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
problems I have with the first one which

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.930 
problems I have with the first one which
is<00:03:56.710> that<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.070> would<00:03:57.190> make<00:03:57.340> my<00:03:57.460> nail<00:03:57.640> polish

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
is that it would make my nail polish

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.870 
is that it would make my nail polish
peel<00:03:58.180> off<00:03:58.390> all<00:03:58.690> in<00:03:59.470> one<00:03:59.650> swift<00:03:59.950> motion<00:04:00.160> very

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
peel off all in one swift motion very

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.970 
peel off all in one swift motion very
shortly<00:04:01.240> after<00:04:01.480> I<00:04:01.840> applied<00:04:02.470> it<00:04:02.650> like<00:04:02.800> within

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
shortly after I applied it like within

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.530 
shortly after I applied it like within
hours<00:04:03.460> of<00:04:03.700> putting<00:04:04.240> my<00:04:04.450> manicure<00:04:04.840> on<00:04:05.020> and<00:04:05.320> I

the reason I do still use it is because

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.120 
the reason I do still use it is because

category<00:04:49.450> of<00:04:49.510> special<00:04:50.440> effects<00:04:50.770> top<00:04:51.070> coats

category of special effects top coats

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.040 
category of special effects top coats
the<00:04:51.850> first<00:04:52.060> one<00:04:52.210> I'm<00:04:52.300> going<00:04:52.390> to<00:04:52.450> talk<00:04:52.600> about<00:04:52.630> is

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
the first one I'm going to talk about is

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.770 
the first one I'm going to talk about is
the<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.740> am<00:04:54.040> Northern<00:04:54.940> Lights<00:04:55.150> which<00:04:55.420> I've<00:04:55.600> said

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
the I am Northern Lights which I've said

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.480 
the I am Northern Lights which I've said
is<00:04:55.990> very<00:04:56.200> similar<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.620> China<00:04:56.980> Glaze<00:04:57.130> fairy

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
is very similar to China Glaze fairy

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.880 
is very similar to China Glaze fairy
dust<00:04:57.730> but<00:04:58.330> it's<00:04:58.450> a<00:04:58.540> little<00:04:58.720> less<00:04:59.110> dense<00:04:59.410> more

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
dust but it's a little less dense more

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.640 
dust but it's a little less dense more
you<00:05:00.550> know<00:05:00.640> sparing<00:05:01.360> glitter<00:05:01.600> as<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:01.870> guess<00:05:02.050> but

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
you know sparing glitter as I guess but

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.440 
you know sparing glitter as I guess but
another<00:05:02.830> difference<00:05:03.220> with<00:05:03.760> this<00:05:03.970> is<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.330> as

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
another difference with this is it as

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.210 
another difference with this is it as

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.640 
made by the same company as out the door
and<00:05:06.430> this<00:05:06.910> is<00:05:06.970> meant<00:05:07.390> to<00:05:07.540> be<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:07.720> top<00:05:08.110> coat<00:05:08.350> like

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.410 
do and all a matte topcoat does is take
any<00:06:20.050> shine<00:06:20.770> out<00:06:21.190> of<00:06:21.640> your<00:06:21.790> nails<00:06:21.970> and<00:06:22.210> leaves

any shine out of your nails and leaves

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
you with just a flat matte color and I

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.550 
you with just a flat matte color and I
really<00:06:24.940> initially<00:06:25.450> didn't<00:06:25.750> like<00:06:25.990> the<00:06:26.200> idea<00:06:26.470> of

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
really initially didn't like the idea of

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.620 
really initially didn't like the idea of
a<00:06:26.740> matte<00:06:26.920> topcoat<00:06:27.190> but<00:06:27.640> the<00:06:27.730> more<00:06:27.940> I<00:06:27.970> see<00:06:28.360> like

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
a matte topcoat but the more I see like

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.090 
a matte topcoat but the more I see like
how<00:06:28.810> people<00:06:28.840> incorporate<00:06:29.650> it<00:06:29.740> into<00:06:29.920> their

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
the kind of manicure we have like maybe

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.660 
the kind of manicure we have like maybe
two<00:06:39.230> pink<00:06:39.470> nails<00:06:39.710> and<00:06:39.980> black<00:06:40.160> nail<00:06:40.400> and<00:06:40.640> a

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
two pink nails and black nail and a

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.630 
two pink nails and black nail and a
glitter<00:06:40.880> nail<00:06:41.150> and<00:06:41.480> stuff<00:06:41.690> like<00:06:41.870> that<00:06:42.140> um

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
glitter nail and stuff like that um

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.400 
glitter nail and stuff like that um
mattify<00:06:43.640> like<00:06:43.940> one<00:06:44.180> of<00:06:44.270> those<00:06:44.420> colors<00:06:44.840> and<00:06:44.870> so

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
mattify like one of those colors and so

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.230 
mattify like one of those colors and so
everything<00:06:45.830> kind<00:06:46.430> of<00:06:46.580> goes<00:06:46.700> along<00:06:46.760> with<00:06:47.000> one

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
everything kind of goes along with one

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.340 
everything kind of goes along with one
color<00:06:47.480> scheme<00:06:47.750> but<00:06:47.900> they<00:06:48.020> all<00:06:48.140> look<00:06:48.320> different

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
color scheme but they all look different

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.050 
color scheme but they all look different
I<00:06:48.830> kind<00:06:49.070> of<00:06:49.100> really<00:06:49.370> wanted<00:06:49.700> to<00:06:49.760> do<00:06:49.850> one<00:06:50.000> of

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
I kind of really wanted to do one of

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.400 
I kind of really wanted to do one of
those<00:06:50.150> lately<00:06:50.480> but<00:06:50.690> I<00:06:50.930> haven't<00:06:51.230> had<00:06:51.320> that

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
those lately but I haven't had that

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.080 
those lately but I haven't had that
topcoat<00:06:51.680> I<00:06:51.950> guess<00:06:52.100> that<00:06:52.220> just<00:06:52.370> takes<00:06:52.640> all<00:06:52.880> the

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
topcoat I guess that just takes all the

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.880 
topcoat I guess that just takes all the
shine<00:06:53.300> away<00:06:53.600> from<00:06:54.050> everything<00:06:54.290> most<00:06:54.590> recent

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:54.890 
shine away from everything most recent

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.950 
shine away from everything most recent
one<00:06:54.980> that<00:06:55.010> I<00:06:55.190> bought<00:06:55.430> is<00:06:55.670> from<00:06:56.090> Colt<00:06:56.420> nails<00:06:56.630> and

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
one that I bought is from Colt nails and

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.860 
one that I bought is from Colt nails and
it's<00:06:57.080> called<00:06:57.350> wax<00:06:57.860> that<00:06:58.250> wax<00:06:58.850> effects<00:06:59.420> topcoat

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
it's called wax that wax effects topcoat

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.560 
it's called wax that wax effects topcoat
and<00:07:00.160> what<00:07:01.160> this<00:07:01.310> is<00:07:01.520> is<00:07:01.820> it's<00:07:02.150> kind<00:07:02.390> of<00:07:02.450> an

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
and what this is is it's kind of an

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.440 
and what this is is it's kind of an
in-between<00:07:02.720> a<00:07:03.290> matte<00:07:03.620> and<00:07:04.010> like<00:07:04.520> a<00:07:04.670> glossy<00:07:05.180> top

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.450

in-between a matte and like a glossy top
coat<00:07:05.510> and<00:07:05.870> it<00:07:06.020> really<00:07:06.230> does<00:07:06.470> make<00:07:07.310> your<00:07:07.520> nails

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.300 
look waxy like you think about wax it's

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.590 
look waxy like you think about wax it's
not<00:07:11.680> completely<00:07:12.680> dull<00:07:13.070> but<00:07:13.670> it's<00:07:13.790> not<00:07:14.390> like

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
somewhere in between and that's what

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.030 
somewhere in between and that's what
this<00:07:17.390> does<00:07:17.600> and<00:07:17.870> it<00:07:17.990> looks<00:07:18.230> really<00:07:18.650> really

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.040 
this does and it looks really really
