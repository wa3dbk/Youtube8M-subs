00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 cuirassier show cheap game keys 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.230
 nomic accounts outcast 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.870
 and dota 2 link in the description hello to all 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.660
 you cuirassier we continue to play sky 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.410
 wars on crystallix we play on the map here 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.170
 such pokemon sky pokeball minutes 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.300
 the cards are shorter so what we have here is 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 we have a hatchet great us even 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.550
 there is an extra arrow 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.890
 the main thing is that we have it seems to me 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.430
 he is on the chest and kader 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.520
 This in my opinion I will say that the hacker who 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.469
 as usual some kind of excellent here 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.780
 thing if there is a stone like and this is not 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.399
 everything will be bad i think so let's 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.809
 more arrows do so I dig for now 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.690
 no one is built of course you can get 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:59.309
 a little blocks i hear that only up 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.050
 the threads are close already and I still have 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.110
 not dressed 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.060
 other things so you need to wear them 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.360
 look this guy wants to get to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.860
 center 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:17.189
 I can not take it to get 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.210
 to the center here now look 1 this one 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.990
 girl maybe dump so i'm here 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.780
 sit a little 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.750
 i just wanted to reset from this 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.200
 the guy who's gonna try next 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:38.540
 the center is being built it would be quite 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:41.729
 not bad here look at and everything flew away 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.640
 now we can try to build 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.420
 bridge 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.940
 in this girl we are also a hatchet and she 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.940
 I probably dumped resources 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:02:00.200
 I wanted to fight but nothing could be done 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.140
 there is clearly no point in sky warce 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.580
 sola 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:10.610
 so well, I used to be still here 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.069
 sky Wars well for teams that is 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.840
 especially there you can go there was 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.890
 He was called Sky Wars tanks well, or 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.550
 somehow so then it was removed and now 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.730
 rushes forbidden so dungeon we neither 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.360
 with whom we will not look so looking for him 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.370
 being built 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.459
 Well ka ka let down well and in principle 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.600
 I can use now I think here 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.500
 by this bridge 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.130
 and these are all the same guys topic price is 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.600
 forbidden to do so now kill 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.010
 Now we take a closer look and kill 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.549
 Tyrone so they dropped from the bow but 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.680
 it seems like it will not work and you reset 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.750
 six more people became my sound 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.310
 let's see that we have bread there 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.660
 bread 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.019
 Well, in principle, you can try now 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:10.489
 here from them a little nedrelil 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.420
 now he will still come out in ii 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:19.280
 think so and run you can even 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.900
 another run to it let's see 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.900
 no one is shorter here 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.040
 and the other one failed them a little 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.620
 let's try brushes to the center 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.670
 will finish 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:39.750
 maybe I can do it like this 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:44.069
 really completed before the center is now 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:47.900
 let's wait a little here and when they 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.900
 will be built on, I'll drop them 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.750
 we give a why a fig why not hit 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.000
 pipets 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.950
 military sad but anyway i 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.220
 already at the center I have a sword awesome 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.379
 so look uh now you try here in 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:16.400
 this get in when he runs like him 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:19.100
 someone runs from the back and got great 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.860
 not bad as he shot down 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.479
 so now this is possible in him mask Guy 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.280
 Fox 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.410
 funny so let's see what we have 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.000
 there is still 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.080
 but I am glad that at least I got then 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.760
 when he ran 2 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.800
 let's see something else here 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:45.870
 another guy about but he is far from 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.660
 will fly far away he clearly is no longer there 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.930
 fly away and to me so far nobody goes 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:56.180
 so you can still here a little bit 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:05:01.020
 get confused look here pvp some 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:04.070
 Evans one hit there is this guy 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.500
 with diamond on babies worth and 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:11.010
 shot off 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.510
 Well, I still arrows and normal 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.340
 the amount can still be shot 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.229
 a little bit of course he collects them 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.000
 some arrows are falling it like this 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.820
 let's say 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.290
 and maybe even his life already 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.480
 left to the mark a little course 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.940
 be a lot but I still try again 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.290
 just get him a little bit higher need 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:40.380
 un to move the glorious 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:44.610
 demon hatchet get not so much 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:47.250
 just as there is a ladder let 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.010
 try to gather here with us too 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.810
 there are chests 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:59.760
 nowhere visible diamond bib here 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:06:03.540
 this is a good topic missed sadly 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:07.500
 flour in fact in principle, and so already dressed 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.980
 far it would be nice to me now 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:15.330
 bigger tree 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:18.510
 could then make a workbench yourself 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.000
 this guy has thrown off the chains 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.570
 three 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.620
 I do not have an arrow so we can 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.540
 guy try to drain 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.530
 Well, in principle, this is the bottom easily 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:36.900
 it turned out like a diamond sword after all 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:40.410
 I have yes and armor is not so fig so 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:45.770
 but I donâ€™t have any arrows anymore 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:49.860
 the last remaining survivor 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:54.450
 perhaps he sat down somewhere straight seriously 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:58.260
 sat down and out on the principle he is not very dressed 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.930
 not very good but if services it will be 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.390
 very bad 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:09.370
 I give to eat of the tree would not mind 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:13.990
 him use bow wow eat bow 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:17.040
 and what do Alan let's do it for me 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:20.160
 could such a mini challenge i 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:25.419
 try not to use a bow against him 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:27.540
 I won't even make arrows 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:33.180
 try 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:39.729
 get to him that way 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:45.490
 slowly but surely he shot me that 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:48.669
 I think he's building something there of the need to 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:54.310
 increase and the higher gets higher and higher 

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:57.360
 basically made up dolechu here 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:59.440
 fine all guy forgives ha ha 

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.940
 it turned out but the principle is all about it 

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.410
