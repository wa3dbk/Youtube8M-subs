00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.819
 hello everyone welcome to our channel 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.590
 in our last videos we have 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.809
 pointed out the possibility that the 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.809
 asteroid apophis in one of his journeys 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.570
 from the year 2029 could collide 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.119
 with the earth equally in other videos 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.249
 we have tried to link said fact 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.679
 with the prophecies of nostradamus that 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:26.480
 foresee such event we have analyzed in 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.949
 our previous video each of the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.630
 quatrains that refer to the 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.999
 fall of an asteroid on earth and 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.890
 we have seen the similarities between what 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.740
 they write the quatrains of our lakes 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.620
 and what would be the effects of the fall 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.040
 doubt steroid however if that's 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.030
 true 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.390
 several doubts arise where when in this 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.630
 video we will try to answer them 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.050
 century 10 pages 74 the year of 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.930
 great seventh amount fulfilled will appear 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.150
 in the time of the battle games 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.180
 not far from the age of the great millennium 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.510
 when the dead leave their graves 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.450
 the great seventh refers to the 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.280
 seventh seal narrated in the book of 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.080
 apocalypse of san juan that makes 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.060
 reference to the resurgence of a new 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.180
 world after several cataclysms and 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.729
 misfortunes for humanity regarding the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.110
 grammy log would undoubtedly be the second one 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.450
 say the year 2000 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.150
 when he speaks of 2000 makes 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.220
 reference not far from therefore not 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.100
 would be located precisely in that same 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.770
 year but not very far as we are 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.200
 talking about centuries a magnitude not 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.010
 very far from the year 2000 could be the year 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.460
 2020 2030 or even 2040 being the most 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.800
 probable about 2030 in the next 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.070
 century if you give us more details of 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.590
 240 240 shortly after the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.710
 King has been assassinated Castor and 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.830
 pollux in the barbed star boat 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.320
 public treasure emptied by land and sea 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.470
 tread like this will close turin are lands 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.350
 prohibited this quatrain is a little more 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.229
 specific since it is not being located 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.020
 only where but when when 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.330
 we talk about the boat where the beaver is 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.130
 The brand could make reference to 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.800
 the boat of san pedro 'symbol of the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.400
 rock papacy by both beaver and p칩lux 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.440
 in the boat would be two prophecies 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.210
 already hidden by another well-known prophet 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.010
 bad san 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.800
 which we have already talked about in 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.270
 other videos for as much as in this 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.540
 the same moment the 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.360
 communication from a dad emeritus and another 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.880
 chosen the date could be given from now 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.150
 taking into account the same longevity 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.100
 of the parents and that according to our 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.540
 lamus we would be talking about a date 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.000
 between 2020 2030 would coincide with the 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.040
 cohabitation and would match equally 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.370
 also with the passage of the asteroid 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.010
 apophis in the year 2029 this places us in 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.500
 a reference date about when it could 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.840
 give itself if it will be the prophecy of 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.170
 nostradamus now that we have a 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.780
 suspect the date would be interesting 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.420
 know where it could fall is asteroid if 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.040
 once again our the most accepted as 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.770
 we have seen in our previous medium of 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.070
 we lock us several quatrains ago 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.710
 allusions to a sunken island that great 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.290
 sunken island could be britain 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.090
 he also makes reference to his quartets 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.490
 outs to this both in the south of france 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.870
 near Toulouse continues quoting 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.210
 Miranda also in southern France 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.860
 perpi침치n near to below 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.710
 talk about genoa 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.910
 rom치n and rodas if all these populations 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:48.340
 from Great Britain ending in Rhodes 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.680
 put on a map we would see that 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.460
 form a strip that goes from west 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.550
 to this and that are also located 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.710
 in the northern hemisphere reference 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.170
 continuous that he does when he talks about the 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.900
 catastrophe referring in various 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.880
 how many here I read a component wind 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.830
 north said strip also if the 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.900
 we analyzed curiously could match 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.750
 with the fall trajectory of a 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.160
 scientific agreement speculated on the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.590
 possible fall of the master today 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.920
 specifically the apophis and they have plotted 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.300
 a strip with its possible trajectory 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.840
 it matches with our water 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.340
 both in its direction from west to east as 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.169
 your situation in the hemisphere 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.669
 we would talk to the northern hemisphere 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.620
 considering that they are still missing 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.479
 enough years for the apophis to 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.180
 approximate and that you do not have data 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.919
 Exactly there could be a modification of 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.300
 trajectory with which they could 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.110
 approaching or not saying frank 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.719
 curiously he powerfully calls 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.039
 Attention that also the quatrains 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:51.550
 prediction steroid culture 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:54.039
 part in linking this fact to a large 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.169
 war that would match the time a 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.009
 East war against the West that 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.779
 it would resemble the third world war 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.819
 earthquakes and tsunamis shocks of 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:06.520
 meteorites and all this in the middle of a 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.460
 great world war is this exaggerated 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.860
 it makes sense because we treat each other 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.900
 of catastrophist in our next 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.150
 video we 'll talk about it and we'll see if 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.409
 this world war has logic in 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.629
 half of a catastrophe such 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.330
 scope and certainly so 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.969
 studied points out that some logic does not 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.729
 you are missing if you want to be the first to see 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.680
 this video subscribe to our channel and 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.849
 You will be informed promptly of all 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.849
 developments there
