much<00:02:31.349> exactly<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.889> same<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:34.760> what's<00:02:35.760> really

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
much exactly the same so what's really

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.899 
much exactly the same so what's really
different<00:02:36.870> here<00:02:37.139> first<00:02:37.530> off<00:02:37.739> my<00:02:38.519> memories

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
different here first off my memories

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.280 
different here first off my memories
little<00:02:39.120> hazy<00:02:39.359> of<00:02:39.689> how<00:02:40.310> much<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.549> enjoyed<00:02:42.290> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
little hazy of how much I enjoyed the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.199 
little hazy of how much I enjoyed the
last<00:02:43.469> build<00:02:43.859> I<00:02:44.069> was<00:02:44.219> excited<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.790> see<00:02:45.030> it

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
last build I was excited to see it

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.020 
last build I was excited to see it
because<00:02:45.629> of<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.840> promise<00:02:46.079> that<00:02:46.349> it<00:02:46.500> had<00:02:47.030> but

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
because of the promise that it had but

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.119 
because of the promise that it had but
it<00:02:48.299> was<00:02:48.540> obvious<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.319> was<00:02:49.349> not<00:02:49.650> finished

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
it was obvious that it was not finished

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.420 
it was obvious that it was not finished
this<00:02:50.609> actually<00:02:51.060> feels<00:02:51.269> very<00:02:52.079> nice<00:02:52.430> very

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
this actually feels very nice very

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.599 
this actually feels very nice very
polished<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:55.230> browser<00:02:55.500> feels<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:56.519> a

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
polished the browser feels like it's a

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.199 
polished the browser feels like it's a
little<00:02:56.879> bit<00:02:57.859> more<00:02:58.859> ready<00:02:59.430> for<00:02:59.879> prime<00:03:00.180> time

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
little bit more ready for prime time

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.839 
little bit more ready for prime time

you first go into the market the

you first go into the market the

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
featured for TV section that was there

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.920 
featured for TV section that was there
before<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.609> there<00:03:21.449> are<00:03:21.569> different

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 
applications there now and I installed

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.490 
applications there now and I installed
several<00:03:26.939> of<00:03:27.120> these<00:03:27.209> applications<00:03:27.930> all<00:03:28.259> of

them installed all of them launched I

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.259 
them installed all of them launched I
think<00:03:30.509> it<00:03:30.569> has<00:03:30.689> more<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.049> do<00:03:31.319> with<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
think it has more to do with the

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.960 
think it has more to do with the
availability<00:03:33.269> of<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:34.709> SDK<00:03:35.489> being<00:03:35.790> updated

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.080 
availability of the SDK being updated
for<00:03:37.040> Google<00:03:38.040> TV<00:03:39.290> more<00:03:40.290> than<00:03:40.349> anything<00:03:40.709> else<00:03:41.090> so

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
for Google TV more than anything else so

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.999

launch so that's a problem but it's not

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.059 
launch so that's a problem but it's not
a<00:05:11.099> major<00:05:11.310> problem<00:05:12.229> I'm<00:05:13.229> sure<00:05:13.529> that<00:05:13.770> you<00:05:13.919> can

a major problem I'm sure that you can
still<00:05:14.389> do<00:05:15.389> some<00:05:15.449> side<00:05:15.870> loading<00:05:16.229> of

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
still do some side loading of

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:17.779 
still do some side loading of
applications<00:05:16.949> like<00:05:17.159> you<00:05:17.340> could<00:05:17.550> on<00:05:17.759> the

been sitting for too long without any

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.140 
been sitting for too long without any

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150 
activity but trust me i was looking at

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.540 
activity but trust me i was looking at
pictures<00:07:16.480> earlier<00:07:16.630> so<00:07:17.110> that<00:07:17.290> works<00:07:17.550> but

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
pictures earlier so that works but

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.100 
pictures earlier so that works but
pretty<00:07:18.700> much<00:07:18.790> everything<00:07:19.240> else<00:07:19.360> looks<00:07:19.900> like

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
pretty much everything else looks like

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.660 
pretty much everything else looks like
it's<00:07:20.290> about<00:07:20.380> the<00:07:20.680> same<00:07:20.920> there's<00:07:21.400> not<00:07:21.610> a

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:21.670 
it's about the same there's not a

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.550 
it's about the same there's not a
tremendous<00:07:22.030> amount<00:07:22.450> of<00:07:22.540> difference<00:07:22.720> it<00:07:23.230> just

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 
tremendous amount of difference it just

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.670 
tremendous amount of difference it just
feels<00:07:23.830> like<00:07:23.950> this<00:07:24.250> is<00:07:24.310> more<00:07:24.640> polished<00:07:25.150> and

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 
feels like this is more polished and

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.050 
feels like this is more polished and
it's<00:07:26.680> more<00:07:26.980> ready<00:07:27.400> for<00:07:27.820> prime<00:07:28.330> time<00:07:29.190> and<00:07:30.190> you

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
it's more ready for prime time and you

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.540 
it's more ready for prime time and you
kind<00:07:31.870> of<00:07:31.930> have<00:07:32.080> to<00:07:32.110> believe<00:07:32.470> if<00:07:33.250> you<00:07:33.370> get<00:07:33.520> your
