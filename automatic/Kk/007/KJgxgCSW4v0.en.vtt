00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.670
 leonberg friends yes day one of the world 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.860
 four klaus peters are now past 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.570
 and what has been to discover so far 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.760
 Yes, I would like to do that now, for example 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.160
 show this video in that overview 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.030
 on the available battery 4 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.430
 Pioneer class give the pioneer or 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.260
 English also distinguishes engineer 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.460
 This is not really from the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.370
 class in battlefield 3 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.400
 The pioneer will be the weapons class 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.680
 So wear personal beds pds the fans 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.540
 and in the context of the beta here the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.059
 Select mx 4 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.739
 This weapon is mostly on short though 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.900
 also middle distance very effective there 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.350
 she owns a really high rate of fire 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.870
 and straight from the hip very accurate 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.550
 yes and that would be the pioneer without his 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.110
 Of course gadgets nothing about it 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.510
 you get back here at his 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.950
 well-known rocket launcher with him 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.950
 enemy vehicles under fire 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.159
 can take and be repertoire around that 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.479
 extend the life of a vehicle 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.030
 love is the handling of this gadget 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.410
 very similar to part 3 and therefore 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.130
 you should get into the game very quickly 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.620
 Find 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.210
 so you can with your rp the natural 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.250
 enemy vehicles and the bombardment 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.010
 take here but now on it 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.140
 pay attention to the apg something 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.330
 lower as you from home 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.420
 has a higher angle and also 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.850
 faster he inherits by default 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.710
 a total of five missiles and can use it 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.470
 the enemy vehicles pretty much 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.510
 einheizen 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.250
 yes and with the report clock you can yours 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.780
 Keep your own vehicles alive 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.150
 this is the same as in part 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.340
 3 he unpacks the part goes to the 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.110
 vehicle zoom in and weld what that stuff 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.490
 keep an eye on your friend 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.210
 support the battlefield too 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.250
 dominate 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.770
 You should, however, pay attention to it 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.730
 between the repair units short 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.710
 to take breaks 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.810
 So your gas is not so fast 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.090
 is consumed and you turn with it 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.940
 have a longer recharge so far 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.410
 could fix if he had all 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.050
 these gadgets and uses 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.660
 the pioneer is an indispensable 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.370
 military force on the battlefield dear 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.310
 but above all , his 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.130
 team mates at 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.620
 be it the place of his in his 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.599
 medipacks is merged or one 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.730
 Supporter providing ammunition 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.959
 so that he is the enemy vehicles 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.290
 again under fire can take 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.550
 As you can see , the pioneer is one 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.569
 varied and also like 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.060
 played great 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.340
 I shall infallibly and only have it 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.200
 a few flaws like one 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.150
 But I see that policy 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.830
 strongly believe that until the release of 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.069
 battlefield 4 these beauty flaws 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.930
 still be fixed and the pioneer 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.130
 well prepared of the filter next 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.069
 wave 4 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.900
 yes and if you have more such little ones 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.549
 have above pointed want to pay remains at 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.590
 any case on the ball because i will be you 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.590
 this week with at least one video 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.230
 supply the battlefield 4 beta per day 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.470
 in this sense , your goal is dealt with in the 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.470
 eye
