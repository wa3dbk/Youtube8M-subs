because at the end of the day it's an

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.749 
because at the end of the day it's an
internet<00:04:07.290> argument<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.009> there<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.400> no<00:04:08.549> winner

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
and there is no loser for the most part

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.849 
and there is no loser for the most part
so<00:04:10.699> um<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:12.840> kind<00:04:13.019> of<00:04:13.109> affected<00:04:13.500> me<00:04:13.620> in<00:04:13.650> real

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
so um that kind of affected me in real

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.339 
so um that kind of affected me in real
life<00:04:14.039> mostly<00:04:14.459> just<00:04:14.699> because<00:04:15.030> I<00:04:15.509> was<00:04:15.989> melting

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
on the internet and I got away with it

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.099 
on the internet and I got away with it
and<00:04:17.820> I<00:04:18.060> thought<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.299> could<00:04:18.479> be<00:04:18.539> mostly<00:04:18.870> in<00:04:18.959> real

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
and I thought I could be mostly in real

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.360 
and I thought I could be mostly in real
life<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.530> get<00:04:19.620> away<00:04:19.709> with<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.949> and<00:04:20.190> for<00:04:20.310> the

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
life and get away with it and for the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.519 
life and get away with it and for the
most<00:04:20.519> part<00:04:20.639> I<00:04:20.969> could<00:04:21.659> be<00:04:21.779> mouth<00:04:21.959> in<00:04:22.169> real<00:04:22.320> life

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:22.529 
most part I could be mouth in real life

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:23.959 
most part I could be mouth in real life
and<00:04:22.770> become<00:04:22.979> an<00:04:23.070> asshole<00:04:23.250> in<00:04:23.520> real<00:04:23.639> life<00:04:23.849> and

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
and become an asshole in real life and

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.700 
and become an asshole in real life and
get<00:04:24.090> away<00:04:24.180> with<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.449> because<00:04:24.510> no<00:04:25.469> one<00:04:25.620> would

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710
