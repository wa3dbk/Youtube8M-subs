Ableton's<00:00:34.010> drum<00:00:34.250> rack<00:00:34.430> is<00:00:34.579> one<00:00:34.730> of<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:34.850> best

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
Ableton's drum rack is one of the best

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.819 
Ableton's drum rack is one of the best
ways<00:00:35.239> I've<00:00:35.480> found<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:35.900> manage<00:00:36.170> percussion<00:00:36.680> the

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
ways I've found to manage percussion the

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.860 
ways I've found to manage percussion the
real<00:00:37.640> power<00:00:37.850> lies<00:00:38.120> in<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.390> fact<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:38.660> each

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
real power lies in the fact that each

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.840 
real power lies in the fact that each
pad<00:00:39.170> on<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.440> drum<00:00:39.650> rack<00:00:39.829> can<00:00:40.250> contain<00:00:40.610> any

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
a kick onto our pad that corresponds

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.039 
a kick onto our pad that corresponds
with<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.970> note<00:01:11.210> C<00:01:11.600> one

unfold our devices and our chain view we

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.340 
unfold our devices and our chain view we
can<00:01:19.310> see<00:01:19.460> there<00:01:19.580> is<00:01:19.610> one<00:01:19.700> chain<00:01:20.350> triggering

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
can see there is one chain triggering

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.910 
can see there is one chain triggering
one<00:01:21.710> simpler<00:01:22.159> containing<00:01:22.700> our<00:01:22.760> kick<00:01:22.970> drum<00:01:23.920> now

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
one simpler containing our kick drum now

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.410 
one simpler containing our kick drum now
let's<00:01:25.130> say<00:01:25.250> we<00:01:25.370> like<00:01:25.550> that<00:01:25.700> drum<00:01:25.940> sound<00:01:26.180> but<00:01:26.330> we

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
let's say we like that drum sound but we

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.180 
let's say we like that drum sound but we
want<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.690> layer<00:01:26.840> another<00:01:27.110> one<00:01:27.320> on<00:01:27.440> top<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:27.950> beef

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
want to layer another one on top to beef

want to layer another one on top to beef
it<00:01:28.310> up<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.520> little<00:01:28.700> bit<00:01:28.850> there<00:01:29.750> are<00:01:29.780> two<00:01:30.020> quick

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
it up a little bit there are two quick

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260 
it up a little bit there are two quick
ways<00:01:30.440> of<00:01:30.590> doing<00:01:30.710> this<00:01:30.950> depending<00:01:31.880> on<00:01:31.970> how<00:01:32.120> much

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
ways of doing this depending on how much

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.960 
ways of doing this depending on how much
additional<00:01:32.630> macro<00:01:33.170> control<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.650> want<00:01:33.970> first

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
additional macro control you want first

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.180 
additional macro control you want first
you<00:01:35.420> can<00:01:35.570> control<00:01:35.990> click<00:01:36.050> or<00:01:36.470> right<00:01:36.530> click<00:01:36.770> on

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
you can control click or right click on

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.510 
you can control click or right click on
the<00:01:37.550> existing<00:01:37.820> chain<00:01:38.770> choose<00:01:39.770> create<00:01:40.130> chain

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
the existing chain choose create chain

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.610 
the existing chain choose create chain
and<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:41.600> will<00:01:41.750> create<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:42.049> blank<00:01:42.320> chain

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
and that will create a blank chain

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.680 
and that will create a blank chain

simultaneously<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.680> can<00:01:56.830> hear<00:01:56.950> them

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
simultaneously you can hear them

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.770 
simultaneously you can hear them
separately<00:01:57.460> by<00:01:57.610> clicking<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.210> play<00:01:58.450> buttons

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
separately by clicking the play buttons

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.420 
separately by clicking the play buttons
in<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:58.960> chain<00:01:59.230> and<00:01:59.470> you<00:01:59.530> can<00:01:59.890> adjust<00:02:00.100> their

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
in the chain and you can adjust their

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.490 
in the chain and you can adjust their
volumes<00:02:00.850> independently<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.780> their<00:02:02.140> panning

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
volumes independently and their panning

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.380 
volumes independently and their panning
as<00:02:02.590> well<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.340> can<00:02:03.490> sculpt<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.910> exact<00:02:04.180> type

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
as well so you can sculpt the exact type

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.820 
as well so you can sculpt the exact type
of<00:02:04.420> sound<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.870> want

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.410 

you<00:02:08.830> can<00:02:08.950> also<00:02:09.100> apply<00:02:09.280> individual<00:02:09.940> effects<00:02:10.270> to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
you can also apply individual effects to

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.150 
you can also apply individual effects to
each<00:02:10.450> chain<00:02:10.929> but<00:02:11.560> we'll<00:02:11.710> save<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:11.890> for

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
each chain but we'll save that for

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.240 
each chain but we'll save that for
another<00:02:12.220> video<00:02:13.590> okay<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.830> other<00:02:14.950> quick

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
another video okay so the other quick

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.040 
another video okay so the other quick
way<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.400> layer<00:02:15.640> drums<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.300> once<00:02:16.660> we're<00:02:16.840> at<00:02:16.870> this

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
way to layer drums is once we're at this

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.560

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.740 

you<00:02:36.370> can<00:02:36.490> then<00:02:36.610> drag<00:02:36.760> other<00:02:37.030> samples<00:02:37.450> into<00:02:37.600> the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
you can then drag other samples into the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.150 
you can then drag other samples into the
newly-created<00:02:38.230> instrument<00:02:38.770> rack<00:02:38.890> and

newly-created instrument rack and

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.710 
newly-created instrument rack and
they'll<00:02:39.670> all<00:02:39.850> still<00:02:40.150> be<00:02:40.270> triggered<00:02:40.570> by<00:02:40.600> your

they'll all still be triggered by your
MIDI<00:02:41.050> notes<00:02:41.260> see<00:02:41.530> one

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.370 

the<00:02:47.270> advantage<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.720> doing<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:48.020> this<00:02:48.170> way<00:02:48.230> is

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
the advantage of doing it this way is

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.470 
the advantage of doing it this way is
that<00:02:48.590> your<00:02:48.890> kick<00:02:49.160> instrument<00:02:49.700> rack<00:02:49.880> has<00:02:50.240> its

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
that your kick instrument rack has its

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.960 
that your kick instrument rack has its
own<00:02:50.600> set<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:50.930> dedicated<00:02:51.560> macros<00:02:51.950> which<00:02:52.700> can<00:02:52.880> be

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
own set of dedicated macros which can be

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.880 
own set of dedicated macros which can be
very<00:02:53.180> useful

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.860
