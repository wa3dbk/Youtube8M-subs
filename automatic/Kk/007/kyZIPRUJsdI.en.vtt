call crate motor end you're not allowed
to<00:00:16.049> touch<00:00:16.349> the<00:00:16.410> motors<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.189> and<00:00:17.369> there's

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
to touch the motors and that and there's

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.790 
to touch the motors and that and there's
only<00:00:17.730> certain<00:00:18.570> engine<00:00:19.020> builders<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.410> can

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
only certain engine builders that can

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.820 
only certain engine builders that can
build<00:00:20.340> them<00:00:20.550> they're<00:00:21.119> about<00:00:21.390> 450<00:00:22.259> horses<00:00:22.560> all

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
build them they're about 450 horses all

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.630 
build them they're about 450 horses all
them<00:00:23.040> are<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:24.210> then<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.199> one<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.830> it's

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
them are but then on this one here it's

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.029 
them are but then on this one here it's
a<00:00:26.820> more<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.060> an<00:00:27.240> open<00:00:27.539> motor<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.050> can<00:00:28.230> run<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
a more of an open motor you can run and

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.960 
a more of an open motor you can run and
it's<00:00:29.250> God<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.660> 600<00:00:30.930> horse<00:00:31.610> on<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.820> one

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
it's God it's like 600 horse on that one

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.640 
it's God it's like 600 horse on that one
there<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.510> then<00:00:33.930> when<00:00:34.080> you<00:00:34.170> go<00:00:34.470> to<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
there and then when you go to the

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.430 
there and then when you go to the
Modifieds<00:00:35.220> there<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.660> there's<00:00:36.900> no<00:00:37.110> motor

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
Modifieds there you there's no motor

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.950 
Modifieds there you there's no motor
limit<00:00:37.920> whatsoever<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:38.970> all<00:00:39.210> about<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
limit whatsoever but it's all about the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.380 
limit whatsoever but it's all about the
tire<00:00:40.230> they<00:00:40.530> give<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.700> how<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.210> hook

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
tire they give you and how you can hook

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.110 
tire they give you and how you can hook
it<00:00:42.540> up<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.350> lot<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.829> tracks<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.880> run<00:00:45.090> like

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
it up so a lot of the tracks we run like

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.459 
it up so a lot of the tracks we run like
just<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.600> 350<00:00:46.140> Chevy<00:00:46.170> motor<00:00:46.680> something<00:00:47.610> smaller

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
just a 350 Chevy motor something smaller

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.950 
just a 350 Chevy motor something smaller
five<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.920> six<00:00:50.879> hundred<00:00:50.969> horse<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.690> range

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
five to six hundred horse in that range

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.290 
five to six hundred horse in that range
and<00:00:52.500> then<00:00:52.829> some<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.399> bigger<00:00:53.610> tracks<00:00:54.000> will

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and then some of the bigger tracks will

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.790 
and then some of the bigger tracks will
run<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.660> with<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.960> big<00:00:55.170> motors<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
run like with that big motors in the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.619 
run like with that big motors in the
back<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.430> 730<00:00:57.270> horsepower<00:00:58.160> so<00:00:59.539> will<00:01:00.539> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
back it's a 730 horsepower so will you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.590 
back it's a 730 horsepower so will you
safe<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.320> Ike<00:01:01.590> both<00:01:02.120> cooling<00:01:03.120> okay

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
safe and Ike both cooling okay

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.540 
safe and Ike both cooling okay
basic<00:01:04.170> basic<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.589> run<00:01:04.770> the<00:01:04.890> safe<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
basic basic I run the safe because it

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.639 
basic basic I run the safe because it
keeps<00:01:05.700> my<00:01:06.300> water<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:06.899> hard<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.289> here<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
keeps my water so hard out here and

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.100 
keeps my water so hard out here and
stuff<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.039> keep<00:01:08.250> third<00:01:08.490> oh<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.899> can't

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
stuff and I keep third oh and we can't

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
stuff and I keep third oh and we can't
run<00:01:10.229> no<00:01:10.380> antifreeze<00:01:10.830> okay<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:11.940> racing<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.450> we

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
run no antifreeze okay and racing so we

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.690 
run no antifreeze okay and racing so we
got<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> row<00:01:12.840> water<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.350> keeps<00:01:13.700> before

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
got a row water and that keeps before

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.039 
got a row water and that keeps before
always<00:01:14.790> ice<00:01:15.000> having<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.510> much<00:01:15.659> trouble<00:01:15.810> with

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
always ice having so much trouble with

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.690 
always ice having so much trouble with
the<00:01:16.229> rust<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.830> everything<00:01:16.890> building<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.549> in

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the rust and everything building up in

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.310 
the rust and everything building up in
arrears<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.840> that's<00:01:18.990> why<00:01:19.140> you're<00:01:19.290> running

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
arrears and so that's why you're running

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.780 
arrears and so that's why you're running
a<00:01:19.500> safe<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.860> keep<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.130> clean<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.580> run<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
a safe to keep it clean then we run the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.280 
a safe to keep it clean then we run the
dike<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.570> leaks<00:01:21.780> because<00:01:22.020> with

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
dike just for the leaks because with

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.350 
dike just for the leaks because with
aluminum<00:01:22.710> heads<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.250> stuff<00:01:23.460> they<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.210> so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
aluminum heads and stuff they have so

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
aluminum heads and stuff they have so
problems<00:01:24.780> seeping<00:01:25.439> I'm<00:01:25.560> not<00:01:25.710> actually<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.189> lot

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
problems seeping I'm not actually a lot

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.070 
problems seeping I'm not actually a lot
of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> engine<00:01:26.850> builder's<00:01:27.210> recommend<00:01:27.900> that's

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
of the engine builder's recommend that's

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.350 
of the engine builder's recommend that's
one<00:01:28.229> thing<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.470> recommend<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> use<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.180> dike

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
one thing I recommend to use is the dike

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480 
one thing I recommend to use is the dike
okay<00:01:30.960> because<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.530> won't<00:01:31.680> plug<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> system

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
okay because it won't plug the system

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.520 
okay because it won't plug the system
right<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> lot<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> other<00:01:33.990> stuff<00:01:34.290> does

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
right like a lot of the other stuff does

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.399 
right like a lot of the other stuff does
and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.850> motors<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.360> run<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.020> our<00:01:37.170> crate

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and then the motors we run and our crate

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.550 
and then the motors we run and our crate
motors<00:01:37.829> actually<00:01:38.280> Roley<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.729> off<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.570> 520

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
motors actually Roley right off the 520

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.340 
motors actually Roley right off the 520
because<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.670> picked<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.329> nineteen<00:01:43.140> horse

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
because we picked up like nineteen horse

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.120 
because we picked up like nineteen horse
on<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> dyno<00:01:44.240> by<00:01:45.240> not<00:01:45.960> running<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.409> 20<00:01:46.710> 50

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
on the dyno by not running the 20 50

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.999 
on the dyno by not running the 20 50
using<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.030> lighter<00:01:48.270> weight<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.049> you're

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
using a lighter weight and you're

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
using a lighter weight and you're
limited<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.520> horsepower<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.479> we<00:01:51.750> gain<00:01:51.930> more

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
limited a horsepower so we we gain more

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.080 
limited a horsepower so we we gain more
horsepower<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.920> running<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> 520<00:01:53.850> Isle

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
horsepower with the running the 520 Isle

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.810 
horsepower with the running the 520 Isle
and<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.470> did<00:01:55.619> after<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.310> first<00:01:56.520> year<00:01:56.670> we

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and and we did after the first year we

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.039 
and and we did after the first year we
have<00:01:56.909> seen<00:01:57.119> oh<00:01:57.270> we're<00:01:57.479> difference<00:01:57.899> for

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
have seen oh we're difference for

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.170 
have seen oh we're difference for
nothing<00:01:58.320> anyway<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:58.979> change<00:01:59.340> our<00:01:59.610> oil<00:01:59.850> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
nothing anyway and we change our oil a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.910 
nothing anyway and we change our oil a
lot<00:02:00.659> more<00:02:00.899> than<00:02:01.140> what<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> oil<00:02:01.380> needs<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.829> be

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
lot more than what the oil needs to be

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520 
lot more than what the oil needs to be
so<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:02.850> change<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.240> mother<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.600> race<00:02:03.840> ok

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
so we change the mother of the race ok

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.219 
so we change the mother of the race ok
so<00:02:05.009> actually<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> more<00:02:06.390> would<00:02:06.630> last<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.079> lot

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
so actually the more would last a lot

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.560 
so actually the more would last a lot
longer<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.799> we<00:02:08.729> did<00:02:08.910> that's<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.360> way<00:02:09.450> we

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
longer but we did that's just the way we

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.820 
longer but we did that's just the way we
do<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.810> keep<00:02:10.290> on<00:02:10.380> your<00:02:10.530> friend<00:02:10.799> actually<00:02:10.979> game

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
mmm-hmm just by going from from a 2050

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.050 
mmm-hmm just by going from from a 2050
oil<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.420> 520<00:02:17.420> really<00:02:17.810> yeah<00:02:18.490> well<00:02:19.490> I'm<00:02:19.670> I'm

broke a motor and you take them apart
and<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:43.580> motors<00:02:43.880> look<00:02:44.030> like<00:02:44.210> new<00:02:44.650> at<00:02:45.650> then

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890
