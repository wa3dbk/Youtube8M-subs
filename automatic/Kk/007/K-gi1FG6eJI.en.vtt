00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:06.009
 here is the universally popular and Günther the numbers you can me too 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.690
 evil uncle case to be repeated 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.030
 I am here in this apartment with this tool year broke into and that is 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.390
 that the apartment of a certain comedy Matti I do not know if he is him 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.699
 but knows the surreal should be real Frick 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.019
 the blog light so really collected and Darmstadt Bellinzona computer games 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.380
 Collects video games 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.689
 make it worse 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.469
 we unite what the most mass ann-kathrin in Geesthacht and is something 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.260
 do not go at all I am now legally broke in here to make you illegal 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.040
 to show what this man is all about 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.339
 in his collection so far as I know that's right here on the loo 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.469
 Accordingly, he can not get me now synonymous here I should be safe 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:52.039
 would 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.269
 that's probably half an hour on the toilet because they break down branches 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.110
 right now 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.020
 this is part of his collection here yes 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.940
 so dear kids are there i wanted to role model i tried you in 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.479
 Maribor last is not just visual 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.030
 in character and on what you get involved with 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.960
 but animal disease office space Mourad Trabelsi play games I speak 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.260
 own experience 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.380
 The brutal reflected are not good for the character 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.570
 «I sat like that you do not create me but I was the other day 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.390
 I'll just grab Ryan blindly here and I'll definitely go for it 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.229
 one of the worst and most dangerous players out 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.840
 that St gives here in this world 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.240
 Just 30 here was once 30 euros 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.799
 But for example, what will be the most difficult is it again a facelift 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.520
 Look at this so all kids under two years will be the way up there is 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.090
 This is about LX 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.560
 why is this game so dangerous first of all again the parking meters the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.460
 Edges you can get sick 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.510
 because look at that cheer 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.950
 Chantal Tessmann People who are sociable are doing this for example 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.640
 a shoelace through 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.130
 These parkour dominate and hanged themselves on these cuts here 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.139
 Alone on top of that already 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.480
 the parkour must be on the index i sat again and again 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.370
 but even I was rare at first 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.560
 All reflects the eyes are in bed and banned in the end I have Mobley 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.519
 forbidden 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.760
 in the case of Bayer that one may only love bleeding no more than a mob 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.240
 you 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.240
 it's both and that's why the game mobile has 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.199
 banned because that's parallel through the cracks 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.439
 if Bayern says motionID year think if the lots buy Mogli game 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.689
 that's why the players just have to ban 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.569
 but who believes that you have followed this face "jackpot" although the 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.480
 parcel 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.010
 apart from the fact that you have cup Dagmar Schratter he has the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.379
 face 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.999
 Children want to look like this is being accused of his 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.449
 Kurt Reusch be marginal 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:57.870
 I bet now runs again a thousand children and teenagers 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.780
 not betrayed at first and can climb there a nose in the form 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.340
 this plays must be immediately out of the possible it would be the same I call now 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.709
 Just look at my cell phone the police at Bowman small second 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.000
 as expected, too, looked moment 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.049
 finished 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.129
 police 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.129
 yes here he is by no means again 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:27.489
 On the next minute he probably has too much to do Deuce reigns 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.519
 always back as a precaution Matilda Croatia he should not notice 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.889
 that I was here, let's see, wait 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.440
 the fast end of the third quarter we stand 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.210
 it is sorted now but it is still a lot 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.120
 funny 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.269
 I am happy that we are out of this way 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.010
 Look at these players of these times except here everything is upside down yes 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.290
 I mean, imagine the ComCom kid with two three years old when the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.909
 University of Applied Sciences yes and sees this game and says human now I have 20 years 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.049
 learned for years that the writing is not upside down and what are they doing? 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.430
 This stupid to play such a game back shows it on the 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.230
 Head looks at it it's all upside down 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.700
 what happens yes children and teens make virtually a headstand and 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.069
 this shot the reader to be able to read on the pack 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.869
 what happens now blow 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:17.969
 when they are upside down after three quarters of an hour 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:22.429
 Only good that karate first time the risk of accidents, yes what can happen 

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.159
 if you're upside down I mean I'm well cushioned 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.340
 but what kids in well padded 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.000
 The boats with this reason also did not let themselves by legal 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.030
 Foot warmer subtle Frank Horch year 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.080
 However, because the game immediately confiscated on the sex I'm sorry 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.770
 was the police on 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.770
 Med his resignation 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.610
 Hello 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.719
 here is the uncle case again and although vigorously bring a game for display 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.449
 that means hello 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.610
 of families who are always on what they have against me I work them 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.580
 with the prosecutor together 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.580
 Well, yes, no matter we pack the game back here again 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.449
 here you are not me as I said against a cold and in 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.999
 you are the mirror or you are 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:08.059
 that's nice but it took hold back then 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:10.860
 I play killer games 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.919
 Mogli and something and how they are all called acidification again 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:16.500
 jubilant 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.930
 not the unified important as i look the crisis everywhere no these games 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.670
 sda I'm going to become a single player now 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.740
 Nyman "I have to talk a little quieter so that Martin Michel has me 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.930
 he is on the toilet Opinions one week born Bulut Schaar 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.300
 So it does not fit on the Tui-share yet a single game out so theirs 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.860
 yacht 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.860
 the light itself had something to buy there 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.409
 and now it's your turn 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.009
 what do you say to that? 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.560
 yet it's all in black that means black woman 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.039
 yes, I mean every person Teresa Parodi Peter over for now yes 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.500
 and the reader questions who is the Stormarner 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.010
 but the parade he died yes if you see this pack you think 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.860
 sadness sadly December so he and he stands there the Legends 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.589
 of Zelda Ocarina of Time 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:09.379
 also cardinal 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:12.099
 it's called Katharina and I also Carina 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.789
 I mean every woman a year that Katharina is called in the future 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:17.539
 Carina also called 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:22.339
 Ocarina commander Georg Klein Carina make a hit but van Gaal something 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:24.500
 for my feet and anything else 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.889
 such games create benefits 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.069
 "Every Okarina in this world does to me lightly Katharina alone 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:35.560
 For all Catherine's around the world for all of us 20, these players must 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.730
 also be occupied next to 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.780
 it has it 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.130
 It's nothing to be optimistic about, but it's worth making some money from serving 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.350
 but we have it Black Blue and when Nintendo 64 says what Ostendorf still says 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.520
 64 Nintendo devices just to play this game 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:51.280
 Now it's your turn 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.319
 So I look after hunting rights, I'm right because I 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:56.780
 I think I continue to pull it on my side 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.889
 I should distribute it holistically with this German we the apartment 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:03.630
 leave before Martin Petkovic now leaves the apartment I think 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.969
 I'll do it all again 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:07.039
 I ask him to do it 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:11.259
 yes, most people remember until the next or whether 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:16.279
 The region remains my bent years later as operating creditors later 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:20.589
 Bor Hall RPO with magic 

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:25.529
 Dr. BWL polite "I've been here with you the whole time you're here 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:28.710
 broken into the EHC 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.740
 this should come out more well i could 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.169
 yes 8 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:35.750
 after 8 8
