help the cells survive and thrive like

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.200 
help the cells survive and thrive like
in<00:01:07.439> their<00:01:07.560> native<00:01:07.740> pancreas<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
in their native pancreas so one of the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.060 
in their native pancreas so one of the
first<00:01:09.240> challenges<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.140> took<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.740> as<00:01:11.010> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
first challenges that we took on as a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770 
first challenges that we took on as a
tissue<00:01:11.400> engineering<00:01:11.760> lab<00:01:11.970> was<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.600> engineer

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
tissue engineering lab was to engineer

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
tissue engineering lab was to engineer
the<00:01:13.229> optimal<00:01:13.650> environment<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:14.310> these<00:01:14.400> islets

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the optimal environment for these islets

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.090 
the optimal environment for these islets
and<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> first<00:01:16.650> thing<00:01:16.920> was

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and so that's really the first thing was

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.010 
and so that's really the first thing was
to<00:01:17.130> develop<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.850> scaffold<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
to develop a scaffold like the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.450 
to develop a scaffold like the
scaffolding<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> building<00:01:19.979> that's<00:01:20.280> going

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
scaffolding of a building that's going

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.310 
scaffolding of a building that's going
to<00:01:20.520> house<00:01:20.759> these<00:01:21.030> islets<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.630> three

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
to house these islets in three

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.170 
to house these islets in three
dimensions<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.490> they're<00:01:23.759> going<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> create<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
dimensions so they're going to create a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.580 
dimensions so they're going to create a
three-dimensional<00:01:24.479> structure<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.409> an

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
three-dimensional structure just like an

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.010 
three-dimensional structure just like an
organ<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.460> basically<00:01:27.150> engineering<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> mini

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
organ so basically engineering in a mini

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.569 
organ so basically engineering in a mini
organ<00:01:28.380> that's<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> house<00:01:28.950> these<00:01:29.159> islets

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
organ that's going to house these islets

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.830 
organ that's going to house these islets
it's<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> provide<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
it's going to provide the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.330 
it's going to provide the
three-dimensional<00:01:31.439> distribution<00:01:32.009> it's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
three-dimensional distribution it's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.410 
three-dimensional distribution it's
going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> provide<00:01:32.759> mechanical<00:01:32.970> protection

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
going to provide mechanical protection

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.260 
going to provide mechanical protection
and<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.799> also<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> provide<00:01:35.369> safety

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and it's also going to provide safety

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.999 
and it's also going to provide safety
and<00:01:36.420> retrieve<00:01:36.780> ability<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.350> monitoring<00:01:37.770> so

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and retrieve ability and monitoring so

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.499 
and retrieve ability and monitoring so
these<00:01:38.100> could<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.369> taken<00:01:38.729> out<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:38.970> any<00:01:39.119> time<00:01:39.360> if

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
these could be taken out at any time if

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.450 
these could be taken out at any time if
we<00:01:39.600> need<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.619> can't<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:41.009> when<00:01:41.189> islets

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
we need to which we can't do when islets

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.280 
we need to which we can't do when islets
are<00:01:41.520> put<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> liver<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.270> also<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
are put in the liver and also it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.200 
are put in the liver and also it
provides<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.740> platform<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.579> adding<00:01:45.090> all

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
provides a platform for then adding all

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
provides a platform for then adding all
of<00:01:45.240> these<00:01:45.540> other<00:01:45.750> supplemental<00:01:46.380> factors

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
of these other supplemental factors

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.740 
of these other supplemental factors
because<00:01:47.460> once<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> islets<00:01:48.270> are<00:01:48.360> contained

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
because once the islets are contained

one at a time to a way in which we can

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
generate a consistent product and so we

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.820 
generate a consistent product and so we
came<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.850> buy<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> rep<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.570> we<00:02:40.170> worked<00:02:40.680> together

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
came to buy a rep and we worked together

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.650 
came to buy a rep and we worked together
