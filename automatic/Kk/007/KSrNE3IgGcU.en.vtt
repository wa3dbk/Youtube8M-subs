00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 a couple the truth 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.870
 safe or if not harder by supporting 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.619
 with an evil that you subscribe to and the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.619
 today 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.119
 proud treated as download for 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:24.789
 follow the zero point which is a patch 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:28.589
 for 2013 and what they do updated 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.589
 in 2013 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.519
 what we have to do is carbon 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.030
 lathe file with those of a description 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:40.480
 of the video and open it with the torrent with 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.909
 the same torrent and then wait for it to 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.780
 I complete the charges then to 1.25 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:49.210
 teams 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.210
 well then having downloaded 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.579
 now this option because yon installed 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.470
 good but before executing it if 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.080
 you already have a pc version 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:10.150
 installed what they have to do is 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.970
 install it by deleting these three files 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.600
 and is that they have a new one version 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.420
 previous installed so they do not have 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.040
 to do nothing just run the file 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:27.320
 what if friendship 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:31.300
 Well , they give you a right click now 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.300
 execute as an administrator 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.240
 and they will open a window like this 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:52.619
 what do they have to do and where 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.619
 it was installed and knox 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:08.000
 and then in the end we give in to start and 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.950
 will start to install the patch 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.700
 ending they give you in finalize 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.970
 and everything will be perfectly fine 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.330
 then its microphones are run and we can 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:27.310
 be separated and they will remain our 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:32.069
 three files which will not proceed in 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.069
 to do is to configure it 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.750
 they give you an extra point conflict with the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.780
 mini will likely open the window and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.840
 you configure the settings of your 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.940
 weight in micros like cinchona and then go 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.950
 a point manager exile do the same thing 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.660
 I care as administrator what 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.970
 have to do is select that weight 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.310
 it's microsoft exact point and they give to 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.900
 touch and the installation will be complete 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:07.050
 of the good patch because this has been all 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.570
 for today if you liked at the table 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.520
 subscribed are shared so that 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.670
 more people can see it and that today is 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.010

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.130
