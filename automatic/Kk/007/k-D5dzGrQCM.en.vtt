making<00:03:59.069> YouTube<00:03:59.370> content<00:03:59.819> there<00:04:00.239> are<00:04:00.390> quite<00:04:00.569> a

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
making YouTube content there are quite a

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.789 
making YouTube content there are quite a
few<00:04:00.690> things<00:04:01.019> that<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:01.200> like<00:04:01.319> about<00:04:01.349> making

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
few things that I like about making

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.259 
few things that I like about making
YouTube<00:04:02.130> content<00:04:02.580> but<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.700> think<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.030> best

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
YouTube content but I think the best

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.650 
YouTube content but I think the best
feeling<00:04:04.250> from<00:04:05.250> making<00:04:05.580> YouTube<00:04:05.910> content<00:04:06.390> is

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
feeling from making YouTube content is

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.050 
feeling from making YouTube content is
when<00:04:07.470> someone<00:04:07.860> comes<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.459> comments<00:04:08.880> on<00:04:08.970> your

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
when someone comes and comments on your

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.570 
when someone comes and comments on your
video<00:04:09.330> in<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.540> like<00:04:09.690> yo<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.290> like<00:04:10.709> this<00:04:10.950> video<00:04:11.250> I

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
video in the like yo I like this video I

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.100 
video in the like yo I like this video I
watched<00:04:11.880> all<00:04:12.030> your<00:04:12.060> videos<00:04:12.480> blah<00:04:12.780> blah<00:04:12.930> and

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
watched all your videos blah blah and

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.289 
watched all your videos blah blah and
they<00:04:13.260> just<00:04:13.440> constantly<00:04:13.920> tune<00:04:14.640> in<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.150> they're

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
they just constantly tune in and they're

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.120 
they just constantly tune in and they're
commenting<00:04:15.780> good<00:04:15.989> things<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.530> just<00:04:16.620> they're

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
commenting good things and just they're

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.530 
commenting good things and just they're
like<00:04:17.160> inspired<00:04:17.729> by<00:04:17.910> your<00:04:18.030> videos<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.479> think

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
like inspired by your videos I think

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.960 
like inspired by your videos I think
that<00:04:19.139> gives<00:04:19.380> me<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:19.979> feeling<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.519> like<00:04:20.729> I'm

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
that gives me a feeling of like I'm

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.820 
that gives me a feeling of like I'm
doing<00:04:21.269> something<00:04:21.299> right<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.710> is

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
doing something right so that is

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.990 
doing something right so that is
probably<00:04:23.070> one<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.460> best<00:04:23.639> things<00:04:23.850> about

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
probably one of the best things about

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.360 
probably one of the best things about
producing<00:04:24.990> YouTube<00:04:25.290> content<00:04:25.710> will<00:04:26.100> you<00:04:26.190> do

academies<00:05:35.070> well<00:05:35.610> I<00:05:35.639> was<00:05:35.910> watched<00:05:36.120> by<00:05:36.270> quite<00:05:36.539> a

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
academies well I was watched by quite a

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.240 
academies well I was watched by quite a
few<00:05:36.660> clubs<00:05:36.990> no<00:05:37.200> one<00:05:37.289> ever<00:05:37.500> really<00:05:37.710> followed<00:05:38.160> up

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
few clubs no one ever really followed up

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.800 
few clubs no one ever really followed up
on<00:05:38.280> it<00:05:38.490> which<00:05:38.610> is<00:05:38.639> quite<00:05:39.000> frustrating<00:05:39.180> looking

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
on it which is quite frustrating looking

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.930 
on it which is quite frustrating looking
back<00:05:39.960> at<00:05:40.110> it<00:05:40.200> now<00:05:40.229> maybe<00:05:41.130> because<00:05:41.460> I<00:05:41.580> was<00:05:41.729> quite

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
back at it now maybe because I was quite

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.460 
back at it now maybe because I was quite
small

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
small

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.070 
small
and<00:05:42.800> I'm<00:05:43.700> still<00:05:44.030> quite<00:05:44.150> small<00:05:44.300> now<00:05:44.570> five<00:05:44.900> foot

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
and I'm still quite small now five foot

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.030 
and I'm still quite small now five foot
seven<00:05:45.200> not<00:05:45.470> too<00:05:45.590> tall

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
seven not too tall

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.440 
seven not too tall
so<00:05:46.220> you<00:05:46.280> can<00:05:46.400> imagine<00:05:46.700> at<00:05:46.880> the<00:05:46.940> age<00:05:47.030> of<00:05:47.150> seven

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
so you can imagine at the age of seven

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.420 
so you can imagine at the age of seven
to<00:05:47.540> fifteen<00:05:47.900> how<00:05:48.440> tall<00:05:48.710> I<00:05:48.740> was<00:05:48.890> I<00:05:49.100> think<00:05:49.160> in

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
to fifteen how tall I was I think in

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.640 
to fifteen how tall I was I think in
your<00:05:49.580> seven<00:05:49.910> I've<00:05:50.000> like<00:05:50.180> five<00:05:50.480> foot<00:05:50.690> no<00:05:51.440> not

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
your seven I've like five foot no not

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.400 
your seven I've like five foot no not
five<00:05:51.920> foot<00:05:52.160> like<00:05:52.490> four<00:05:52.790> foot<00:05:53.000> eight<00:05:53.240> and<00:05:53.660> that

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
five foot like four foot eight and that

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.280 
five foot like four foot eight and that
is<00:05:54.560> very<00:05:54.770> small<00:05:55.100> so<00:05:55.340> um<00:05:55.490> yeah<00:05:56.210> maybe<00:05:56.990> one<00:05:57.230> of

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
is very small so um yeah maybe one of

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.420 
is very small so um yeah maybe one of
the<00:05:57.440> reasons<00:05:57.470> I<00:05:57.800> was<00:05:57.860> overlooked<00:05:58.280> because

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
the reasons I was overlooked because

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.540 
the reasons I was overlooked because
this<00:05:58.760> country<00:05:59.180> does<00:05:59.390> focus<00:05:59.960> on<00:06:00.550> physicality

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
this country does focus on physicality

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.800 
this country does focus on physicality
and<00:06:01.640> stuff<00:06:01.910> a<00:06:02.090> lot<00:06:02.330> more<00:06:02.510> than<00:06:02.690> other

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
and stuff a lot more than other

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.200 
and stuff a lot more than other
countries<00:06:02.960> but<00:06:03.740> yeah<00:06:03.860> I<00:06:04.400> don't<00:06:04.700> get<00:06:04.940> myself

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
countries but yeah I don't get myself

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.670 
countries but yeah I don't get myself
