00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
supply of the AV node let's first of all

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.880 
supply of the AV node let's first of all
remember<00:00:15.189> the<00:00:15.520> location<00:00:15.850> of<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.750> AV<00:00:17.050> node<00:00:17.080> the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
remember the location of the AV node the

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.429 
remember the location of the AV node the
AV<00:00:17.920> node<00:00:18.130> is<00:00:18.400> located<00:00:18.430> somewhere<00:00:19.180> here<00:00:19.330> in<00:00:19.840> the

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
AV node is located somewhere here in the

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
tricuspid valve and let's see the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.599 
tricuspid valve and let's see the
options<00:00:31.240> now<00:00:31.510> blood<00:00:32.109> always<00:00:32.710> comes<00:00:33.070> from<00:00:33.340> the

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:33.609 
options now blood always comes from the

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:36.060 
options now blood always comes from the
right<00:00:34.000> coronary<00:00:34.510> artery<00:00:34.960> no<00:00:35.320> blood<00:00:35.620> comes

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
right coronary artery no blood comes

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.130 
right coronary artery no blood comes
from<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.460> right<00:00:36.640> or<00:00:36.909> left<00:00:36.940> coronary<00:00:37.690> artery

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
from the right or left coronary artery

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.349 
from the right or left coronary artery
and<00:00:38.319> this<00:00:38.890> is<00:00:39.039> true<00:00:39.249> for<00:00:39.489> both<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.969> AV<00:00:40.329> node

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
and this is true for both the AV node

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.169 
and this is true for both the AV node
and<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:41.350> SA<00:00:41.710> node<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:42.129> SA<00:00:42.399> node<00:00:42.670> is<00:00:42.699> also

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
and the SA node the SA node is also

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.559 
and the SA node the SA node is also
located<00:00:43.719> in<00:00:44.109> the<00:00:44.170> right<00:00:44.949> atrium<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:46.239> it<00:00:46.420> is

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:46.569 
located in the right atrium but it is

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:48.329 
located in the right atrium but it is
located<00:00:46.899> close<00:00:47.379> to<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.679> opening<00:00:48.069> of<00:00:48.190> the

located close to the opening of the
superior<00:00:48.879> vena<00:00:49.659> cava<00:00:50.079> and<00:00:50.379> both<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.129> them<00:00:51.670> they

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
superior vena cava and both of them they

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.939 
superior vena cava and both of them they
might<00:00:52.120> be<00:00:52.359> supplied<00:00:52.809> by<00:00:53.109> the<00:00:53.350> right<00:00:53.649> or<00:00:53.920> left

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
might be supplied by the right or left

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.939 
might be supplied by the right or left
coronary<00:00:54.609> artery<00:00:55.149> in<00:00:55.329> different<00:00:56.199> percentages

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
coronary artery in different percentages

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.719 
coronary artery in different percentages
so<00:00:57.879> this<00:00:58.120> option<00:00:58.539> is<00:00:58.749> wrong<00:00:59.019> option<00:00:59.319> a<00:00:59.799> now

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
so this option is wrong option a now

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.059 
so this option is wrong option a now
blood<00:01:01.120> comes<00:01:01.420> from<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.870> septal<00:01:02.350> branches<00:01:02.859> of

about<00:02:22.510> 40%<00:02:23.349> of<00:02:23.469> the<00:02:23.650> time<00:02:23.920> blood<00:02:24.370> comes<00:02:24.670> from

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
about 40% of the time blood comes from

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.739 
about 40% of the time blood comes from
the<00:02:25.180> left<00:02:25.359> coronary<00:02:25.719> artery<00:02:26.319> no<00:02:26.769> it's<00:02:27.040> only<00:02:27.280> in

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:27.749 
the left coronary artery no it's only in

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.690 
the left coronary artery no it's only in
20%<00:02:28.749> of<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.049> time<00:02:29.319> that<00:02:29.859> the<00:02:30.129> blood<00:02:30.340> comes

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
20% of the time that the blood comes

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.629 
20% of the time that the blood comes
from<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.349> left<00:02:32.349> coronary<00:02:32.769> artery<00:02:33.310> but<00:02:33.430> this

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:33.639 
from the left coronary artery but this

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.780 
from the left coronary artery but this
40%<00:02:34.420> might<00:02:34.689> act<00:02:35.019> as<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.319> distractor<00:02:36.069> because<00:02:36.549> in

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
40% might act as a distractor because in

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.929 
40% might act as a distractor because in
the<00:02:37.180> SA<00:02:37.569> node<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.620> blood<00:02:38.829> supply<00:02:39.219> of<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.459> SA

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
the SA node the blood supply of the SA

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.990 
the SA node the blood supply of the SA
node<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:40.450> 60%<00:02:41.409> of<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.739> cases<00:02:41.889> it<00:02:42.340> comes<00:02:42.639> from

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
node in 60% of the cases it comes from

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.860 
node in 60% of the cases it comes from
the<00:02:43.239> right<00:02:43.870> coronary<00:02:44.379> artery<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.189> in<00:02:45.790> 40%<00:02:46.329> of

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
the right coronary artery and in 40% of

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.920 
the right coronary artery and in 40% of
the<00:02:47.049> cases<00:02:47.469> it<00:02:47.739> comes<00:02:48.099> from<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.930> left

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the cases it comes from the left

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.009 
the cases it comes from the left
coronary<00:02:50.939> artery<00:02:51.939> so<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:52.419> acts<00:02:52.719> as<00:02:52.959> a

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
coronary artery so this acts as a

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.129 
coronary artery so this acts as a
destructor<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.010> 40%<00:02:54.730> is<00:02:55.090> used<00:02:55.480> for<00:02:55.900> them

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
destructor the 40% is used for them

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.890 
destructor the 40% is used for them
blood<00:02:56.769> supply<00:02:57.189> of<00:02:57.219> that<00:02:57.540> conductive<00:02:58.540> system

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
blood supply of that conductive system

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.809 
blood supply of that conductive system
of<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.139> heart<00:02:59.319> but<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.709> 40%<00:03:00.129> is<00:03:00.609> the

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
of the heart but the 40% is the

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.119 
of the heart but the 40% is the
percentage<00:03:01.389> of<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:02.019> supply<00:03:02.379> of<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.769> SA<00:03:03.099> node

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
percentage of the supply of the SA node

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.390 
percentage of the supply of the SA node
by<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:03.939> left<00:03:04.209> coronary<00:03:04.629> artery<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:05.739> option<00:03:06.250> E

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
by the left coronary artery so option E

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.819 
by the left coronary artery so option E
is<00:03:06.699> also<00:03:07.299> wrong<00:03:07.599> and<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.230> answer<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.709> this

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
is also wrong and the answer to this

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.509 
is also wrong and the answer to this
question<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.519> that<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:10.000> AV<00:03:10.810> node<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:11.290> in<00:03:12.129> about

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
question is that the AV node is in about

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.479 
question is that the AV node is in about
80%<00:03:12.939> of<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.599> time<00:03:13.810> blood<00:03:14.560> comes<00:03:14.889> to<00:03:15.069> it<00:03:15.219> from

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
80% of the time blood comes to it from

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.680 
80% of the time blood comes to it from
the<00:03:15.730> right<00:03:16.239> coronary<00:03:16.840> artery
