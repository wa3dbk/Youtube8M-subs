00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.250
 hello together in the designers in today 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.270
 I want you the stylus of the company 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.960
 daggi imagine the b 508 of here on 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.520
 The tray is about 130 mm long 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.420
 and has a diameter of 13 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.760
 millimeters 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.760
 The color is black as you can easily 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.360
 can recognize and that is material 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.070
 aluminum which is very good at almost the top 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.949
 on top of it we have one 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.949
 small tip he is then plastic 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.970
 the dax looks very high quality 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.340
 I almost feel good too 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:01.260
 the design reminded a little 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.970
 a parka filler very chic, I think 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.920
 that he is not blinded one has 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.090
 no logo anywhere on it but it 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.190
 really a simple pen very much 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.450
 Stylish and fits perfectly with the iPad 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.130
 it also exists in different ways 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.370
 Variants we see immediately there is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.320
 also in color and so special 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.960
 Of course, this little tip is there 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.320
 on the front so this transparent 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.869
 something that works with that 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.890
 tray is to facilitate enormously 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.840
 small feather 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.540
 there is this plastic rain there is 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.340
 then again five protectors 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.250
 is there so that you this screen 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.080
 not damaged and about this little one 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.790
 Feather bends that in front as you do here 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.710
 looks and so you can really 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.360
 work exactly on the tray 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.520
 the advantage is through this 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.990
 transparent ring that we have in the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.560
 Immediately we find the pen 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.509
 do not blindly paint like 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.960
 for many actually for all others 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.569
 donate but with this stylus 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.700
 you then in fact the tablet in view 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.830
 and see where the tip is there I have a lot 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.910
 work closer 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.540
 it is then still here so one 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.910
 small replacement tip with errors and 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.040
 These are those five little ones again 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.640
 The plastic protectors are on top 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.780
 The stylus can be stuck in there 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.950
 different colours 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.290
 bhp 508 that's the black it gives it 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.870
 but then again in red stands there 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.300
 then there's the one with it, too 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.790
 material again aluminum the pin song 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.400
 So very good in the hand and happens 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.970
 then go for apple's ipad for that 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.810
 asus tray for htc so every 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.069
 Compatible stylus tray from there can 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.970
 you can give it to them too 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.970
 write and paint 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.780
 compared to the bamboo of 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.840
 welcome 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.290
 there we see clearly in front as well as 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.700
 most other stylus stylus says 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.410
 I think that has the son 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.360
 rubber club with which you then paint and 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.190
 should write that it is a bit irritating 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.190
 because you can not see the top that is 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.890
 Of course, when the extremely cleverly solved 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.260
 you still have the larger area 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.570
 front but through this transparent 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.150
 Tip you can see where you look 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.370
 straight on the surface is on the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.700
 If you work there, let's take a look 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.900
 in practice 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.270
 Please do not pay attention to what I am there 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.430
 just scrape but you can see now that 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.190
 it's about my perspective that I 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.390
 then at work year I have that 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.640
 have very good control over the pen 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.950
 I can just see where I am right now 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.180
 I'm working on a thinner brush 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.140
 tip here you can still one 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.180
 a little bit better so overall 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.400
 He really works like that 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.990
 with a normal pen and not like 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.540
 with a piece of chalk that's it 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.870
 very pleasant 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.580
 The pen is not very good in the hand 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.110
 because the aluminum is it 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.330
 not so easy but you had 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.220
 really a solid pen in hand 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.590
 in other tests I had read once 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.110
 that there are concerns about this 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.930
 lace it a bit fragile there 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.610
 I could not be in front 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.210
 first understand so if I 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:27.100
 not wild rabble does it all 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.140
 actually a very solid impression 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.500
 Here we have the example in the 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:36.460
 Comparison with the bamboo 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.320
 Writing is also very good 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.210
 anyway strange to my writing yes 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.580
 All in all, you can say the dummy 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.230
 a very nice product so everyone 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.850
 something more serious with the tray 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.280
 I want to draw you've sketchbook 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.030
 should use the three times 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.940
 look at 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.920
 a very serious alternative to 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.900
 all other products have this open market 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.420
 he looks smart 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.340
 similarly good in the hand and the idea 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.770
 that front is this transparent 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.660
 wrestle on it and thus the top 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.860
 I can see exactly for one 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.380
 very smart approach the pen feeling too 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.990
 get what you work for yes 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.720
 like to have a lot of fun trying out 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.669
 and in the article on this article 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.560
 Do you see the further details like 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.190
 exactly is pin and advance them 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.450
 then you can buy a lot of fun and 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.450
 good at working
