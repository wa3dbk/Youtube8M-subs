00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:06.933
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:12.733
 Today, the protagonist of our story is the American sixth-order fighter F4U-1. 

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:23.267
 In the tech tree, its predecessor is F4F. 

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:28.967
 F4U-1 only inherits HVAR rockets from F4F 

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:31.467
 This is not because F4F is too greedy 

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:38.667
 But because from the F4U-1 series, American fighters have become completely different, or become more Corsair style. 

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:43.200
 F4U-1 has better characteristics than its predecessor 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:51.467
 Durability, firepower, high-altitude performance and speed - even with initial configuration, the F4U-1 is better in all of these features 

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:54.767
 And they only perform better when they are configured at the top level. 

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:57.933
 However, no configuration is perfect 

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:05.333
 For these great features, the F4U-1 is exchanged for a longer average 360 ​​degree gyro time. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.500
 Now let's compare the F4U-1 with other sixth-order fighters. 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.667
 Durability is the most notable feature of the Corsair fighter 

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:20.967
 It has a lot of blood, especially when the top body is installed. 

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:26.933
 Only the German Focke-Wulf 190A-5 can proudly claim that it has the same amount of blood. 

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:29.067
 Speed ​​performance is also great 

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:37.967
 Even with the configuration of the main gun, Corsair is faster than most fighters, second only to P-51A and Yak-1M. 

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:44.567
 The only plane that can escape Corsair’s violent offensive is Mustang. 

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.967
 Corsair's weapon assembly options are also extensive 

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:53.233
 The cannon can make its breaking power reach the average level of the same fighter, and the range is quite good. 

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:57.433
 Machine guns for close combat, providing more intensive firepower 

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:04.400
 No matter which weapon configuration you choose, it will not affect the tactics of driving F4U-1. 

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:07.400
 However, its mobility is not very good 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:16.133
 When the cannon is configured, Corsair takes only a little shorter time to make a 360-degree maneuver than the P-51A and Focke-Wulf A-5. 

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:21.400
 This may seem a bit unsatisfactory, but for this aircraft, mobility is not critical. 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.033
 Now let's take a look at some of the more important factors and test Corsair in battle. 

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.433
 We are the first in the list of rooms 

00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:36.267
 This is good because Corsair is at the top of the room table like a cruiser standing in the middle of a group of sailboats. 

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:40.200
 At the beginning of the battle, climb to a height of about 2.5 kilometers. 

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:46.300
 Increase speed and fly to the enemy with a large group of Allied aircraft 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.933
 In fact, Corsair is the kind of aircraft that can be called "free hunters." 

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:55.800
 It can successfully intercept high-altitude aircraft, and can also take boom-zoom tactics for low-altitude targets. 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.467
 Corsair can even destroy ground targets 

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:02.300
 Just remember to maintain your airspeed and altitude. 

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.867
 "Run and run" tactics are most effective for light fighters 

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:13.967
 You can use it to deal with individual targets, or you can deal with enemy planes that are busy with melee. 

00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:15.733
 Don't forget to be careful 

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:22.900
 If it is followed by a large group of maneuverable and flexible enemy aircraft at low altitude, the height should be raised and the maneuver should be stopped. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.833
 Because of the high speed, you can easily get rid of the slower enemy aircraft. 

00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:31.133
 Heavy fighters are easier to fight back 

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:39.933
 You have enough maneuverability to dive behind the enemy heavy fighters, and you are faster, they can't escape from the battle zone. 

00:03:40.267 --> 00:03:45.900
 However, don't try to confront a heavy fighter or a ground target. 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.300
 Because you can't afford their powerful cannons 

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:56.067
 When it comes to attack aircraft, they are almost completely helpless with F4U-1. 

00:03:56.167 --> 00:04:00.533
 You can easily escape their firepower or escape easily if you encounter any danger. 

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:06.100
 Therefore, if there is no other target, you can not worry about fighting with the attack aircraft. 

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:11.567
 Now, let’s talk about the ground target again. 

00:04:11.967 --> 00:04:18.700
 If you decide to carry a bomb or rocket, you should first try to sneak into the enemy base and fly at high altitude. 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.700
 Launch a weapon and then engage the enemy aircraft 

00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:31.633
 You can also use the rocket to quickly destroy enemy attack aircraft and heavy fighters, but this is not easy 

00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:40.967
 Usually, the cannon is enough to knot the damaged ground target and lose any advantage to the enemy. 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.067
 Sometimes, maybe not very good luck, Corsair may also be at the bottom of the room. 

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:54.167
 In this case, you should not try to be a free hunter. 

00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:59.867
 In this battle, the enemy aircraft is more durable and the weapons are more powerful. 

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:07.233
 Therefore, it should be close to a large group of Allied aircraft to attack enemy aircraft that are already in combat. 

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:10.867
 In general, the tactics at this time remain basically unchanged. 

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:12.667
 Let's summarize it: 

00:05:12.767 --> 00:05:16.567
 The F4U-1 is definitely a great airplane. 

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:22.800
 Driving it can make a big contribution to the victory of every battle, and you will also like to drive it. 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:30.600
 The superb features create flexible tactics that allow the F4U-1 to take control of many dilemmas 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.867
 So, Corsair, start the engine, good luck!
