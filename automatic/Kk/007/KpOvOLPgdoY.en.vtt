 I'm placing so then I 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.530
 amounts not always ask me them 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.330
 tell what was going to do a 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.309
 cookies that can be like other 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.110
 we have done to stretch the dough with a 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.989
 roll and cut them with a cutter 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.670
 a form of cookies or by objects that 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.979
 We made cheese that were like a manga 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.750
 pastry for the creamiest texture and 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.879
 you can not do forms in this 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.620
 occasion we are going to make some balls bay 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.750
 the dough is a texture that I know that 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.940
 cook a ball and just put it 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.790
 in the tray and then it's already running 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.310
 shaped cookie is much faster 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.280
 and we are cool 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.600
 the cookies can carry nuggets of 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.210
 chocolate that you can buy in 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.979
 practically any supermarket 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.060
 but to me that we like doloso 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.310
 because besides they are not so 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.430
 natural chocolate does not put the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.140
 chocolate roll on tablet with 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.539
 translation of a table very got 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.500
 big so more rustic or used in 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.890
 the machine as well 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.510
 iquitos and the truth I like more I will 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.940
 make the recipe with Momix because 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.410
 the now handmade for a little bit to 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.880
 everybody's taste but you know that 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.340
 it is simply mixing the ingredients 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.330
 and did not find out about not having a machine 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.520
 ok let's have the recipe and there's a 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.890
 look for you to see how I do it in 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.660
 this case seemed to me now that we 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.910
 we were talking about putting some chocolate 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.619
 white I have it in the freezer a 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.630
 I'm just a little bit harder to be 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.030
 white chocolate has more fat and it 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.740
 melts more easily but you tell me 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.619
 how am I going to do the subject of 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.900
 black chocolate simply what 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.970
 we have to do is cut it that big 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.470
 with the knife with a lot these big 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.470
 they have curvature will be easier 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.280
 but the little ones 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.010
 look you see just like that 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.760
 for me it is ideal 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.709
 ah 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.870
 I eat in this case I will not put 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.750
 nuts'll put a little more 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.069
 chocolate so you have more trips 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.209
 but I started to put nuts follow the 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.209
 recipe the quantities 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:05.159
 it's your sorry guys while it's over 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.409
 cooling the choco all of our 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.499
 the fridge I will start with the mass of 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.239
 biscuits let's mix the butter 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:16.459
 which in this case are 200 grams of 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.459
 butter at room temperature 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.840
 remember that it was taken out of the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.890
 refrigerator a little before you put it in the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.819
 micro that is freeze and ready 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.819
 the sugar 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.540
 and eggs two eggs 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.680
 one 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.710
 good for those who owe house with 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.230
 thermos I will be the 15 seconds in 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.730
 Speed 4 if I do not say otherwise 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.580
 always it is usually speed 4 because the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.080
 speed to mix by endesa world 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.630
 more or less if violence that hand to the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.370
 which week do you see what is this type of 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.659
 dough 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.659
 sticky butter 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:06.499
 let's add that it has a 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.659
 complication break the flour to which 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:10.920
 let's add a teaspoon first 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.550
 of bicarbonate 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.550
 Hello 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.750
 You can buy this in any 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.750
 site in all supermarkets 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.630
 I take butter and butter 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.700
 the flour and the chocolate nuggets if 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.780
 we had nuts at this time 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.660
 add should be done to 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.940
 we add all the sounds for 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.820
 Mix 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.830
 reality is to mix it is 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.640
 very well we already have our plus and it's 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.120
 you see that the consistency is 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.610
 quite 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.719
 lasts 6 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.719
 this just starts 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.090
 the end of everything doing a little but 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.590
 is very good psychologist said already with the 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.170
 help from a teaspoon or if not with the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.540
 hands directly I do it with the 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.870
 hands to the end the best we do 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.639
 a little ball and we throw it a little is the 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.750
 idea of â€‹â€‹cookies this way not 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.750
 machines very well so typical gorditas 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.750
 american 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.819
 the American inhabitants are huge 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.830
 I do not know how the truth is right now 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.710
 but well let's do a little too 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.349
 to Spanish that if we do not have some 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.180
 giant cookies and then what I do 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:39.770
 with the door also today again that 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.600
 eat only one page then eating 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.420
 Four. Five 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.620
 the size of the cookie as you want 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.540
 also so much bigger is the 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.660
 true 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.530
 You see, the dough is gone 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.530
 commented after all the same 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.810
 nail 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.289
 salary of guards already larger than 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.969
 which of equal more honest edges 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.719
 I have said that mass has tied up 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:08.780
 with a certain brown color of 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:12.980
 chips of 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:15.230
 of chocolate that have been chopped more 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.009
 he stays with a little chocolate there 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.749
 I love the truth 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:22.939
 and if you want to buy pepito from 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.939

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.260
 large cuts like these we have not 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.930
 it arrived when messina was my that size 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.180
 but a little smaller still about 40 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.170
 cookies you know you can keep them 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.310
 in a closed tin with mint do but 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:49.530
 perfectly two weeks I do not think that 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.530
 as trying but could 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.719
 look what I meant to try 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:59.400

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.090
 indicated for this type of cookies but 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:05.340
 yes you can do this 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.930
 print a heart on the computer or 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.169
 drawing at hand if you have a bit of 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.120
 art and make a cookie dough from the 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:14.520
 of those of pastas to find the 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.770
 website how is butter or 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.069
 is the one that almost worth it because 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:23.219
 is to do with roller and make the way 

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:25.050
 with a clipper you report the heart and 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:28.139

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.610

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.129
 quite original do not pass a valentino

 large cookie made necessary 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:42.229
 about 30 but because they are quite large 

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:45.660
 will leave a lot 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:48.259
 about 20 minutes or so at 200 degrees 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.259
