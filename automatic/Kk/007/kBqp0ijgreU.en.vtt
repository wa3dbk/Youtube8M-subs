00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
to have to pay to get that I don't think

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.369 
to have to pay to get that I don't think
so<00:00:51.330> because<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.659> computer<00:00:52.019> term<00:00:52.170> but

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
so because it's a computer term but

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.189

and<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> Tegra<00:01:11.490> 4

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
and this is going to have a Tegra 4

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
and this is going to have a Tegra 4
processor<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.100> should<00:01:14.310> be<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.490> good

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
processor so it should be really good

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.340 
processor so it should be really good
for<00:01:15.060> gaming<00:01:15.299> especially<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.110> price<00:01:16.320> point

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
for gaming especially at a price point

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.029 
for gaming especially at a price point
of<00:01:16.850> 150<00:01:18.409> really<00:01:19.409> good<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.799> price<00:01:20.009> point

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
of 150 really good for the price point

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.130 
of 150 really good for the price point
and<00:01:20.579> I<00:01:20.939> would<00:01:21.270> definitely<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.840> from<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and I would definitely see it from the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.919 
and I would definitely see it from the
US<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:22.649> it's<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.789> a<00:01:24.119> curiosity<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.810> see

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
US but it's it's just a curiosity to see

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.929 
US but it's it's just a curiosity to see
if<00:01:25.170> they<00:01:25.350> will<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.920> think<00:01:26.219> if<00:01:26.340> they<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.549> good

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
if they will I think if they do good

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.719 
if they will I think if they do good
with<00:01:27.179> their<00:01:27.359> first<00:01:27.570> ascend<00:01:28.140> mate<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.770> coming

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
with their first ascend mate to coming

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.929 
with their first ascend mate to coming
to<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> US<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.990> maybe<00:01:31.859> they<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.549> more

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
to the US then maybe they can get more

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.819 
to the US then maybe they can get more
traction<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.509> put<00:01:33.719> a<00:01:33.749> android<00:01:34.380> game<00:01:34.530> console

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
traction to put a android game console

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.580 
traction to put a android game console
another<00:01:35.460> thing<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.609> worry<00:01:35.909> about<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:37.170> it's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
another thing I worry about is that it's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.959 
another thing I worry about is that it's
it's<00:01:38.520> has<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> Tegra<00:01:39.869> 4<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:41.039> coming<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.429> q2

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
it's has the Tegra 4 it's coming in q2

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.749 
it's has the Tegra 4 it's coming in q2
which<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.380> point<00:01:43.560> k1r<00:01:44.189> already<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.729> out

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
which at that point k1r already be out

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.029 
which at that point k1r already be out
so<00:01:45.210> why<00:01:45.450> wouldn't<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.170> kind<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.590> go<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
so why wouldn't you kind of go for the

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.770 
so why wouldn't you kind of go for the
future<00:01:47.369> technology<00:01:47.909> more<00:01:48.270> than<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> current

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
future technology more than the current

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.590 
future technology more than the current
gen<00:01:49.079> technology<00:01:49.289> or<00:01:50.009> maybe<00:01:50.520> even<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.149> know<00:01:51.179> I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
gen technology or maybe even you know I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.020 
gen technology or maybe even you know I
think<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.289> hundred<00:01:52.560> dollars<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> k1<00:01:53.460> with

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
think two hundred dollars of the k1 with

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.169 
think two hundred dollars of the k1 with
these<00:01:54.210> same<00:01:54.420> kind<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.689> specs<00:01:55.310> would<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.460> more

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
these same kind of specs would be more

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.410 
these same kind of specs would be more
than<00:01:57.479> worth<00:01:58.139> it<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.619> my<00:01:58.649> opinion<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.429> trump

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
than worth it in my opinion to trump

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.779 
than worth it in my opinion to trump

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
longer battery life than what we

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.280 
longer battery life than what we
experienced<00:03:38.700> on<00:03:38.910> our<00:03:39.210> pebble<00:03:39.660> smartwatch<00:03:40.080> is

course will you up sacrifice battery so

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.880 
course will you up sacrifice battery so
that's<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:51.960> to<00:03:52.020> be<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.140> two-day<00:03:52.530> battery

SmartWatch in the hands a lot more
consumers<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.340> other<00:04:23.490> question<00:04:23.820> is<00:04:23.940> is<00:04:24.150> will

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
consumers the other question is is will

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.600 
consumers the other question is is will
it<00:04:24.510> be<00:04:24.720> available<00:04:24.810> in<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.500> US<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.130> watch

it be available in the US and watch

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.000 
it be available in the US and watch
retailer<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.300> watch<00:04:27.480> should<00:04:27.660> carry<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.320> feel

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
retailer to watch should carry it feel

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.370 
retailer to watch should carry it feel
of<00:04:29.130> retailers<00:04:29.520> carry<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.120> in<00:04:30.270> bulk<00:04:30.600> then<00:04:31.290> we

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
of retailers carry it in bulk then we

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.790 
of retailers carry it in bulk then we
might<00:04:31.560> see<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.830> lot<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:32.630> backing

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
might see a lot of backing

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.499 
might see a lot of backing
board<00:04:33.949> but<00:04:34.280> if<00:04:34.460> retailers<00:04:34.849> don't<00:04:35.150> care<00:04:35.389> it

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
board but if retailers don't care it

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.140 
board but if retailers don't care it
then<00:04:35.659> it's<00:04:35.840> going<00:04:36.050> to<00:04:36.110> be<00:04:36.259> a<00:04:36.289> flop<00:04:36.620> in<00:04:37.550> my

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
then it's going to be a flop in my

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.860 
then it's going to be a flop in my
opinion<00:04:39.250> LG's<00:04:40.250> like<00:04:40.610> band<00:04:40.879> touch<00:04:41.360> there<00:04:41.690> was<00:04:41.810> a

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
opinion LG's like band touch there was a

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.469 
opinion LG's like band touch there was a
lot<00:04:42.229> of<00:04:42.259> fitness<00:04:42.770> bands<00:04:43.280> they<00:04:44.030> came<00:04:44.210> out<00:04:44.300> of

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
lot of fitness bands they came out of

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.480 
lot of fitness bands they came out of
CSI<00:04:44.810> mean<00:04:45.199> there's<00:04:45.500> I<00:04:45.740> think<00:04:46.039> there<00:04:46.129> was<00:04:46.250> over

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
CSI mean there's I think there was over

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.480 
CSI mean there's I think there was over
ten<00:04:46.819> it<00:04:47.120> was<00:04:47.150> just<00:04:47.569> so<00:04:47.870> many<00:04:48.169> like<00:04:48.379> razor<00:04:49.099> had

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
ten it was just so many like razor had

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.129 
ten it was just so many like razor had
one<00:04:49.759> Sony<00:04:50.150> had<00:04:50.389> when<00:04:50.569> all<00:04:50.780> these<00:04:50.900> different

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
one Sony had when all these different

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.920 
one Sony had when all these different
brands<00:04:51.620> had<00:04:51.740> one<00:04:51.970> LG<00:04:52.970> life<00:04:53.150> ban<00:04:53.360> was<00:04:53.569> probably

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
brands had one LG life ban was probably

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.080 
brands had one LG life ban was probably
my<00:04:54.470> personal<00:04:55.159> ones<00:04:55.370> I<00:04:55.550> would<00:04:55.669> say<00:04:55.789> if<00:04:55.909> I<00:04:56.060> were

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
my personal ones I would say if I were

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.300 
my personal ones I would say if I were
to<00:04:56.330> get<00:04:56.569> one<00:04:56.840> something<00:04:57.440> like<00:04:57.620> this<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:58.009> would

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
to get one something like this I would

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.089 
to get one something like this I would
get<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.520> LG<00:04:58.849> one<00:04:59.060> and<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.870> reason<00:05:00.110> why<00:05:00.259> is<00:05:00.590> it

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
get the LG one and the reason why is it

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.100 
get the LG one and the reason why is it
has<00:05:01.550> a<00:05:01.580> lot<00:05:01.970> of<00:05:02.000> onboard<00:05:02.419> sensors<00:05:02.870> for

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
has a lot of onboard sensors for

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.520 
has a lot of onboard sensors for
distance<00:05:03.740> speed<00:05:04.960> number<00:05:05.960> of<00:05:06.050> steps<00:05:06.229> you<00:05:06.409> take

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
distance speed number of steps you take

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.100 
distance speed number of steps you take
so<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.800> has<00:05:06.919> a<00:05:06.949> pedometer<00:05:07.659> calories<00:05:08.659> you<00:05:08.840> burn

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
so I has a pedometer calories you burn

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.379 
so I has a pedometer calories you burn
and<00:05:09.530> screen<00:05:10.069> ottoman<00:05:10.370> turns<00:05:10.639> on<00:05:10.849> you<00:05:11.090> lift<00:05:11.300> it

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
and screen ottoman turns on you lift it

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.080 
and screen ottoman turns on you lift it
up<00:05:11.509> kind<00:05:11.840> of<00:05:11.900> like<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.169> gear<00:05:12.639> so<00:05:13.639> that<00:05:13.940> that's

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
up kind of like the gear so that that's

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.059 
up kind of like the gear so that that's
really<00:05:14.479> nice<00:05:14.690> that<00:05:15.050> it<00:05:15.259> does<00:05:15.469> that<00:05:15.680> even<00:05:15.860> till

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
really nice that it does that even till

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:18.459 
really nice that it does that even till
its<00:05:16.190> time<00:05:16.219> which<00:05:17.030> not<00:05:17.509> all<00:05:17.539> of<00:05:17.930> these<00:05:18.080> watches

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:18.469 
its time which not all of these watches

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:20.800 
its time which not all of these watches
are<00:05:18.560> doing<00:05:18.860> but<00:05:19.340> for<00:05:19.550> 179<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.270> kind<00:05:20.479> of<00:05:20.569> seems

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
are doing but for 179 it kind of seems

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.680 
are doing but for 179 it kind of seems
to<00:05:20.900> do<00:05:21.050> the<00:05:21.080> best<00:05:21.520> out<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.580> them<00:05:22.969> all<00:05:23.150> and<00:05:23.449> it<00:05:23.539> is

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
to do the best out of them all and it is

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.510 
to do the best out of them all and it is
even<00:05:24.020> a<00:05:24.080> heart<00:05:24.259> rate<00:05:24.440> this<00:05:24.919> will<00:05:25.159> be<00:05:25.280> available

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
even a heart rate this will be available

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.640 
even a heart rate this will be available
in<00:05:25.789> q1<00:05:26.330> and<00:05:26.750> I'm<00:05:26.840> honestly<00:05:27.229> thinking<00:05:27.319> about

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
in q1 and I'm honestly thinking about

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.860 
in q1 and I'm honestly thinking about
reviewing<00:05:27.889> this<00:05:28.129> one<00:05:28.370> just<00:05:28.940> because<00:05:29.240> I<00:05:29.479> feel

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
reviewing this one just because I feel

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.050 
reviewing this one just because I feel
that<00:05:30.409> since<00:05:30.830> because<00:05:31.129> the<00:05:31.310> fitness<00:05:31.699> ones<00:05:31.909> are

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
that since because the fitness ones are

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.379 
that since because the fitness ones are
becoming<00:05:32.569> so<00:05:32.810> big<00:05:33.740> now<00:05:33.949> that<00:05:34.639> maybe<00:05:34.969> we<00:05:35.240> need

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
becoming so big now that maybe we need

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.879 
becoming so big now that maybe we need
to<00:05:35.419> start<00:05:35.629> comparing<00:05:35.900> see<00:05:36.229> which<00:05:36.379> ones<00:05:36.680> are

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
to start comparing see which ones are

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.990 
to start comparing see which ones are
the<00:05:37.069> best<00:05:37.099> out<00:05:37.460> of<00:05:37.490> them<00:05:37.759> so<00:05:37.969> far<00:05:38.900> this<00:05:39.199> is<00:05:39.380> my

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
the best out of them so far this is my

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.760 
the best out of them so far this is my
top<00:05:41.000> candidate<00:05:41.479> but<00:05:41.659> we'll<00:05:41.810> see<00:05:41.990> one<00:05:42.620> of<00:05:42.710> the

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
top candidate but we'll see one of the

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.170 
top candidate but we'll see one of the
main<00:05:42.889> competitors<00:05:43.310> of<00:05:43.460> course<00:05:43.669> is<00:05:43.819> the<00:05:43.940> sony

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
main competitors of course is the sony

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.629 
main competitors of course is the sony
as<00:05:44.479> well<00:05:44.990> as<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.590> traditional<00:05:46.190> ones<00:05:46.340> like<00:05:46.550> the

finally Qualcomm did announce that their
first<00:05:51.830> device<00:05:52.250> with<00:05:52.550> Snapdragon<00:05:53.180> 805<00:05:54.080> will<00:05:55.009> be

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:55.279 
first device with Snapdragon 805 will be

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.019 
first device with Snapdragon 805 will be
coming<00:05:55.610> out<00:05:55.990> will<00:05:56.990> ripen<00:05:57.259> may<00:05:57.830> now<00:05:58.699> this<00:05:58.880> is

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.029 
coming out will ripen may now this is

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:01.689 
coming out will ripen may now this is
really<00:05:59.210> interesting<00:06:00.199> because<00:06:00.250> we<00:06:01.250> don't<00:06:01.460> know

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 
really interesting because we don't know

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:04.839 
really interesting because we don't know
what<00:06:02.270> the<00:06:02.509> galaxy<00:06:03.289> s5<00:06:03.949> will<00:06:03.979> have<00:06:04.460> and<00:06:04.699> many

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
what the galaxy s5 will have and many

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.610 
what the galaxy s5 will have and many
have<00:06:05.029> speculated<00:06:05.479> that<00:06:05.750> well<00:06:06.050> what<00:06:06.229> if<00:06:06.349> it<00:06:06.469> has

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
have speculated that well what if it has

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.390 
have speculated that well what if it has
the<00:06:06.949> Snapdragon<00:06:07.759> 805<00:06:08.060> processor<00:06:08.650> that<00:06:09.650> is<00:06:09.710> it

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
the Snapdragon 805 processor that is it

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.209 
the Snapdragon 805 processor that is it
makes<00:06:10.639> sense<00:06:11.000> for<00:06:11.419> that<00:06:11.960> purpose<00:06:12.409> but<00:06:12.919> because

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219 
makes sense for that purpose but because

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:15.480 
makes sense for that purpose but because
it's<00:06:13.370> going<00:06:13.520> anime<00:06:14.090> I<00:06:14.509> at<00:06:15.349> least

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
it's going anime I at least

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.559 
it's going anime I at least
traditionally<00:06:16.490> Samsung<00:06:17.210> has<00:06:17.300> always

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:17.569 
traditionally Samsung has always

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.379 
traditionally Samsung has always
released<00:06:17.900> their<00:06:18.110> devices<00:06:18.620> 11<00:06:19.310> months<00:06:19.699> so<00:06:20.300> you

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
released their devices 11 months so you

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.200 
released their devices 11 months so you
know<00:06:20.659> we<00:06:20.840> had<00:06:21.020> the<00:06:21.229> s3<00:06:21.770> come<00:06:21.979> out<00:06:22.099> in<00:06:22.250> May<00:06:22.490> we

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
know we had the s3 come out in May we

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.700 
know we had the s3 come out in May we
had<00:06:23.419> the<00:06:23.629> s4<00:06:24.050> come<00:06:24.289> out<00:06:24.379> in<00:06:24.500> April<00:06:24.969> so<00:06:25.969> it

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
had the s4 come out in April so it

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.350 
had the s4 come out in April so it
having<00:06:27.710> the<00:06:28.099> first<00:06:28.400> thing<00:06:28.969> come<00:06:29.120> out<00:06:29.180> and

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
having the first thing come out and

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.899 
having the first thing come out and
Megan<00:06:30.050> would<00:06:30.469> be<00:06:30.710> about<00:06:31.159> two<00:06:31.430> months<00:06:31.580> later

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:31.909 
Megan would be about two months later

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:34.330 
Megan would be about two months later
than<00:06:32.150> what<00:06:32.389> the<00:06:32.840> traditionally<00:06:33.500> Samsung<00:06:34.219> will

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
than what the traditionally Samsung will

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.519 
than what the traditionally Samsung will
do<00:06:34.520> so<00:06:35.150> I'm<00:06:35.240> really<00:06:35.449> curious<00:06:35.719> to<00:06:35.900> see<00:06:36.110> how<00:06:36.500> this

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:36.529 
do so I'm really curious to see how this

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:40.029 
do so I'm really curious to see how this
turns<00:06:36.830> out<00:06:37.279> and<00:06:37.520> what<00:06:37.909> comes<00:06:38.419> about<00:06:38.569> when<00:06:39.050> it

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
turns out and what comes about when it

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.430 
turns out and what comes about when it
comes<00:06:40.069> to<00:06:40.370> this<00:06:40.490> processor<00:06:41.210> and<00:06:41.419> what<00:06:42.080> what

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
comes to this processor and what what

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.779 
comes to this processor and what what
are<00:06:42.529> they<00:06:42.620> gonna<00:06:42.680> be<00:06:42.800> the<00:06:42.919> first<00:06:43.219> devices<00:06:43.490> we

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
are they gonna be the first devices we

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.450 
are they gonna be the first devices we
see<00:06:44.000> it<00:06:44.089> in<00:06:44.180> we<00:06:44.719> can<00:06:44.870> expect<00:06:45.169> HTC<00:06:45.830> One<00:06:46.099> will

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
see it in we can expect HTC One will

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.980 
see it in we can expect HTC One will
have<00:06:46.610> their

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
have their

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.590 
have their
X<00:06:47.080> phone<00:06:47.260> out<00:06:47.530> before<00:06:48.040> then<00:06:48.280> as<00:06:48.460> well<00:06:48.610> and<00:06:48.970> as

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
X phone out before then as well and as

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.600 
X phone out before then as well and as
well<00:06:49.780> as<00:06:49.870> Samsung<00:06:50.500> so<00:06:51.100> does<00:06:51.250> that<00:06:51.280> mean<00:06:51.550> that

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
well as Samsung so does that mean that

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.460 
well as Samsung so does that mean that
LG<00:06:52.210> might<00:06:52.450> be<00:06:52.600> the<00:06:52.690> first<00:06:52.900> one<00:06:53.050> to<00:06:53.080> have<00:06:53.290> this

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
LG might be the first one to have this

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.940 
LG might be the first one to have this
processor<00:06:54.100> or<00:06:54.130> even<00:06:54.700> Sony<00:06:55.030> oh<00:06:55.360> who<00:06:56.350> else<00:06:56.380> would

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950 
processor or even Sony oh who else would

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.470 
processor or even Sony oh who else would
have<00:06:56.980> it<00:06:57.340> maybe<00:06:57.610> motorola<00:06:58.090> baby<00:06:58.330> they're

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
going to go back to making a high-end

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.650 
going to go back to making a high-end
device<00:07:00.130> as<00:07:00.370> well<00:07:00.400> besides<00:07:01.030> their<00:07:01.210> mid<00:07:01.420> tier

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 
device as well besides their mid tier

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.840 
device as well besides their mid tier
and<00:07:01.750> low-end<00:07:02.200> devices<00:07:02.440> it's<00:07:03.310> really<00:07:03.610> kind<00:07:03.790> of

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:03.850 
and low-end devices it's really kind of

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.490 
and low-end devices it's really kind of
curious<00:07:04.120> to<00:07:04.270> see<00:07:04.450> what<00:07:04.690> who's<00:07:05.200> going<00:07:05.380> to<00:07:05.440> come
