sometimes<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:07.150> turn<00:01:07.660> left<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:08.230> doesn't

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
sometimes you turn left and it doesn't

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.990 
sometimes you turn left and it doesn't
work<00:01:08.620> so<00:01:08.890> then<00:01:08.980> you<00:01:09.100> have<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.340> turn<00:01:09.490> right<00:01:09.550> it's

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
work so then you have to turn right it's

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.610 
work so then you have to turn right it's
just<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.240> way<00:01:10.390> that<00:01:10.570> it<00:01:10.720> works<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.320> you<00:01:11.470> have

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
just the way that it works and you have

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.510 
just the way that it works and you have
to<00:01:11.740> be<00:01:11.860> progressive<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:13.030> continue<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.930> grow<00:01:14.520> so

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
to be progressive to continue to grow so

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
couple things to bear in mind on this I

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.320 
couple things to bear in mind on this I
will<00:01:23.720> not<00:01:23.900> be<00:01:24.020> changing<00:01:24.520> anything<00:01:25.520> on<00:01:26.180> my

particular<00:01:30.160> endeavor<00:01:31.160> I<00:01:32.500> do<00:01:33.500> have<00:01:33.980> some

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
particular endeavor I do have some

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.100 
particular endeavor I do have some
rewards<00:01:34.790> for<00:01:34.940> pledges<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:35.720> there<00:01:35.870> are<00:01:35.930> only

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
rewards for pledges but there are only

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.660 
rewards for pledges but there are only
arbitrary<00:01:36.500> rewards<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.220> I<00:01:37.310> put<00:01:37.520> there

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
arbitrary rewards that I put there

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.220 
arbitrary rewards that I put there
because<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:38.030> felt<00:01:38.240> like<00:01:38.300> but<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.660> website

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
because I felt like but the website

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.590 
because I felt like but the website
wanted<00:01:39.680> me<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:39.860> personally<00:01:40.550> I<00:01:40.970> don't<00:01:41.390> really

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
wanted me to personally I don't really

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.080

know<00:01:41.810> if<00:01:41.960> I<00:01:41.990> want<00:01:42.830> a<00:01:42.920> reward<00:01:43.580> scheme<00:01:43.850> because

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
know if I want a reward scheme because

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.780 
know if I want a reward scheme because
it<00:01:44.180> seems<00:01:44.630> kind<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.310> incentivizing<00:01:46.310> for

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
it seems kind of incentivizing for

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.160 
it seems kind of incentivizing for
people<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.210> give<00:01:47.360> money<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:47.810> don't<00:01:48.020> really

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.020 
people to give money and I don't really
want<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.650> be<00:01:48.770> about<00:01:48.890> that<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:49.520> want<00:01:49.910> this

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
the system doesn't really register it

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.940 
the system doesn't really register it
because<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:39.050> tried<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.230> put<00:02:39.410> like<00:02:39.530> if<00:02:39.709> somebody

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
pledged a million dollars then I would

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.090 
pledged a million dollars then I would
take<00:02:41.630> over<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.959> world<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.320> marry<00:02:42.530> them<00:02:42.739> on

naked<00:02:43.550> pictures<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.120> know<00:02:44.209> stuff<00:02:44.420> like<00:02:44.570> that

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
naked pictures you know stuff like that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.759 
naked pictures you know stuff like that
but<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:44.930> didn't<00:02:45.080> really<00:02:45.140> come<00:02:45.350> across<00:02:45.440> too

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
but it didn't really come across too

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.920 
but it didn't really come across too
well<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.190> apparently<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.300> can't<00:02:47.540> go<00:02:47.750> that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
well and apparently you can't go that

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.750 
well and apparently you can't go that
high<00:02:48.140> which<00:02:48.500> makes<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.100> lot<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.250> sense<00:02:49.459> I<00:02:49.610> guess

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
high which makes a lot of sense I guess

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.920 
high which makes a lot of sense I guess
not<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.060> anyone<00:02:50.300> is<00:02:50.330> going<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.540> be<00:02:50.630> giving

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
not that anyone is going to be giving

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.000 
not that anyone is going to be giving
you<00:02:51.050> millions<00:02:51.410> because<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.709> just<00:02:51.769> doesn't

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
you millions because it just doesn't

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.340 
you millions because it just doesn't
make<00:02:52.220> sense<00:02:52.390> but

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.620 

this<00:02:56.980> is<00:02:57.130> an<00:02:57.250> experiment<00:02:57.790> for<00:02:57.910> me<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.150> see<00:02:58.360> if

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
this is an experiment for me to see if

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.780 
this is an experiment for me to see if
this<00:02:59.350> kind<00:02:59.560> of<00:02:59.680> endeavor<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.100> worthwhile<00:03:00.280> and

this kind of endeavor is worthwhile and

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
just to see the added level of

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.560 
just to see the added level of
interactivity<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.910> can<00:03:04.180> get<00:03:04.330> with<00:03:04.450> my

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.780 
spirit of what this is if I only made
one<00:03:44.440> video<00:03:44.710> a<00:03:44.890> month<00:03:44.980> that<00:03:45.520> would<00:03:45.640> probably

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
one video a month that would probably

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.940 
one video a month that would probably
make<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> lot<00:03:46.330> more<00:03:46.570> sense<00:03:46.630> but<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.140> don't<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.740> try

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
make a lot more sense but I don't I try

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.500 
make a lot more sense but I don't I try
to<00:03:48.010> make<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.460> know<00:03:48.550> at<00:03:48.670> least<00:03:48.700> three<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.240> day

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
to make you know at least three a day

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.990 
to make you know at least three a day
which<00:03:49.990> is<00:03:50.020> a<00:03:50.170> massive<00:03:50.740> turnout<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.490> if<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.820> were

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
which is a massive turnout and if I were

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.700 
which is a massive turnout and if I were
to<00:03:52.060> put<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:52.480> on<00:03:52.570> that<00:03:52.720> other<00:03:52.870> system<00:03:53.320> I'd

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
to put it on that other system I'd

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.680 
to put it on that other system I'd
essentially<00:03:54.430> be<00:03:54.550> robbing<00:03:54.910> people<00:03:55.300> and<00:03:55.510> that's

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
essentially be robbing people and that's

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.670 
essentially be robbing people and that's
not<00:03:55.840> what<00:03:56.050> this<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:56.350> about

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
not what this is about

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.960 
not what this is about
so<00:03:57.340> it's<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.450> monthly<00:03:59.110> based<00:03:59.470> the<00:04:00.340> subscription

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
so it's a monthly based the subscription

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.440 
so it's a monthly based the subscription

trying something new it might not work

but there's always the possibility that

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.900 
but there's always the possibility that
it<00:04:23.050> does<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.650> gives<00:04:23.830> me<00:04:23.920> another<00:04:24.310> avenue
