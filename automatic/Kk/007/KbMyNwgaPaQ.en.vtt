00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
corner but I can assure you that he

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.960 
corner but I can assure you that he
won't<00:02:23.080> do<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.260> from<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.950> first<00:02:24.250> time<00:02:24.550> you

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
won't do that from the first time you

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.800 
won't do that from the first time you
have<00:02:25.660> kind<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.260> three<00:02:26.560> four<00:02:26.860> create

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
have kind of three four create

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.690 
have kind of three four create
opportunities<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.840> punish<00:02:29.530> him<00:02:29.800> before<00:02:30.550> he

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
opportunities to punish him before he

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.630 
opportunities to punish him before he
can<00:02:30.910> pluck<00:02:31.210> it<00:02:31.450> properly<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:32.680> if<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.250> manage

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.030 
can pluck it properly and if you manage
to<00:02:33.670> perform<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.330> corners<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.530> same<00:02:35.770> way

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
to perform the corners in the same way

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.630 
to perform the corners in the same way
like<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:37.000> these<00:02:37.330> examples<00:02:37.830> you'll<00:02:38.830> be<00:02:39.040> able<00:02:39.490> to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
like in these examples you'll be able to

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.360 
like in these examples you'll be able to
score<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.120> from<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.660> first<00:02:40.960> try<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:42.130> good

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
score it from the first try the good

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.460 
score it from the first try the good
news<00:02:42.550> is<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.420> current<00:02:43.900> technique<00:02:44.200> is

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
news is that the current technique is

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.850 
news is that the current technique is
efficient<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.760> lower<00:02:46.030> as<00:02:46.630> well<00:02:46.990> as<00:02:47.230> in<00:02:47.650> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
efficient in the lower as well as in the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.340 
efficient in the lower as well as in the
higher<00:02:48.070> divisions<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.360> basically<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.140> can

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
higher divisions so basically you can

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.280 
higher divisions so basically you can
even<00:02:50.620> get<00:02:50.980> me<00:02:51.220> into<00:02:51.850> trouble<00:02:52.060> if<00:02:52.780> we<00:02:52.840> play

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
even get me into trouble if we play

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.310 
even get me into trouble if we play
against<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:54.220> as<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:55.030> won't<00:02:55.300> expect<00:02:55.780> this

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
against you as I won't expect this

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.340 
against you as I won't expect this
