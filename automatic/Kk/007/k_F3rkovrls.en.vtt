00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
is something that is almost living like

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.520

ticking<00:00:57.980> on<00:00:58.160> your<00:00:58.309> wrist<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:59.320> that's<00:01:00.320> why<00:01:00.559> we

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
ticking on your wrist and that's why we

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.710 
ticking on your wrist and that's why we
use<00:01:01.640> this<00:01:01.850> organic<00:01:02.210> ID<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.140> that's<00:01:03.620> why<00:01:03.830> I

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
use this organic ID and that's why I

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.719 
use this organic ID and that's why I
think<00:01:05.720> it's<00:01:05.900> it's<00:01:06.170> a<00:01:06.380> very<00:01:06.619> good<00:01:06.890> place<00:01:07.460> the

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
think it's it's a very good place the

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.150 
think it's it's a very good place the
world<00:01:08.090> war<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.630> have<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:09.440> kind<00:01:09.710> of<00:01:09.770> design

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
world war to have this kind of design

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.490 
world war to have this kind of design
because<00:01:10.369> it's<00:01:10.759> it's<00:01:11.660> technically<00:01:12.080> an<00:01:12.200> object

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
because it's it's technically an object

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.620 
because it's it's technically an object
that<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.460> have<00:01:13.640> around<00:01:13.970> your<00:01:14.150> wrist<00:01:14.330> all<00:01:14.479> the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
day right that is almost like a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:28.160 
day right that is almost like a
progression<00:01:16.670> of<00:01:16.910> yourself

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.810 

either<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.380> first<00:01:29.650> thing<00:01:29.860> I<00:01:30.009> want<00:01:30.220> people<00:01:30.640> to

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.030 
either the first thing I want people to
experience<00:01:31.600> when<00:01:31.900> they<00:01:32.080> see<00:01:32.259> my<00:01:32.380> design<00:01:32.770> is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
experience when they see my design is

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.450 
experience when they see my design is
that<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.880> want<00:01:34.240> them<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.930> want<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.259> touch<00:01:35.530> my

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
objects it's something that is essential

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.969 
objects it's something that is essential
to<00:01:39.880> me<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.420> this<00:01:40.630> is<00:01:40.750> something<00:01:41.049> that<00:01:41.590> goes

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
to me and this is something that goes

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.920 
to me and this is something that goes
through<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.340> eyes<00:01:42.549> but<00:01:42.939> when<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.210> want<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.690> be

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
closer to the objects and this appeal

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.300 
closer to the objects and this appeal
comes<00:01:46.600> through<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.200> feeling<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:48.070> the

the man with his hands just despair
hands<00:02:31.120> making<00:02:31.600> an<00:02:31.660> object<00:02:31.829> draining<00:02:32.829> objects

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
hands making an object draining objects

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.150 
hands making an object draining objects
and<00:02:33.519> touching<00:02:34.060> it
