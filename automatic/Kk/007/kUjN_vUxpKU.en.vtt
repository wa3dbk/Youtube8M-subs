00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
so tell me a little bit more about this

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.460 
so tell me a little bit more about this
exercise<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.360> who<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.870> might<00:00:15.990> be<00:00:16.049> ideal<00:00:16.289> for

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
exercise and who it might be ideal for

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.429 
exercise and who it might be ideal for
so<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.609> pretty<00:00:18.390> much<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> entire<00:00:18.869> population

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
so I pretty much the entire population

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.260 
so I pretty much the entire population
it's<00:00:19.560> ideal<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:19.890> him<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> reason<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.580> most<00:00:21.090> of

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
it's ideal for him the reason is most of

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.880 
it's ideal for him the reason is most of
us<00:00:21.359> sit<00:00:21.510> down<00:00:21.660> at<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.810> desk<00:00:21.840> during<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.410> day<00:00:22.529> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
us sit down at a desk during the day and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.140 
us sit down at a desk during the day and
if<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.189> don't<00:00:23.369> sit<00:00:23.519> down<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.760> desk<00:00:23.970> we're

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
if we don't sit down in desk we're

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.550 
if we don't sit down in desk we're
travelling<00:00:24.510> by<00:00:24.660> car<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.350> from<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
travelling by car to and from the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.589 
travelling by car to and from the
location<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.789> muscles<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.330> glutes

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
location so the muscles and the glutes

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.640 
location so the muscles and the glutes
and<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> lower<00:00:27.990> back<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> hamstrings

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
and the lower back and the hamstrings

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.769 
and the lower back and the hamstrings
get<00:00:28.920> really<00:00:29.130> weak<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.119> hip<00:00:30.269> flexors<00:00:30.599> get

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
get really weak and the hip flexors get

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.120 
get really weak and the hip flexors get
really<00:00:30.990> tight<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.410> we're<00:00:31.529> allowed<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.740> open

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
really tight so we're allowed to open

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.830 
really tight so we're allowed to open
the<00:00:32.219> hip<00:00:32.340> flexors<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.850> work<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.270> glute

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the hip flexors and work the glute

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.810 
the hip flexors and work the glute
muscles<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> hamstrings<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.160> so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
muscles the hamstrings all of that so

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.850 
muscles the hamstrings all of that so
another<00:00:36.210> reason<00:00:36.390> why<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.809> really<00:00:37.050> great<00:00:37.710> as

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
another reason why it's really great as

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.900 
another reason why it's really great as
well<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.100> because<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.370> always<00:00:38.520> work<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
well is because we always work the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.950 
well is because we always work the
muscles<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> front<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
muscles that we see in the front of the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.209 
muscles that we see in the front of the
body<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.500> happens<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.890> though<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.160> it

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
body what happens is though and it

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.440 
body what happens is though and it
creates<00:00:41.460> imbalances<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> back<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
creates imbalances in the back of the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.240 
creates imbalances in the back of the
body<00:00:42.629> which<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.230> called<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.590> posterior<00:00:43.950> chain

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
body which is called a posterior chain

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.770 
body which is called a posterior chain
so<00:00:44.700> want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> work<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> posterior<00:00:45.450> chains

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
so want to work the posterior chains

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.880 
so want to work the posterior chains
stay<00:00:46.020> away<00:00:46.200> from<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.469> front<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> body

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
stay away from the front of the body

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.889 
stay away from the front of the body
just<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.370> an<00:00:47.430> exercise<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.120> help<00:00:48.600> strengthen

because<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.409> really<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:34.829> using<00:01:35.340> those

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
because this is really about using those

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.249 
because this is really about using those
core<00:01:35.790> muscles<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> back<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.810> want<00:01:37.049> Sarah<00:01:37.229> to

core muscles in the back I want Sarah to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.840 
core muscles in the back I want Sarah to
put<00:01:37.439> our<00:01:37.530> arms<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> little<00:01:38.250> further<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
put our arms out a little further to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
put our arms out a little further to
side<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:39.960> gives<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:40.470> stability

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
side and that just gives more stability

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.069 
side and that just gives more stability
okay<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:41.970> she's<00:01:42.150> gonna<00:01:42.270> push<00:01:42.479> your<00:01:42.630> gluts<00:01:42.899> up

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
all the way now ideally how this

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.600 
all the way now ideally how this
exercise<00:01:45.840> works<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.860> want<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.130> hips<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
exercise works is you want your hips a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.880 
exercise works is you want your hips a
little<00:01:47.850> bit<00:01:48.450> harsh<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.320> these<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> little

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
little bit harsh so these are a little

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.770 
little bit harsh so these are a little
higher<00:01:50.220> than<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.549> knees<00:01:50.759> now<00:01:51.360> what<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
higher than your knees now what if you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.480 
higher than your knees now what if you
can't<00:01:52.140> get<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.470> because<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.860> don't<00:01:53.130> get

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
can't get there because they don't get

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.750 
can't get there because they don't get
out

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.760 
out
we<00:01:54.880> need<00:01:55.030> strength<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.660> squeeze<00:01:56.200> those<00:01:56.440> glutes

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
we need strength to squeeze those glutes

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.890 
we need strength to squeeze those glutes
together<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.280> push<00:01:57.460> up<00:01:57.640> so<00:01:58.300> that<00:01:58.480> is<00:01:58.630> level

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
glutes all the way up and you're gonna

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.490 
glutes all the way up and you're gonna
keep<00:02:42.700> those<00:02:42.880> oblique<00:02:43.540> muscles<00:02:43.960> strong<00:02:44.260> or

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
keep those oblique muscles strong or

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.290 
keep those oblique muscles strong or
glute<00:02:44.770> strong<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.340> your<00:02:45.430> hips<00:02:45.580> really<00:02:46.030> really

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
glute strong and your hips really really

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.000 
glute strong and your hips really really
high<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.110> now<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.590> harder<00:02:47.920> because

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
high so now this is harder because

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.640 
high so now this is harder because
Sara's<00:02:48.850> only<00:02:49.120> on<00:02:49.210> her<00:02:49.300> head<00:02:49.510> her<00:02:50.110> shoulders

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
Sara's only on her head her shoulders

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.590 
Sara's only on her head her shoulders
and<00:02:50.860> she<00:02:51.400> has<00:02:51.520> her<00:02:51.610> feet<00:02:51.820> obviously<00:02:52.000> on<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
and she has her feet obviously on the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.990 
and she has her feet obviously on the
ball<00:02:52.780> she<00:02:53.350> holds<00:02:53.770> this<00:02:53.920> for<00:02:54.190> 60<00:02:54.580> seconds

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
ball she holds this for 60 seconds

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.730 
ball she holds this for 60 seconds
that's<00:02:55.480> level<00:02:55.780> three<00:02:56.050> that's<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.380> hardest

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
that's level three that's the hardest

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.590 
that's level three that's the hardest
level<00:02:56.890> there<00:02:57.130> is<00:02:57.250> now<00:02:57.850> once<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.240> can<00:02:58.390> hold

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
level there is now once you can hold

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.420 
level there is now once you can hold
statically<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.200> want<00:02:59.470> Sara<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.740> come<00:03:00.010> almost

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
statically I want Sara to come almost

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.920 
statically I want Sara to come almost
all<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.730> way<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.910> ground<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.450> then<00:03:01.750> right

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
all the way the ground and then right

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.320 
all the way the ground and then right
back<00:03:02.110> up<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:02.980> now<00:03:03.130> we<00:03:03.190> add<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.490> dynamic<00:03:03.850> element

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
back up so now we add a dynamic element

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.080 
back up so now we add a dynamic element
to<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:05.200> come<00:03:05.410> down<00:03:05.530> slow<00:03:06.010> we<00:03:06.370> squeeze<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
to it we come down slow we squeeze the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.970 
to it we come down slow we squeeze the
top<00:03:07.330> where<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.660> glutes<00:03:08.050> come<00:03:08.290> all<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.830> way<00:03:08.860> up

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
top where the glutes come all the way up

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.550 
top where the glutes come all the way up
past<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.670> knees<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.180> then<00:03:10.690> back<00:03:10.900> down<00:03:10.930> slow

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
past the knees and then back down slow

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.680 
past the knees and then back down slow
and<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.190> helps<00:03:12.520> open<00:03:12.730> up<00:03:12.940> these<00:03:13.120> anterior

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
and this helps open up these anterior

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.570 
and this helps open up these anterior
chain<00:03:13.930> muscles<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:14.440> hip<00:03:14.620> flexor<00:03:15.100> is<00:03:15.220> all<00:03:15.430> in

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
chain muscles that hip flexor is all in

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.800 
chain muscles that hip flexor is all in
the<00:03:15.670> front<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.000> quadriceps<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.720> up

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
the front of the quadriceps and up

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.020 
the front of the quadriceps and up
through<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.110> ABS<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.650> then<00:03:18.280> back<00:03:18.520> down<00:03:18.550> slow

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
through the ABS and then back down slow

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.570 
through the ABS and then back down slow
now<00:03:19.450> your<00:03:19.600> goal<00:03:19.840> will<00:03:20.260> be<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.709> fold<00:03:21.190> each<00:03:21.370> rep

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
now your goal will be to fold each rep

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.220 
now your goal will be to fold each rep
at<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.850> top<00:03:22.060> go<00:03:22.300> full<00:03:22.540> breath<00:03:22.780> come<00:03:23.050> down

at the top go full breath come down

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.350 
at the top go full breath come down
slowly<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:23.920> don't<00:03:24.130> touch<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.760> then<00:03:25.150> right

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
slowly but don't touch it and then right

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.240 
slowly but don't touch it and then right
back<00:03:25.570> up<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.320> want<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.530> complete<00:03:26.800> 15

balance in the beginning and then find

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.800 
balance in the beginning and then find
your<00:03:33.280> center<00:03:33.610> of<00:03:33.640> gravity<00:03:33.730> don't<00:03:34.239> wobble<00:03:34.510> back
