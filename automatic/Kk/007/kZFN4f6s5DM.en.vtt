just<00:01:45.720> by<00:01:45.899> changing<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.530> signature<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.640> time

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
just by changing the signature the time

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.999

signature<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.350> speeding<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
signature and this and speeding up the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
signature and this and speeding up the
tempo<00:01:50.430> now<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> whole<00:01:51.720> different

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
tempo now you have a whole different

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.170 
tempo now you have a whole different

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
feel and I watch this with the metronome

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:06.219 
feel and I watch this with the metronome
in<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.450> background
