passive<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.770> what<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.220> it's<00:00:08.490> just<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.790> sound

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
passive is what it is it's just a sound

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.020 
passive is what it is it's just a sound
from<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.330> pickup<00:00:09.630> by<00:00:09.840> itself<00:00:10.429> active<00:00:11.429> as<00:00:11.880> a

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
from the pickup by itself active as a

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.140 
from the pickup by itself active as a
built<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.719> pickup<00:00:13.019> can<00:00:13.349> have<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.559> built-in

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
built in the pickup can have a built-in

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.990 
built in the pickup can have a built-in
EQ<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> pickup<00:00:15.809> more<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.039> these<00:00:17.250> days

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
EQ in the pickup more so these days

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.480 
EQ in the pickup more so these days
these<00:00:18.690> are<00:00:18.840> humbuckers<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.920> got<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> preamp

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
these are humbuckers it's got a preamp

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.859 
these are humbuckers it's got a preamp
so<00:00:20.670> that's<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> active<00:00:21.270> part<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.720> bass

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
so that's the active part of the bass

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.380 
so that's the active part of the bass
you<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> bass<00:00:23.220> that's<00:00:23.519> passive<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
you can have a bass that's passive and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.689 
you can have a bass that's passive and
active<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.769> switch<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.099> goes<00:00:26.340> from

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
active we have a switch that goes from

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.060 
active we have a switch that goes from
passive<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.570> pickups<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> actives

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
passive for the pickups and actives

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.319 
passive for the pickups and actives
that'll<00:00:29.429> engage<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.000> premium<00:00:30.769> so<00:00:32.180> this<00:00:33.180> has

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
that'll engage the premium so this has

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.420 
that'll engage the premium so this has
got<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.540> huge<00:00:33.840> output<00:00:34.350> there's<00:00:34.860> two<00:00:35.040> batteries

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
got a huge output there's two batteries

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.850 
got a huge output there's two batteries
in<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> back<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.230> that's<00:00:37.230> two<00:00:37.620> 9-volt

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
in the back of this that's two 9-volt

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.470 
in the back of this that's two 9-volt
batteries<00:00:40.250> that<00:00:41.250> gives<00:00:41.489> me<00:00:41.610> bass<00:00:43.550> treble

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
batteries that gives me bass treble

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.590 
batteries that gives me bass treble
and<00:00:47.050> this<00:00:47.920> is<00:00:48.010> good<00:00:48.160> parametric<00:00:48.790> mid<00:00:49.000> so

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
and this is good parametric mid so

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.330 
and this is good parametric mid so
that's<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.900> mid<00:00:50.080> control<00:00:50.470> that<00:00:50.800> selects<00:00:51.190> a

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
that's a mid control that selects a

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.830 
that's a mid control that selects a
frequency<00:00:51.880> and<00:00:52.290> this<00:00:53.290> is<00:00:53.470> cut<00:00:54.250> or<00:00:54.790> boost<00:00:55.540> at

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
frequency and this is cut or boost at

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.970 
frequency and this is cut or boost at
frequency<00:00:56.380> so<00:00:57.040> if<00:00:57.160> I<00:00:57.250> want<00:00:57.490> to<00:00:58.620> boost<00:00:59.620> the

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
frequency so if I want to boost the

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.610 
frequency so if I want to boost the
frequency<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.810> mid-range<00:01:02.170> I'll<00:01:02.470> hit<00:01:02.590> a

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
frequency in the mid-range I'll hit a

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.690 
frequency in the mid-range I'll hit a
deep

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:25.620 

so<00:01:09.700> that's<00:01:09.940> nasty<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.570> gnarly<00:01:10.720> Oh<00:01:11.640> cover<00:01:24.630> to

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
so that's nasty and gnarly Oh cover to

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.300 
so that's nasty and gnarly Oh cover to
get<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:25.960> sort<00:01:26.200> of<00:01:26.320> sounded<00:01:26.650> scoops<00:01:27.070> the

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
get that sort of sounded scoops the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.520 
get that sort of sounded scoops the
middle<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.950> I<00:01:30.250> prefer<00:01:30.610> an<00:01:31.509> active<00:01:31.900> base<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.170> lot

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
middle so I prefer an active base a lot

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.990 
middle so I prefer an active base a lot
of<00:01:32.650> people<00:01:32.950> do<00:01:33.160> but<00:01:33.640> some<00:01:33.940> true<00:01:36.000> vintage

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
went to these spaces it was a big step

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.660 
went to these spaces it was a big step
for<00:01:53.289> me<00:01:53.319> it<00:01:53.649> was<00:01:53.770> either<00:01:53.890> going<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.220> go<00:01:54.340> from<00:01:54.580> an

the<00:02:00.819> right<00:02:00.970> decision<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:01.869> I<00:02:02.140> took<00:02:02.530> an<00:02:02.800> L<00:02:02.950> Series

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
the right decision so I took an L Series

the right decision so I took an L Series
base<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> gig<00:02:04.539> as<00:02:04.690> well<00:02:04.899> I<00:02:05.190> played<00:02:06.190> this

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
base to a gig as well I played this

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.600 
base to a gig as well I played this
a<00:02:07.570> different<00:02:07.960> model<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.290> this<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:09.250> I<00:02:09.340> played

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
a different model of this and I played

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.820 
a different model of this and I played
the<00:02:09.640> wooden<00:02:10.210> passive<00:02:11.050> l-series<00:02:11.440> jazz<00:02:11.860> when<00:02:13.830> my

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
the wooden passive l-series jazz when my

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.920 
the wooden passive l-series jazz when my
notes<00:02:15.100> are<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.460> so<00:02:15.670> present<00:02:16.240> with<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.630> bass

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
notes are just so present with this bass

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.380 
notes are just so present with this bass
they<00:02:17.890> they<00:02:18.190> weren't<00:02:18.430> as<00:02:18.610> present<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.270> stage

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
they they weren't as present on stage

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.500 
they they weren't as present on stage
with<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.870> ulcers<00:02:20.170> for<00:02:20.590> recording<00:02:21.180> maybe<00:02:22.180> not

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
with the ulcers for recording maybe not

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.870 
with the ulcers for recording maybe not
Pino<00:02:22.960> Paladino<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.620> think<00:02:23.830> uses<00:02:24.130> an<00:02:24.310> old<00:02:24.460> P<00:02:24.670> bass

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
Pino Paladino I think uses an old P bass

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.960 
Pino Paladino I think uses an old P bass
still<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.170> sounds<00:02:26.440> great<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.070> it's<00:02:27.640> what

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
still and it sounds great so it's what

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.430 
still and it sounds great so it's what
you<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.890> four<00:02:30.280> string<00:02:30.610> passive<00:02:31.440> six

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
you like so this four string passive six

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.260 
you like so this four string passive six
