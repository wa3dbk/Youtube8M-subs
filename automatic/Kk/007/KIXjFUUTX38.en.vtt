actually was red berry I'm sorry about

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.229 
actually was red berry I'm sorry about
that<00:00:32.360> let's<00:00:33.360> open<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.780> up<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.880> we<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.030> see

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that let's open this up and we can see

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.590 
that let's open this up and we can see
that<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.600> inside<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.050> exactly<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.160> same

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
that the inside is exactly the same

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.590 
that the inside is exactly the same
actually<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> little<00:00:39.870> bit<00:00:40.020> different

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
actually it's a little bit different

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.030 
actually it's a little bit different
yeah<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:42.870> that's<00:00:43.170> probably<00:00:43.440> because<00:00:43.649> these

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
yeah but that's probably because these

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.880 
yeah but that's probably because these

our<00:01:57.799> conclusion<00:01:58.799> about<00:01:59.729> it<00:02:00.049> now<00:02:01.939> whether<00:02:02.939> I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
our conclusion about it now whether I

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.539 
our conclusion about it now whether I
would<00:02:03.270> recommend<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:04.079> over<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.070> red<00:02:05.280> berry

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
would recommend this over the red berry

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.969 
would recommend this over the red berry
gum<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.210> would<00:02:07.049> actually<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> go<00:02:07.649> with<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
gum I would actually have to go with the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.940 
gum I would actually have to go with the
red<00:02:08.129> berry<00:02:08.369> gum<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.879> feel<00:02:09.629> like<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.959> one<00:02:10.200> has<00:02:10.920> a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
red berry gum I feel like that one has a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.640 
red berry gum I feel like that one has a
better<00:02:11.220> flavor<00:02:11.720> lime<00:02:12.720> isn't<00:02:13.140> relief

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
better flavor lime isn't relief

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.280 
better flavor lime isn't relief
everyone<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.390> might<00:02:15.599> it<00:02:15.900> might<00:02:15.959> actually

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
everyone so it might it might actually

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.949 
everyone so it might it might actually
work<00:02:16.590> for<00:02:17.340> some<00:02:17.519> people<00:02:17.549> but<00:02:17.909> not<00:02:18.510> for<00:02:18.569> me<00:02:20.959> it's
