quick<00:02:56.910> defrost<00:02:57.910> method<00:02:58.330> is<00:02:58.510> put<00:02:59.350> them<00:02:59.530> in<00:02:59.709> cold

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
quick defrost method is put them in cold

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.430 
quick defrost method is put them in cold
water<00:03:00.130> for<00:03:00.940> about<00:03:01.030> 30<00:03:01.360> minutes<00:03:01.600> in<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.170> sink

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
water for about 30 minutes in the sink

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.020 
water for about 30 minutes in the sink
and<00:03:02.620> just<00:03:03.040> make<00:03:03.250> sure<00:03:03.400> they're<00:03:03.580> immersed<00:03:03.760> in

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
and just make sure they're immersed in

and just make sure they're immersed in
the<00:03:04.120> water<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.989> should<00:03:05.200> do<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.350> trick

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
the water and that should do the trick

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.410 
the water and that should do the trick
you<00:03:06.130> can<00:03:06.400> put<00:03:06.640> them<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.850> microwave<00:03:06.940> but<00:03:07.360> I

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
you can put them in the microwave but I

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.350
