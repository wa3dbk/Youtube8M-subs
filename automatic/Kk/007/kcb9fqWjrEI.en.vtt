00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:08.220
 it is necessary to see from which point of view yes 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.290
 can see this result 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.910
 if i go see the performance with the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.690
 sampdoria where we didn't take to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.550
 house no sun one point only 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.220
 then I say I hold these tight 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.840
 this result of these three points 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.970
 I'm fine tonight we have 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.460
 suffered most strangely then with the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.320
 numerical superiority maybe we were not 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.939
 accustomed because we have often played 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 in numerical inferiority in these 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.600
 matches the fear may have taken over 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.850
 to win 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.030
 we had to be better at going to 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.399
 attack the palermo immediately 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.809
 without forgetting that anyway 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.750
 palermo by players at level 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.649
 technician really important then 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.589
 I believe these two things have done 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.510
 yes maybe to lose some 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.339
 reference and not having the courage 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.530
 to go and win a game that was 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.879
 in our ropes 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.519
 because we played against one then two 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.009
 central and I had to keep them if he had 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.740
 possibly had two players in 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.840
 attack I would have put in three though always 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.819
 taking into account the numerical superiority 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.979
 we probably didn't push like 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.500
 we had those two full-backs of the times 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.350
 we were too tall with the two externals 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.630
 However, the alternative of Abbruscato and a 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.899
 code could give us more depth and more 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.890
 ball between the lines simply this 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:35.040
 we started very well 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.570
 we missed two three-goal balls for 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.360
 anything 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.680
 in the first half however the management of 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.840
 attackers ball must be 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.250
 different because every time we lose 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.290
 ball we go in numerical superiority 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.560
 we try to create it on the outside or 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.130
 sometimes we also stick to it 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.070
 we play too individual we lose 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.250
 which then not this instead of giving 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.340
 force to remove strength we are stretched 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.950
 because we probably even laughed from 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.930
 an important match 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.660
 two days ago where you don't have to 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.019
 forget that in 10 against 11 he has 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.940
 played more than half an hour then at 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.420
 Eve I had read that we had spent 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.830
 very 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.200
 so indeed it was so also 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.370
 if I would pay all the games to play 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.370
 with numerical superiority 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.470
 not then in the aspect of the then 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.200
 precise my culture to mine 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.500
 consider what i did in 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.110
 conference yesterday the fact of not being 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.150
 babysitter or not wanting to do it I wanted to 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.400
 just goad the players who 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.780
 less employees I have nothing 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.709
 to give criminals 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.060
 the team at the moment it seems to me 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.340
 that since the beginning of the championship I am 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.050
 happy and satisfied with the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.360
 performance that I still saw in 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.209
 growing and also of the work that came 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.330
 played by the boys I wanted to goad who 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.600
 possibly maybe not having the 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.959
 jacket or wine or little was used 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.970
 it didn't put me in trouble for 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.069
 being able to choose to be able to play it 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:21.010
 only this however is if I go to see 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.970
 all the balls he played I wanted 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.100
 I wanted to enter 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:30.130
 I was there to enter but I made a 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.700
 great goal is a great player 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.440
 quality can do better and we all do 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.940
 times we have suffered at once 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.550
 that's why then maybe the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.860
 team gets longer loses ball yes 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.370
 discourages is not short and among the 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.430
 departments 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.019
 because it is the ball management of the gods 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.290
 external must be done in a manner 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.290
 different
