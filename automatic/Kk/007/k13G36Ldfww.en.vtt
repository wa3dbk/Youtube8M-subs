00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.210
 I am going to teach you how to place the ropes 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:12.890
 in the first 4 they remove all the strings 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.780
 cut them here and then 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.910
 remove all the bits that can 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.220
 be here they are going to place 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.520
 the hole that you see here in the cylinder 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.520
 towards the front all towards the front 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.820
 on the 10 pegs 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.829
 so 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.030
 after he does in this procedure 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.030
 take out the rope 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.090
 opens 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.220
 grabbing one of the bending ropes 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.900
 a little bit the tip 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.030
 so that the rope does not get caught in the 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.030
 little bone there went up the rope 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.910
 remember you can place the other if 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.350
 they want or they can put the 11 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.550
 as I have both doors but 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.930
 I take the opportunity to put both 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.220
 after they place the rope 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.100
 they were completely 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.680
 and then we go to the top 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.760
 the first hangs the damos 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.340
 and we put it 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.940
 by the hole that has 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.140
 no s 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.140
 after he places it 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.540
 they raise the rope again as if 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.250
 they were sewing a little button 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.290
 and they do not replace it by the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.690
 hole but only once for the 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.810
 small 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.140
 and then do a little door here 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.610
 second a kind of a transita 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.550
 three or four times they catch her here between 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.030
 the grandmothers and the rope like an inch 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.810
 to an inch and a half and then give they go 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.810
 turning around 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.730
 in favor of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.040
 of the hands of the clock 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.410
 walking around back they were grabbing 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.120
 here so that it does not come loose 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.470
 they place it in the slot that 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.470
 corresponds here 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.510
 they will make the rope a little bit backwards and 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.150
 then the pica 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.819
 that there is no dot here that bothers 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.040
 is the procedure to place all 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.390
 each and every one of the strings and each 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.390
 one will do exactly the same
