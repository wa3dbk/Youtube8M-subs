00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 video 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.230
 and it looks like this is already recording 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.620
 very well this is already recording this already 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.620
 is recording 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.080
 and well let's go there 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.270
 they very nice guy welcome to a 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.090
 new video and this is in the micro 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.550
 360 box with a new tutorial and this 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.419
 I will show you how to make a rod 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.970
 good not but a farm of reeds 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:38.809
 automatic well fully automatic 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.450
 all we are going to need is what 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.790
 that I currently have in the inventory and 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.059
 as you see, I already have my captor 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.280
 new video guys so that's already is 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.470
 new and here I have a test for 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.830
 to see how it works here is already the 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.970
 cane are growing a bit and simply 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.970
 we press the button 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.360
 and the cane will be picked up by a hopper 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.180
 that will come to this chest as they see 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.960
 Here the cane is collected 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.970
 and well let's move on with the tutorial 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.140
 well we are here the first thing that 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:25.520
 let's do is a surface of 5 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:31.880
 blocks 1 2 3 4 5 and well rather for 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:37.190
 seven long one two three four five 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:41.170
 six seven and we just fill in this 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.170
 here we cover it 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.130
 perfect and so with the water bucket 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:52.570
 in both corners we have to fill 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:56.840
 in such a way that only 1 is left 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.689
 me like that so we can break it 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.590
 in such a way that it stays that way and then 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.200
 here what we would need is to place 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.110
 our block any block that 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.590
 we create we will have to place it sorry 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.730
 here we will place a block here here 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.209
 here with ton outlining everything 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.010
 our our base we have to 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:29.049
 outline the well all all up here 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:32.360
 and here we are going to place the pistons 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:36.590
 important that they are not sticky 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:42.019
 well here not here here here here 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:45.349
 very well here here here here here and 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.569
 here as we all know no cane 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.549
 it can be in areas where there is no water 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.440
 so in the corners we will not put 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.680
 nothing 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.120
 the next step is 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.430
 right here here listen to me guys 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.150
 here here is important behind the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.359
 pistons we will place two blocks two 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.269
 blocks so that the stones network the 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:16.389
 redd mechanism this happens just 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.389
 on top of the pistons in such a way so 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:25.379
 up here and we will go placing 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:29.670
 red stones all around by 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.310
 everything around here important is that if 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.489
 so we activate a button or any other 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.489
 thing 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.530
 the current is not going to get there is not going to 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.500
 get as much as if I put this here 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.530
 that is here here lunges lunges 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.920
 they are up here as they see here no longer 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.080
 it arrives so we will have to place 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.510
 it seems the corners are a repeater of 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.050
 red stone to expand all the 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.260
 energy the same would be here in this 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.260
 corner 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.650
 and so on and so and so in such a way that 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.440
 the pistons are open this 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:17.230
 we 're just going to lower it to a 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:20.859
 button a button that I have right here 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.570
 and here we have activity and disable 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.500
 we will see and subjective this practically 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.900
 is the whole mechanism and everything else would be 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.320
 question of you here for example I 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.600
 I'm going to dig a hole that arrives 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:41.690
 get here 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:44.240
 here I will place what is the chest and 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.920
 if they want to place about the hopper 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.200
 thing that the objects arrive 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.060
 directly to the chest will have to 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.330
 place the hopper as follows 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.840
 they will have to bend 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.630
 to the chest or very well in such a way that 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.990
 those little things are looking for the chest 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.090
 and here it would be almost everything almost everything not 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.070
 I say it's everything but we 'll have to 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.900
 plant 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.530
 Where are you 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.040
 bad is that this with me Trojans no longer 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.040
 it serves too much 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:25.490
 where are the crops are I 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:28.470
 he has thrown me the clamp 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.490
 and where are they 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.770
 ok here is maybe the cane and what 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.980
 next would be to plant it we will make a 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.780
 try to see if it works if 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.890
 he gathers them and everything so they do not have 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.890
 no doubt 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.150
 we will give height to the cane 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.830
 up here more or less because as you know 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.600
 Reed gets to grow anything else until 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.130
 three high I can put more 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.949
 Now if I want I can make a tower 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.169
 giant cane but as much as it grows 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.600
 it's up to 3 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.639
 very well here so 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.810
 and we are going to give the button 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.110
 3 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:16.400
 As you can see, it pushes most of the cane 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:20.479
 all that's why a semi-automatic farm 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:24.260
 here you can add the decoration 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:26.990
 as you want me here 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:30.260
 Do not add decoration to it either 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.020
 just plug redstone gestures 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:36.710
 the rest marks by in the blocks 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.690
 over here it would simply be everything 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.210
 I hope you liked it if it's like that 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.340
 leave me your like comments share and 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:47.740
 subscribe that that see you and see you in 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.740
 next goodbye videos 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.740
 attractive 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:04.670
 assets that still give us 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.670
 I'm a bit of encouragement and accessories
