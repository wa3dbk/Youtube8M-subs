be<00:01:51.450> cuts<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.530> different

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
be cuts here and just different

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.920 
be cuts here and just different
structures<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.430> their<00:01:53.579> abs<00:01:53.759> now<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.780> can

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
structures to their abs now we can

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.139 
structures to their abs now we can
define<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> degree<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> types

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
define that to a degree with the types

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.899 
define that to a degree with the types
of<00:01:57.329> exercises<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.890> also<00:01:59.130> think

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
of exercises that we do but also think

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.359 
of exercises that we do but also think
about<00:01:59.969> which<00:02:00.420> type<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.810> body<00:02:01.409> type<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.280> are

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
about which type of body type you are

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.550 
about which type of body type you are
now<00:02:02.759> if<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.090> have<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> very<00:02:03.780> long<00:02:04.020> back<00:02:04.290> and

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
now if you have a very long back and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.100 
now if you have a very long back and
short<00:02:04.860> legs<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.119> may<00:02:06.329> well<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.600> able<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
short legs then you may well be able to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.109 
short legs then you may well be able to
achieve<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.560> full<00:02:07.860> eight<00:02:08.099> pack<00:02:08.459> look<00:02:08.729> if<00:02:08.910> you

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
achieve that full eight pack look if you

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.380 
achieve that full eight pack look if you
have

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390

achieve that four pack look another
thing<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.830> ought<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.130> mention<00:02:20.360> nutrition

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
thing that ought to mention nutrition

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.660 
thing that ought to mention nutrition
now<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.840> lot<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.319> us<00:02:22.440> are<00:02:22.650> able<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.160> achieve<00:02:23.250> to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
now a lot of us are able to achieve to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.900 
now a lot of us are able to achieve to
some<00:02:23.910> point<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.660> upper<00:02:25.170> abdominals<00:02:25.580> here<00:02:26.580> and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
some point the upper abdominals here and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.210 
some point the upper abdominals here and
the<00:02:27.180> reason<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.780> well<00:02:28.590> there's<00:02:29.070> not

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
the reason for that is well there's not

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.949 
the reason for that is well there's not
that<00:02:29.280> much<00:02:29.550> body<00:02:29.820> fat<00:02:29.910> appears<00:02:30.480> below<00:02:30.690> our

that much body fat appears below our
chest<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.950> abs<00:02:32.160> are<00:02:32.520> here<00:02:32.700> if<00:02:32.850> you've<00:02:33.030> got<00:02:33.240> low

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
chest the abs are here if you've got low

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.030 
chest the abs are here if you've got low
body<00:02:33.660> fat<00:02:33.780> you're<00:02:34.140> going<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.410> be<00:02:34.500> able<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.770> see

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
body fat you're going to be able to see

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.550 
body fat you're going to be able to see
to<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> degree<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:36.150> ab<00:02:36.330> structure<00:02:36.840> here<00:02:37.020> what

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
to a degree the ab structure here what

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.290 
to a degree the ab structure here what
most<00:02:37.830> people<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.370> problems<00:02:38.660> achieving<00:02:39.660> is

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
most people have problems achieving is

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.780 
most people have problems achieving is
this<00:02:42.300> here<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.900> basically<00:02:43.500> what<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.220> or<00:02:44.520> looks

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
this here and basically what is or looks

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.810 
this here and basically what is or looks
like<00:02:45.030> lower<00:02:45.690> abdominal<00:02:46.440> separation<00:02:47.040> here<00:02:47.250> now

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
like lower abdominal separation here now

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.270 
like lower abdominal separation here now
really<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.660> just<00:02:48.959> lower<00:02:49.620> loss<00:02:49.890> or<00:02:50.100> their

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
really that is just lower loss or their

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.550 
really that is just lower loss or their
the<00:02:50.430> ABS<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.060> six-pack<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.840> more<00:02:52.350> up<00:02:52.530> here

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
the ABS the six-pack a more up here

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.979 
the ABS the six-pack a more up here
above<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.310> belly<00:02:53.519> button<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:54.180> when<00:02:54.840> you

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
above the belly button but when you

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.900 
above the belly button but when you
train<00:02:55.380> them<00:02:55.560> correctly<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.850> certain

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
train them correctly and to a certain

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.600 
train them correctly and to a certain
level<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.680> low<00:02:58.890> body<00:02:59.100> fat<00:02:59.190> level

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
level and you have low body fat level

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.150 
level and you have low body fat level
you<00:03:00.120> can<00:03:00.360> achieve<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.989> almost<00:03:01.650> eight<00:03:01.830> pack

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
you can achieve that almost eight pack

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.400 
you can achieve that almost eight pack
look<00:03:02.459> now<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.120> comes<00:03:03.570> down<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.900> nutrition

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
look now that comes down to nutrition

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.470 
look now that comes down to nutrition
it's<00:03:04.830> about<00:03:05.040> burning<00:03:05.580> away<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.970> body<00:03:06.180> fat

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
it's about burning away the body fat

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.600 
it's about burning away the body fat
that<00:03:06.690> men<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.140> women<00:03:07.290> accumulate<00:03:08.160> around

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
that men and women accumulate around

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.670 
that men and women accumulate around
their<00:03:08.940> midsection<00:03:09.570> women<00:03:10.230> typically

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
their midsection women typically

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.590 
their midsection women typically
accumulate<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.519> around<00:03:11.850> their<00:03:12.030> glutes<00:03:12.330> and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
accumulate it around their glutes and

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.960 
accumulate it around their glutes and
thighs<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.260> men<00:03:13.890> around<00:03:14.310> their<00:03:14.549> center<00:03:14.910> of

gravity also which of them is their
naval<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.090> I'm<00:03:18.329> going<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.600> leave<00:03:18.780> nutrition<00:03:19.470> to

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
naval so I'm going to leave nutrition to

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.860 
naval so I'm going to leave nutrition to
one<00:03:19.890> side<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.489> this<00:03:20.640> segment<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.239> show<00:03:21.810> you

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
one side of this segment and show you

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.350 
one side of this segment and show you
more<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.590> abdominal<00:03:23.040> exercises<00:03:23.760> inside

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
more of the abdominal exercises inside

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.199 
more of the abdominal exercises inside
now<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.690> final<00:03:25.170> point<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:26.100> abs<00:03:26.310> are<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.670> unique

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
now a final point the abs are a unique

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.050 
now a final point the abs are a unique
structure<00:03:27.600> once<00:03:27.930> again<00:03:28.200> let<00:03:28.290> me<00:03:28.380> show<00:03:28.560> you

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
become enlarged we can hypertrophy them

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.699

we can grow them out apps we currently

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.500 
we can grow them out apps we currently

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
do that they haven't got anywhere to go

that's<00:03:47.579> what<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:47.910> hear<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.150> lot<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.480> people<00:03:48.720> say

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
that's what you hear a lot of people say

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.590 
that's what you hear a lot of people say
when<00:03:49.019> they<00:03:49.110> talk<00:03:49.320> about<00:03:49.350> abs<00:03:49.769> ripped<00:03:50.610> chisel

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
when they talk about abs ripped chisel

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.410 
when they talk about abs ripped chisel
hard<00:03:52.200> defined<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.700> don't<00:03:53.730> hear<00:03:54.000> many<00:03:54.060> people

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
hard defined you don't hear many people

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.590 
hard defined you don't hear many people
say<00:03:54.570> I<00:03:54.600> want<00:03:54.810> big<00:03:55.019> blocky<00:03:55.620> thick<00:03:56.160> full<00:03:57.150> abs

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
say I want big blocky thick full abs

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.810 
say I want big blocky thick full abs
yeah<00:03:58.200> we<00:03:58.380> want<00:03:58.560> full<00:03:58.799> abs<00:03:59.070> but<00:03:59.430> we<00:03:59.549> want<00:03:59.670> them

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
yeah we want full abs but we want them

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.580 
yeah we want full abs but we want them
to<00:03:59.910> be<00:04:00.000> flat<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.660> we<00:04:00.810> don't<00:04:00.959> want<00:04:01.140> them<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.440> be

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
to be flat to we don't want them to be

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.220 
to be flat to we don't want them to be
protruding<00:04:02.489> out<00:04:02.640> from<00:04:02.940> our<00:04:03.120> shirts<00:04:03.510> we'll

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
protruding out from our shirts we'll

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.650 
protruding out from our shirts we'll
leave<00:04:04.380> that<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.799> big<00:04:04.920> body<00:04:05.220> balls<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:06.540> the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
leave that to the big body balls and the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.509 
leave that to the big body balls and the
reason<00:04:06.989> for<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.410> if<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:08.100> think<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.430> the

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
reason for that is if you think of the

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.880 
reason for that is if you think of the
app<00:04:08.700> as<00:04:08.970> like<00:04:09.329> a<00:04:09.510> sheet<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.140> muscle<00:04:10.560> along

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
app as like a sheet of muscle along

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.009 
app as like a sheet of muscle along

similar to their tibia anterior the

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.949 
similar to their tibia anterior the
front<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.470> cafe<00:04:14.269> it's<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.480> sheet<00:04:15.720> of<00:04:15.750> the

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
front of a cafe it's a sheet of the

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.229 
front of a cafe it's a sheet of the
muscle<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.410> attaches<00:04:16.700> from<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.820> sternum

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
muscle that attaches from the sternum

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.909 
muscle that attaches from the sternum
the<00:04:18.330> ribcage<00:04:18.720> all<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.140> way<00:04:19.229> down<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.680> hip

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
the ribcage all the way down to the hip

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:20.750 
the ribcage all the way down to the hip
flex<00:04:20.220> of<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.459> bone

flex of the bone

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.510 
flex of the bone
and<00:04:21.440> again<00:04:22.440> we<00:04:22.590> have<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.740> cross<00:04:23.100> section<00:04:23.490> of

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
and again we have the cross section of

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.690 
and again we have the cross section of
abs<00:04:23.940> coming<00:04:24.270> here<00:04:24.420> which<00:04:24.810> allow<00:04:25.260> our<00:04:25.530> torso<00:04:26.160> or

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
abs coming here which allow our torso or

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.120 
abs coming here which allow our torso or
core<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.840> core<00:04:27.870> isn't<00:04:28.290> really<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.650> muscle<00:04:29.010> it's

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
core the core isn't really a muscle it's

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.220 
core the core isn't really a muscle it's
a<00:04:29.250> group<00:04:29.520> of<00:04:29.700> muscles<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.210> we<00:04:30.390> think<00:04:30.630> of<00:04:30.780> for

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
a group of muscles that we think of for

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.920 
a group of muscles that we think of for
the<00:04:31.290> upper<00:04:31.560> torso<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.970> abdominals<00:04:33.420> their

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
the upper torso the abdominals their

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.620 
the upper torso the abdominals their
function<00:04:34.470> is<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.950> apart<00:04:35.670> from<00:04:35.700> stabilizing<00:04:36.510> be

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
function is to apart from stabilizing be

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.590 
function is to apart from stabilizing be
our<00:04:36.750> center<00:04:37.230> of<00:04:37.440> gravity<00:04:38.220> here<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:39.260> rotate

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
our center of gravity here is to rotate

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.440 
our center of gravity here is to rotate
bend<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:43.850> flex<00:04:46.670> so<00:04:47.670> we<00:04:47.880> want<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.180> try<00:04:48.420> to

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
bend and flex so we want to try to

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.780 
bend and flex so we want to try to
incorporate<00:04:48.720> as<00:04:49.200> many<00:04:49.410> different<00:04:50.250> exercises

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
incorporate as many different exercises

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.320 
incorporate as many different exercises
as<00:04:51.090> we<00:04:51.630> can<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:52.640> focus<00:04:53.640> on<00:04:53.790> all<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.180> those

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
as we can to focus on all of those

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.660 
as we can to focus on all of those
movements<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:55.050> some<00:04:55.410> of<00:04:55.530> them<00:04:55.650> involve<00:04:56.430> more

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
movements and some of them involve more

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.060 
movements and some of them involve more
than<00:04:56.700> one<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:57.450> know<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.570> rotation<00:04:58.290> with<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:58.740> side

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
than one you know a rotation with a side

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
allow us to bring that muscle out and

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.850 
allow us to bring that muscle out and
the<00:05:09.180> second<00:05:09.570> thing<00:05:09.600> is<00:05:09.870> because<00:05:10.590> of<00:05:10.740> their

your ab workout to hopefully achieve a
better<00:06:09.470> six<00:06:10.470> pack<00:06:10.710> which<00:06:10.950> for<00:06:11.160> most<00:06:11.280> of<00:06:11.490> us

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
better six pack which for most of us

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.630 
better six pack which for most of us
let's<00:06:11.880> be<00:06:12.060> honest<00:06:12.330> is<00:06:12.450> that<00:06:12.830> cornerstone<00:06:13.830> the

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
let's be honest is that cornerstone the

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.580 
let's be honest is that cornerstone the
peak<00:06:14.970> of<00:06:15.150> fitness<00:06:15.510> what<00:06:15.690> most<00:06:15.900> of<00:06:16.050> us<00:06:16.170> think<00:06:16.230> of

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
peak of fitness what most of us think of

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.890 
peak of fitness what most of us think of
when<00:06:16.830> we<00:06:17.040> mentioned<00:06:17.490> six<00:06:17.730> pack<00:06:17.940> is<00:06:18.120> a<00:06:18.330> lean

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
when we mentioned six pack is a lean

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.070 
when we mentioned six pack is a lean
healthy<00:06:19.890> fit<00:06:20.550> looking<00:06:21.000> body<00:06:21.180> and<00:06:21.450> that's<00:06:21.780> what

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
healthy fit looking body and that's what

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.230 
healthy fit looking body and that's what
I'm<00:06:22.290> trying<00:06:22.650> to<00:06:22.800> achieve<00:06:23.010> it<00:06:23.370> so<00:06:23.760> I<00:06:23.820> follow<00:06:24.060> me

I'm trying to achieve it so I follow me

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.600 
I'm trying to achieve it so I follow me
inside<00:06:24.360> and<00:06:24.750> let's<00:06:25.560> start<00:06:25.890> with<00:06:25.950> the<00:06:26.100> first<00:06:26.340> by
