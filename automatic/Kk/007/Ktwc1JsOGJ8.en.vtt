00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.130 
at the moment I'm using just the darkest
one<00:00:29.039> because<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:30.060> dyed<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.570> hair<00:00:30.599> quite<00:00:31.050> a

one because I just dyed my hair quite a
dark<00:00:31.380> brown<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.369> don't<00:00:32.579> need<00:00:32.700> a

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
dark brown so I really don't need a

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
dark brown so I really don't need a
lighter<00:00:33.030> shades<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.840> apply<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.530> use

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
lighter shades to apply it I just use

this<00:00:35.100> angled<00:00:35.640> brush<00:00:35.940> I've<00:00:36.329> had<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
this angled brush I've had it for a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.330 
this angled brush I've had it for a
really<00:00:37.500> long<00:00:37.620> time<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.489> quite<00:00:39.290> old<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:41.070> it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
really long time it's quite old but it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.209 
really long time it's quite old but it
serves<00:00:41.760> me<00:00:42.090> right<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.710> always<00:00:43.710> always<00:00:43.950> always

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
serves me right I always always always

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.360 
serves me right I always always always
start<00:00:44.760> with<00:00:45.750> my<00:00:45.899> arch<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.129> has<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
start with my arch because that has to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.410 
start with my arch because that has to
be<00:00:47.579> done<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:49.520> I<00:00:50.750> like<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.170> quite<00:00:52.440> dark<00:00:53.420> so

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
be done so I like it to be quite dark so

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.020 
be done so I like it to be quite dark so
that<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.780> actually<00:00:55.590> looks<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.550> something

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that it actually looks like something

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
that it actually looks like something
because<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.840> guys<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.109> probably<00:00:58.170> tell<00:00:58.649> I

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
because as you guys can probably tell I

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.470 
because as you guys can probably tell I
don't<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> lot<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.579> hairs<00:00:59.850> growing<00:01:00.210> up

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.030 
instead dip my brush make sure it's
really<00:02:16.730> really<00:02:16.970> covered<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.540> then<00:02:18.440> clean<00:02:19.010> it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
really really covered and then clean it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.460 
really really covered and then clean it
off<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.310> bit<00:02:19.610> on<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.000> back<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.330> my<00:02:20.480> hand<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:21.080> so

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
off a bit on the back of my hand just so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.520 
off a bit on the back of my hand just so
that<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:22.700> not<00:02:22.840> clumpy<00:02:23.840> or<00:02:23.930> anything<00:02:24.170> and

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
that it's not clumpy or anything and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.490 
that it's not clumpy or anything and
then<00:02:24.920> again<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.400> start<00:02:25.910> with<00:02:26.090> my<00:02:26.209> arch<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:30.410> I

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
then again I start with my arch and I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.729 
then again I start with my arch and I
just<00:02:30.769> do<00:02:30.980> very<00:02:31.250> light<00:02:31.670> feathery<00:02:32.540> strokes

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
just do very light feathery strokes

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.330 
just do very light feathery strokes
there<00:02:33.880> because<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:35.000> don't<00:02:35.060> want<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.800> be<00:02:36.950> too

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340

and do a few extra steps definitely do

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.020

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
that it's just my preference and then

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.880 
that it's just my preference and then
just<00:03:51.240> blend<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.660> upwards<00:03:52.080> like<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.470> did<00:03:52.650> with

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
some powder just set it because I just

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.080 
some powder just set it because I just
feel<00:04:11.870> it<00:04:12.020> lasts<00:04:12.350> longer<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:12.890> I<00:04:13.520> use<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.820> exact

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
feel it lasts longer and I use the exact

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.150 
feel it lasts longer and I use the exact
same<00:04:14.120> powder<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:14.990> brush<00:04:15.260> that<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.650> use<00:04:15.800> for<00:04:16.010> my

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
same powder and brush that I use for my

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:35.080 
same powder and brush that I use for my
other<00:04:16.340> brow

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.330

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
both but I usually go for the powder

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.930 
both but I usually go for the powder
more<00:04:51.230> often<00:04:51.770> because<00:04:52.130> I<00:04:52.250> feel<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.550> looks<00:04:52.730> more
