00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
only really going to use a lot because

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.450 
only really going to use a lot because
we<00:00:37.110> don't<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.320> messages<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.829> phone<00:00:38.100> i<00:00:38.129> took

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
them out of this world because this

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.869 
them out of this world because this
isn't<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> phone<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.250> there's<00:00:41.399> no<00:00:41.489> need<00:00:41.670> from

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
isn't the phone so there's no need from

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.119 
isn't the phone so there's no need from
as<00:00:42.320> we're<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> start<00:00:43.739> over<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> things

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
as we're going to start over the things

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.490 
as we're going to start over the things
that<00:00:44.280> don't<00:00:44.520> work<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.989> first<00:00:46.230> thing<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that don't work the first thing it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.700 
that don't work the first thing it
doesn't<00:00:46.680> work<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.640> video<00:00:47.969> capture<00:00:48.480> as<00:00:48.899> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
doesn't work is the video capture as you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.139 
doesn't work is the video capture as you
can<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:50.070> we've<00:00:50.250> swapped<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> video<00:00:50.789> capture

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
can see we've swapped the video capture

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.290 
can see we've swapped the video capture
here<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.829> after<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:53.190> three<00:00:53.520> seconds<00:00:54.030> or

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
here and after about three seconds or

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.590 
here and after about three seconds or
two<00:00:54.510> seconds<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.410> doesn't<00:00:55.710> work<00:00:56.600> so

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
two seconds it just doesn't work so

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.740 
two seconds it just doesn't work so
that's<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.840> bit<00:00:57.989> unfortunate<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> yet<00:01:00.480> video

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
that's a bit unfortunate so yet video

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.349 
that's a bit unfortunate so yet video
capture<00:01:01.109> doesn't<00:01:01.410> work<00:01:01.789> which<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.090> problem

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
capture doesn't work which is a problem

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.600 
capture doesn't work which is a problem
actually<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> signage<00:01:04.470> mod<00:01:04.769> seven<00:01:05.250> port

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
actually with a signage mod seven port

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.200 
actually with a signage mod seven port
it's<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> problem<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.140> particular<00:01:07.470> wrong

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210

as I intended for you to use it there's
not<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.320> any<00:01:28.560> problems<00:01:29.310> with

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
not going to be any problems with

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.600 
not going to be any problems with
graphical<00:01:30.119> glitches<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
graphical glitches really and is that

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.249 
graphical glitches really and is that
obviously<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> said<00:01:33.540> wireless<00:01:33.750> issues

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
obviously like I said wireless issues

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.770 
obviously like I said wireless issues
connecting<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.460> first<00:01:35.670> time<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
connecting for the first time can be a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.840 
connecting for the first time can be a
bit<00:01:36.900> awkward<00:01:37.020> normally<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.979> reboot<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
bit awkward normally a reboot and the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.929 
bit awkward normally a reboot and the
constant<00:01:39.299> trying<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.780> connect<00:01:40.049> will<00:01:40.290> fix<00:01:40.560> up

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
constant trying to connect will fix up

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.670 
constant trying to connect will fix up
so<00:01:41.939> yeah<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.299> problems<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:43.320> working<00:01:43.530> this

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
so yeah as problems then working this

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.440 
so yeah as problems then working this
wrong<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> lot<00:01:44.399> really<00:01:44.960> camera<00:01:45.960> works<00:01:47.450> as

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
wrong not a lot really camera works as

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.940 
wrong not a lot really camera works as
