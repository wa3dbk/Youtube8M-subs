I<00:00:10.980> just<00:00:11.980> recently<00:00:12.160> picked<00:00:12.520> this<00:00:12.670> bike<00:00:12.910> up<00:00:13.680> it

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
I just recently picked this bike up it

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.500 
I just recently picked this bike up it
was<00:00:14.950> in<00:00:14.980> pretty<00:00:15.310> rough<00:00:15.400> shape<00:00:15.550> when<00:00:16.029> I<00:00:16.119> got<00:00:16.330> it

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
was in pretty rough shape when I got it

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.500 
was in pretty rough shape when I got it
the<00:00:16.779> previous<00:00:17.350> owner<00:00:17.590> had<00:00:17.950> basically<00:00:18.510> painted

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
the previous owner had basically painted

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.350 
the previous owner had basically painted
it<00:00:19.660> black<00:00:20.020> and<00:00:20.610> he<00:00:21.610> didn't<00:00:21.939> really<00:00:22.029> do<00:00:22.240> a<00:00:22.270> very

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
it black and he didn't really do a very

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.960 
it black and he didn't really do a very
good<00:00:22.720> job<00:00:22.930> he<00:00:23.259> just<00:00:23.590> taped<00:00:24.070> off<00:00:24.310> he<00:00:24.700> didn't

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
good job he just taped off he didn't

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.089 
good job he just taped off he didn't
even<00:00:25.029> take<00:00:25.270> the<00:00:25.329> plastics<00:00:25.869> off<00:00:26.110> to<00:00:26.860> do<00:00:26.980> the

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
even take the plastics off to do the

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.900 
even take the plastics off to do the
paint<00:00:27.340> he<00:00:27.700> just<00:00:28.060> taped<00:00:28.419> off<00:00:28.630> some<00:00:28.989> parts<00:00:29.320> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
paint he just taped off some parts and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.100 
paint he just taped off some parts and
did<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.000> paint<00:00:31.210> so<00:00:31.480> it<00:00:31.630> kind<00:00:31.869> of<00:00:31.930> looked

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
did the paint so it kind of looked

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.530 
did the paint so it kind of looked
really<00:00:32.380> ugly<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.700> also<00:00:33.850> needed<00:00:34.149> a<00:00:34.360> full

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
really ugly it also needed a full

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.850 
really ugly it also needed a full
tune-up<00:00:34.930> it<00:00:35.079> had<00:00:35.230> been<00:00:35.380> sitting<00:00:35.530> for<00:00:35.649> a<00:00:35.800> while

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
tune-up it had been sitting for a while

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.099 
tune-up it had been sitting for a while
so<00:00:36.399> I<00:00:36.700> went<00:00:37.539> through<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.780> whole<00:00:37.870> bike

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109 
so I went through the whole bike

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.069 
so I went through the whole bike
refurbished<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:38.920> whole<00:00:39.070> thing<00:00:39.359> i<00:00:40.359> repainted

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
refurbished the whole thing i repainted

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.169 
refurbished the whole thing i repainted
the<00:00:41.199> whole<00:00:41.350> bike<00:00:41.559> with<00:00:41.859> truck<00:00:42.250> bedliner<00:00:42.670> paint

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
the whole bike with truck bedliner paint

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.810 
the whole bike with truck bedliner paint
and<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:44.469> my<00:00:44.620> opinion<00:00:45.010> I<00:00:45.100> think<00:00:45.309> it<00:00:45.399> came<00:00:45.640> out

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
and in my opinion I think it came out

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.500 
and in my opinion I think it came out
really<00:00:46.090> well<00:00:46.829> here's<00:00:47.829> some<00:00:48.010> close-ups<00:00:48.579> it's

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
really well here's some close-ups it's

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.619 
really well here's some close-ups it's
rubberized<00:00:50.339> paint<00:00:51.339> so<00:00:51.820> it<00:00:52.089> gives<00:00:52.300> it<00:00:52.420> a

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
rubberized paint so it gives it a

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.619 
rubberized paint so it gives it a
texture<00:00:53.199> or<00:00:53.440> rough<00:00:53.949> texture<00:00:54.489> and<00:00:54.730> it's

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
texture or rough texture and it's

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.400 
texture or rough texture and it's
extremely<00:00:56.260> durable<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.969> goes<00:00:58.149> on<00:00:58.300> truck<00:00:58.570> bed

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
extremely durable it goes on truck bed

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.819 
extremely durable it goes on truck bed
liners<00:00:59.800> on<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.760> bed<00:01:00.879> of<00:01:01.059> trucks<00:01:01.390> so<00:01:01.510> it<00:01:01.960> has<00:01:02.649> to

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
liners on the bed of trucks so it has to

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.000 
liners on the bed of trucks so it has to
be<00:01:02.920> durable<00:01:03.360> I've<00:01:04.360> done<00:01:04.600> this<00:01:04.780> on<00:01:05.500> other<00:01:05.800> bikes

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
be durable I've done this on other bikes

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.350 
be durable I've done this on other bikes
as<00:01:06.250> well<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:08.320> really<00:01:08.830> durable<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.820> stays

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
as well and it's really durable it stays

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.230 
as well and it's really durable it stays
on<00:01:10.570> there<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:12.130> won't<00:01:12.490> come<00:01:13.030> off

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
on there it won't come off

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.610 
on there it won't come off
like<00:01:13.900> regular<00:01:14.140> paint<00:01:14.500> so<00:01:15.400> I<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:17.350> highly

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
like regular paint so I would highly

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.700 
like regular paint so I would highly
recommend<00:01:17.650> doing<00:01:18.190> this<00:01:19.140> other<00:01:20.140> than<00:01:20.350> that<00:01:20.500> the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
recommend doing this other than that the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.180 
recommend doing this other than that the
bike<00:01:20.890> runs<00:01:21.160> great<00:01:21.370> it's<00:01:22.180> only<00:01:22.450> got<00:01:22.690> about

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
bike runs great it's only got about

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.230 
bike runs great it's only got about
9,000<00:01:24.190> miles<00:01:24.370> on<00:01:24.640> it

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
9,000 miles on it

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.240 
9,000 miles on it
it's<00:01:25.630> really<00:01:25.930> becoming<00:01:26.290> hard<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.770> find<00:01:27.010> K

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
it's really becoming hard to find K

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.900 
it's really becoming hard to find K
large<00:01:27.490> with<00:01:27.790> low<00:01:27.940> mileage<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.890> I<00:01:30.280> really<00:01:30.760> got

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
large with low mileage so I really got

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.640 
large with low mileage so I really got
this<00:01:31.090> for<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.810> good<00:01:32.020> price

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
this for a good price

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.130 
this for a good price
so<00:01:33.010> it<00:01:33.070> was<00:01:33.190> a<00:01:33.220> really<00:01:33.520> nice<00:01:33.670> deal<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:35.020> I'm

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
so it was a really nice deal and I'm

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.990 
so it was a really nice deal and I'm
enjoying<00:01:35.470> writing<00:01:36.040> it<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.490> came<00:01:36.730> with<00:01:36.910> a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
enjoying writing it it came with a

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.810 
enjoying writing it it came with a
little<00:01:37.210> trunk<00:01:37.600> in<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.720> back<00:01:37.990> as<00:01:38.200> well<00:01:38.820> the
