00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.420 
out the pressure cooker in just a couple
minutes<00:01:32.600> because<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.840> only<00:01:34.020> takes<00:01:34.290> about<00:01:34.430> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
minutes because the only takes about you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.450 
minutes because the only takes about you
know<00:01:35.550> five<00:01:35.820> minutes<00:01:36.090> or<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:37.350> cook<00:01:38.100> potatoes

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460

this<00:01:38.910> way<00:01:40.550> okay<00:01:41.550> so<00:01:43.820> we're<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:44.850> break<00:01:45.270> apart

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
this way okay so we're just break apart

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.580 
this way okay so we're just break apart
perfectly<00:01:49.130> cooked<00:01:50.130> ready<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.550> be<00:01:50.700> matched<00:01:50.970> and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
perfectly cooked ready to be matched and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.840 
perfectly cooked ready to be matched and
even<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.040> time<00:01:53.280> getting<00:01:53.580> it<00:01:53.729> ready

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
even with all the time getting it ready

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.880 
even with all the time getting it ready
and<00:01:54.119> cooling<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.600> down<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.990> still<00:01:55.259> took<00:01:55.590> less

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and cooling it down it still took less

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.940 
and cooling it down it still took less
time<00:01:55.920> than<00:01:56.820> bowling<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.690> stove<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.770> we

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
time than bowling it on the stove but we

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.580 
time than bowling it on the stove but we
used<00:01:59.160> a<00:01:59.280> lot<00:01:59.430> less<00:01:59.640> water<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
used a lot less water and so the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.469 
used a lot less water and so the
potatoes<00:02:02.250> are<00:02:02.430> ready<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.789> suck<00:02:03.030> up<00:02:03.210> whatever

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
potatoes are ready to suck up whatever

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.990 
potatoes are ready to suck up whatever
milk<00:02:03.930> or<00:02:04.200> cream<00:02:04.800> cheese<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.369> whatever<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:05.789> put

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
milk or cream cheese or whatever we put

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.980 
milk or cream cheese or whatever we put
in<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> potatoes<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:07.679> taste<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.840> used<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.959> lot

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
in the potatoes for taste and used a lot

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.070 
in the potatoes for taste and used a lot
less<00:02:10.259> energy<00:02:10.470> right<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:11.550> if<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.690> want<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.990> use

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
less energy right so if you want to use

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.600 
less energy right so if you want to use
your<00:02:13.200> pressure<00:02:13.410> cooker<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.010> stuff<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.400> that

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
your pressure cooker for stuff like that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.920 
your pressure cooker for stuff like that
it's<00:02:14.790> pretty<00:02:14.970> simple<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.480> we're<00:02:15.600> not<00:02:15.750> gonna

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
it's pretty simple and we're not gonna

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.630 
it's pretty simple and we're not gonna
