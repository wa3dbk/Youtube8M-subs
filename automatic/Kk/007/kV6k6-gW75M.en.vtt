00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.500 
experienced it
what's<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.519> upgrade<00:02:24.849> from<00:02:25.090> what<00:02:25.390> they're

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
what's the upgrade from what they're

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.949 
what's the upgrade from what they're
used<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.750> on<00:02:25.930> blu-ray<00:02:26.140> or<00:02:26.470> HD<00:02:26.890> sure<00:02:27.780> it's<00:02:28.780> a

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
used to on blu-ray or HD sure it's a

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.949 
used to on blu-ray or HD sure it's a
much<00:02:29.260> sharper<00:02:29.800> clearer<00:02:30.519> image<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.330> it's<00:02:31.810> not

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
much sharper clearer image and it's not

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.410 
much sharper clearer image and it's not
just<00:02:32.170> about<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.830> quantity<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.819> pixels<00:02:34.269> so

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
just about the quantity of pixels so

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.449 
just about the quantity of pixels so
there's<00:02:34.599> it's<00:02:34.870> got<00:02:35.050> more<00:02:35.440> pixels<00:02:36.099> on<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
there's it's got more pixels on the

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.400 
there's it's got more pixels on the
screen<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:36.970> it's<00:02:37.090> got<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.269> much<00:02:37.540> denser<00:02:37.840> image

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
screen so it's got a much denser image

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.160 
screen so it's got a much denser image
but<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.130> also<00:02:39.340> has<00:02:39.730> more<00:02:40.330> color<00:02:40.630> in<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:40.989> and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
but it also has more color in it and

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.770 
but it also has more color in it and
more<00:02:41.290> contrast<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.129> it<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:42.730> overall<00:02:43.299> it's<00:02:43.720> a

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
more contrast in it so overall it's a

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.780 
more contrast in it so overall it's a
much<00:02:43.930> more<00:02:44.080> beautiful<00:02:44.590> image<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.190> it's<00:02:45.700> a

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
much more beautiful image and it's a

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.000 
much more beautiful image and it's a
much<00:02:45.970> more<00:02:46.269> it's<00:02:46.900> an<00:02:46.989> image<00:02:47.200> that's<00:02:47.230> much<00:02:47.709> more

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
much more it's an image that's much more

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.490 
much more it's an image that's much more
what<00:02:48.640> you'd<00:02:48.790> expect<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.239> see<00:02:49.299> in<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.260> world
