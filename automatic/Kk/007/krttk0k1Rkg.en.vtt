00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.019
 high above the rooftops of rudolstadt 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.519
 the heidecksburg towers the 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.469
 most magnificent baroque palace of the 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.809
 eighteenth century in thuringia 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.460
 the diverse exhibitions and 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.700
 Collections inspire every year 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.920
 over 100,000 visitors on thursday evening 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.320
 But it was not the white gold that 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.670
 in the porcelain gallery lured the 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.220
 Visitors brought this time the 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.590
 magnificent objects even with ob 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.689
 loft find heirloom or purchased 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.050
 souvenir here raises the question is 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.070
 it art or clutter 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.650
 for the third time the event took place 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.930
 on the heidecksburg city ​​and similar 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.489
 as in the known television broadcast 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.070
 they were from the 40 or so visitors 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.780
 brought along pieces of three 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.790
 art experts of the museum appraised 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.500
 the scientific assistant 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.820
 jeanette lauterbach witten themselves 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.489
 while porcelain 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.860
 during museum director dr lutz unbehaun 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.450
 and vice president jens henkel for that 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.730
 interested audience more about 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.680
 graphics and paintings reveal 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.620
 So remind me a little bit of 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.110
 these quality paintings of mr 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.510
 boss or from the family endes there 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.850
 There were some porcelain painters and 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.770
 maybe it was also in the teaching of 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.520
 one of these this size 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.640
 I think a bit 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.460
 are worth more than normal plates 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.020
 It is part of a so-called tactic 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:33.619
 and didactics is from the name 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.380
 actually a ring ratio that is 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.610
 one likes to have such tactics 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.580
 cut stones 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.710
 this is certainly known somehow 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.760
 put in and you have these things in front 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.630
 all things 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.300
 nobility gathered in the bourgeoisie it was 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.960
 in a sense a collection of the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.830
 plaques classic education background 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.600
 when i disappoint this is awesome 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.490
 30 out could be 50 years and 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.700
 actually this dangerous pictures 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.660
 that you could buy at the bottom 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.820
 for the visitors to the heidecksburg 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.040
 it was certainly an exciting and 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.810
 Educational evening art and clutter is 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.120
 meanwhile a firm component of the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.010
 calendar of events the next 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.430
 It will be published in a quarter of a year 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.430
 give
