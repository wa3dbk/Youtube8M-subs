00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.080
 we continue with the series understanding the visit to paris insight let's see 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.560
 what are the requirements for a complete publication solution 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:10.959
 digital 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:12.769
 we must rethink 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.439
 how to build an endesa inc document according to the device it is going to 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:17.480
 addressed 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.919
 if we are going to build a digital kiosk for tablets 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.919
 of not taking into account that the changes have double reading 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.369
 vertical and after the rotation of the horizontal device 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.530
 in endesa in we will have to manufacture two documents one for the contents in 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.330
 vertical 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
 and another for horizontal reading 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.150
 In addition, reading on the device is provided separately by articles 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.930
 to also facilitate interaction with information 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.100
 we will have to manufacture a document and table imported from the articles 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.820
 for the correct structure of the document 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.930
 a second factor to take into account that resolution to which we will work 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.140
 1024 by 768 would be the resolution of the ipad 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.480
 also 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.520
 of the possibilities of the ninth that this action 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.990
 We can also offer the customer an interactive experience by adding 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.510
 Content rich multimedia content 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.400
 video audio the slide picture image slide 360 ​​images 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.060
 degrees panoramic image for all of mozart familiarize us with the format 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.350
 compatible file for different devices 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.220
 for example to publish an ipad we must use a track format in 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.740
 it even costs in high resolution like the toilet 64 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.740
 for the audio it is advisable to use the mp3 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.870
 in the use of images 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.000
 It is advisable to use images in jpg or png format 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.330
 so 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.840
 the knowledge and navigation capabilities is what will allow us 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.820
 create a much more professional concept 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.470
 so let's continue on the next series and let's see how 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.950
 we can involve sectors with interactivity 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.760
 within Endesa and let's see some examples
