00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.530
 my life perfect for another 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.980
 ps theory this time you the topic 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.650
 around 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.439
 Frankie for other future ability 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.330
 from them and around the moon 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.039
 which we can all look forward to 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.369
 frank in the near future a new one 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.189
 ability or a small one 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.140
 get a bonus that makes him stronger 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.200
 or give him an advantage 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.090
 to others and I could 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.579
 Imagine that a next ability 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.680
 to do something with a special gas 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.070
 But what kind of glass do I mean 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.430
 so I'm talking about a glass of what the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.130
 ability to fly or one 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.410
 Glass of water allows everything too 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.940
 to transport what I mean by that 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.560
 I'll explain a little bit now 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.810
 and why can I even care 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.150
 that there is such a gas or something like that 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.560
 something exists for a very simple reason 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.390
 because I believe that we have this gas 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.009
 already have planned in this balance 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.509
 which we now see here 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.329
 as we have seen the people have 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.159
 the gas is fully used from around the moon 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.320
 scarpia to come to have the robot 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.659
 also this balance to this guest 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.760
 uses to land on skype or her 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.159
 to come to the ground as well were 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.830
 also many balloons under par without appointment 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.870
 what we saw in the last chapter 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.520
 where there was pressure on the island and me 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.020
 believe that with the balance easy 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.170
 it is possible that the so much 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.870
 Because so many people transport 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.810
 the balance is attached to their ships 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.909
 have to go to the sky, however 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.860
 to explore or sky island 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.270
 explore as well as now, for example 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.210
 in the movie above 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.040
 There the old gentleman also has jauchs 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.470
 his house is attached and then it is easy 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.540
 once flown through the area 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.540
 It would also be a possibility 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.460
 for yb come to this island who 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.369
 without him having a blog upstream now 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.780
 must have searched so the balance 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.250
 now humans and robots 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.950
 drift up or up 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.440
 have promoted a very very good 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.750
 strong gas in itself but what is that 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.490
 future of this gas i think that 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.780
 frankie wants to find this gas and 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.710
 then there are two possibilities what he 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.650
 could do with it 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.370
 pack this gas inside yourself 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.830
 or yes a machine develops so that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.060
 he in his body that gas 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.470
 the weir is able to produce 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.940
 fly and could decide if we 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.320
 want to fly now or if he wants to go 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.480
 also wants the other option 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.760
 would that he used this gas with 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.000
 that sami fly to the moon like in that 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.370
 film the adventures of why münchhausen 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.010
 has baron münchhausen also sue 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.450
 use to fly to the moon 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.060
 besides, peace is very very very much 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.700
 very much inspired by this movie 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.250
 such as the spotted kites of 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.709
 eye or probably later as well 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.270
 straw hat pirates because the moon is coming 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.830
 yes also in the balloon on the ship 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.570
 attach as we already do 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.790
 have seen that the balance 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.350
 which have been possible from the moon to 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.480
 earth to travel 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.290
 also the island where he is right now 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.810
 hot baron terminal if that's what 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.269
 with the 1500 or I can not now 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.310
 not say but it could be 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.380
 that something has to do with film because they are 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.610
 the whole balance and we film that 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.140
 also lost with 1 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.170
 maybe that's the island too 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.480
 the mare before the travel comfort the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.060
 he fly to the moon and learn 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.370
 a little bit more about the moon or the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.440
 monde this in the multi site is so 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.209
 now again briefly summarized as follows 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.500
 strange as world probably this gas 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.440
 Find and develop this glass 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.019
 This perfect what these strong 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.120
 balance will have this gas 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.920
 for you use it yourself to fly 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.230
 or is this gas also likely 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.150
 use that to the moon now 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.579
 to fly or if we are that moon 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.560
 finally get to see adventures like this 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.630
 that and my little theory too 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.280
 this balance and frankie future 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.400
 is missing what do you think 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.900
 this is all sitting 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.030
 it totally huda there was something or not 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.790
 or I have something completely wrong now 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.099
 wrong was devised occasion completely 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.659
 wrong thought me for your opinion 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.430
 really interested write down there 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.909
 purely next time haut rein're 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.909
 look
