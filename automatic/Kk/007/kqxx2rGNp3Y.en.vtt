00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:07.589
 hello to all the last video promised that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:13.610
 will show what I do not use any other 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.610
 water stones for good knife sharpening 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:22.789
 as promised i show principle he is the first 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:30.240
 pebble is a common pebble 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:35.489
 i i rarely favor this rough stone by 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.850
 my 150 200 80 he he he is there 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.160
 each 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.329
 the hardware store is standing there 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.550
 within two dollars total find it 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.570
 then you can still talk about him not 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.129
 I will be like this principle is not a problem here 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:58.010
 problem with fine-grained 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:01.079
 water karmas like they are very expensive 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.800
 traded on the face of the volume of 100 dollars and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.580
 above 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.659
 In general, as an alternative, I found a very 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.140
 the water stone was going pretty well 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.479
 firm rondel so i put knives 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.600
 that is, if nothing profiteers alive because 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.520
 this stone and came complete with these on 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.180
 with knife kit 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.580
 cost 25 dollars that is it is very 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.380
 cheap like a set of three knives 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:38.520
 monster here is an average balance of 30 30 x 13 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.220
 hardness I measured about 50 units for 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.950
 the kitchen in general will come down science man here 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:54.380
 the other side is somewhere around 360g 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:57.810
 and the shallow side in the detail area i.e. 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.890
 about 800 grit but I suspect that day 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:06.180
 the possibility of thousands of firs that is in 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.060
 principle in on the packaging itself is written 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.560
 how much is the grain of this Kansk 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.410
 but there was still damage 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.930
 pebble is sold separately here and the company 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.470
 which is clearly written that with one 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.190
 parties 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:27.120
 400 grid in the other side 1000 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:30.120
 that is, the principle and value he has there 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.880
 already hears 30 dollars well too 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.860
 available principle i use it 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:41.130
 pebble is basically this pebble using 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.190
 easy to rule in principle, very not 2 then 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.680
 there is further after 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.620
 here is the finish that is a small drop 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.430
 thousands of grain killed and use this 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.140
 just chic 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.409
 there is also a wooden bar in principle and on 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.930
 double sided tape apple knit 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:06.530
 emery paper that is fed into the car 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:11.519
 and marv 2,500 and r3000 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:15.030
 but this is equivalent in principle to 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.150
 waterstone then the 2000 grid that is here 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.840
 one piece 2 is huge and the finish is not 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.290
 answer flock two pastes on the skin i 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.530
 I use tanks farm pastor blue and 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.889
 post white and blue group white more 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.280
 more entered you can give a super finish. 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:40.319
 Under the amendment, in principle, it is clear that 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.450
 blue too much remains so 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.569
 a little damn black takes off again 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.500
 takes off 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:53.730
 that's basically here after the two of 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.949
 Art knives are optical and perfect even here 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.879
 despite 3 played for . 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.879
 do not look down 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.800
 but 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:29.760
 photos are perfect i.e. at least 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.560
 cost is $ 25 with a set 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.300
 knives + 2 dollars for systems dollar plus 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.230
 sandpaper there costs 1 dollar 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:43.830
 a large sheet of steep skin 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.050
 dialogs I will also indicate where I bought very 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.180
 cheap because i see that too 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.900
 many people ask for these to deliver as 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.110
 there would be a real price there are three even three 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.090
 dollars are not here for 1 pack that is 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.950
 we have a jewelry company that 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.910
 will expose there is an online store and they 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:06.240
 I will also indicate the principle I will also indicate the name 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.800
 these knives and photos lay out to 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.660
 it was convenient to anyone interested in general in 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.300
 principle of these tools 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:19.170
 enough to sharpen a knife 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.870
 before the string i have the principle of the wine test the same 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.330
 I'll post it later to show you how it is 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.260
 test it is interesting to see to make 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.740
 subscribe in general subscribe 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.600
 huskies 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.600
 thanks now for him
