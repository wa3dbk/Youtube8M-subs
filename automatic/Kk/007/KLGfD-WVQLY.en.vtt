00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.779
 unboxing and review of the tripod plus arm 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.779
 mkc 301 model 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.380
 after a long time pulling with a 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.720
 pretty bad tripod I 've decided 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.610
 buy a more decent one specifically 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.329
 This model of the photo of the series 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.850
 compact 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.230
 leave the load with several illustrations 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.210
 in which it indicates that the model is 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.780
 designed for both videos and for 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.780
 Photographs 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.670
 the higher rate our 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.830
 basic features such as height 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.830
 Weight and load capacity 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.260
 the opening of the box is simple and 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.840
 original since it is about three closing 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.850
 Velcro potato bottom shows two 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.770
 illustrations with features 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.730
 that this tripod offers as well as a 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.730
 Quick use guide 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.410
 inside we find the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.530
 tripod the instructions in several 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.530
 Languages 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.760
 God 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.230
 and a guide with basic care 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.230
 also in several languages 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.500
 as we can see it is about 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.110
 case model 301 of the series that 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.659
 we mark in the hands the tripod it shows 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.939
 lightweight at the same time robust 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.829
 It has economic rubber grip with 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.049
 very good fast shoe grip with 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.000
 screw threads and has vih the 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.979
 head is the type of ball break 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.569
 with a single wheel- shaped control 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.369
 that backwards is released for 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.310
 move it freely and forward 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.840
 ensures the head to lock in a 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.880
 side has a selector to change the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.880
 head to video mode like photography 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.320
 accompanying the clip has a small 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.090
 manual with the benefits and 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.270
 practical specifications in different 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.270
 Languages 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.910
 as we mentioned earlier when dealing with 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.280
 of a ball head 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.990
 they just own selector is about 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.540
 some wheels that makes the operation of 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.170
 lock and unlock the head be 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.170
 Fast and easy 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.320
 up to 22 in four sections 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.290
 allowing us a height that varies 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.040
 from 40 and 45 to 134 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.040
 centimeters 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.240
 besides the central column also 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.280
 adjusted gives us a height 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.310
 additional that can reach up to a 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.800
 total of 154 centimeters 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.750
 selector that allows us to pass so 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.120
 video to photo mode in video mode 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.680
 it only allows us movements of 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.720
 left to right and top to bottom 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.180
 being blocked for movements 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.849
 on other axes in photo mode 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.640
 In addition to the previous movements we 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.010
 allows the possibility of turning the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.400
 perform 90 degrees to the left and to the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.560
 right 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.370
 being able to fix in this position to 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.840
 take pictures in portrait mode 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.840
 and me 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.890
 to remove the shoes the head 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.480
 has a pin that allows the 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.190
 quick release of it the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.260
 screw that attaches to the device 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.400
 comes protected with a plastic cap 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.400
 that has scratched at the same 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.120
 ah 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.190
 the central column allows us to vary the 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.680
 position of the head for it we extract 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.389
 the lower rubber stopper we release the 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.389
 column we turn around 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.010
 and we reintroduce 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.400
 it can be useful to make plans 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.400
 chopped 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:39.519
 to return the column to its position 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.599
 original we follow the reverse 

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:42.599
 same steps as before 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.200
 I 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.910
 It is certainly a good purchase and a great 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.889
 tripod to start in the world of 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.169
 photography and video recording
