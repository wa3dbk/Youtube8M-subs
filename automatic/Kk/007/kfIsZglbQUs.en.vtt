 more than the appearance of the product the food market worries each 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.890
 with its origin is one of the fundamental elements for 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.479
 traceability 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.759
 learn more about the subject in one more report of the series that if not to take 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.759
 that the streetcar and rihanna is showing this week 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.849
 the area 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.260
 in the beef market in the price of the traced title is the highest 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.700
 food safety reason 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.200
 in times of mad cow agripino flamengo and other diseases provoked 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200
 consumption of contaminated food 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.990
 product traceability is an important market differential. 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.560
 yes this question 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.970
 the great northern river is coming forth ahead of cesumar 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020
 It's important that we give him bad luck. 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.900
 came the product on Saturday the middle bunch 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.840
 of the whole course for consumer protection 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.220
 I do not know I'm going to die, what's happened said 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.970
 if any problem happens 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.970
 I started part time on Sunday 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.460
 we know where the fish went by so know with what was the problem sat 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.420
 already the problem in coritiba the next time we make the pl problem 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.490
 does not reach the final consumer 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.590
 the care with the table white high sea 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.470
 boats operate as small industries after fish fishing 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.830
 processed the head and the viscera are removed 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.360
 n at the market 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.090
 pre-classified according to the quality that made it and 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.260
 well on board 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.140
 we use to avoid export 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.180
 it is already classified according to the organoleptic characteristics 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.490
 the composition of the same side 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.470
 the rails of solar brightness 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.500
 infected with the site was coming the time to capture the conditioned drop 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.640
 the desired consideration 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.799
 cotton wool 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.609
 the classification 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:09.430
 the care 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.639
 this boat arrives at the top 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:16.749
 in Natal the withdrawal of fish is done with the utmost care until a canvas 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.749
 installed on the dock to protect the 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.079
 in processing 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.169
 with chlorinated water 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.199
 is analyzed 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.929
 the fish is heavy 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.109
 and once again 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.249
 the fish was fished 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.699
 in day 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.469
 of the 3 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.069
 his classification with the classification 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.149
 2 would be the third 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.149
 export context training 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.109
 the other did too little 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.119
 and to the texture also the other text 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:58.229
 also too 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:59.889
 to other items 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.310
 the barometer is paulo 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.399
 but it is a will hypothesis portal 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.589
 to increase capture is one of the goals of Brazil 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.220
 each country has a quota determined by the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.869
 mcleish for the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:20.549
 is a stipulated index to avoid the extinction of the fish 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:26.559
 Brazil captures 40 thousand tons of fertilizers and the like per year 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:31.869
 but may even triple this number the good quality aaron gray ment in 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:36.609
 fishing techniques shows how much we can advance in the sector the big river 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.789
 from the north to the state what else produces the bird actors 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.789
 and then he responded with more than 50 years 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:45.859
 of national production 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.969
 about one hundred percent 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.969
 production is intended for export 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:08.799
 So 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:09.699
 in your 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.040
 and many life lessons do not miss it
