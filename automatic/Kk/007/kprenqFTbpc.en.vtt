setting<00:01:37.870> suit<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.410> way<00:01:38.680> I've<00:01:38.890> run<00:01:39.160> it<00:01:39.340> now

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
setting suit is the way I've run it now

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.730 
setting suit is the way I've run it now
I<00:01:39.520> just<00:01:39.640> did<00:01:40.030> turn<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.360> couple<00:01:40.600> on<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:41.080> test<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
I just did turn a couple on the test and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.760 
I just did turn a couple on the test and
rotate<00:01:44.740> head<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:46.210> definitely<00:01:47.140> gonna<00:01:47.410> go<00:01:47.620> back

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
rotate head is definitely gonna go back

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.830 
rotate head is definitely gonna go back
to<00:01:48.010> zero<00:01:48.400> anyway<00:01:49.000> now<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:52.090> can<00:01:52.240> refine<00:01:52.600> that

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
to zero anyway now you can refine that

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.740 
to zero anyway now you can refine that
number<00:01:53.290> because<00:01:53.680> zero<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.340> one<00:01:54.640> well<00:01:55.390> one<00:01:55.600> is

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
number because zero to one well one is

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.560 
number because zero to one well one is
being<00:01:55.990> 100%<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.910> know<00:01:58.030> that<00:01:58.330> would<00:01:58.420> be

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
being 100% so you know that would be

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.420 
being 100% so you know that would be
like<00:01:58.780> maybe<00:01:59.140> in<00:01:59.350> go<00:01:59.530> point<00:01:59.920> twenty<00:02:00.220> five

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
like maybe in go point twenty five

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.790 
like maybe in go point twenty five
percent<00:02:00.670> but<00:02:01.480> it<00:02:01.720> turns<00:02:01.930> your<00:02:02.110> head<00:02:02.320> looking

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
percent but it turns your head looking

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.450 
percent but it turns your head looking
into<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.130> apex<00:02:04.080> but<00:02:05.080> set<00:02:05.440> at<00:02:05.590> one<00:02:05.830> it's<00:02:06.190> way

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
into the apex but set at one it's way

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.110 
into the apex but set at one it's way
too<00:02:06.520> dramatic<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.530> I'll<00:02:08.649> go<00:02:08.800> back<00:02:09.040> to<00:02:11.820> zero<00:02:12.820> and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
too dramatic so I'll go back to zero and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.600 
too dramatic so I'll go back to zero and
at<00:02:13.240> zero<00:02:13.630> not<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.320> letter<00:02:14.470> O
