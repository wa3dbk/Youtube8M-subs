00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
actually went to e3 and got your hands

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.390 
actually went to e3 and got your hands
on<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:45.140> star<00:02:45.440> wars<00:02:45.590> battlefront<00:02:45.680> demo

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
on the the star wars battlefront demo

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.099 
on the the star wars battlefront demo
that<00:02:46.489> they<00:02:46.670> were<00:02:46.760> showing<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.239> floor<00:02:47.480> so

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
that they were showing on the floor so

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.750 
that they were showing on the floor so
maybe<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.350> have<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.500> better<00:02:48.709> idea<00:02:48.799> of<00:02:49.130> what<00:02:49.609> it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
maybe you have a better idea of what it

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.550 
maybe you have a better idea of what it
was<00:02:49.910> like<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.180> actually<00:02:50.510> fly<00:02:51.140> one<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.410> these

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
was like to actually fly one of these

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.130 
was like to actually fly one of these
things<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:52.130> I'm<00:02:53.120> kind<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.510> disappointed<00:02:53.780> that

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
things so I'm kind of disappointed that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.370 
things so I'm kind of disappointed that
you<00:02:54.200> can't<00:02:54.530> uh<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:55.850> can't<00:02:56.180> start<00:02:56.569> off<00:02:56.780> on<00:02:57.049> foot

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
you can't uh you can't start off on foot

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.569 
you can't uh you can't start off on foot
and<00:02:57.560> then<00:02:57.709> jump<00:02:58.010> on<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.430> ship<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.700> then<00:02:59.090> go<00:02:59.959> up

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
and then jump on the ship and then go up

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.430 
and then jump on the ship and then go up
that<00:03:01.579> seems<00:03:02.000> like<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.209> no-brainer<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.870> me<00:03:03.049> if

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
that seems like a no-brainer to me if

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.349 
that seems like a no-brainer to me if
you're<00:03:03.650> making<00:03:04.130> this<00:03:04.220> kind<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.489> game<00:03:04.700> but

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
you're making this kind of game but

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.819 
you're making this kind of game but
apparently<00:03:05.840> it's<00:03:06.019> just<00:03:06.109> the<00:03:06.410> touch<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.769> a

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
apparently it's just the touch of a

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.289 
apparently it's just the touch of a
button<00:03:06.859> and<00:03:07.250> then<00:03:07.400> you're<00:03:07.519> in<00:03:07.609> the<00:03:07.700> sky<00:03:07.880> so

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
button and then you're in the sky so

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.550 
button and then you're in the sky so
which<00:03:08.569> is<00:03:08.720> kind<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:08.989> disappointing<00:03:09.110> but

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
which is kind of disappointing but

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.869 
which is kind of disappointing but
that's<00:03:09.739> what<00:03:09.950> ever<00:03:10.069> I<00:03:10.159> mean<00:03:10.340> that's<00:03:10.459> a<00:03:10.610> small

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
that's what ever I mean that's a small

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.860 
that's what ever I mean that's a small
thing<00:03:11.120> it's<00:03:11.239> not<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.510> big<00:03:11.599> of<00:03:11.659> a<00:03:11.780> deal

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
thing it's not that big of a deal
