our<00:00:00.780> next<00:00:00.960> state<00:00:01.170> that<00:00:01.290> we're<00:00:01.380> going<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.530> look

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
our next state that we're going to look

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.320 
our next state that we're going to look
at<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:02.010> our<00:00:02.250> patrol<00:00:02.639> state<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.120> we're<00:00:03.210> going

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
at is our patrol state and we're going

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.410 
at is our patrol state and we're going
select<00:00:03.540> on<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.720> edit<00:00:03.990> button<00:00:04.819> as<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:06.060> select

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
select on the edit button as we select

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.700 
select on the edit button as we select
it<00:00:06.540> we<00:00:06.629> can<00:00:06.750> see<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.140> header<00:00:07.560> has

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
it we can see that the header has

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.799 
it we can see that the header has
changed<00:00:08.160> patrol<00:00:08.610> state<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.150> we<00:00:09.389> can<00:00:09.540> now<00:00:09.630> look

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
changed patrol state and we can now look

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.620 
changed patrol state and we can now look
at<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.019> options<00:00:10.139> available<00:00:10.969> again<00:00:11.969> we<00:00:12.480> have

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
at the options available again we have

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.480 
at the options available again we have
our<00:00:12.780> trigger<00:00:13.049> our<00:00:13.290> animation<00:00:13.830> our<00:00:13.980> movement

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
our trigger our animation our movement

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.189 
our trigger our animation our movement
or<00:00:14.580> cool<00:00:14.820> down<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.210> our<00:00:15.330> audio<00:00:15.630> those<00:00:16.020> are

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
or cool down and our audio those are

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.140 
or cool down and our audio those are
always<00:00:16.440> going<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.680> persistent<00:00:17.119> below<00:00:18.119> that

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
always going to be persistent below that

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.570 
always going to be persistent below that
we<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.539> some<00:00:18.779> options<00:00:18.960> for<00:00:19.580> specifically

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
we have some options for specifically

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.599 
we have some options for specifically
for<00:00:20.939> our<00:00:21.210> patrol<00:00:21.630> states<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.260> movement<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.519> we

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
for our patrol states and movement so we

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.340 
for our patrol states and movement so we
have<00:00:23.699> movement<00:00:23.939> options<00:00:24.600> inside<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> here<00:00:25.230> we

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
have movement options inside of here we

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.290 
have movement options inside of here we
have<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> patrol<00:00:25.920> mode<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.789> patrol<00:00:27.119> mode

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
have a patrol mode the patrol mode

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.349 
have a patrol mode the patrol mode
allows<00:00:27.599> us<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.019> say<00:00:28.199> how<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.650> he<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> go

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
allows us to say how is he going to go

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.299 
allows us to say how is he going to go
throughout<00:00:30.359> his<00:00:30.929> waypoints<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> navigation

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
throughout his waypoints the navigation

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.430 
throughout his waypoints the navigation
points<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.790> create<00:00:33.180> legal<00:00:33.540> once<00:00:34.140> through

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
points that we create legal once through

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.229 
points that we create legal once through
them<00:00:34.559> will<00:00:34.710> he<00:00:34.800> loop<00:00:35.100> Willie<00:00:35.489> ping-pong<00:00:36.000> back

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
them will he loop Willie ping-pong back

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.190 
them will he loop Willie ping-pong back
and<00:00:36.420> forth<00:00:36.630> really<00:00:37.230> continue<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> forever<00:00:39.200> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
and forth really continue it forever the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.990 
and forth really continue it forever the
next<00:00:40.410> one<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> continued<00:00:41.520> previous

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
next one we see is a continued previous

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.750 
next one we see is a continued previous
patrol<00:00:42.420> point<00:00:42.950> now<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.309> hover<00:00:44.550> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
patrol point now if you do hover you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.470 
patrol point now if you do hover you
will<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.000> some<00:00:46.250> additional<00:00:47.250> help<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.360> is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
will get some additional help so this is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.850 
will get some additional help so this is
saying<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.809> when<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> state<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> switched

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
saying that when the state is switched

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.959 
saying that when the state is switched
back<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:51.449> will<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.629> continue<00:00:52.340> as<00:00:53.340> far

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
back to it what will it continue as far

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.459 
back to it what will it continue as far
as<00:00:54.090> where<00:00:54.480> will<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.690> continue<00:00:54.899> when<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.289> left

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
as where will it continue when it's left

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.799 
as where will it continue when it's left
off<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.760> look<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.300> will<00:00:57.449> say<00:00:57.600> I'm

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
off so if we look at it will say I'm

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.160 
off so if we look at it will say I'm
coming<00:00:58.140> back<00:00:58.469> into<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.920> patrol<00:00:59.399> do<00:01:00.210> i<00:01:00.270> reset<00:01:00.930> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
coming back into a patrol do i reset to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.160 
coming back into a patrol do i reset to
the<00:01:01.199> start<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.980> continue<00:01:02.430> previous<00:01:03.210> do<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.870> go

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the start do I continue previous do I go

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
the start do I continue previous do I go
to<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.439> neck<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.129> nearest<00:01:05.430> node<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.180> i

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
to the neck to the nearest node or do i

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.170 
to the neck to the nearest node or do i
do<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.600> nearest<00:01:07.020> next<00:01:07.560> node<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.850> nice<00:01:09.030> little

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
do the nearest next node so nice little

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.539 
do the nearest next node so nice little
option<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.100> below<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
option for that below that we have a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.789 
option for that below that we have a
lock<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.850> path<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.840> keeps<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> constraint<00:01:13.590> to

lock to path that keeps a constraint to
the<00:01:13.950> path<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.640> can't<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.090> off<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
the path so that it can't get off of it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.590 
the path so that it can't get off of it
below<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.860> use<00:01:17.189> node<00:01:17.520> action<00:01:18.119> the

below that we have a use node action the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.660 
below that we have a use node action the
use<00:01:18.750> node<00:01:18.930> action<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.439> used<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.189> type<00:01:20.400> back

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
into any trigger event on a script if we

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
into any trigger event on a script if we
run<00:01:24.450> across<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.840> node<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.710> want<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
run across that node and we want it to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.249 
run across that node and we want it to
actually<00:01:26.369> affect<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.720> state<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
actually affect the state of the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.340 
actually affect the state of the
character<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.920> tie<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.369> there<00:01:30.350> below

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
character we can tie it in there below

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
character we can tie it in there below
that<00:01:31.530> we<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.770> our<00:01:31.979> patrol<00:01:32.310> points<00:01:32.790> these<00:01:32.939> are

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
that we have our patrol points these are

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.690 
that we have our patrol points these are
the<00:01:33.150> points<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:33.600> actually<00:01:33.750> use<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.860> for

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the points that we actually use that for

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.359 
the points that we actually use that for
the<00:01:35.790> character<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.630> follow<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the character to follow so we have a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.140 
the character to follow so we have a
patrol<00:01:38.790> points<00:01:39.180> group<00:01:40.850> below<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.119> have

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
patrol points group below that we have

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.060 
patrol points group below that we have
the<00:01:42.329> distance<00:01:42.720> threshold<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.619> how<00:01:43.740> close

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the distance threshold this is how close

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.710 
the distance threshold this is how close
they<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.909> those<00:01:45.119> points<00:01:45.600> in

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
they have to get to those points in

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.899 
they have to get to those points in
order<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.439> accomplish<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.369> move<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
order to accomplish it and move on to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.060 
order to accomplish it and move on to
the<00:01:48.030> next<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.560> let's<00:01:49.740> start<00:01:49.950> off<00:01:50.040> with

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the next one so let's start off with

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
the next one so let's start off with
this<00:01:50.369> one<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:51.090> were<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> play<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:51.990> out

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
this one if we were to play this one out

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.410 
this one if we were to play this one out
we're<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.560> get<00:01:52.820> information<00:01:53.820> at<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
we're going to get information at the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.700 
we're going to get information at the
bottom<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.869> gives<00:01:55.020> us<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> warning<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.480 
point group is unassigned for the patrol
state<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.180> avatar<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.469> what<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.040> looking

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
state on the avatar so what it's looking

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.550 
state on the avatar so what it's looking
for<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> set<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.630> points<00:02:03.899> empty<00:02:04.380> game

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
for is a set of points empty game

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.010 
for is a set of points empty game
objects<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.759> wants<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.240> use<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.750> follow

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
objects that it wants to use to follow

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.469 
objects that it wants to use to follow
so<00:02:07.860> let's<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.129> ahead<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.310> set<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.879> we'll

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
so let's go ahead and set that up we'll

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.809 
so let's go ahead and set that up we'll
start<00:02:09.750> off<00:02:09.869> by

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
start off by

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.300 
start off by
moving<00:02:12.819> into<00:02:12.940> our<00:02:13.090> character<00:02:13.830> will<00:02:14.830> drop<00:02:15.069> in<00:02:15.220> a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
moving into our character will drop in a

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.690 
moving into our character will drop in a
new<00:02:15.720> game<00:02:16.720> object<00:02:17.170> control<00:02:18.569> shift<00:02:19.569> in<00:02:19.900> and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
new game object control shift in and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.960 
new game object control shift in and
with<00:02:21.700> our<00:02:21.849> game<00:02:22.000> object<00:02:23.610> let's<00:02:24.610> go<00:02:24.730> ahead<00:02:24.879> go

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
with our game object let's go ahead go

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.309 
with our game object let's go ahead go
to<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.090> top<00:02:25.390> view<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.750> we<00:02:25.900> can<00:02:26.019> see<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.260> a

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
to a top view so that we can see this a

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.059 
to a top view so that we can see this a
little<00:02:26.470> better<00:02:28.379> we'll<00:02:29.379> set<00:02:29.560> up<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.739> couple<00:02:29.920> of

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
little better we'll set up a couple of

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.550 
little better we'll set up a couple of
points<00:02:30.400> around<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:31.470> naming<00:02:32.470> convention<00:02:32.980> is

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
points around the naming convention is

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.539 
points around the naming convention is
not<00:02:37.079> locked<00:02:38.079> down<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.860> can<00:02:39.069> call<00:02:39.430> it

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
not locked down so you can call it

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.339 
not locked down so you can call it
whatever<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.849> want<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.209> call<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.780> will<00:02:41.200> do

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
whatever you want to call it will do

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:49.080 
whatever you want to call it will do
this<00:02:41.409> one<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:43.260> node<00:02:44.260> one<00:02:47.430> will<00:02:48.430> make<00:02:48.549> a<00:02:48.609> copy<00:02:48.940> of

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
this one a node one will make a copy of

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.920 
this one a node one will make a copy of
it<00:02:49.920> will<00:02:50.920> call<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.310> one<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.549> node<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.090> what<00:02:52.810> it

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
it will call this one a node to what it

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.020 
it will call this one a node to what it
does<00:02:53.200> do<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.500> increment<00:02:54.190> throughout<00:02:57.030> your

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
does do is increment throughout your

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.699 
does do is increment throughout your
node<00:02:58.359> so<00:02:58.659> if<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.840> do<00:02:58.959> them<00:02:59.079> one<00:02:59.319> two<00:02:59.500> three

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
node so if you do them one two three

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.259 
node so if you do them one two three
four<00:02:59.890> five<00:02:59.950> it's<00:03:00.400> going<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.609> follow<00:03:00.819> them<00:03:01.090> one

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
four five it's going to follow them one

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.069 
four five it's going to follow them one
two<00:03:01.450> three<00:03:01.659> four<00:03:01.870> five<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.750> good<00:03:04.930> idea

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
two three four five so it is a good idea

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.130 
two three four five so it is a good idea
to<00:03:05.379> number<00:03:05.920> them<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.129> that<00:03:06.280> way<00:03:06.900> now<00:03:07.900> what<00:03:08.049> we

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
to number them in that way now what we

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.630 
to number them in that way now what we
have<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.319> we<00:03:08.470> have<00:03:08.560> three<00:03:08.920> different<00:03:09.099> nodes<00:03:09.430> we

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
have is we have three different nodes we

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.039 
have is we have three different nodes we
can<00:03:09.760> apply<00:03:10.060> these<00:03:10.120> set<00:03:10.599> these<00:03:10.720> into<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.170> group

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
can apply these set these into a group

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.710 
can apply these set these into a group
so<00:03:14.049> let's<00:03:14.200> go<00:03:14.290> ahead<00:03:14.319> and<00:03:14.440> make<00:03:15.329> one<00:03:16.329> more<00:03:16.480> game

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
so let's go ahead and make one more game

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.520 
so let's go ahead and make one more game
object<00:03:17.169> will<00:03:18.069> call<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.400> our

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.950 

note<00:03:23.530> group<00:03:24.150> I'm<00:03:25.150> just<00:03:25.270> going<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.420> drag<00:03:25.720> and

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
note group I'm just going to drag and

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.340 
note group I'm just going to drag and
drop<00:03:26.110> these<00:03:26.320> into<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.740> node<00:03:26.890> group<00:03:28.350> next

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
drop these into the node group next

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.910 
drop these into the node group next
thing<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.620> can<00:03:29.770> do<00:03:29.890> is<00:03:30.010> set<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.290> visual<00:03:32.290> cue<00:03:32.650> for

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
thing I can do is set a visual cue for

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.290 
thing I can do is set a visual cue for
these<00:03:33.040> we<00:03:33.250> could<00:03:33.400> write<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.700> script<00:03:34.090> for<00:03:34.240> a

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
these we could write a script for a

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.730 
these we could write a script for a
showcase<00:03:34.720> our<00:03:34.870> gizmo<00:03:35.200> or<00:03:35.410> we<00:03:35.530> can<00:03:35.620> take

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
showcase our gizmo or we can take

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.770 
showcase our gizmo or we can take
advantage<00:03:36.130> of<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.310> new<00:03:36.460> features<00:03:37.150> in<00:03:37.480> unity

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
advantage of the new features in unity

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.120 
advantage of the new features in unity
and<00:03:37.960> just<00:03:38.800> select<00:03:38.980> an<00:03:39.220> icon<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:39.940> we'll<00:03:40.090> go<00:03:40.240> in

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
and just select an icon so we'll go in

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.610 
and just select an icon so we'll go in
selecting<00:03:42.130> each<00:03:42.250> one<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.580> nodes<00:03:43.620> assign

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
selecting each one of the nodes assign

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.860 
selecting each one of the nodes assign
an<00:03:44.740> icon<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:46.560> which<00:03:47.560> helps<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:47.920> make<00:03:48.100> it

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
an icon to it which helps to make it

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.020 
an icon to it which helps to make it
much<00:03:49.870> more<00:03:50.110> visible<00:03:50.380> as<00:03:50.830> we<00:03:51.070> work<00:03:51.280> with<00:03:51.550> the

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
much more visible as we work with the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.320 
much more visible as we work with the
patrol<00:03:52.390> points

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.360 

rotate<00:03:57.140> back<00:03:57.380> around<00:03:57.740> one<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.220> things

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370

that we want to make sure that we are

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.810 
that we want to make sure that we are
aware<00:04:00.200> of<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.800> height<00:04:01.070> of<00:04:01.100> these<00:04:01.430> patrol

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
aware of is the height of these patrol

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.730 
aware of is the height of these patrol
points<00:04:02.180> if<00:04:02.540> we<00:04:02.750> have<00:04:02.930> this<00:04:03.080> too<00:04:03.290> high<00:04:03.500> it's

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
points if we have this too high it's

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.920 
points if we have this too high it's
going<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:03.920> be<00:04:04.040> where<00:04:04.610> he<00:04:04.730> can't<00:04:05.060> get<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:05.630> and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
going to be where he can't get to it and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.960 
going to be where he can't get to it and
he<00:04:06.500> won't<00:04:06.740> be<00:04:06.860> able<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.130> get<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.490> it<00:04:07.520> so<00:04:07.790> let's

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
he won't be able to get to it so let's

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.550 
he won't be able to get to it so let's
make<00:04:08.120> sure<00:04:08.150> we<00:04:08.360> set<00:04:08.570> them<00:04:08.690> where<00:04:08.900> he<00:04:09.020> can<00:04:09.290> get

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
make sure we set them where he can get

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.620 
make sure we set them where he can get
to<00:04:12.580> okay<00:04:13.580> I'm<00:04:14.000> going<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.180> move<00:04:14.270> this<00:04:14.390> one<00:04:14.540> over

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
to okay I'm going to move this one over

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.680 
to okay I'm going to move this one over
just<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:14.990> little<00:04:15.020> bit<00:04:15.380> there<00:04:15.710> we<00:04:15.800> go<00:04:16.450> let's<00:04:17.450> like

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
just a little bit there we go let's like

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.930 
just a little bit there we go let's like
back<00:04:17.930> on<00:04:18.140> our<00:04:18.260> character<00:04:18.680> at<00:04:19.459> least<00:04:19.609> like<00:04:19.790> back

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
back on our character at least like back

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.849 
back on our character at least like back
on<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.150> character<00:04:20.540> will<00:04:20.660> go<00:04:20.780> back<00:04:20.989> make<00:04:21.830> sure

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
on a character will go back make sure

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.150 
on a character will go back make sure
that<00:04:22.160> we're<00:04:22.310> in<00:04:22.490> our<00:04:22.610> patrol<00:04:23.030> edit<00:04:23.660> at<00:04:24.160> the

that we're in our patrol edit at the
bottom<00:04:25.520> we<00:04:25.640> have<00:04:25.760> our<00:04:25.880> patrol<00:04:26.270> point<00:04:26.510> group

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
bottom we have our patrol point group

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.050 
bottom we have our patrol point group
this<00:04:27.170> is<00:04:27.320> looking<00:04:27.710> for<00:04:27.920> a<00:04:27.950> group<00:04:28.310> instead<00:04:28.940> of

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
this is looking for a group instead of

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.430 
this is looking for a group instead of
having<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.330> assign<00:04:29.690> each<00:04:29.930> one<00:04:30.230> individually

having to assign each one individually

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.650 
having to assign each one individually
we've<00:04:30.920> set<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.580> up<00:04:31.730> so<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.330> can<00:04:32.480> simply

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
we've set it up so that you can simply

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.070 
we've set it up so that you can simply
select<00:04:33.410> on<00:04:33.830> that<00:04:34.190> group<00:04:34.550> drag<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.300> group<00:04:35.840> and

select on that group drag that group and

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.500 
select on that group drag that group and
drop<00:04:36.650> it<00:04:36.800> into<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.340> patrol<00:04:37.580> points<00:04:38.000> group<00:04:38.270> and

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
drop it into the patrol points group and

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.620 
drop it into the patrol points group and
that<00:04:39.080> gets<00:04:39.320> everything<00:04:39.680> set<00:04:40.010> up<00:04:40.040> for<00:04:40.160> you<00:04:40.630> all

right now without tweaking any of the

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.540 
right now without tweaking any of the
other<00:04:44.090> properties<00:04:44.780> we've<00:04:45.040> got<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.130> set<00:04:46.160> on<00:04:46.370> the

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
other properties we've got it set on the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.060 
other properties we've got it set on the
loop<00:04:46.730> let's<00:04:47.600> go<00:04:47.750> ahead<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:47.960> hit<00:04:48.200> play<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:48.710> see

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
loop let's go ahead and hit play and see

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.680 
loop let's go ahead and hit play and see
what<00:04:49.190> happens<00:04:51.880> so<00:04:52.880> we<00:04:52.970> can<00:04:53.090> see<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.360> character

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
what happens so we can see the character

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.460 
what happens so we can see the character
rotating<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.440> target<00:04:55.630> moving<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.110> once

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
rotating to the target moving to it once

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.860 
rotating to the target moving to it once
he<00:04:57.650> gets<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.730> required<00:04:59.090> threshold<00:04:59.720> of

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
he gets to the required threshold of

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.390 
he gets to the required threshold of
that<00:05:00.050> target<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.560> he<00:05:00.680> picks<00:05:00.950> that<00:05:01.100> next

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
that target and he picks that next

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.500 
that target and he picks that next
target<00:05:01.760> moves<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.240> it<00:05:02.950> then<00:05:03.950> continues<00:05:04.510> moving

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
target moves to it then continues moving

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.180 
target moves to it then continues moving
around<00:05:07.900> from<00:05:08.900> each<00:05:09.110> navigation<00:05:09.710> point<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:10.100> the

around from each navigation point to the

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.940 
around from each navigation point to the
next<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:12.830> patrolling<00:05:14.440> like<00:05:15.440> a<00:05:15.470> good<00:05:15.740> enemy

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
next and patrolling like a good enemy

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.720 
next and patrolling like a good enemy
ought<00:05:16.340> to<00:05:16.640> patrol<00:05:18.160> all<00:05:19.160> right<00:05:19.340> we'll<00:05:19.520> go<00:05:19.640> ahead

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
ought to patrol all right we'll go ahead

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.720 
ought to patrol all right we'll go ahead
and<00:05:20.260> stop<00:05:21.260> that<00:05:21.590> will<00:05:21.890> scroll<00:05:22.160> out<00:05:22.340> just<00:05:22.640> a

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
and stop that will scroll out just a

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.300 
and stop that will scroll out just a
little<00:05:22.760> bit<00:05:23.650> so<00:05:24.650> what<00:05:24.740> we<00:05:24.860> have<00:05:25.040> is<00:05:25.070> the

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
little bit so what we have is the

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.860 
little bit so what we have is the
character<00:05:25.669> moving<00:05:26.000> from<00:05:26.180> one<00:05:26.330> point<00:05:26.600> to<00:05:26.750> the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
character moving from one point to the

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.200 
character moving from one point to the
next<00:05:26.960> point<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.710> next<00:05:27.950> at<00:05:28.280> any<00:05:28.760> point<00:05:29.090> in

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
next point to the next at any point in

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.200 
next point to the next at any point in
time<00:05:29.270> you<00:05:29.570> can<00:05:29.660> simply<00:05:29.900> just<00:05:29.960> add<00:05:30.260> additional

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
time you can simply just add additional

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.850 
time you can simply just add additional
padding<00:05:32.210> notes<00:05:32.510> to<00:05:32.780> it<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.080> then<00:05:33.560> he'll<00:05:33.710> just

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
padding notes to it and then he'll just

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.190 
padding notes to it and then he'll just
path<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.370> those<00:05:34.580> points<00:05:35.060> nice<00:05:35.900> and<00:05:36.230> simple<00:05:38.200> all

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
path to those points nice and simple all

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.480 
path to those points nice and simple all
right<00:05:39.320> we're<00:05:39.440> going<00:05:39.530> to<00:05:39.620> select<00:05:39.800> on<00:05:40.040> the<00:05:40.130> idle

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
right we're going to select on the idle

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.880 
right we're going to select on the idle
on<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:41.510> Edit<00:05:41.810> for<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.050> patrol<00:05:42.440> we're<00:05:42.770> going

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
on the Edit for the patrol we're going

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.500 
on the Edit for the patrol we're going
to<00:05:42.950> scroll<00:05:43.160> back<00:05:43.220> down<00:05:43.400> and<00:05:44.090> we're<00:05:44.330> going<00:05:44.450> to

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
to scroll back down and we're going to

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
to scroll back down and we're going to
take<00:05:44.570> a<00:05:44.630> look<00:05:44.840> at<00:05:44.930> some<00:05:45.050> of<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.229> movement

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
take a look at some of the movement

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.110 
take a look at some of the movement
properties<00:05:46.010> for<00:05:46.190> this<00:05:46.340> one<00:05:46.790> things<00:05:47.000> you'll

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
properties for this one things you'll

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.250 
properties for this one things you'll
notice<00:05:47.210> is<00:05:47.360> it<00:05:47.510> as<00:05:47.600> that<00:05:47.750> character<00:05:47.960> guess

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
notice is it as that character guess

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.890 
notice is it as that character guess
that<00:05:48.470> point<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:48.860> turns<00:05:49.280> that<00:05:49.700> speed<00:05:50.479> is<00:05:50.630> kind

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
that point and turns that speed is kind

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.930 
that point and turns that speed is kind
of<00:05:51.020> slow<00:05:51.229> we<00:05:51.560> could<00:05:51.710> speed<00:05:52.040> that<00:05:52.250> up<00:05:52.490> so<00:05:52.820> that

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
of slow we could speed that up so that

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.610 
of slow we could speed that up so that
he<00:05:53.120> whips<00:05:53.780> around<00:05:53.960> a<00:05:54.140> little<00:05:54.229> bit<00:05:54.380> quicker

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
he whips around a little bit quicker

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.960 
he whips around a little bit quicker
let's<00:05:55.070> bump<00:05:55.910> that's<00:05:56.030> maybe<00:05:56.330> 180

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
let's bump that's maybe 180

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.580 
let's bump that's maybe 180
in<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.150> distance<00:05:59.539> to<00:05:59.780> the<00:05:59.810> threshold<00:06:00.380> if<00:06:00.500> we

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
in the distance to the threshold if we

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.200 
in the distance to the threshold if we
want<00:06:00.770> it<00:06:00.800> a<00:06:00.919> little<00:06:01.069> bit<00:06:01.280> softer<00:06:01.819> around<00:06:02.090> those

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
want it a little bit softer around those

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.680 
want it a little bit softer around those
turn<00:06:02.449> so<00:06:02.660> he<00:06:02.720> doesn't<00:06:02.990> quite<00:06:03.110> hit<00:06:03.830> that<00:06:04.690> that

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
turn so he doesn't quite hit that that

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.379 
turn so he doesn't quite hit that that
point<00:06:06.319> we<00:06:06.620> can<00:06:06.800> bump<00:06:07.610> that<00:06:07.789> up<00:06:07.819> a<00:06:08.030> little<00:06:08.150> bit

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
point we can bump that up a little bit

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.350 
point we can bump that up a little bit
more<00:06:08.599> so<00:06:09.050> our<00:06:09.259> threshold<00:06:09.680> is<00:06:09.770> higher<00:06:10.039> and<00:06:10.370> this

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
more so our threshold is higher and this

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.610 
more so our threshold is higher and this
time<00:06:11.539> around<00:06:11.630> I'm<00:06:11.930> actually<00:06:12.110> going<00:06:12.319> to<00:06:12.410> drag

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
time around I'm actually going to drag

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.040 
time around I'm actually going to drag
the<00:06:12.830> game<00:06:13.789> view<00:06:15.220> down<00:06:16.220> so<00:06:16.580> that<00:06:16.610> we<00:06:16.849> can<00:06:17.060> also

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
the game view down so that we can also

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:25.089 
the game view down so that we can also
see<00:06:18.440> our<00:06:18.590> scene<00:06:18.800> view<00:06:19.539> we'll<00:06:20.539> hit<00:06:20.660> play<00:06:24.099> there

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
see our scene view we'll hit play there

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.550 
see our scene view we'll hit play there
we<00:06:25.220> go<00:06:25.509> we<00:06:26.509> can<00:06:26.630> watch<00:06:26.720> how<00:06:26.990> much<00:06:27.139> more<00:06:27.319> quickly

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
we go we can watch how much more quickly

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.930 
we go we can watch how much more quickly
he'll<00:06:27.889> turn<00:06:29.830> much<00:06:30.830> better<00:06:31.220> get<00:06:31.490> to<00:06:31.580> that<00:06:31.610> point

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
he'll turn much better get to that point

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.710 
he'll turn much better get to that point
he<00:06:32.389> doesn't<00:06:32.659> go<00:06:32.750> quite<00:06:32.930> as<00:06:33.050> far<00:06:33.259> into<00:06:34.720> that

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
he doesn't go quite as far into that

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.320 
he doesn't go quite as far into that
transform<00:06:36.229> position<00:06:36.380> and<00:06:36.970> turns<00:06:37.970> around<00:06:38.180> to

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
transform position and turns around to

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:45.519 
transform position and turns around to
the<00:06:38.389> next<00:06:38.690> one

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:45.529 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:47.979 

so<00:06:46.129> the<00:06:46.309> patrol<00:06:46.639> states<00:06:46.969> selected<00:06:47.689> will<00:06:47.839> go

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:47.989 
so the patrol states selected will go

00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:49.989 
so the patrol states selected will go
back<00:06:48.169> down<00:06:48.409> we'll<00:06:48.649> take<00:06:48.769> a<00:06:48.799> look<00:06:49.039> at<00:06:49.249> what<00:06:49.879> else

00:06:49.989 --> 00:06:49.999 
back down we'll take a look at what else

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:53.289 
back down we'll take a look at what else
do<00:06:50.119> we<00:06:50.149> have<00:06:50.239> to<00:06:50.899> use<00:06:51.199> in<00:06:51.379> here<00:06:51.939> the<00:06:52.939> continued

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:53.299 
do we have to use in here the continued

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:55.149 
do we have to use in here the continued
previous<00:06:53.659> path<00:06:53.839> this<00:06:54.079> depends<00:06:54.499> on<00:06:54.649> if<00:06:54.949> we're

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:55.159 
previous path this depends on if we're

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.179 
previous path this depends on if we're
triggering<00:06:55.699> in<00:06:55.819> and<00:06:55.969> out<00:06:56.059> of<00:06:56.089> the<00:06:56.919> patrol<00:06:57.919> mode

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:58.189 
triggering in and out of the patrol mode

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:00.699 
triggering in and out of the patrol mode
with<00:06:58.789> the<00:06:58.819> vegetable<00:06:59.239> mould<00:06:59.479> type<00:06:59.959> we<00:07:00.499> could

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:00.709 
with the vegetable mould type we could

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:03.069 
with the vegetable mould type we could
do<00:07:00.889> just<00:07:01.189> once<00:07:01.429> just<00:07:01.729> to<00:07:01.849> kind<00:07:02.059> of<00:07:02.119> see<00:07:02.389> how

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:03.079 
do just once just to kind of see how

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:07.329 
do just once just to kind of see how
that<00:07:03.319> works<00:07:03.559> now<00:07:04.159> if<00:07:04.399> I<00:07:04.929> select<00:07:05.929> on<00:07:06.319> the<00:07:06.979> patrol

00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:07.339 
that works now if I select on the patrol

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:10.629 
that works now if I select on the patrol
mode<00:07:07.639> once<00:07:08.179> then<00:07:08.599> what<00:07:09.469> is<00:07:09.619> the<00:07:09.799> in<00:07:09.949> patrol

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 
mode once then what is the in patrol

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.869 
mode once then what is the in patrol
transition<00:07:11.389> so<00:07:11.989> we<00:07:12.109> could<00:07:12.289> idle<00:07:12.739> and<00:07:13.579> since<00:07:13.789> we

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:13.879 
transition so we could idle and since we

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:15.369 
transition so we could idle and since we
have<00:07:13.909> looked<00:07:14.209> at<00:07:14.389> idle<00:07:14.689> we'll<00:07:15.079> go<00:07:15.169> ahead<00:07:15.229> an

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:15.379 
have looked at idle we'll go ahead an

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:23.679 
have looked at idle we'll go ahead an
idol<00:07:16.509> so<00:07:17.509> hit<00:07:17.689> play<00:07:22.149> watch<00:07:23.149> our<00:07:23.329> character
