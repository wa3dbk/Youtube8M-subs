you'll notice that I put the cookie on a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.450 
you'll notice that I put the cookie on a
napkin<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:07.350> reason<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
napkin and the reason I like to do that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.100 
napkin and the reason I like to do that
at<00:01:08.790> first<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.210> thought<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.450> was<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.960> keep

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
at first I thought it was just to keep

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.679 
at first I thought it was just to keep
the<00:01:10.560> table<00:01:10.890> neat<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.610> really<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.479> work

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
the table neat but not really it work

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.390 
the table neat but not really it work
winds<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.260> being<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.710> much<00:01:13.860> more<00:01:14.070> than<00:01:14.250> that

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
winds up being so much more than that

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.670 
winds up being so much more than that
instead<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.090> actually<00:01:15.750> touching<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> cookie

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
instead of actually touching the cookie

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.070 
instead of actually touching the cookie
and<00:01:16.890> turning<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:18.390> they<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:18.750> need<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and turning it all they really need to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.140 
and turning it all they really need to
do<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.530> turn<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> napkin<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.759> works<00:01:20.939> out

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
do is turn the napkin and that works out

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.330 
do is turn the napkin and that works out
