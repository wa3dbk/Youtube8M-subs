the knees on the ground birdie they have
a<00:03:06.210> little<00:03:06.390> second<00:03:06.750> trick<00:03:06.990> there<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.380> second

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
a little second trick there that second

variation that's that's again I think
it's<00:03:10.860> one<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.040> your<00:03:11.160> inventions<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.790> probably

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
it's one of your inventions you probably

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.490 
it's one of your inventions you probably
came<00:03:12.240> up<00:03:12.390> with<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.570> yourself<00:03:12.690> because<00:03:13.350> you

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
came up with that yourself because you
