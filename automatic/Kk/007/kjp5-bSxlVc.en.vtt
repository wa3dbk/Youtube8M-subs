00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.180
 let's take the earring closer 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:16.049
 one is ready to broadcast 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:20.820
 a little bit already the end which 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.550
 in fact a hard hat and rush you are the law 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.899
 that we know what they 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.320
 but 80 percent have covered are engaged 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.030
 us 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.680
 furniture 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.710
 we have a great tactic when you 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.290
 okay goes either all of them either 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.150
 to the translator because they depend 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.500
 I again lubricate it to conquer shorter 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.870
 guys 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.270
 so for 1 cous on what we get 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.220
 our such that we get guys 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.870
 game seed whether to work were either 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.170
 happen together there work with them not 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.390
 give them a year with us 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.390
 jumper and window and after that already 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.219
 do you were the same we understand what 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.339
 they work in the middle of them for this 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.430
 there is a rat this is a rug 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.860
 if they called saw and we gave it 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.750
 and they leave they go either there were plans 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.729
 at the same time exhibiting such painting 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.950
 before either carry racers repeat 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.700
 dependencies but they were given my people are not 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.439
 that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.450
 of these physicists are very important let's decide 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.880
 hatch for the counter in fact, I would 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.200
 just played default just i would play 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.750
 And this is a rewind to the driver once and Rabban 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.250
 units will study and fresh then summer cottage 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.080
 finish why i had three media just 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.520
 call they will expect 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.800
 for such I now have gathered all the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.410
 the gun and which we made heights not 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.790
 died when we threw a clear fire 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.790
 gives a ledge 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.350
 39 that he goes a whim 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.780
 training 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.590
 district run single if you're so 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.810
 your but we we go out of the basements and 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.580
 ginger and we what guys when we do for 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.350
 anexis attack you know what they have 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.970
 often they take the jumper so 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.739
 rebelled against your action you can 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:26.660
 you can even see the photo of the minutes 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:29.150
 See if they shower 103 cm and 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.990
 tall before then to anyone very quickly 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.970
 most likely they play 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.400
 task reception because when they do it 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.110
 are up to what they played with high 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.460
 in a minute how but this is not clear 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.850
 dog give jumper 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:47.760
 if you rush failed jumper 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:52.890
 Maxim and we are all these dude not 9 and they 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.110
 a blog you do n't really want to run around 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.480
 compact limit but you must understand 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.950
 if, on the contrary, they ’ll barely throw 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.120
 whether 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.020
 how should we understand that they 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.640
 take close it will 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.070
 it happens that the blades do not play 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.740
 bondick unit prepares to wait 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.380

 we actually after exchange and became 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.000
 not cold-bloodedly natural and after 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.030
 the exchange started throwing and throwing the ukada 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.160
 bustle and understand stress trying to play 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.950
 so as not to happen confidently and calmly 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.770

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.750

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.350
 this will not happen 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:57.610
 let's face it 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.610
 here wants a couple more words. 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.590
 on this championship in the first glister of the Urals 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.150
 the seam was taken from straight generally tough 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.880
 understood and started 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.459
