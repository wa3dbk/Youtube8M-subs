00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.580 

okay<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:19.949> here's<00:00:20.279> an<00:00:20.580> update<00:00:21.210> with<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.380> bike

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
okay so here's an update with the bike

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.650 
okay so here's an update with the bike
as<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.429> can<00:00:23.580> see<00:00:23.789> most<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.359> bike<00:00:24.509> is

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
as you can see most of the bike is

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.900 
as you can see most of the bike is
pretty<00:00:24.929> much<00:00:25.080> finished<00:00:25.349> intact<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.189> put<00:00:26.310> back

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
pretty much finished intact and put back

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.599 
pretty much finished intact and put back
together<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.619> went<00:00:28.619> with<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> powder<00:00:29.039> coating

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
together I went with a powder coating

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.450 
together I went with a powder coating
finish<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.800> subframe<00:00:31.800> under<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> seat

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
finish on the subframe under the seat

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.120 
finish on the subframe under the seat
and<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> wheels<00:00:33.450> now<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.500> advantage<00:00:34.830> is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
and with the wheels now the advantage is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.910 
and with the wheels now the advantage is
to<00:00:35.280> powder<00:00:35.490> coating<00:00:35.910> over<00:00:36.390> painting<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
to powder coating over painting is that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.500 
to powder coating over painting is that
powder<00:00:38.130> coating<00:00:38.610> actually<00:00:38.940> bonds<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
powder coating actually bonds and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.830 
powder coating actually bonds and
adheres<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.990> the<00:00:40.290> surface<00:00:40.530> better<00:00:41.250> than<00:00:41.460> paint

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
adheres to the surface better than paint

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.270 
adheres to the surface better than paint
it<00:00:42.840> gives<00:00:43.080> you<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> much<00:00:43.380> better<00:00:43.680> finish<00:00:44.070> it's

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
it gives you a much better finish it's

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.460 
it gives you a much better finish it's
less<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:45.180> more<00:00:45.480> scratch<00:00:45.900> and<00:00:46.200> dent

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
less it's more scratch and dent

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.220 
less it's more scratch and dent
resistant<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:48.000> doesn't<00:00:48.330> sag<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:48.990> drip

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
resistant it doesn't sag or drip

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.290 
resistant it doesn't sag or drip
typically<00:00:49.740> like<00:00:49.920> paint<00:00:50.190> does<00:00:50.430> now<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.150> can

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
typically like paint does now as you can

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
going to dial that in I just think the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.149 
going to dial that in I just think the
bike<00:01:42.390> looks<00:01:42.569> spectacular<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.920> color

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.749 
bike looks spectacular and this color
scheme<00:01:45.350> some<00:01:46.350> will<00:01:46.469> ask<00:01:46.649> why<00:01:46.889> I<00:01:46.920> went<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.609> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
scheme some will ask why I went with the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
scheme some will ask why I went with the
back<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.539> stock<00:01:48.810> exhaust<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.679> in<00:01:49.889> my

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
back to the stock exhaust I just in my

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.840 
back to the stock exhaust I just in my
opinion<00:01:50.819> I<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.329> think<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:52.170> stock<00:01:52.850> exhaust

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
opinion I just think the stock exhaust

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.309 
opinion I just think the stock exhaust
fits<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.229> bike<00:01:55.549> better<00:01:56.549> than<00:01:56.789> any<00:01:56.939> other

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
fits the bike better than any other

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.330 
fits the bike better than any other
exhaust<00:01:58.319> that<00:01:58.469> I've<00:01:58.590> seen<00:01:58.859> with<00:01:59.189> one

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
exhaust that I've seen with one

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.099 
exhaust that I've seen with one
exception<00:01:59.700> there<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.179> narrow<00:02:00.450> exhaustion

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
exception there is a narrow exhaustion

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.559 
exception there is a narrow exhaustion
it's<00:02:01.229> not<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> boxy<00:02:01.920> shaped<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.459> it's<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
it's not the boxy shaped one it's the

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.209 
it's not the boxy shaped one it's the
rounded<00:02:04.049> shape<00:02:04.259> when<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.679> full<00:02:04.829> titanium

rounded shape when it's a full titanium
race<00:02:05.639> exhaust<00:02:06.590> but<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.889> really<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.400> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
race exhaust but I just really like the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.310 
race exhaust but I just really like the
way<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.820> bike<00:02:09.000> came<00:02:09.240> out<00:02:09.479> if<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.900> notice<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
way the bike came out if you notice the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.530 
way the bike came out if you notice the
red<00:02:10.470> subframe<00:02:11.070> on<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.490> looks<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.300> much

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
red subframe on this looks so much

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.520 
red subframe on this looks so much
better<00:02:12.810> than<00:02:13.050> on<00:02:13.200> this

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
better than on this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.630 
better than on this
Triple<00:02:13.920> R<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.190> my<00:02:14.310> opinion<00:02:14.780> we<00:02:15.780> went<00:02:15.990> with<00:02:16.640> crg

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
Triple R in my opinion we went with crg

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.830 
Triple R in my opinion we went with crg
