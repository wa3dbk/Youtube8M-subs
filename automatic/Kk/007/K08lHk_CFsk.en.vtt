00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 yes 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.509
 I do not know what to really say 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.559
 three minutes 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.350
 for the greatest battle of our lives 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.550
 professionals 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.020
 everything comes down to today 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.750
 and we are cured 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:31.410
 as a team or we drop 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.660
 move to move inch by inch until 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.580
 clean and now we are in hell 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:42.300
 gentlemen believe me or we stay here 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:46.610
 leaving the expensive spots or we miss 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.610
 back to light 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 we can get out of hell inch to 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:04.089
 I can not do it for you 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.060
 I look around and see those young faces 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.439
 and I think 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.189
 I think when you get older in life 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.310
 there are things that go away is sometimes part of 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.100
 the girl but you only learn that when 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.960
 you start to lose those things 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.890
 you discover that life is a matter of 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.850
 inches like that is football 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.570
 because in every game life soccer 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.369
 the margin of error is very small in 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.580
 this team we leave the skin 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.909
 us and each other for that 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.460
 inch that is earned 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.619
 because when we add one after another 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.500
 because we know that if we add those 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.810
 inches that's what will mark the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.810
 point difference between winning and losing 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.640
 to die and I can not convince you 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.090
 that you do not have to throw to that 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.019
 you have at your side look him in the eye 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.530
 but willing to win it with you 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:18.110
 you are going to see an uncle who will sacrifice 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.379
 for this guy because he knows that when 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.770
 come the chance you have what 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:28.040
 same for him 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:33.130
 that's a team gentlemen and we do not 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:38.220
 we cure now as a team 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:41.310
 or we will die as individuals 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.780
 that's football guys that's all 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.780
 what is now 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.180
 are you going to do
