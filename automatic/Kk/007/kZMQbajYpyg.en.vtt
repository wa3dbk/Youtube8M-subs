00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 This country was today's theme of the week 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.029
 how can i get low carb nutrition 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.029
 I left 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.610
 hello and welcome to ticket with fit 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.930
 ev of the deadlines on the internet is my name 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.849
 the proportion not long this button 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.470
 I've turned back on so I 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.570
 She actually tells her exercises 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.550
 I wanted to help as I did last week 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.710
 I've been aware of that 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.660
 a lot of people asked for it so good 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.279
 I am also vegan or too 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.260
 not depending but I want to hold 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.520
 me young carb nutrition and that's why 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.500
 I thought I pushed the video 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.600
 before that and will definitely 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.820
 you 're sure to see this next week 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.649
 still show exercises 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.260
 so how is it if you are not local 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.400
 only if you're vegan often can 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.580
 you do very well 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.800
 It's so easy on vegetables 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:56.090
 Be sure to choose watery vegetables 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.430
 that is called cucumbers tomatoes broccoli it 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.190
 also very good then there are too 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.800
 such as green leafy vegetables as well 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.210
 spinach or lamb's lettuce, for example 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.210
 actually very rich in water live 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.490
 and above all things locally as well 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.670
 for example cauliflower so stories 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.110
 are really highly recommended because 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.490
 I can recommend both if you 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.500
 A low carb diet is there 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.080
 You should eat less fruit on each one 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.110
 but if you like to eat your fruit 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.150
 just grab strawberries or apples 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.680
 Libya back we are very much to 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.810
 recommend because they really are 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.870
 very much the we have the strength 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.570
 They are also very rich in water 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.040
 otherwise i would say if you are up 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.049
 Helpers wants to recommend 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.820
 I, of course, as always beautiful 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.060
 to take olive oil but are also nuts 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.310
 really good nuts you can really great 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.110
 Combine with this low carb diet 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.560
 They also have a lot of nutrients 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.020
 contain and what the higher me 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.299
 know it goes even if you insist 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.280
 now want to have more protein for 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.320
 for example if you make sport or 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.240
 weight training makes whichever 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.189
 Sports just do then you can 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.330
 also from time to time do of them so 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.009
 I know I did not recommend it 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.959
 not personally used now too 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.569
 but not every now and then it is all right 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.250
 and which is very good , which I often do 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.370
 I snacked on time and from time to 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.829
 use is absolutely in powder so that 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.629
 is super super good and if you want to 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.579
 example, raw kosher want like me 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.889
 then it can be really good 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.510
 well any proteins have one 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.569
 protein is needed if it finally 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.859
 through all thinking and on through peas 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.840
 and lentils sprouted 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.569
 I can highly recommend that 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.430
 really a lot of proteins included and 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.469
 I use it over and over again 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.629
 salads and various combinations 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:44.059
 tastes fantastic, of course 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.769
 but I have talked about windows 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.659
 think with time it will be determined 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.549
 can enjoy and in addition the 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.749
 of course, as an artist like me 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.129
 just mentioned and it was natural 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.739
 a defect but they only 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.209
 super good protein cases and natural 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.129
 as i always do my jewelry 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.989
 shoots are also highly recommended 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.459
 I would but then when we need us 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.799
 she then makes use of him 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.870

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.579
 smoothies then I can watch this video too 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.949
