 in the rain under a plexi tells

 real fault I know with my father 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.150
 for 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.430
 in the west I was 17 years old and I 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.480
 reminds me of feeling and it's funny 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.490
 because you have the impression when you 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.750
 see them like that there is little market in 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.760

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.850
 went up this do with it's 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.530
 insurmountable as too long this 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.150
 approach I do not know how much jewelry 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.800
 bullshit about you and you have 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.420
 the impression that the world has stopped 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.580
 for you and it's true that it was 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.720
 diling I believed for a moment that 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.570
 I was the person no longer 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.220
 important 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.510
 it's true that my father told me that you 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.430
 finally he saw that I get used to and very 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.200
 quickly I took the thing and I 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.490
 reminds me in two words I even 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.200
 found a dress from dior that was 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.610
 transparent with ace of spades and 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.170
 I did the most stubborn thing you 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.370
 can do that is mounted hands 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.260
 just to climb the stairs and not to 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.580
 Watch the movie

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.130
