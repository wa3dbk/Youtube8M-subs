00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:12.639
 The domestic raw material wood has been used for years as an energy source 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.639
 ever greater and above all ecological importance 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.570
 in sawmills as here in the Westerwald are almost a byproduct of 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.460
 Construction wood production 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.939
 The wood pellets that Logkow Logos are so soon made Bolz 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.329
 Renewable resource is very changeable 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.300
 Owner of Westphalia or in the Federal Republic sustainable 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.090
 managed forests 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.700
 and if this is burned the renewable resource 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.770
 That's just the same amount of co2 that's actually over the same period 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.040
 that means it is just a co2-neutral fuel 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.770
 and it is an available fuel 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.400
 about fat at SWK holz-her smurf the tensile forces wood-pellets 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.400
 Sacks with 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.340
 This will be on conveyor belts from the sawmill to the adjacent 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.340
 Transported pellet production 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.850
 in such press values ​​from the painting wood shavings or forest residue wood 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.520
 pressed the pellets under high pressure 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 without the addition of chemical binders 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.730
 the energy content of one kilo of such pellets is approximately equal to that of 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.040
 a pint of fuel oil 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.860
 In comparison to sinking fuels, wood pellets are more secretive of a Rheine 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.730
 Recker Noller 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.030
 Raw material produced here percent is endangered raw materials come from 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.100
 from here and the end customer is also supplied in the region 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.670
 where they can learn to be transported so far in the Gulf of Mexico 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.980
 maybe the oil is 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.530
 to Europe percent that's not necessary we have this 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.020
 Environmental hazards too, not wood pellets are a natural one 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.280
 Fuel from and in the domestic raw material wood 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.540
 The pellet producers have long since created large storage capacities 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.680
 In addition, they produce more than is demanded in the domestic market 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.370
 Supply bottlenecks are thus almost impossible to clear 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.250
 Price Fluctuations There are now ten years no price index in these ten 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.949
 Years have a price increase of 11% more 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:14.049
 around the oil arc at 7 2% guest at 79% at the same time 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.559
 And of course that makes me proud of course there are also fluctuations Bernd 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:21.200
 confess who at Christmas and January at 15 degrees minus then 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.489
 determine if you think Keller is empty think it must be expected that too 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.329
 times the price peak but I can shop in the summer can deposits 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.109
 In summer and summer is guaranteed the cheapest point to shop 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.999
 most of them come but they are not the only ones 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.450
 renewable energy sources benefit 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.899
 The production of pellets creates new jobs 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.719
 In addition, the fuel will be four positions more than 90 percent of 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.629
 Value added in the region 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.750
 the goal of the state government is 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.190
 Tripling of private wood pellets inviting in NRW 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.850
 we want to do that by, for example, using the action wood pellets 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.760
 consumers are better informed than before 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.390
 They motivate to use such a system besides actually convincing that 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.779
 a regional raw materials provide the safe 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:08.789
 safe and climate as well as environmentally friendly 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:12.269
 Incidentally, the quality requirements for wood pellets are high 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.099
 and in a standard the certificates set the plus and the endless 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.959
 distinguish high quality wood pellets
