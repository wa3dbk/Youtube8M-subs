00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
poker professionals in fact the large

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.970

reason<00:01:34.630> why<00:01:34.750> we're<00:01:35.170> all<00:01:35.290> so<00:01:35.470> good<00:01:35.710> at<00:01:35.830> what<00:01:35.950> we

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
reason why we're all so good at what we

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.010 
reason why we're all so good at what we
do<00:01:36.250> is<00:01:36.520> because<00:01:36.670> we<00:01:37.000> had<00:01:37.210> friends<00:01:37.840> when<00:01:37.990> we

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
do is because we had friends when we

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.330 
do is because we had friends when we
could<00:01:38.230> bounce<00:01:38.350> ideas<00:01:38.620> off<00:01:39.010> and<00:01:39.070> learn

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
could bounce ideas off and learn

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.000 
could bounce ideas off and learn
together<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.600> things<00:01:40.840> are<00:01:40.990> going<00:01:41.200> bad<00:01:41.380> if<00:01:41.830> any

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
together and things are going bad if any

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.890 
together and things are going bad if any
of<00:01:42.100> us<00:01:42.190> were<00:01:42.250> playing<00:01:42.640> strangely<00:01:43.240> someone

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
of us were playing strangely someone

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.480 
of us were playing strangely someone
else<00:01:44.020> would<00:01:44.170> be<00:01:44.260> there<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:44.560> call<00:01:44.710> you<00:01:44.800> out<00:01:44.920> what

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
else would be there to call you out what

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.690 
else would be there to call you out what
you're<00:01:45.640> doing<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:47.380> think<00:01:47.650> that's<00:01:48.040> actually

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
you're doing and I think that's actually

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.030 
you're doing and I think that's actually
probably<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:49.810> large<00:01:50.020> reason<00:01:50.410> why<00:01:50.500> we<00:01:50.620> wanted<00:01:50.920> to

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
probably a large reason why we wanted to

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.190 
probably a large reason why we wanted to
run<00:01:51.160> a<00:01:51.190> coaching<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:51.760> staking<00:01:51.970> site<00:01:52.330> because

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
run a coaching and staking site because

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.160 
run a coaching and staking site because
I<00:01:53.670> don't<00:01:54.670> know<00:01:54.790> how<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.150> can<00:01:55.450> get<00:01:55.600> really<00:01:56.020> good

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
I don't know how you can get really good

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.390 
I don't know how you can get really good
if<00:01:56.440> you're<00:01:56.590> just<00:01:56.800> playing<00:01:56.980> on<00:01:57.130> your<00:01:57.250> own

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
if you're just playing on your own

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
how much it will be I actually ran 12

thousand dollars above what I expected

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.770 
thousand dollars above what I expected
but<00:02:29.050> then<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.470> got<00:02:29.640> lucky<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.480> should<00:02:31.690> have

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
but then I got lucky and I should have

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.040 
but then I got lucky and I should have
made<00:02:31.900> 78<00:02:32.410> but<00:02:33.310> instead<00:02:33.519> I<00:02:33.580> made<00:02:33.820> 90<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.750> just

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
made 78 but instead I made 90 and just

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.540 
made 78 but instead I made 90 and just
as<00:02:35.170> easily<00:02:35.350> they<00:02:35.830> can<00:02:35.860> swing<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.340> other<00:02:36.370> way

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
as easily they can swing the other way

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.910 
as easily they can swing the other way
and<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:38.080> would<00:02:38.200> say<00:02:38.320> it's<00:02:38.440> very<00:02:38.530> much<00:02:38.860> like

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
and I would say it's very much like

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.520 
and I would say it's very much like
