to say about the figures after thee

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.790 
to say about the figures after thee
after<00:05:31.360> them<00:05:32.280> because<00:05:34.140> this<00:05:35.140> is<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.470> start

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
after them because this is the start

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.460 
after them because this is the start
this<00:05:36.039> is<00:05:36.100> the<00:05:36.789> first<00:05:37.030> figure<00:05:37.660> to<00:05:37.930> start<00:05:38.169> us<00:05:38.289> off

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
this is the first figure to start us off

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.310 
this is the first figure to start us off
then<00:05:39.400> you<00:05:39.520> have<00:05:39.729> the<00:05:39.910> next<00:05:40.210> figure<00:05:40.390> who<00:05:41.020> I'm

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
then you have the next figure who I'm

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.870 
then you have the next figure who I'm
pretty<00:05:41.590> sure<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:41.890> can<00:05:42.010> already<00:05:42.160> guess<00:05:42.640> who

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
pretty sure you can already guess who

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
pretty sure you can already guess who
it's<00:05:43.030> going<00:05:43.210> to<00:05:43.360> be<00:05:44.940> certain<00:05:45.940> red<00:05:46.300> sword<00:05:46.570> nudge

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
it's going to be certain red sword nudge

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.080 
it's going to be certain red sword nudge
nudge<00:05:47.169> wink<00:05:47.200> wink<00:05:47.500> hint<00:05:47.770> hint<00:05:48.990> and<00:05:51.090> then

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
nudge wink wink hint hint and then

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.440 
nudge wink wink hint hint and then
another<00:05:52.270> two<00:05:52.570> figures<00:05:52.990> and<00:05:54.150> then<00:05:55.150> you<00:05:55.330> have

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
another two figures and then you have

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.060 
another two figures and then you have
another<00:05:55.479> month<00:05:55.960> left<00:05:56.260> after<00:05:56.620> this<00:05:56.770> and<00:05:56.919> then<00:05:57.010> I
