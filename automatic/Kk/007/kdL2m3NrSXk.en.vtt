00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 ran to the ball for christian fuchs and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.819
 co was after two days 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.950
 Frustration coping with the pill again 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.580
 before that was the work up of the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.719
 stuttgart defeat 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.130
 of course very disappointed after the game 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.230
 if you just what we are 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.470
 could not implement 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.119
 maybe the first 15 minutes we yes 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.830
 that we have implemented 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.350
 had been made to go deep 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.519
 to radiate danger and that is 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.869
 actually no longer succeeded 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.030
 and the game is analyzed and I hope 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.260
 also drawn the right conclusions 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.850
 theme can only be on his 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.010
 Strengthen everything negative 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.980
 Hide and feel the frustration of the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.200
 footballer soul to shoot yes yes that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.579
 and very diligent and much analyzed 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.680
 even after defeats you have the thing 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.969
 done again 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.129
 we all have to also again 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.719
 thoughts naturally at home too 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.210
 times happiness looked at twice so not 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.940
 definitely teeth but you look it then 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.699
 Nevertheless, what lessons do you have from this? 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.760
 drawn for a next endgame in 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.580
 FRIBORG oh well it's easy to 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.140
 that we only react 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.580
 instead of acting and I think 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.080
 stuttgart showed us that very well 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.780
 have played very aggressive 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.700
 always looking for the way forward 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.210
 the roads have also gone to the deep 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.770
 and played forward in football 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.780
 we also have to do that very easily 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.000
 implement a freiburg course 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.000
 an enemy he comes home very strong 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.799
 and of course the big one 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.290
 driving champions league qualification 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.820
 in addition there is royal blue with the art 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.030
 the football of freiburg the one or 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.020
 others did not get along so well 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.780
 who with gladbach not for a long time 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.909
 be able to win 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.159
 before 2 plays then just after years 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.380
 won again and would be nice than that 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.420
 in freiburg berlin please the unit on 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 Tuesday held some ready first came 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.890
 rafael an hour late because in the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.750
 full closure of the a 2 was and shortly before 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.939
 The exit did not go back and forth 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.340
 then came fright second to julian 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.939
 draxler after a fight with roman 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.610
 New Town 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.540
 At first he had to lie down then had to 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.550
 be treated 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.720
 the right ankle had to hurt 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.400
 be cooled 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.080
 and then it caught 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.710
 sharper are the procedure but just 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.470
 first had to pause like christian 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.530
 fuchs the vor stuttgart 6 times at the beginning 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.580
 just sat on the bench had one 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.050
 completely new experience was not easy 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.700
 Everything was not easy at the beginning 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.630
 yes yes 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.890
 or if I am in the past 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.270
 no matter where I played actually 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.900
 more and more counted as permanent staff 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.100
 have and also most parties or 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.220
 90 percent of my players from the beginning 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.720
 and of course one 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.320
 certain experience I have made 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.220
 but I have to deal with that now 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.680
 but still nothing is learned 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.300
 I also want to learn this apprenticeship 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.040
 if something does not go wrong 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.050
 hang your head over and over again 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.800
 fight and maybe it's enough 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.720
 for Saturday 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.490
 as I now roll distribution 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.709
 silvas it comes that he was hurt and 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.540
 By doing that I mean I'm shooting 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.340
 me in training on i problems best 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.590
 to give and that he starts in training 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.459
 the line always remains true to itself and 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.970
 then you will see what on saturday 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.140
 but of course I want to play 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.300
 clearly his wish fulfilled the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.830
 fuksa like and immediately follow the big one 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.650
 To fulfill fourth place is essential 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.510
 but it must be more difficult 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.519
 Look that you play that we can do that 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.260
 retrieve our performance and if 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.849
 with your place bring the retrieve what 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.349
 we are what we can then 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.349
 confident that we will win
