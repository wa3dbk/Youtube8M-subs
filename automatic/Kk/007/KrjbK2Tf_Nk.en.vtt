00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it's a hardware you can send in the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.760 
it's a hardware you can send in the
Harvard<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.230> she's<00:02:57.350> in<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.500> hardware

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
Harvard and she's in the hardware
