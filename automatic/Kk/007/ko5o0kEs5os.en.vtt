00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.940
 very good guys how are you that we are 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.079
 in a new gta 5 video online and in 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.939
 this case I bring you a pretty video 

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:08.620
 short but also pretty pretty 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.730
 curious since not all people or 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.500
 almost everyone who is watching this video 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.300
 right now he would be asking how 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.890
 balls put them to the liberator that 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.570
 is the new car that they have got into this 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.189
 last dlc just before yesterday if 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.079
 I do not remember badly in the morning because 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.210
 I say medstar and asking everyone how 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.589
 cojones has put this color to the car not 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.909
 to this new car has competed in gta 5 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.019
 online if the color can not be 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.310
 change not because the mistakes back to 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.079
 everyone has taken everything very seriously 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.429
 this patriotism and the car as there 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.320
 it can be changed at any time 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.580
 color just like the non-mythical motorcycle 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.770
 it is very easy, I 'll leave it 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.300
 just under the description a link 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.090
 that will take you to a career which has 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.460
 created a video this dawn 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.900
 then just under the description 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.240
 so that downloads for playstation3 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.860
 I think unfortunately for 360 team 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.730
 It's not worth it if you find any 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.290
 puts also down by the 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.820
 description but as I say it's very easy 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.560
 then in that activity and then 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.640
 when you enter here in the menu of the 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.050
 gossip that is only what is 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.700
 can play with all terrain because what 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.829
 what I would have to do is select the 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.880
 of Liberatori look that is a moment I will 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.230
 to change it there are the 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.490
 selected and we see that it does not have the 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.480
 color ok we can not put the color 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.680
 that we want because team not only 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.610
 the gesture of victory and we can not 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.650
 select the color 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.210
 but there is a very easy way to put it 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.830
 the color is to tell you that you can not 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.120
 put any color is worth only 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.710
 you can put the color of the crew 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.150
 then when it is not in any 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.280
 Greek if you do not have a clear screen 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.930
 then you will not be able to modify the color 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.190
 but good as I say it is very easy to create 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.240
 a sieve so good the only thing 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.710
 have to do is register in 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.330
 social club and then well then and create 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.979
 the crew and you think the color of the crisis 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.420
 ok then in this case I have like 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.640
 you already know the green that believes it from 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.960
 It's been a week since I created my first 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.820
 I think it's totally full 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.900
 and soon create a new one but as 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.220
 I say we have to do well then 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.690
 we select just the bodybuilder to 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.430
 the left or the test to the right of 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.290
 the same then 'no migration for 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.940
 example the Sandinista and we have to 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.229
 select the color of the crew and without 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.890
 no hurry without having to do it 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.050
 Quick 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.460
 we just give it to the right and 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.530
 we select the liberator as 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.450
 you are seeing and it will be with the color 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.030
 totally modified the color is green 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.649
 how do you see my mother how is it left 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.060
 awesome the green color I think that 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.680
 is the color that best fits this 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.570
 car because I do not know is pretty enough 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 wyle very kid that this is the trick then 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.750
 they want to point out good today more than tricks 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.950
 and a method to change the color to that of 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.720
 car since good could play the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.860
 activity and everything is the theme of nabai has 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.910
 liked this public policy video and 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.080

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.190

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.190
