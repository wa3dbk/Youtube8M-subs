00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520 
today on GoPro tips and tricks' we're

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.910 
today on GoPro tips and tricks' we're
making<00:00:06.850> a<00:00:06.939> pole<00:00:07.269> mount<00:00:07.569> which<00:00:08.380> can<00:00:08.800> be

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
making a pole mount which can be

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.380 
making a pole mount which can be
attached<00:00:09.340> to<00:00:09.580> any<00:00:10.260> broom<00:00:11.260> handle<00:00:11.860> or

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.390 
attached to any broom handle or

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.970 
attached to any broom handle or
extendable<00:00:13.390> handle<00:00:13.690> like<00:00:13.810> this<00:00:13.990> which<00:00:14.710> has

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
extendable handle like this which has

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.710 
extendable handle like this which has
threads<00:00:15.400> on<00:00:15.580> the<00:00:15.700> end<00:00:15.850> of<00:00:15.970> it<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:19.539> is<00:00:19.600> a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
threads on the end of it this is a

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.750 
threads on the end of it this is a
really<00:00:20.200> cool<00:00:20.410> mount<00:00:20.680> because<00:00:21.250> it's<00:00:21.430> very

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
really cool mount because it's very

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.150 
really cool mount because it's very
compact<00:00:22.510> and<00:00:22.660> yet<00:00:22.930> can<00:00:23.140> be<00:00:23.170> attached<00:00:23.619> to<00:00:23.830> some

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
compact and yet can be attached to some

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.180 
compact and yet can be attached to some
very<00:00:24.570> very<00:00:25.570> long<00:00:26.170> poles<00:00:26.560> if<00:00:26.860> you<00:00:26.949> want<00:00:27.100> to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
very very long poles if you want to

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.340 
very very long poles if you want to
travel<00:00:27.460> with<00:00:27.610> something<00:00:28.060> like<00:00:28.690> that<00:00:28.720> like<00:00:29.170> the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
travel with something like that like the

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.019 
travel with something like that like the
piece<00:00:29.590> we're<00:00:29.830> going<00:00:29.980> to<00:00:30.070> design<00:00:30.340> you<00:00:30.789> can<00:00:30.910> go

this<00:00:46.960> mount

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
this mount

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.610 
this mount
we<00:00:48.429> need<00:00:48.699> the<00:00:49.120> base<00:00:49.389> and<00:00:49.749> this<00:00:49.929> base<00:00:49.989> has<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.469> be

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
we need the base and this base has to be

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.489 
we need the base and this base has to be
something<00:00:51.100> that<00:00:51.339> has<00:00:52.030> threads<00:00:52.510> on<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:53.170> end<00:00:53.199> of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499 
something that has threads on the end of

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.199 
something that has threads on the end of
it<00:00:53.589> I<00:00:53.829> went<00:00:54.429> to<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.549> hardware<00:00:54.819> store<00:00:54.879> and<00:00:55.120> I

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:55.209 
it I went to the hardware store and I

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:57.090 
it I went to the hardware store and I
wandered<00:00:55.479> around<00:00:55.539> for<00:00:55.899> a<00:00:55.929> long<00:00:56.289> time<00:00:56.559> until<00:00:56.920> I

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
wandered around for a long time until I

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.459 
wandered around for a long time until I
found<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.579> cheapest<00:00:58.089> thing<00:00:58.299> I<00:00:58.449> could<00:00:58.719> which

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
found the cheapest thing I could which

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.379 
found the cheapest thing I could which
would<00:00:59.739> facilitate<00:00:59.920> mounting<00:01:00.729> a<00:01:00.789> GoPro<00:01:01.119> onto

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:01.389 
would facilitate mounting a GoPro onto

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:03.629 
would facilitate mounting a GoPro onto
it<00:01:01.539> and<00:01:01.659> was<00:01:02.109> threaded<00:01:02.619> and<00:01:02.829> what<00:01:03.519> I<00:01:03.549> came

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
it and was threaded and what I came

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:06.420 
it and was threaded and what I came
across<00:01:03.940> was<00:01:04.629> this<00:01:04.869> roller<00:01:05.379> this<00:01:05.740> was<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.950> four

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
across was this roller this was a four

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.970 
across was this roller this was a four
dollar<00:01:06.970> roller<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.900> it<00:01:08.620> was<00:01:08.710> a<00:01:08.770> cheaper

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
dollar roller and it was a cheaper

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.440 
dollar roller and it was a cheaper
school<00:01:09.100> where<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.250> could<00:01:09.370> possibly<00:01:09.670> find<00:01:09.880> so

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
school where I could possibly find so

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.940 
school where I could possibly find so
what<00:01:10.570> we're<00:01:10.660> gonna<00:01:10.720> do<00:01:10.960> is<00:01:11.200> just<00:01:11.260> cut<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.830> end

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
what we're gonna do is just cut the end

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.410 
what we're gonna do is just cut the end
of<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.100> roller<00:01:12.280> off<00:01:12.490> right<00:01:12.730> here<00:01:12.970> because<00:01:13.300> we

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
of the roller off right here because we

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.790 
of the roller off right here because we
don't<00:01:13.540> need<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.960> be<00:01:14.110> a<00:01:14.140> paint<00:01:14.440> roller<00:01:14.500> we

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
don't need it to be a paint roller we

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.110 
don't need it to be a paint roller we
just<00:01:15.010> need<00:01:15.160> this<00:01:15.340> little<00:01:15.550> piece<00:01:15.790> here<00:01:15.820> which

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
just need this little piece here which

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.760 
just need this little piece here which
has<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.330> threads<00:01:16.600> on<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.810> bottom<00:01:17.050> of<00:01:17.080> it<00:01:17.200> and

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
has the threads on the bottom of it and

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.590 
has the threads on the bottom of it and
then<00:01:17.860> we're<00:01:17.950> gonna<00:01:18.040> take<00:01:18.280> our<00:01:18.490> GoPro<00:01:19.210> adhesive

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
then we're gonna take our GoPro adhesive

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.690 
then we're gonna take our GoPro adhesive
mount<00:01:19.810> stick<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.650> on<00:01:20.770> right<00:01:21.040> here<00:01:21.310> with<00:01:21.490> a<00:01:21.520> nice
