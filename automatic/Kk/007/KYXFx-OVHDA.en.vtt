00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.550
 Hi, girls and boys, I'm Gabriela. 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.860
 we have a shop for assembly parts 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.340
 jewelry store and our store is 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.810
 our website is www.ana.pt gabriela 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.060
 dot com 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.619
 I decided to make a video for you guys. 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.690
 showing me a little how I 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.830
 I work with a circle of 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.779
 colors or chromatic circle or is a cycle of 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.690
 color is I'll show you one 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.239
 very old sheet of the time I 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.449
 I was doing college at heart. 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.609
 I did not finish but it was a 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.989
 Of the things that I loved the most in college 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.719
 it was one of the subjects that I liked the most 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.879
 it was of color psychology, right? 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.699
 and it is an honor for the first semesters 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:50.449
 so this time in this time of 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.370
 College I met the old sheet 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.170
 trip told the sheet that it is from 2002 we 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.499
 we are in 2014 she is 12 years old 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.559
 and knows that one 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:04.159
 chocolate starts here for us 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.020
 it starts here going through it this 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.120
 how we go about it. 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.710
 use our chromatic circle 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.860
 circle of things 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.760
 The goal is to use a dark color 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.250
 this hue in the case the last to 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.490
 lighter color on this other side 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.560
 opposite of it understands then so if you 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.840
 will use this red color to 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.620
 wine you can use a light green 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.090
 it is 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.530
 so this is the goal that you 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.840
 learned to use with things 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.270
 What is it here? 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.150
 a visual harmony and this is going to 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.620
 You're a good shot, shall we say? 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.390
 When are you going to work with the cut? 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.160
 in his pieces of jewelry 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.250
 then I'll give another so because we 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.190
 use the example color in case this here 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.470
 number four we already come one two three is 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.270
 the fourth was we come in a two 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.180
 three to four with what would be the case 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.360
 this here so this is the more to 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.729
 Outside is the color from the inside how much to 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.610
 outside in this case is to wake up right there 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.740
 they do they always that way ok 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.390
 so I'm going to work here a color that 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.729
 I always do with you until 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.400
 I worked on the earring that is a 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.200
 turquoise and pulled pro coral I 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.690
 I'll show you yourselves a 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.140
 ask me what I did 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.060
 working with these, that part is 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.549
 so circle the leaves it is obvious that 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.170
 You do not need to get stuck in 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.569
 colors you 're working with, right? 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.819
 Girls, can you play for a while? 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.080
 work a bit with the trends a 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.480
 album that you are from 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.170
 Predilection What is a customer asking you? 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.060
 so then 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.530
 Actually, this here to give a 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.690
 But it does not mean that we're going to 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.670
 get stuck in this right there 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.849
 in no way can we really 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.890
 get away from it all but we 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.140
 the base we will have a north to 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.930
 follow and that depends on you if you go 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.940
 to follow or not is this earring for example 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.640
 works with complementary colors is 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.160
 now I do not work with becoming 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.019
 so rigid ages for example its the 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.209
 I work with this very shade of pink 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.670
 I love you, by the way, I can work 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.370
 he contrasted with an agreement and green 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.890
 dark are and are complementary things 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.709
 but I did not stay the key 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.829
 the color of the color he asks let's say so 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.799
 Yeah, I'll put this light green here. 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:25.700
 I can work with very dark pink pink 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.549
 fux if a is that cobain tastes pretty strong 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.470
 so always an opposing tint 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.569
 another and will play with 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.269
 the color nuances lighter and more 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.760
 Dark is so it's this loves this 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.370
 video is very fast just to present 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.040
 for you, the circle of colors 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.650
 This circle is there on google you 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.780
 can look for this from the time of the 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.000
 college is clean this people here 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.620
 She's the guard for a long time. She 'll be a 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.889
 pastry 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.700
 It was great for me, that's how it was for me. 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:00.590
 really one in the exact notion of what you 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.079
 can work as we are with the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.109
 The course that I did was of heart then 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.970
 he gave you a notion is direct from 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.699
 how do you relate to things at 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.280
 psychology of colors in each environment 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:15.540
 with alcohol that should or should not use 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.669
 if you put a background color 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.280
 there you can put other points of light 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.310
 the color complementary to that and in the biju that 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.289
 is a screen also remains the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.060
 people start doing a job in 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.520
 white work that comes out of nowhere and you 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.190
 Then you can build. 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.380
 use the same technique as putting the 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.780
 complementary things and make your 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.419
 piece ok I very much hope that you have 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.220
 I liked this video very quickly 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.560
 but I just wanted to let you guys know

 girls that yes in another way but 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.560
