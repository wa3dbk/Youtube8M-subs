00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.530 
gorge out and we're running out of
daylight<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.530> we<00:02:42.560> decided<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.310> head<00:02:44.299> for<00:02:44.329> the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
daylight so we decided to head for the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.520 
daylight so we decided to head for the
hills<00:02:44.630> with<00:02:45.019> our<00:02:45.170> towers<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.650> finally

and<00:02:49.350> from<00:02:49.980> what<00:02:50.130> we've<00:02:50.280> seen<00:02:50.490> this<00:02:50.640> morning<00:02:50.910> I

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
and from what we've seen this morning I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.550 
and from what we've seen this morning I

think there was a pretty good decision
the<00:02:52.890> river<00:02:53.240> probably<00:02:54.240> got<00:02:54.390> out<00:02:54.569> actually

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the river probably got out actually
