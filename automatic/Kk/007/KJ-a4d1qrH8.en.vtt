00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.509
 official presentation of those who are going to 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.910
 be the reinforcements of the club 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:24.439
 college of cougars during this tournament 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.029
 that comes this that although they already take care 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.240
 they know them and they have not been training 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.949
 but good yosgart gutiérrez that all 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.949

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.790
 ramis 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 As you well know, well, help, we see 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.310
 I knew him from Cruz Gerardo blue and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.700
 jonathan 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.490
 with the board of directors with the coaching staff 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.280
 we were watching them we went to see them in 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.170
 I live with them they know 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.540
 of their commitment to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.970
 institution where they are and we are 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.980
 sure they come to shore up a 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.350
 very good base of players that 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.990
 we have and know what the objectives are 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.290
 that we have what it is to always fight 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.020
 championship no good morning everyone 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.510
 first of all I'm very happy with 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 form rows in a team like cougars 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.950
 Then they told me about the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 responsibility that this post generates 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.229
 in this team 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.740
 I'm very calm because my base is 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.570
 work and sacrifice from 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.090
 there you can go harvesting things very 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.390
 good I'm very well accompanied by 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.939
 I will give so in that sense I feel 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.860
 very calm I think that I will go 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.990
 well because I have many always sold 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.119
 always accompanies me and also the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.440
 partners that we have are very good and 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.080
 this makes every day easier 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.370
 and when they made me a cougar we got 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.560
 to cry with my family because it's a 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.230
 club so big and I come to do the same 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.990
 I was doing there and trying to get 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.150
 earn the love of the people and 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.020
 thank you in each game to the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.390
 leaders that made it possible that I go 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.360
 to be here 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.090
 the truth that very happy to get to 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.020
 a team as big as cougars 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.530
 previously I had the possibility of 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.330
 play on important teams the pressure 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.700
 who demands to wear this shirt like that 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.130
 How good to try to do the best 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.500
 in each game and demonstrate 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.720
 what I social up here first 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.690
 thank people that only possible 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.610
 so that I was here and what more 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.430
 motivation needs one that a team 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.710
 like how cougars come to look 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.590
 opportunities to a big team that 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.740
 motivates anyone the truth that I am 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.800
 very happy to be here 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.420
 and to demonstrate why the memo confirms yes 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.060
 Of course that is the intention 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.680
 At the end of the day we believe that 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.930
 foreigners have to come to 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.390
 contribute and they have to be playing not 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.610
 the players that good maybe you 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.500
 they left now they did not have great 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.550
 participation and that's why they were not taken 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.890
 the measurements is not the same when you enter 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.740
 to a half of the process that now that 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.080
 let's start this as you say good is 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.190
 is propping up the team we are not 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.410
 aware that we have a good base 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.080
 both Mexicans and foreigners and 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.300
 these people come to contribute to put their 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.950
 grain of sand to be a team more 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.150
 constant from the beginning that I think 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.310
 that it weighed us a lot to be more 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.720
 constants of the premises 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.940
 we know that we did not have good 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.130
 results here at home and we have 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.500
 that we improve a lot in that we have to 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.810
 be in 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.630
 at the top of the table for 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.620
 have no problems in qualifying and 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.840
 then of course we have to be 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.270
 protagonists in the good league 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.010
 because it 's a very punctual position, not what 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.560
 we talked with the governing body with 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.970
 a coaching staff and we know that good 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.100
 to start saldivar had a great 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.570
 tournament and I am now aware that 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.550
 comes to fight a position with bernabé and 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.440
 with saldivar it will be a decision again 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.720
 who do not play but I also 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.220
 we need a person of experience 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.580
 in that position 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.230
 and as I said this part of the project 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.660
 young people and that's why today they are adding 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.450
 77 players from the U-20 and the 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.269
 second to the first team is not the 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.680
 intention we had to open spaces 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.169
 how it looked good because I think the 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.450
 we are opening and generating will be 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.430
 registered with us said I hope that 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.680
 I 'm not leaving, but it is and 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.919
 moment jesus gallardo omar and doubts 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.260
 pablo since it is josé carlos oaks 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.390
 Romario valdés 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.460
 and Jorge is Camilo, I think it's seven 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.800
 that will also be in the first 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.800
 team if we are aware and that's why 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.080
 be reinforcing as I mentioned I think 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.400
 that we have a good base plus the 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.210
 players that come I think they come to 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.830
 prop up and contribute their part this bad 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.320
 the young people that we are integrating 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.420
 I think we have a good staff that 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.670
 we must be fighting up 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.010
 the idea is that their young people play the 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.480
 cup as we have been handling it myself 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.970
 I think they have to develop 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.980
 and they need competition at the end 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.380
 of beads the cup I think it serves 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.270
 for that and for that is designed this 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.370
 our idea is that beyond that 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.660
 play in sub-20 can also in 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.860
 these competences that serve them as 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.140
 development then ultimately 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.700
 we believe are rising young people of 18 and 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.110
 19 years that I think have a greater 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.120
 process that maybe those that already 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.100
 they were more years old and had not 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.140
 had a lot of participation we believe that a 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.690
 several of them have quality and that 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.850
 may be the future of cougars then 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.550
 you have to give them that competence and so what 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.860
 we want as we said also the idea 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.130
 is medium to long term and go down 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.240
 at the end of three months accounts here 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.000
 now let's play with one less 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.680
 return to past this past when 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.190
 there are nine today we are going to play with eight 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.710
 so everything is a process and good 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.720
 now we said that we were going to lower the 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.250
 average age I think today 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.900
 the average of 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.720
 age we want to work the sectionalists 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.430
 well I think it's going down 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.840
 and we also said that we were going to give 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.130
 opportunity for young people today we are 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.500
 going up 7 young people of sub 20 and of 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.690
 second the first team then it's a 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.850
 process true and good the posts 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.710
 also nothing places we would like 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.990
 accelerate them I think there's little time in 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.220
 this in this period and we'll see in a 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.220
 future but sometimes working
