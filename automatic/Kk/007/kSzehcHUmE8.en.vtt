00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.530
 with the girls with the video I'm going to 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.180
 explain how to use the practical 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.980
 uncollectible then I will make a series 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.809
 of tutorials with the different 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.900
 finishes that you can find you have the 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.060
 plastic in black in transparent in 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.190
 translucent in white and also 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.710
 printable this material you have many 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.869
 possibilities for example you can do 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.100
 studs brooches pins 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.380
 anything that comes to mind 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.320
 The particularity of this material is 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.780
 that when heated it shrinks and takes a 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.550
 thickness then there are two methods for 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.950
 heat it you can heat it in the oven 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.720
 of house that is not toxic to any 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.030
 problem and if you do not have the option to 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.430
 this heat gun 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.809
 good as I told you to warm it to 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.750
 a certain temperature the plastic will 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.269
 shrink then to make you an idea 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.920
 you can make a rule and so you have it 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.360
 of reference for each time you want 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.460
 do one thing for example they will be 10 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.329
 centimeters in reality and on heating 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.329
 they have been left this size 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.060
 to start today we are going to make a 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.350
 pendant for mobile with plastic 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.650
 printable because it is the simplest 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.030
 then do this the materials that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.920
 we will need are the following 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.619
 first the printable plastic 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.930
 once you have chosen your drawing what 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.150
 printed on this plastic 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.430
 then you need a surface on the 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.560
 that heat the plastic for example a 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.410
 same dish can serve then also 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.850
 you need something to reject it because 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.979
 once warmed up sometimes it remains a 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.200
 little curved then with a glass itself 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.540
 you can also do 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.400
 then need scissors to trim it 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.260
 we can to make a hole for 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.360
 then hook it to the pendant we're going to 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.010
 do with a hole punch or 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.750
 well with a punch that we have more 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.390
 size options 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.140
 then we will need an object to 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.110
 hold it while we are heating up 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.690
 why take a jet of air because we are 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.220
 can then fly finally the rings 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.080
 and a tool to find the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.820
 rings and then good of course the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.690
 hanging for the mount once we have 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.560
 the printed drawing will be cut out 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.560
 around 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.820
 and we make the hole with the punch 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.820
 with the drill 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.660
 Once we have it, we can 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.960
 warm it up so we take a 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.970
 tool to hold it once 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.930
 we have started to warm up we heat 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.930
 a little bit the gun 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.519
 ah 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.550
 as I said before once warmed up what 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.810
 you have to get out 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.810
 so that it stays flat 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.470
 once you have the object in fact 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.390
 so we have to put a pendant to 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.260
 mobile then will finish him 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.260
 we put the washer 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.960
 we already have the supermoto 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.430
 and in this case I've put a little bit of 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.020
 varnish and a little bit of felt in the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.860
 back to make it do a 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.860
 nicer finish
