said I used tissue tape along the edges

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.360 
said I used tissue tape along the edges
to<00:02:28.209> really<00:02:28.780> reinforce<00:02:29.170> things<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.220> that

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
to really reinforce things so that

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.610 
to really reinforce things so that
hopefully<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:31.209> book<00:02:31.450> will<00:02:31.690> hold<00:02:32.050> up<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.260> wear

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
hopefully this book will hold up to wear

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.610 
hopefully this book will hold up to wear
and<00:02:32.800> tear<00:02:33.069> I've<00:02:33.640> also<00:02:34.120> used<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:35.170> fact<00:02:35.470> that

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
and tear I've also used the fact that

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.940 
and tear I've also used the fact that
it's<00:02:35.860> an<00:02:36.010> envelope<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:37.090> Brad<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.530> lot<00:02:38.769> of

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
it's an envelope to Brad in a lot of

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.509 
it's an envelope to Brad in a lot of
metal<00:02:39.400> embellishments<00:02:40.390> so<00:02:40.690> these<00:02:41.620> do<00:02:42.010> open

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
metal embellishments so these do open

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.610 
metal embellishments so these do open
but<00:02:42.970> I'm<00:02:43.120> choosing<00:02:43.599> not<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.110> stuff<00:02:44.349> anything

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
but I'm choosing not to stuff anything

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.110 
but I'm choosing not to stuff anything
inside<00:02:45.069> them<00:02:45.280> because<00:02:45.580> it's<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:45.819> heavily

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
inside them because it's so heavily

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.059 
inside them because it's so heavily
embellished<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:47.019> what<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.200> did<00:02:47.440> was<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.650> just

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
embellished but what I did was I just

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.630 
embellished but what I did was I just
simply<00:02:49.030> used<00:02:49.720> by<00:02:49.930> brads<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.739> because<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.550> an

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
simply used by brads and because it's an

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.000 
simply used by brads and because it's an
envelope<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.480> backs<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.319> them<00:02:53.530> are<00:02:53.739> hidden

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
envelope the backs of them are hidden

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.990
