these are wanting to help me proportion
the<00:00:46.110> structure<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.640> also<00:00:47.789> serve<00:00:48.120> as<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the structure and they also serve as a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.430 
the structure and they also serve as a
foundation<00:00:48.710> for<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> basis<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.460> plane

foundation for the basis of my plane

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.729 
foundation for the basis of my plane
we'll<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.559> ahead<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.300> hide<00:00:54.300> my<00:00:54.600> guidelines<00:00:55.140> so

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
we'll go ahead and hide my guidelines so

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.560 
we'll go ahead and hide my guidelines so
they<00:00:55.920> denote<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> red<00:00:56.520> lines<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.059> drop<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
they denote in red lines that I drop the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.189 
they denote in red lines that I drop the
steps<00:00:57.809> won't<00:00:58.620> distract<00:00:59.070> the<00:01:00.050> guidelines<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
steps won't distract the guidelines of

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.050 
steps won't distract the guidelines of
the<00:01:01.579> plane<00:01:03.409> I'll<00:01:04.409> go<00:01:04.589> ahead<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.060> start

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the plane I'll go ahead and start

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.969 
the plane I'll go ahead and start
drawing<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.780> actual<00:01:07.229> structure<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.770> this

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
drawing the actual structure of this

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.140 
drawing the actual structure of this
plane

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.070 

the<00:01:15.150> tail

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.550 

that's<00:01:21.650> step<00:01:21.920> 2<00:01:22.250> I'll<00:01:22.880> make<00:01:23.120> step<00:01:23.420> 3<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:24.320> this

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
that's step 2 I'll make step 3 and this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:36.820 
that's step 2 I'll make step 3 and this
would<00:01:24.710> be<00:01:24.830> for<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.780> wings<00:01:34.630> step<00:01:35.630> 4<00:01:36.050> well

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
would be for the wings step 4 well

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.680 
would be for the wings step 4 well
before<00:01:38.380> we<00:01:39.380> head<00:01:39.710> over<00:01:39.920> plane<00:01:40.190> as<00:01:40.850> well<00:01:41.180> as<00:01:41.300> the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
before we head over plane as well as the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:52.960 
before we head over plane as well as the
window

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:01.840 

no<00:01:53.970> sugar

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.100 

we'll<00:02:02.850> go<00:02:02.970> ahead<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.150> make<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.360> new<00:02:03.570> step<00:02:03.840> step

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
we'll go ahead and make a new step step

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.330 
we'll go ahead and make a new step step
5<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.830> this<00:02:05.550> will<00:02:05.730> be<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.120> engines<00:02:07.340> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
5 and this will be for the engines the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.390 
5 and this will be for the engines the
little<00:02:08.610> engine<00:02:09.450> things<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.960> hang<00:02:10.170> below<00:02:11.130> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
little engine things that hang below the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.340 
little engine things that hang below the
wing<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.570> plate<00:02:14.060> make<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> new<00:02:15.360> step<00:02:15.630> step<00:02:15.990> 6

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
wing of the plate make a new step step 6

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.640 
wing of the plate make a new step step 6
and<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.000> last<00:02:18.240> detail<00:02:19.050> on<00:02:19.500> the

and this is for the last detail on the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.610 
and this is for the last detail on the
tail<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.130> plane<00:02:21.200> I'm<00:02:22.200> gonna<00:02:22.320> hide<00:02:22.530> my

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.410 
guide lines and here I have my
nice-looking<00:02:25.440> plane<00:02:25.710> just<00:02:26.460> erase<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:26.880> line

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
nice-looking plane just erase this line

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.870 
nice-looking plane just erase this line
right<00:02:27.660> here<00:02:27.720> that's<00:02:28.680> crossing<00:02:29.190> over<00:02:29.460> with<00:02:29.730> the
