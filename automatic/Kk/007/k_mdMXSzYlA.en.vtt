avocados<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.160> had<00:00:17.670> great<00:00:18.090> ideas<00:00:18.300> for<00:00:18.570> what

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
avocados in I had great ideas for what

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.170 
avocados in I had great ideas for what
to<00:00:18.900> do<00:00:19.170> with<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.439> but<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.550> days<00:00:20.730> went<00:00:20.970> by<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
to do with it but the days went by and

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.509 
to do with it but the days went by and
so<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.960> didn't<00:00:22.320> get<00:00:22.439> around<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.279> here

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
so I didn't get around to it and so here

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.060 
so I didn't get around to it and so here
we<00:00:23.640> are<00:00:23.760> about<00:00:24.210> five<00:00:24.600> days<00:00:24.869> later<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.920> know

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
we are about five days later and I know

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.279 
we are about five days later and I know
it's<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.580> little<00:00:26.670> squishy<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.689> when<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.990> opened

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
it's a little squishy so when I opened

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.560 
it's a little squishy so when I opened
it<00:00:28.349> may<00:00:28.680> not<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.099> prettiest<00:00:29.490> avocado<00:00:29.939> but

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it may not be the prettiest avocado but

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.150 
it may not be the prettiest avocado but
it<00:00:30.750> sure<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.349> delicious<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
it sure is going to be delicious so the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.340 
it sure is going to be delicious so the
first<00:00:32.399> thing<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.640> do<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.809> cut<00:00:34.020> into<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
first thing you do is you cut into it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:45.200 
first thing you do is you cut into it
like<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:41.750> there<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:44.030> don't<00:00:45.030> look

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
like that there we have it don't look

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.229 
like that there we have it don't look
too<00:00:45.390> closely<00:00:46.399> it's<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.760> little<00:00:47.940> bit

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
too closely it's just a little bit

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
too closely it's just a little bit
bruised<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.469> you've<00:00:49.829> worked<00:00:50.129> with

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
bruised and if you've worked with

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.010 
bruised and if you've worked with
avocados<00:00:50.969> before<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.899> they

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
avocados before you know that they

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
avocados before you know that they
oxidize<00:00:52.289> very<00:00:52.920> quickly<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:54.030> basically<00:00:54.239> we're

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
oxidize very quickly but basically we're

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.910 
oxidize very quickly but basically we're
going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.780> take<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.170> flesh<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> avocado

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
going to take the flesh of the avocado

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.959 
going to take the flesh of the avocado
and<00:00:56.760> put<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.420> blender<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:02.670> work<00:01:02.789> around

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and put it in a blender to work around

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.759 
and put it in a blender to work around
the<00:01:03.239> pit<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> didn't<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> very<00:01:04.439> good<00:01:04.619> job

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the pit here I didn't do a very good job

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.260 
the pit here I didn't do a very good job
of<00:01:05.119> getting<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:07.430> pit<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.119> also

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
of getting the pit out but it's also

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.109 
of getting the pit out but it's also
because<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.840> kind<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.700> squishy<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:11.939> but

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
because it's kind of a squishy one but

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.300 
because it's kind of a squishy one but
there<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.869> beautiful<00:01:13.320> avocado<00:01:13.619> color

so<00:01:33.390> there's<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.780> avocado<00:01:34.350> part<00:01:34.740> now<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.450> was

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
so there's the avocado part now as I was

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.210 
so there's the avocado part now as I was
saying<00:01:36.630> earlier<00:01:37.079> if<00:01:37.560> you've<00:01:37.710> worked<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.070> an

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
saying earlier if you've worked with an

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.770 
saying earlier if you've worked with an
avocado<00:01:39.409> then<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.590> know<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.360> as<00:01:42.360> soon<00:01:42.570> as

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
avocado then you know that as soon as

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.850 
avocado then you know that as soon as
it's<00:01:42.990> exposed<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.520> air<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.000> oxidizes<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
it's exposed to the air it oxidizes so a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.340 
it's exposed to the air it oxidizes so a
good<00:01:47.399> way<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.729> keep<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.420> from<00:01:48.659> happening<00:01:48.689> as

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
good way to keep that from happening as

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.870 
good way to keep that from happening as
with<00:01:50.250> apples<00:01:50.789> is<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.750> fly<00:01:52.110> line<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> take

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
with apples is the fly line so you take

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.380 
with apples is the fly line so you take
your<00:01:54.030> lime<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:55.220> squeeze<00:01:56.220> it<00:01:56.429> in<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:59.390> more

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
your lime and squeeze it in there more

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.090 
your lime and squeeze it in there more
line<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.899> put<00:02:01.080> in<00:02:01.200> there<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> better<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
line you can put in there the better and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.649 
line you can put in there the better and
it's<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.580> help<00:02:02.840> with<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:05.360> not<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.539> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it's going to help with the not just the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.090 
it's going to help with the not just the
oxidizing<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.679> going<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.890> add<00:02:08.069> some

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
oxidizing but it's going to add some

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.729 
oxidizing but it's going to add some
nice<00:02:08.700> tangy<00:02:09.179> taste<00:02:09.840> good<00:02:11.209> all<00:02:12.209> right<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
nice tangy taste good all right then the

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.479 
nice tangy taste good all right then the
next<00:02:13.890> step<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.299> take<00:02:15.540> soy<00:02:16.350> milk<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:17.459> can

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
next step is you take soy milk you can

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.729 
next step is you take soy milk you can
use<00:02:17.640> plain<00:02:18.090> milk<00:02:18.360> too<00:02:18.600> if<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.930> enjoy

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
use plain milk too if you enjoy

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.259 
use plain milk too if you enjoy
consuming<00:02:20.340> animal<00:02:20.670> secretions<00:02:21.769> otherwise<00:02:23.269> um

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
consuming animal secretions otherwise um

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.570 
consuming animal secretions otherwise um
just<00:02:25.140> add<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> little<00:02:25.470> bit<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.799> soy<00:02:26.069> milk<00:02:26.130> or

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
just add a little bit of soy milk or

in fact if you make avocado ice cream
you<00:03:13.420> don't<00:03:13.570> even<00:03:13.660> need<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.020> add<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:15.130> lot<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.790> milk
