while people are around I just wanted to
live<00:00:40.800> commentary<00:00:41.250> then<00:00:41.460> constantly<00:00:41.879> be

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.709 
and then was just like okay leave but no
big<00:00:46.350> deal<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.129> think<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.579> our<00:00:47.730> second

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
big deal so I think this is our second

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.240 
big deal so I think this is our second
medium<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> row<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> think

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
medium in a row and actually I think

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.639 
medium in a row and actually I think
might<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.670> our<00:00:50.760> six<00:00:51.030> medium<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.600> total<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.500> this

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
might be our six medium in total of this

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.889 
might be our six medium in total of this
series<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.039> far<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.489> our<00:00:54.210> six<00:00:54.420> medium<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
