which is wireless charging and I think

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.340 
which is wireless charging and I think
some<00:00:52.250> HP<00:00:53.250> devices<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> now<00:00:54.930> no<00:00:55.110> care

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
some HP devices in the now no care

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.709 
some HP devices in the now no care
devices<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> pack<00:00:56.219> actually<00:00:57.210> use<00:00:57.480> this

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
devices in the pack actually use this

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.340 
devices in the pack actually use this
but<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.649> new<00:00:58.800> kind<00:00:59.329> its<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.539> Nokia<00:01:01.050> DT

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
me just show you the device up close

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.149 
me just show you the device up close
first<00:01:18.450> off<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.930> already<00:01:19.170> showed<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.799> already

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
first off I already showed you already

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.109 
first off I already showed you already
it's<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.820> giant<00:01:21.090> AC<00:01:21.420> adapter<00:01:22.140> plate<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.119> big

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it's a giant AC adapter plate and big

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.120 
it's a giant AC adapter plate and big
and<00:01:24.420> some<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> other<00:01:25.229> two<00:01:25.560> charges<00:01:25.799> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and some of the other two charges you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.440 
and some of the other two charges you
find<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.580> market<00:01:26.729> might<00:01:27.060> actually<00:01:27.180> use<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
find on the market might actually use a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.140 
find on the market might actually use a
regular<00:01:27.900> USB<00:01:28.080> adapter<00:01:28.950> however<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.909> one

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
regular USB adapter however this one

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.240 
regular USB adapter however this one
since<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> outputs<00:01:30.960> 12<00:01:31.229> volts<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.619> power

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
since the outputs 12 volts of power

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.539 
since the outputs 12 volts of power
I<00:01:32.810> don't<00:01:33.810> think<00:01:33.840> nokia<00:01:34.439> wants<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.070> confuse

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
I don't think nokia wants you to confuse

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.010 
I don't think nokia wants you to confuse
the<00:01:35.729> plug<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.360> actually<00:01:36.630> give<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> this

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the plug so they actually give you this

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.999 
the plug so they actually give you this
special<00:01:37.170> AC<00:01:37.590> cable<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.790> very<00:01:39.119> long<00:01:40.009> right

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
special AC cable it's very long right

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.069 
special AC cable it's very long right
here<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:44.210> think<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> meter<00:01:45.869> or

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
here I think it's like a meter or

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.550 
here I think it's like a meter or
something<00:01:46.320> long<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:48.720> other<00:01:48.899> ends<00:01:49.290> just

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
something long and the other ends just

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.270 
something long and the other ends just
the<00:01:49.649> same<00:01:49.890> kind<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.369> plug<00:01:51.560> what<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.130> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the same kind of plug what you do is you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.830 
the same kind of plug what you do is you
have<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.549> plug<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> AC<00:01:53.970> adapter<00:01:54.570> into<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
have to plug the AC adapter into the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.980 
have to plug the AC adapter into the
wall<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.590> cable<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:59.479> now<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> other

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
wall and this cable in now the other

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.600 
wall and this cable in now the other
side<00:02:01.350> I'll<00:02:01.590> actually<00:02:01.740> go<00:02:01.979> into<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> charging

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
side I'll actually go into the charging

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.290 
side I'll actually go into the charging
plate<00:02:02.880> right<00:02:03.030> here

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
plate right here

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.749 
plate right here
see<00:02:05.300> is<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:07.130> do<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:08.170> then<00:02:09.759> the

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
see is that you do that and then the

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.600 
see is that you do that and then the
setups<00:02:11.150> pretty<00:02:11.390> much<00:02:11.570> done<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.860> now<00:02:13.070> since<00:02:13.430> I

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
setups pretty much done so now since I

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.230 
setups pretty much done so now since I
don't<00:02:13.670> use<00:02:14.150> an<00:02:14.560> Nokia<00:02:15.560> Lumia<00:02:15.680> phone<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:17.030> new

actually uh the new LG Nexus 5 right
here<00:02:22.160> actually<00:02:22.400> does<00:02:22.700> work<00:02:22.910> with<00:02:23.120> Qi<00:02:23.300> charging

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
here actually does work with Qi charging

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.360 
here actually does work with Qi charging
-<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:25.700> let<00:02:25.850> me<00:02:25.940> just<00:02:26.120> unlock<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.570> off<00:02:26.900> camera

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.180 

and<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:32.480> can<00:02:32.510> see<00:02:32.990> it<00:02:33.170> is<00:02:33.350> currently<00:02:33.620> not
