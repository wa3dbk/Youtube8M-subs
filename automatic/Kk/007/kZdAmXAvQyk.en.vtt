this<00:03:34.580> it's<00:03:35.580> actually<00:03:35.940> sounds<00:03:36.209> better<00:03:36.360> but<00:03:36.569> if

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
this it's actually sounds better but if

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:44.740 
this it's actually sounds better but if
you<00:03:37.049> can't<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.409> can<00:03:37.440> do

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:53.310 

and<00:03:45.290> then<00:03:45.410> ending<00:03:45.740> the<00:03:45.890> scene

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.170 

so<00:03:54.320> if<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.530> noticed<00:03:54.860> pretty<00:03:55.370> much<00:03:55.640> every

some<00:04:00.970> escapes<00:04:01.360> are<00:04:01.569> very<00:04:01.840> important<00:04:02.230> not<00:04:02.410> the

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
some escapes are very important not the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.280 
some escapes are very important not the
scale<00:04:03.040> of<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.310> song<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.780> then<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.050> can<00:04:05.200> do

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290

interlude of the song is a really

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:25.600 
interlude of the song is a really
