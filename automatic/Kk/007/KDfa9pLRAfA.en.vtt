00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.680
 How friends are I, doctor Osvaldo? 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.500
 navy president of the doxa university 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.280
 International in the Miami area 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.850
 florida usa 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.039
 My interest in making this video is from 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.610
 share about the validation of 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.680
 titles of Hispanic professionals 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.180
 foreigners arriving in the USA one of 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.160
 the great problems of the 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.320
 professionals is that when you reach the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.469
 United States think that maybe they can 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.469
 work with your profession and 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.379
 Unfortunately it is not needed 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:43.579
 a revalidation you need a 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.820
 homologation of studies and agencies 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:51.469
 who carry out this function of taking 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.530
 the diplomas review them and see what level 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.969
 the only thing that is 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.920
 they give is a bachelor for the studies 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.010
 professionals unless they come 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.380
 with a PhD all professions 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.950
 minors to the doctorate 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.780
 they only receive a bachelot level that 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.760
 is the title four years later 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.460
 the high school junior here in 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.680
 USA that ends with a high school or 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.240
 high school four years later 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.009
 he gets that pothole what does not allow him 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.590
 immediately access a career 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:34.649
 professional because in this country 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.439
 Professionalism is achieved with a 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.810
 master's degree or a PhD do not assume that 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.270
 comes someone with a degree in 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.359
 Advocacy in psychology in studies 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.390
 social and business administration what 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.880
 only one that receives that bachelor's degree 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.780
 and obviously it did not reach its 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.530
 professionalism at the doxa university 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.590
 offers a master's degree in two years and 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.960
 Many people who have been interested in 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.970
 two years to complete a master's degree in 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.509
 psychology 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:17.340
 doxa you can find us on the internet 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.340
 like docs to dot edu from x to dot 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.180
 the idea is that if you are interested 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.940
 in revalidating your title maybe up 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.240
 change of professional field can 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.640
 consider us to study a year and 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.180
 half two years pass very soon and you 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.310
 can achieve its validation because we are going 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.820
 to take all the previous studies 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.670
 so that in a very short time I can 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.560
 graduate therefore docs international 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.710
