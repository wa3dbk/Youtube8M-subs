technique to help improve thoracic
rotation<00:00:15.120> with<00:00:16.049> my<00:00:16.320> new<00:00:16.650> track<00:00:16.980> bar<00:00:17.220> thoracic

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
rotation with my new track bar thoracic

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.519 
rotation with my new track bar thoracic
rotation<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.539> one<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.720> those<00:00:18.840> things<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.380> guys

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
rotation is one of those things you guys

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.200 
rotation is one of those things you guys
hear<00:00:19.859> me<00:00:20.010> talking<00:00:20.340> about<00:00:20.400> all<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> time<00:00:21.029> I'm

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
hear me talking about all the time I'm

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.609 
hear me talking about all the time I'm
always<00:00:21.390> discussing<00:00:21.930> about<00:00:22.050> how<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.320> need<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
always discussing about how you need to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.560 
always discussing about how you need to
rotate<00:00:22.890> your<00:00:23.160> t<00:00:23.369> spine<00:00:23.670> well<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
rotate your t spine well this is the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.029 
rotate your t spine well this is the
main<00:00:24.750> reason<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.230> think<00:00:25.560> thoracic

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
main reason that I think thoracic

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.890 
main reason that I think thoracic
rotation<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.970> important<00:00:27.510> when<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.720> comes

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
rotation is so important when it comes

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.689 
rotation is so important when it comes
to<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.140> biomechanics<00:00:28.949> if<00:00:29.130> there's<00:00:29.550> one

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
to your biomechanics if there's one

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.890 
to your biomechanics if there's one
thing<00:00:29.820> I've<00:00:29.970> noticed<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.330> too<00:00:30.449> common<00:00:30.720> out

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
thing I've noticed it's too common out

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.959 
thing I've noticed it's too common out
of<00:00:30.990> people<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.380> there<00:00:31.590> are<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:32.189> kinds<00:00:32.910> of

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
of people is that there are all kinds of

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.610 
of people is that there are all kinds of
rotations<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.510> do<00:00:33.719> happen<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> body<00:00:34.410> but

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
rotations that do happen on the body but

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.319 
rotations that do happen on the body but
there<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.250> never<00:00:35.399> seems<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> happen<00:00:36.090> here

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
there but it never seems to happen here

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.670 
there but it never seems to happen here
to<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> degree<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.020> thought<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.320> wanted<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
to the degree that I thought I wanted to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.470 
to the degree that I thought I wanted to
if<00:00:38.010> there<00:00:38.370> isn't<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> kind<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.910> movement<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
if there isn't a kind of movement in the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.940 
if there isn't a kind of movement in the
ribcage<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> t<00:00:40.230> spine<00:00:40.500> region<00:00:40.710> is

ribcage and the t spine region is

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.889 
ribcage and the t spine region is
usually<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.520> something<00:00:41.730> laughs<00:00:42.030> but

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
usually going to do something laughs but

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.360 
usually going to do something laughs but
if<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.260> look<00:00:43.469> at<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> rest<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> joints<00:00:44.309> on

if I look at the rest of the joints on
my<00:00:44.460> body<00:00:44.700> typically<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> will<00:00:45.780> find<00:00:46.100> for

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
most others that I've encountered is

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.639 
most others that I've encountered is
either<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> they're<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.140> some

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
either that they're going to have some

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.529 
either that they're going to have some
kind<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.860> an<00:00:49.980> external<00:00:50.340> rotation<00:00:50.539> happening

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
kind of an external rotation happening

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.150

neutral and external rotation through
the<00:00:54.960> tibias<00:00:55.350> all<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:56.129> I'll<00:00:56.219> notice<00:00:56.460> an

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the tibias all or I'll notice an

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
the tibias all or I'll notice an
internal<00:00:57.000> rotation<00:00:57.090> through<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.870> femurs<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
internal rotation through the femurs and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
internal rotation through the femurs and
an<00:00:58.980> external<00:00:59.340> rotation<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> tibia<00:01:00.239> I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
an external rotation to the tibia I

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.060 
an external rotation to the tibia I
can't<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:00.989> too<00:01:01.199> much<00:01:01.379> my<00:01:01.770> body

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
can't really do it too much my body

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
can't really do it too much my body
doesn't<00:01:02.370> allow<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.449> point<00:01:03.750> being

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
doesn't allow for that but point being

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.719 
doesn't allow for that but point being
I'll<00:01:04.229> find<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.589> lot<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.830> rotation<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.549> tends

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
I'll find a lot of rotation that tends

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.399 
I'll find a lot of rotation that tends
to<00:01:05.790> happen<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> lower<00:01:06.570> half<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> body

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
to happen in the lower half of the body

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.899 
to happen in the lower half of the body
there<00:01:07.710> usually<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.189> some<00:01:08.369> kind<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.580> rotation

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
there usually is some kind of rotation

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.940 
there usually is some kind of rotation
that<00:01:09.060> happens<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> body<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.380> shoulder

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that happens in the body in the shoulder

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.200 
that happens in the body in the shoulder
or<00:01:11.070> some<00:01:11.250> rotation<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.760> happens<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
or some rotation that happens in the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
or some rotation that happens in the
cervical<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.020> these<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> main<00:01:13.500> areas

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
cervical but these are the main areas

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.440 
cervical but these are the main areas
that<00:01:13.830> I'm<00:01:14.010> concerned<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.460> well<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> main

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
that I'm concerned with well the main

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.999 
that I'm concerned with well the main
point<00:01:15.479> being<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.500> end<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.740> having

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
point being is that if you end up having

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.950 
point being is that if you end up having
some<00:01:17.159> kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.490> lack<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> rotation<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:18.720> T

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
some kind of lack of rotation in your T

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.870 
some kind of lack of rotation in your T
spine<00:01:19.229> through<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> neutral<00:01:19.950> spine<00:01:20.250> well

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
spine through a neutral spine well

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.670 
spine through a neutral spine well
you're<00:01:21.030> gonna<00:01:21.119> then<00:01:21.360> find<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.290> because

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you're gonna then find is that because

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.080 
you're gonna then find is that because
you<00:01:22.770> don't<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.189> rotation<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:23.880> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you don't get the rotation here you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.390 
you don't get the rotation here you
excessively<00:01:24.659> rotate<00:01:25.170> down<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.310> you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
excessively rotate down here and if you

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.010

inward an hour if there's no rotation up
here<00:01:38.909> then<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.450> body's<00:01:39.750> gonna<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
here then the body's gonna have to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.960 
here then the body's gonna have to
compensate<00:01:40.500> with<00:01:40.799> some<00:01:40.950> kind<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> rotation

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
compensate with some kind of rotation

with<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.090> lower<00:01:42.299> body<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.110> guys<00:01:43.200> ever

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
with the lower body if you guys ever

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.899 
with the lower body if you guys ever
looking<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.799> bipedal<00:01:44.220> robots<00:01:44.729> when

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
looking like bipedal robots when

looking like bipedal robots when
engineers<00:01:45.450> put<00:01:45.689> them<00:01:45.840> together<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.290> will

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
engineers put them together you will

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.569 
engineers put them together you will
notice<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:46.950> they're<00:01:47.100> walking

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
notice that as they're walking

notice that as they're walking
the<00:01:48.000> upper<00:01:48.299> body<00:01:48.479> will<00:01:48.720> rotate<00:01:48.930> almost

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the upper body will rotate almost

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.200 
the upper body will rotate almost
perfectly<00:01:50.159> while<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> legs<00:01:50.759> remain<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.119> the

I<00:01:53.159> think<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:53.490> are<00:01:53.640> biomechanics<00:01:54.390> should<00:01:54.810> be

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
I think we are biomechanics should be

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.810 
I think we are biomechanics should be
inclined<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.649> more<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.520> than<00:01:56.700> what

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
inclined to do that more so than what

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.219 
inclined to do that more so than what

have myself I'm not the biggest fan of
pull-ups<00:02:30.980> but<00:02:31.550> I've<00:02:31.700> become<00:02:31.850> almost<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.300> little

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
pull-ups but I've become almost a little

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.000 
pull-ups but I've become almost a little
bit<00:02:32.630> more<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.990> fan<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.230> full<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.590> because<00:02:33.890> of

bit more of a fan of full of because of

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.710 
bit more of a fan of full of because of
this<00:02:34.100> tool<00:02:34.340> here<00:02:34.550> because<00:02:34.880> it<00:02:35.240> enables<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.690> to

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
this tool here because it enables you to

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.900

thing that I think is really cool when I

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.750 
thing that I think is really cool when I
teach<00:03:58.360> fighters<00:03:58.840> as<00:03:59.620> we're<00:03:59.860> going<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.040> throw<00:04:00.730> a

punch or something along those lines one
thing<00:04:03.069> I<00:04:03.190> always<00:04:03.520> teach<00:04:03.850> them<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.180> do<00:04:04.300> is<00:04:04.510> to

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
thing I always teach them to do is to

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.330 
thing I always teach them to do is to
extend<00:04:05.260> out<00:04:05.440> one<00:04:05.650> arm<00:04:05.860> as<00:04:05.980> they're<00:04:06.100> pulling

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
and you rotate your trunk try keeping

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.780 
and you rotate your trunk try keeping

your pelvis as stable as possible then

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.680 
your pelvis as stable as possible then
you<00:04:45.820> just<00:04:46.120> go<00:04:46.800> back<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.100> forth<00:04:48.510> through<00:04:49.510> here

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
you just go back and forth through here

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.750 
you just go back and forth through here
and<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.350> doesn't<00:04:50.620> seem<00:04:50.890> like<00:04:51.160> much<00:04:51.370> as<00:04:51.610> you
