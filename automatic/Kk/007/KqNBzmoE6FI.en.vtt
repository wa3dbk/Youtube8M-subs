00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
building which kind of strikes me to

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.969 
building which kind of strikes me to
think<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.780> why<00:01:12.990> would<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.380> spend<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.890> much

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
think that why would they spend so much

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.740 
think that why would they spend so much
time<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.460> make<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.240> much<00:01:15.330> time<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
time at make like so much time and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.870 
time at make like so much time and
effort<00:01:15.869> making<00:01:16.259> both<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.280> building<00:01:17.729> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
effort making both this building and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.789 
effort making both this building and
obviously<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> casino<00:01:18.930> building<00:01:19.259> there<00:01:19.740> was

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
obviously the casino building there was

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.730 
obviously the casino building there was
never<00:01:20.070> planning<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.729> putting<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.500> game

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
never planning on putting it in the game

let's talk up your friends and again I
strike<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.930> same<00:03:28.110> question<00:03:28.350> again<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.829> just

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
strike a same question again it's just

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.280 
strike a same question again it's just
why<00:03:29.250> would<00:03:29.459> they<00:03:29.549> have<00:03:29.760> all<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.090> stuff<00:03:30.239> if<00:03:30.870> it

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
why would they have all this stuff if it

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.470 
why would they have all this stuff if it
wasn't<00:03:31.680> ever<00:03:31.860> going<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.250> be<00:03:32.610> in<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.030> game<00:03:33.239> I

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
wasn't ever going to be in the game I

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.240 
wasn't ever going to be in the game I
mean<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.200> guess<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.590> simple<00:03:34.829> question<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.130> just

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
mean I guess the simple question is just

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.009 
mean I guess the simple question is just
yeah<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.459> purely<00:03:35.760> for<00:03:36.030> aesthetic<00:03:36.120> basis<00:03:36.810> maybe

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
yeah a purely for aesthetic basis maybe

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.530 
yeah a purely for aesthetic basis maybe
that<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.440> case<00:03:37.650> they<00:03:38.489> just<00:03:38.700> seem<00:03:38.850> strange

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
that is the case they just seem strange

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.210 
that is the case they just seem strange
it's<00:03:40.170> me<00:03:40.260> I've<00:03:40.350> always<00:03:40.530> thought<00:03:40.890> about<00:03:40.950> it

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
it's me I've always thought about it

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.890 
it's me I've always thought about it
ever<00:03:41.340> since<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.700> first<00:03:41.850> saw<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.239> in<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.480> game<00:03:42.660> I

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
ever since I first saw it in the game I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.050 
ever since I first saw it in the game I
think<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.860> liked<00:03:44.070> row<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> think<00:03:44.579> I<00:03:44.730> was<00:03:44.820> driving

all<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.860> maybe<00:04:07.980> late<00:04:08.130> that's<00:04:08.459> what<00:04:08.549> they<00:04:08.610> went

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
all and maybe late that's what they went

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.430 
all and maybe late that's what they went
for<00:04:08.970> maybe<00:04:09.120> there<00:04:09.299> wasn't<00:04:09.450> any<00:04:09.660> gambling<00:04:09.900> ever

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
for maybe there wasn't any gambling ever

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.470 
for maybe there wasn't any gambling ever
intended<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:10.859> be<00:04:11.070> in<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.370> game<00:04:11.609> but<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.359> me

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
intended to be in the game but to me

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.479 
intended to be in the game but to me
this<00:04:12.600> sort<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:12.840> seems<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:13.019> bit<00:04:13.109> strange<00:04:13.489> that

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
this sort of seems a bit strange that

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.250 
this sort of seems a bit strange that
for<00:04:14.880> this<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.150> not<00:04:15.329> ever<00:04:15.480> be<00:04:15.690> opened<00:04:16.140> in

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
for this to not ever be opened in

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.330 
for this to not ever be opened in
somewhat<00:04:16.530> ELC<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:16.919> think<00:04:17.130> that'd<00:04:17.220> be<00:04:17.280> really

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
somewhat ELC I think that'd be really

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.569 
somewhat ELC I think that'd be really
cool<00:04:17.729> DLC<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.239> had<00:04:18.419> gambling<00:04:18.840> DLC<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:20.370> what

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
cool DLC I had gambling DLC and what

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.890 
cool DLC I had gambling DLC and what
they<00:04:20.669> do<00:04:20.729> is<00:04:20.850> gonna<00:04:20.910> open<00:04:21.120> up<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.450> building

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
they do is gonna open up this building

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.830 
they do is gonna open up this building
and<00:04:22.049> open<00:04:22.680> up<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.789> horse<00:04:24.060> track<00:04:24.360> vote<00:04:24.810> for

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
and open up the horse track vote for

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.150 
and open up the horse track vote for
gambling<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.440> that's<00:04:25.590> obviously<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:25.860> do<00:04:26.010> that

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
gambling and that's obviously I do that

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.920 
gambling and that's obviously I do that
online<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.580> start

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
online and start

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.960 
online and start
and<00:04:27.020> then<00:04:27.620> here<00:04:28.250> you'll<00:04:28.520> see<00:04:28.729> there's

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
and then here you'll see there's

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.400 
and then here you'll see there's
actually<00:04:29.030> like<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.330> carpark<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:30.020> an<00:04:30.080> actual<00:04:30.169> go

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
actually like a carpark of an actual go

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.680 
actually like a carpark of an actual go
here<00:04:30.560> I<00:04:30.590> cannot<00:04:30.800> list<00:04:30.979> down<00:04:31.070> really<00:04:31.310> quickly

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
here I cannot list down really quickly

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.719 
here I cannot list down really quickly
the<00:04:32.690> columns<00:04:32.960> not<00:04:33.110> down<00:04:33.229> this<00:04:33.350> fence<00:04:33.610> but<00:04:34.610> as

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
the columns not down this fence but as

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.340 
the columns not down this fence but as
you<00:04:34.970> like<00:04:35.060> it<00:04:35.210> I<00:04:35.270> guess<00:04:35.389> I<00:04:35.479> said<00:04:35.570> car<00:04:35.780> yes<00:04:36.169> it's

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
you like it I guess I said car yes it's

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.200 
you like it I guess I said car yes it's
parts<00:04:36.560> like<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.710> car<00:04:36.979> park<00:04:37.280> I<00:04:37.550> think<00:04:37.910> if<00:04:38.150> you

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
parts like a car park I think if you

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.310 
parts like a car park I think if you
drive<00:04:38.419> around<00:04:38.539> Haven<00:04:38.780> further<00:04:39.139> we<00:04:39.199> can

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
drive around Haven further we can

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.300 
drive around Haven further we can
actually<00:04:39.470> explore<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:39.979> rest<00:04:40.100> of<00:04:40.220> the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
actually explore the rest of the

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.219 
actually explore the rest of the
building<00:04:40.699> I<00:04:40.850> think<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:41.360> can<00:04:41.539> yeah<00:04:41.750> so<00:04:42.139> you

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
building I think you can yeah so you

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.360 
building I think you can yeah so you
drive<00:04:42.380> around<00:04:42.500> here<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:42.800> you'll<00:04:42.919> see<00:04:42.949> again

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
drive around here and you'll see again

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.400 
drive around here and you'll see again
like<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.210> guess<00:04:44.360> he's<00:04:44.509> like<00:04:44.690> all<00:04:44.810> these<00:04:44.960> signs

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
like I guess he's like all these signs

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.020 
like I guess he's like all these signs
on<00:04:45.650> here<00:04:45.800> again<00:04:46.070> I<00:04:46.130> thought<00:04:46.340> like<00:04:46.490> smart<00:04:46.789> card

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
on here again I thought like smart card

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.129 
on here again I thought like smart card
science<00:04:47.449> ATM<00:04:47.960> signs<00:04:49.630> like<00:04:50.630> an<00:04:50.720> advertising

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
science ATM signs like an advertising

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.170 
science ATM signs like an advertising
board<00:04:51.440> here<00:04:51.680> it<00:04:52.220> just<00:04:52.370> seems<00:04:52.580> strange<00:04:52.699> I<00:04:53.090> have

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
board here it just seems strange I have

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.159 
board here it just seems strange I have
all<00:04:53.240> this<00:04:53.300> stuff<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.690> you'll<00:04:53.780> see<00:04:53.930> I'm<00:04:54.050> gonna

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
all this stuff and you'll see I'm gonna

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.510 
all this stuff and you'll see I'm gonna
I'm<00:04:54.440> gonna<00:04:54.500> wait<00:04:54.710> till<00:04:54.740> nighttime<00:04:55.070> I'll<00:04:55.370> show

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
I'm gonna wait till nighttime I'll show

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.820 
I'm gonna wait till nighttime I'll show
you<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.669> rest<00:04:55.759> of<00:04:55.940> it<00:04:56.289> so<00:04:57.289> yeah<00:04:57.410> you<00:04:57.530> see<00:04:57.680> how<00:04:57.800> I

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
you the rest of it so yeah you see how I

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.409 
you the rest of it so yeah you see how I
think<00:04:57.919> I<00:04:58.070> get<00:04:58.460> camera<00:04:58.759> away<00:04:58.880> you<00:04:59.090> see<00:04:59.240> some

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
think I get camera away you see some

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:00.850 
think I get camera away you see some
stuff<00:04:59.570> in<00:04:59.720> here<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.110> I<00:05:00.139> guess<00:05:00.320> actually<00:05:00.680> right

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
stuff in here so I guess actually right

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.310 
stuff in here so I guess actually right
now<00:05:01.070> that<00:05:01.280> has<00:05:01.400> nothing<00:05:01.639> that's<00:05:02.630> nothing<00:05:03.139> in

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
now that has nothing that's nothing in

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.909 
now that has nothing that's nothing in
there<00:05:03.729> but<00:05:04.729> I<00:05:04.759> think<00:05:04.789> that's<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.180> car<00:05:05.360> park

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
there but I think that's a car park

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.050 
there but I think that's a car park
it's<00:05:06.919> her<00:05:07.009> strange<00:05:07.370> it's<00:05:07.580> kind<00:05:07.729> of<00:05:07.759> a<00:05:07.849> hard<00:05:07.970> to

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
it's her strange it's kind of a hard to

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.370 
it's her strange it's kind of a hard to
like<00:05:08.180> at<00:05:08.300> work<00:05:08.419> seen<00:05:08.660> it<00:05:08.750> actually<00:05:09.020> is<00:05:09.139> unless

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
like at work seen it actually is unless

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.480 
like at work seen it actually is unless

basement that I said what do you think
cuz<00:05:16.460> I<00:05:16.490> I<00:05:16.580> just<00:05:16.910> my<00:05:17.720> main<00:05:17.900> question<00:05:18.259> is<00:05:18.349> purely

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
cuz I I just my main question is purely

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.779 
cuz I I just my main question is purely
why<00:05:18.889> would<00:05:19.039> I<00:05:19.099> put<00:05:19.250> it<00:05:19.310> in<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.460> game<00:05:19.580> in<00:05:19.699> the

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
why would I put it in the game in the

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.490 
why would I put it in the game in the
first<00:05:19.970> place<00:05:20.240> maybe<00:05:20.870> it's<00:05:21.080> just<00:05:21.169> me<00:05:21.349> being

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
first place maybe it's just me being

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.499 
first place maybe it's just me being
enlightened<00:05:21.860> as<00:05:22.130> a<00:05:22.160> bit<00:05:22.310> to<00:05:22.520> overanalyzing

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
enlightened as a bit to overanalyzing

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.300 
enlightened as a bit to overanalyzing
something<00:05:24.050> that<00:05:24.139> why<00:05:24.259> is<00:05:24.320> it<00:05:24.410> in<00:05:24.590> here<00:05:24.830> I<00:05:24.949> think

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
something that why is it in here I think

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.890 
something that why is it in here I think
