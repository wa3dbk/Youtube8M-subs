Leslie<00:01:57.570> an<00:01:57.689> idea<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.229> also<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> MIDI

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
Leslie an idea they also have the MIDI

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.880 
Leslie an idea they also have the MIDI
which<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.329> little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.930> less<00:02:01.170> pointy<00:02:01.619> and
