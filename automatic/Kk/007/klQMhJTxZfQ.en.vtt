00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.240
 in the world 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.200
 we are also seeing josemari contribution 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.580
 that this year we have not seen 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.860
 competing here so we're going to 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.300
 ask you are you preparing for 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.500
 something special some kind of competition 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.910
 are you ready for life 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.760
 modern 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.490
 good in principle we are preparing 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.289
 here there are about five weeks in front of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.480
 Spain is that it selects for our 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.400
 universe of hamburg with all the illusion 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.010
 to participate again in that minister 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.750
 so prestigious and good universe the idea 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.879
 is this to see if it is in condition and 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.400
 will evaluate well enough to 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.739
 be able to attend again very well how have you 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.320
 seen prepared here to the guys 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.820
 because I've seen looking a lot like no 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.430
 is the prepared track provided a level 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.839
 excellent obviously this this 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.600
 championship is becoming a 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.840
 novice reference and almost the same 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.489
 level that there is in the USA in the same tree 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.219
 Well and let's say athletes 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.840
 of the best of all no one is and I 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.089
 looking just looking at them because he has not 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.690
 could compete here but good the idea 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.670
 the idea is to continue in the gap 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.160
 competing where I can and getting old 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.320
 with dignity that is my motto I have to 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.120
 say that your legs have 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.180
 to many legs out there good too 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.850
 the truth that it is difficult to compare if we 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.650
 they have up and you're not in front of the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.080
 judges and this talk to talk 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.700
 I the championships that won are the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.619
 that I have won and those that I have been 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.420
 can not say that I look better than 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.700
 nobody because it's not true either 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.130
 good level is huge the illusion always 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.979
 is there sometimes win is not also the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.220
 success but being able to be with a level like 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.619
 this is already a success for many 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.570
 it could be good to me not because I 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.509
 that moment I'm not going to be active with 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.280
 the doctor but he could give them some 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.229
 secret or some 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.960
 some motivation those who are 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.170
 starting and they want to put it that way 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.549
 strong like you and continue like you good 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.440
 I would only say to people who 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.750
 we have it saying constantly in the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.860
 Program 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.800
 is that really patience 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.680
 the ability to sacrifice the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.700
 perpetuate yourself doing something that you like 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.410
 do for yourself what for others 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.320
 live it as something that enriches you 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.270
 that's the way to get to be many 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.840
 years practicing this sport and even 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.680
 like me competing a lifestyle 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.390
 logically it's a lifestyle that's 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.280
 undoubtedly the diet touches you much more than 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.950
 no sport but above all 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.930
 things 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.140
 is what this sport demands is a great 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.209
 mental strength 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.480
 and that is not the heritage of many and 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.580
 you also have to work it sometimes see 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.480
 that others are capable of doing things that 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.860
 we think that we would never do 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.080
 They make us try to do them and 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.310
 let's get them to do it as well 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.250
 thank you very much your little 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.640
 good interview as I always say for 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.640
 samples 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.630
 my mother 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.110
 thank you very much 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.430
 you see here not for competitions 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.930
 until the last day pointing and 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.970
 continuing with this that here we see that 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.459
 they just did some gymnastics I 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.280
 I do not even know and here we have the 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.019
 stand stronger than ever 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.970
 They are giving a gift for everyone 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.370
 those who have come to the fair 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.799

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.959

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.060

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.650
 which is coming and I'm good because it only remains 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.549
 say goodbye and keep watching bodies 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.549
