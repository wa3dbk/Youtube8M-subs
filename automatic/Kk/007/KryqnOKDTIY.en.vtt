00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.289
 every year more come here 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.859
 ministry of youth to salzburg this year 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.270
 there are 6000 so far are the program 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.699
 sounds pretty bland 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.670
 starting from the common prayer times 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.130
 about inputs to topics of faith up to 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.710
 workshops and joint worship services 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.930
 but it is really so boring here 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.260
 let's listen to what youths do 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.399
 say that's amazing and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.160
 as enthusiastic and refreshing as you 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.280
 experienced that so many young people 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:53.110
 jesus christ bavaria so that he in 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.330
 lives with us and so many people 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.460
 actually, when I feel sorry for all this 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.370
 that you really have the holy spirit 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.140
 Every radiation received every tautz 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.440
 and there is probably none 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.440
 fought 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.390
 quarrels and everything is positive and 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.970
 yes, that's incredible power 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.740
 It also draws a lot of strength throughout the year 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.570
 you do not forget your whole life 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.100
 Say what's good just that one 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.850
 just notice that you are not alone 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.800
 So always in the church 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.300
 sitting alone among seniors and when 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.950
 you 're around here with 5000 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.930
 teens together knew against it 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.899
 been really great 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.820
 So I find folk wine what I that it 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.729

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.770

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.030

 you have just been totally fulfilled 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.970
 What do we say when we have so many teenagers 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.099
 Here you are easy to notice 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.920
 Congress here really the presence for 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.509
 sacred spirit actually what you are 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.990
 all joy was being exhibited 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.360
 Everyone, I'm in a good mood because so many 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.259
 friendly words that simply holy 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.259
 ghost in the middle of us 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.799
 even when you are at, for example 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.599
 the worship of the evening of 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.569
 compassion 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.760
 For example, I was there at the beginning of my life 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.680
 completely averse to it and have me 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.650
 thought what are there for people and hold 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.280
 hands up and after some 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.349
 time that takes a bit slow 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.609
 to stretch your hands up and 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.950
 What you only here ingenious I think the 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:39.069
 community that gives the team 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.730
 also a pulse to the outside then 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.129
 un-report again other adolescents 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.250
 we are taking this year 6000 people 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:03:03.620
 If everyone makes friends the year brings 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:03:06.319
 2010 now more and more in the year 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.120
 getting to know new people you play 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.419
 just the god here and it is 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.419
 wonderful 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.489
 so I whine after him every time 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.069
 because you just feel like the sacred 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.470
 Spirit fulfilled every one and that 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.329
 team so now again at the 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.129
 Pentecostal determined to learn to give the people 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.900
 get to know the community in god and 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.560
 example with Amazon and co right 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.150
 feel that he reigned in the community 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.799
 but it is much supermarket plays 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.879
 really that god is among us that he 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:40.579
 there and it's just the day after all 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.500
 Many people know and have been quite 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.239
 have fun and it's just great 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.190
 event 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.540
 we pray together on the horns and 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.129
 that is really young also come in yes 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.829
 this Catholic community and then 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.949
 so ecumenical so I think it's 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.650
 he is super cool, he is super good 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:03.470
 on it and has a lot of fun with light 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.629
 So, year does not confess so many 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.150
 actually work in such a way 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.889
 because everyone is so connected 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.049
 somehow it's because you 're doing that 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.479
 Community is just so beautiful here 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.439
 how everything is in a super mood and you 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.439
 really great fun 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.029
 So I like the praise the best 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.090
 because I'm right, you get right in 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.699
 mood around 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.020
 properly fulfilled and it makes it easy 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.250
 enjoy singing with it 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.080
 and yes that 's the best I'm this 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.639
 for the second time since I was that 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.560
 Last year, I was the first 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.240
 I liked that so much 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.949
 At first I did not want to become one 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.270
 luck persuaded and now I am again 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.790
 I'm guaranteed next year and next 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.720
