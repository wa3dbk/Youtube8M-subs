at<00:01:33.710> designing<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.340> lunar<00:01:34.969> speed<00:01:35.210> 3<00:01:35.479> we<00:01:35.869> really

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
at designing the lunar speed 3 we really

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.889 
at designing the lunar speed 3 we really
wanted<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.469> shoot<00:01:37.040> fast<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.820> sleek<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.390> keep

wanted to shoot fast and sleek and keep

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.929 
wanted to shoot fast and sleek and keep
the<00:01:39.020> lines<00:01:39.290> very<00:01:39.619> flowing<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.340> we<00:01:40.670> think<00:01:40.850> it

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
the lines very flowing and we think it

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
back for a bit more breathability and

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.670 
back for a bit more breathability and
then<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.549> strap<00:02:23.880> actually<00:02:24.569> wraps<00:02:25.170> from<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
again this is part of the design but

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.930 
again this is part of the design but
it's<00:02:30.480> also<00:02:30.690> integrated<00:02:31.680> into<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.340> inner<00:02:32.549> bra
