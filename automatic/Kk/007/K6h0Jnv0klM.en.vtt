GRAY WROTE FOR SEVERAL HOURS

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.500
THIS MORNING.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.130
STEVE: IMAGINE PARKING YOUR CAR

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.340
FOR A FEW HOURS AND FINDING IT

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.910
WILL I ICE -- PUMMELED BY ICE.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.370
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ONE MAN

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.810
IN THE OLD PORT.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.340
HUGE CHUNKS OF ICE LANDED

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.340
DIRECTLY ON HIS CAR.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.910
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.350
KYLE JONES IS IN PORTLAND WITH A

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.290
CLOSER LOOK.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.420
REPORTER: WHEN ADAM

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.990
SOUSA PARKED

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.660
HIS CAR DOWNTOWN ON FRIDAY, HE

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.730
EXPECTED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN TO

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.760
THE CAR, AND BUT NOT THE ICE

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.000
THAT FELL ON IT FROM A BUILDING

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.870
ABOVE.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.800
NOW HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THE

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.470
BUILDING OWNER'S INSURANCE WILL

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.070
COVER THE DAMAGE AND HOW HE WILL

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.890
GET TO WORK IN THE MEANTIME.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.510
HE FOUND A HUGE SURPRISE WHEN HE

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.810
GOT BACK TO HIS CAR SUNDAY

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.790
AFTERNOON.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.590
I THOUGHT MAYBE AN ICICLE

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.550
WOULD FALL OFF, NOT A WHOLE

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.820
CAR-SIZED PIECE OF ICE.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.490
REPORTER: THAT IS WHAT HE SAYS

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.730
BELL OFFICE BUILDING IN THE OLD

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.200
PORT.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.060
IT CAME OUT OF THE

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.730
WINDSHIELD

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.970
AND WAS SITTING ON THE PASSENGER

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.200
SEAT.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.740
THE FRONT FENDER CAVED IN, THE

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.000
WHOLE STEERING COLUMN IS

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.710
SMASHED.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.060
REPORTER: NOW HE IS STUCK.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.980
HIS LIABILITY INSURANCE WILL

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.610
NOT

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.140
COVER REPAIRS, AND HE SAYS THE

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.080
CITY WAS NOT MUCH HELP.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.220
FOR THEY TOLD ME IS THAT THEY

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.580
CANNOT DO MUCH BECAUSE IT IS AN

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.990
ACT OF NATURE.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.090
BUT FROM WHAT I SAW, THE SIZE

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.720
OF

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.990
THOSE ICE CHUNKS, THEY ARE 150

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.060
POUNDS.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.690
REPORTER: THAT COULD BE

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.990
CONSIDERED A THREAT UNDER CITY

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.300
ORDINANCE.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.130
WHEN AN ICE DAM IS NOTICED OR

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.830
PRESENT A HAZARD, THEY ARE

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.300
REQUIRED TO MITIGATE THE HAZARD.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.770
SOMETIMES, THAT PRESENTS

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.110
LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.740
REPORTER: LIKE THE HIGH DEMAND

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.090
FOR ROOF CLEARING THIS SEASON.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.710
A BARRICADE IS PUT IN PLACE, BUT

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.020
WHAT IF THERE IS DAMAGE OR

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.490
INDUSTRY?

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.090
TONY PAY

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.760
NE IS NOT INVOLVED IN

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.990
THE CASE, BUT SAYS THERE MAY BE

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.390
HELP.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.990
WITH LIABILITY COVERAGE, HE

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.960
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET SOME

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.500
DAMAGES TAKING CARE OF.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.170
REPORTER: ADAM HOPES TO WORK

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.400
SOMETHING OUT WITH THE BUILDING

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.070
OWNER.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.240
HE IS GRATEFUL FOR THE HELP HE

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.840
HAS GOTTEN SO FAR AND THAT

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.410
THINGS DID NOT END UP WORSE.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.080
I AM GLAD NO ONE ELSE WAS

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.080
AROUND.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.550
SOMEONE COULD HAVE GOTTEN HURT.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.180
REPORTER: WHEN WE SPOKE TO THE

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.080
FIRE DEPARTMENT, THEY SAID THE

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.390
SPECIFICS OF THE INSURANCE

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.120
POLICY FOR THE BUILDING OWNER

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.190
AND WHATEVER ADAM IS ENTITLED TO

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.660
MIGHT BE MORE OF A LEGAL ISSUE.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.630
THOSE DETAILS ARE NOT YET KNOWN.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.360
THEY DID SAY NOW IS A GOOD TIME

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.900
TO GET ON THE ROOF OF

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.500
RESIDENTIAL AND PRIVATE

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.320
PROPERTIES TO CLEAR ICE AND SNOW
