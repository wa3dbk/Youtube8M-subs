00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.859 
to put a wick hole with a pin through
the<00:00:28.769> silicone<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.580> personally<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.599> like

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the silicone I personally do not like

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.310 
the silicone I personally do not like
putting<00:00:31.619> any<00:00:31.830> holes<00:00:32.189> or<00:00:32.550> cutting<00:00:32.940> the

putting any holes or cutting the
silicone<00:00:34.320> mold<00:00:34.649> whatsoever<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.760> think<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
silicone mold whatsoever I think it

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.520 
silicone mold whatsoever I think it
wears<00:00:37.110> down<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.770> silicone<00:00:38.700> quicker<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
wears down the silicone quicker and it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.869 
wears down the silicone quicker and it
just<00:00:40.770> starts<00:00:41.180> like<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> pre<00:00:43.070> pre<00:00:44.070> tear<00:00:44.460> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
just starts like a pre pre tear and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.959 
just starts like a pre pre tear and
there's<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.570> mold<00:00:45.780> doesn't<00:00:46.230> last<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.739> long<00:00:46.969> so

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
there's the mold doesn't last as long so

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.260 
there's the mold doesn't last as long so
what<00:00:48.329> I'm<00:00:48.719> going<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> show<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.260> how<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.039> whip<00:00:51.000> up

think<00:01:03.899> are<00:01:04.379> fantastic<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:05.820> they're<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
think are fantastic I think they're a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.590 
think are fantastic I think they're a
lot<00:01:06.240> easier<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.840> use<00:01:07.460> they<00:01:08.460> don't<00:01:08.640> require<00:01:09.000> so

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
lot easier to use they don't require so

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.800 
lot easier to use they don't require so
much<00:01:09.799> balancing<00:01:11.030> because<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.570> one

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
much balancing because with this one

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.429 
much balancing because with this one
you'll<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.350> place<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.890> base<00:01:15.140> right<00:01:16.140> side

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you'll have to place the base right side

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.820 
you'll have to place the base right side
up<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:17.250> order<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.030> work<00:01:18.390> properly<00:01:18.450> so

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.090
