00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
now this is great adhesive but still you

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.960 
now this is great adhesive but still you
have<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.920> get<00:02:50.099> you<00:02:50.250> get<00:02:50.400> them<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.730> got<00:02:50.910> to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
have to you get you get them you got to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.280 
have to you get you get them you got to
have<00:02:51.060> pressure<00:02:51.269> applied<00:02:51.569> to<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:51.959> don't<00:02:52.110> you

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
have pressure applied to it don't you

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.860 
have pressure applied to it don't you
yes<00:02:52.500> I've<00:02:52.830> already<00:02:53.010> cut<00:02:53.310> some<00:02:53.550> custom<00:02:54.510> wedges

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870

yes I've already cut some custom wedges
here<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.160> will<00:02:56.540> wash<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.840> there<00:02:58.050> and

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
here and this will wash it in there and

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.890 
here and this will wash it in there and
it's<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.620> good<00:02:59.220> idea<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.790> leave<00:02:59.970> these<00:03:00.209> for<00:03:00.420> 24

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
it's a good idea to leave these for 24

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:12.400 
it's a good idea to leave these for 24
hours<00:03:02.269> give<00:03:03.269> enough<00:03:03.690> time<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.989> set<00:03:04.290> up<00:03:10.880> yeah

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
hours give enough time to set up yeah

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.839 
hours give enough time to set up yeah
that's<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.950> now<00:03:14.099> what<00:03:14.250> about<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.549> front
