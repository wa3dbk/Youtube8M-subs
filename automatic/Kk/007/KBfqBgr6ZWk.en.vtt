00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hello friends today I want 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.270
 tell you about your experience how to make 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.519
 so that hard drives 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.360
 worked as long as possible did not break and 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:17.699
 so forth means for this first of all 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:21.689
 very simple way it is necessary to 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.199
 as you can see now there are windows xp and 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.560
 windows 7 and windows 8 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.460
 there is such a range here, and you just 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.790
 only that it was not red that is 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.930
 do not drive hard drive 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.800
 to the point if I may say so 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.250
 so for that, well, I don't know. 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.750
 to use the program with a c, let's say 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.800
 now I will show you can download it 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.320
 free from the internet on a cycle not free 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.149
 that is, free and accordingly 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.180
 can you here 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.760
 brushing to remove excess means 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.920
 hard drive information then I 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
 I recommend just some old ones 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.100
 movies or 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.010
 unnecessary programs or some unnecessary 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.110
 games delete well constantly monitor 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.549
 hard disk by the way tell the story 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.450
 my first hard drive was at 100 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:23.250
 megabyte and i'm not a hundred gigabyte infusion 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:28.259
 megabyte I cleaned it that you are there every 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.210
 just a day signs lapid to be and here 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.970
 such solicitude hard drive me 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.790
 It means as if such a respect 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.210
 I treat this attitude to all 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.060
 female disc and when I like a little 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.490
 forgot to clean the hard drive 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.710
 I broke down on a laptop but take it away 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.860
 broke down but he generally constantly washed down 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.950
 under the red well, that is, he has a few 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.810
 disks and all these scales 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.960
 the red is the hard disk and 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.680
 the reception is very much beaten here 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.689
 just one disc flew 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.539
 then what do i recommend doing it 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:15.049
 defragmentation can 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.049
 drive defragmentation into search click start 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.969
 defragmentation 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.040
 so I click here such is called 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:26.129
 drive optimization windows 8 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.470
 if you are -8 there is no start button you can click 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.069
 search and trial also drive a word 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.900
 then defragment and thus the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:39.510
 push analysis and optimize that 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.389
 defragment it if allowed 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.780
 your let's film can be recorded 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:48.720
 not evenly on the hard disk 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.090
 let's say that's green because here 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.280
 recorded here and heads account 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.209
 run first there and then here and 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.980
 agree to her less strain when 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.400
 she runs in one place like this here 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.919
 as it is shown after defragmentation 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:09.120
 when all that's the sector that's it 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:09.919
 are near and heads do not have to 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.439
 run 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:17.909
 let's say here and there again and 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:21.030
 to come back means that's all 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:24.060
 clean up his hard drive and never 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.560
 scored don't score it to the eyeballs 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.129
 unfortunately it concerns exactly 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.989
 naturally hard drives psd 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:34.260
 I will not say let us flash drives 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.060
 this was not, that is, they though clogged 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.340
 work ok they somehow don't care 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.099
 just cue drive for some reason he doesn't 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.590
 endures like this 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.900
 load when its straight to full 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.329
 are loading 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.840
 I hope this video is useful to you 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.840
 good bye
