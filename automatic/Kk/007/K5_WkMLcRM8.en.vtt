ceiling
and<00:02:08.659> then<00:02:09.140> they'll<00:02:09.289> bounce<00:02:09.530> back<00:02:09.950> or<00:02:10.310> see<00:02:10.939> that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
and then they'll bounce back or see that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.319 
and then they'll bounce back or see that
pull<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.420> way<00:02:11.840> back<00:02:12.079> there<00:02:13.120> sometimes<00:02:14.120> throw

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
pull the way back there sometimes throw

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.720 
pull the way back there sometimes throw
it<00:02:14.420> at<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.719> and<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.620> zombies<00:02:15.769> will<00:02:15.950> die<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
it at that and the zombies will die and

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.270 
it at that and the zombies will die and
if<00:02:17.569> they<00:02:18.019> get<00:02:18.200> closer<00:02:18.439> and<00:02:18.560> closer<00:02:18.829> and<00:02:19.010> you

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
if they get closer and closer and you

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.190 
if they get closer and closer and you
kill<00:02:19.489> people<00:02:19.760> at<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.389> back<00:02:20.599> all<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.019> zombies

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
kill people at the back all the zombies

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.470 
kill people at the back all the zombies
will<00:02:21.560> back<00:02:21.799> up<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:22.670> don't<00:02:22.909> worry<00:02:23.030> don't<00:02:23.269> get

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
will back up so don't worry don't get

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.569 
will back up so don't worry don't get
scared<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:23.959> run<00:02:24.019> out<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.319> your<00:02:24.439> position<00:02:24.709> um

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
scared and run out of your position um

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.280 
scared and run out of your position um
so<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:27.519> use<00:02:28.519> this<00:02:28.760> glitch<00:02:29.090> when<00:02:29.959> you<00:02:30.049> get<00:02:30.170> the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
so I use this glitch when you get the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.270 
so I use this glitch when you get the
time<00:02:30.639> we're<00:02:31.639> on<00:02:31.670> level<00:02:31.849> 38<00:02:32.799> you'll<00:02:33.799> get<00:02:33.980> really

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
time we're on level 38 you'll get really

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.020 
time we're on level 38 you'll get really
far<00:02:34.549> and<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.359> points<00:02:35.810> were<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.219> 130<00:02:37.219> thousands

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
far and the points were in 130 thousands

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.929 
far and the points were in 130 thousands
and<00:02:38.269> so<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:39.079> keep<00:02:39.260> on<00:02:39.439> using<00:02:40.129> your<00:02:40.489> needs<00:02:40.700> and

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
and so just keep on using your needs and

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.259 
and so just keep on using your needs and
you<00:02:41.419> get<00:02:41.689> probably<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:43.340> like<00:02:43.519> level<00:02:43.760> six

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
you get probably to like level six

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.719 
you get probably to like level six
hundred<00:02:44.629> so<00:02:45.819> yeah<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.389> by
