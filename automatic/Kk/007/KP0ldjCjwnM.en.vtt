to do them on monster power 10 because

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.230 
to do them on monster power 10 because
it<00:01:10.850> is<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.060> guaranteed<00:01:11.630> drop<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.229> if<00:01:13.219> a<00:01:13.880> part

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
it is a guaranteed drop and if a part

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.929 
it is a guaranteed drop and if a part
doesn't<00:01:14.479> drop<00:01:15.009> for<00:01:16.009> your<00:01:16.159> ring<00:01:16.429> during

killing<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.570> boss<00:01:17.749> it<00:01:18.229> can<00:01:18.799> be<00:01:18.920> pretty<00:01:19.100> much

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
killing a boss it can be pretty much

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.919 
killing a boss it can be pretty much
considered<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.880> massive<00:01:20.359> waste<00:01:20.509> of<00:01:20.689> time

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
considered a massive waste of time

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:22.599 
considered a massive waste of time
gathering<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.619> maths<00:01:21.829> actually<00:01:22.369> kill<00:01:22.579> the

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
gathering the maths actually kill the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.270 
gathering the maths actually kill the
boss<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.119> then<00:01:23.780> not<00:01:23.960> getting<00:01:24.380> anything<00:01:24.560> so

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
boss and then not getting anything so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.620 
boss and then not getting anything so
therefore<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:25.789> definitely<00:01:26.240> want<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.509> do

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
therefore you definitely want to do

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.859 
therefore you definitely want to do
monster<00:01:26.990> part<00:01:27.200> n<00:01:27.520> now<00:01:28.520> with<00:01:29.030> this<00:01:29.179> they<00:01:29.689> have

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
monster part n now with this they have

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.590 
monster part n now with this they have
made<00:01:30.049> a<00:01:30.079> couple<00:01:30.289> changes<00:01:30.590> recently<00:01:31.600> yesterday

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
made a couple changes recently yesterday

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.349 
made a couple changes recently yesterday
they<00:01:33.259> did<00:01:33.409> increase<00:01:33.999> legendary<00:01:34.999> and<00:01:35.149> set

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
they did increase legendary and set

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.779 
they did increase legendary and set
drops<00:01:35.630> by<00:01:35.929> double<00:01:36.289> of<00:01:36.469> course<00:01:36.799> which<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.490> nice

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
drops by double of course which is nice

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.510 
drops by double of course which is nice
but<00:01:38.270> they've<00:01:38.450> also<00:01:38.630> increased<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.259> HP<00:01:39.740> of<00:01:39.950> the

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
but they've also increased the HP of the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.200 
but they've also increased the HP of the
bosses<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:41.240> mobs<00:01:41.780> I<00:01:41.990> think<00:01:42.229> mainly<00:01:43.100> bosses<00:01:43.700> by

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
bosses and mobs I think mainly bosses by

bosses and mobs I think mainly bosses by
quite<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.509> bit<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:44.960> know<00:01:45.439> for<00:01:45.740> sure<00:01:45.770> magda<00:01:46.429> has

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
quite a bit I know for sure magda has

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:51.069 
quite a bit I know for sure magda has
header<00:01:47.149> HP<00:01:47.630> increased<00:01:48.020> by<00:01:48.259> 100<00:01:49.130> mil<00:01:49.869> rack<00:01:50.869> and

header HP increased by 100 mil rack and

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.010 
header HP increased by 100 mil rack and
not<00:01:51.229> gone<00:01:52.219> they've<00:01:53.060> both<00:01:53.450> had<00:01:53.689> their<00:01:53.840> HP

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.889 
not gone they've both had their HP
increase<00:01:54.530> even<00:01:55.100> skeleton<00:01:55.700> king<00:01:55.899> although

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
increase even skeleton king although

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.570 
increase even skeleton king although
Skelton<00:01:57.350> king<00:01:57.590> is<00:01:57.829> a<00:01:57.859> bit<00:01:58.130> easier<00:01:58.340> now

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
Skelton king is a bit easier now

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.130 
Skelton king is a bit easier now
and<00:02:00.140> well<00:02:01.140> he's<00:02:01.980> not<00:02:02.130> very<00:02:02.340> hard<00:02:02.520> anymore<00:02:03.140> so

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and well he's not very hard anymore so

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.410 
and well he's not very hard anymore so
with<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> proper<00:02:05.430> amount<00:02:05.550> of<00:02:05.790> crowd<00:02:06.180> control

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
with the proper amount of crowd control

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.609 
with the proper amount of crowd control
you<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.230> absolutely<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:08.490> monster<00:02:08.850> power<00:02:09.060> 10

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
you can absolutely do monster power 10

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.010 
you can absolutely do monster power 10
regardless<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.770> how<00:02:11.070> long<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.430> takes<00:02:11.690> now<00:02:12.690> of

regardless of how long it takes now of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.550 
regardless of how long it takes now of
course<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.440> most<00:02:13.950> optimal<00:02:14.430> group<00:02:14.670> is

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
course the most optimal group is

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.160
