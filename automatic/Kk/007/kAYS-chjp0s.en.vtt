00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.780
 two 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.089
 hello how good is welcome 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.070
 portal coches.net we are going to give us a 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.910
 back in this book let tracks 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.910
 come with us please 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.910
 two 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.640
 we started but good you know how 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.180
 whenever we try a car with 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.930
 certain off-road features or its 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.940
 4x4 eye that this 4x4 us as always 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.520
 We bring to some area where you can 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.620
 see their skills for good and truth 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.480
 is that we gave ourselves a hard I do not deceive you 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.700
 we did not give a hard for this chevrolet 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.770
 tracks and it has surprised us well 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.440
 then going up to the same places as a 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.480
 jeep wrangler for example or cars with 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.930
 4x4 drive as he did in his day what 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.580
 the mouth is a kind of clone or cousin 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.880
 brother twin cousin of this one 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.040
 from scratch he tracks and has uploaded the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.790
 coast a tad for that piece of slope 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.150
 but well, it has not done badly 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:08.050
 truth is that to be a 4 by 2 130 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.410
 Diesel horses the six manual change 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.240
 speeds then without more or more without 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.520
 no help without any history 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.330
 the truth is that we have not put it here 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.370
 in our off road area and the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.410
 truth is that it has solved with enough 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.970
 with good enough note sincerely no 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.290
 we just finished a road tour, I'm telling you, but 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.470
 The truth is that he has shown us that 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.070
 Well, he is able to get into some 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.750
 quagmire and if it's not too much 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.940
 too hard, well, well, here 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.040
 you have it otherwise well 4 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.320
 meters and 24 centimeters of this 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.270
 chevrolet tracks the cousin brother of 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.760
 lopez moke shares her engines 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.320
 traction and much more in this case 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.740
 concrete we are with a two wheels 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.230
 motor front 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.520
 and well, here we see that it has 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.460
 phenomenal behaved 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.320
 we went to the asphalt and on asphalt 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.750
 well, the typical suv goes up 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.060
 medium size pulling to small that good 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.360
 Well, that's not bad 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.090
 I can say that this unit the ls plus 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.709
 is around 20 thousand euros which is a 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.170
 so good price because neither much nor little 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.819
 is in the middle is a little bit more 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.380
 equality of versions a little more 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.239
 expensive that the mocha what I tell you is 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.750
 that this version is a bit more 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.430
 low with 130 horsepower diesel engine 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.310
 takes some of some equipment 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.470
 important for example takes speed 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.930
 Cruise carries automatic lights and 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.459
 Sincerely, he does not have a computer 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.590
 I'll tell you just what 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.420
 autonomy you have left or what is the average of 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.459
 consumption that you are making us 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.530
 we have already done more than 1000 kilometers and 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.420
 doing calculations with the deposit of 52 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.910
 liters and what we did with the first 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.350
 what could there be in feeding we have 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.860
 made a calculation of about 6 liters to the 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.019
 100 that is not bad but jolÃ­n a 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.660
 car 20 thousand euros say it like that 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.060
 Of course you must have a computer on board 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.950
 forever 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.300
 on the other hand we are very surprised with 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.340
 the habitability the ceiling height is 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.470
 very very large the squares are very wide 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.760
 backs look like saloon or they have 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.770
 a lot of space up and down 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.380
 for inside out and outside 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.120
 lateral that yes three people behind the 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.349
 from the center and they will give a little bit worse 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.230
 but the truth is that we have 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.849
 surprised enough trunk of 356 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.669
 liters and as in this test unit 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.400
 does not have a spare wheel 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.160
 under the trap door you have another hole 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.620
 decent for good then for well for 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.450
 put more things problems as the fall 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.430
 damages what is pretty hard plastic 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.220
 yes three glove boxes or we are 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.380
 delighted is that apart from the 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.450
 normal glove compartment because they have two more 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.910
 quite comfortable and quite spaces 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.889
 wide to put things the car is 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.630
 well it takes a way that the truth does not 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.979
 we found too much difference 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.600
 when tongue is tight and when not 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.160
 yes that we notice the best that pushes a 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.470
 tint more or that the air conditioning goes 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.270
 a tad better but let's go a little more 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.620
 as always I tell you a little 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.510
 preview the video of what is this 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.070
 chevrolet tracks on portal coches.net 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.830
 world reference website the 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.180
 engine and the full analysis of this 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.550
 you will find it as usual 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.700
 Well on this website where we try 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.860
 try all the cars that have come out 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.850
 to the market and also those who ordered us 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.600
 of course there is a forum in which 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.490
 we listen to all your requests 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.200
