00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.030
 Hello everyone in today's video I wanted 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.430
 you see competes recreate the make up 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.380
 of violet have the right to do this 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.210
 video tutorial because I noticed that 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.680
 many written in the channel are fans of 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.350
 violet because I thought it could 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.230
 be a really nice idea to recreate 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.510
 precisely the make up of violet and then 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.370
 also because in any case the trick in 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.070
 question and it is very easy to 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.690
 to realize is very fast but above all 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.720
 is suitable for all occasions was 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.170
 really very bright so in short 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.590
 it is very cute, penalizing us will serve 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.210
 because of the shim eye shadows anyway 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.070
 just as readers less Alessandro 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.149
 are the shimmer little men are perfect 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.700
 from the white to the light points he launched 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.550
 golden to brown then very colors 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.530
 very hot and of course an eyeliner 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.680
 to recreate as you see 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.570

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.729
 point in 3 stability will know that the actress 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.890

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.429

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.369
 integrated if you want to volumize the 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.229
 eyelashes a synthetic fibers 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.240

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.410

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.730
 beautiful long wavy hair 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.070

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.870

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.350
 like see you at the next video of 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.820
 hello but hello everyone hello hello 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.650
 we use a colorni world pencil 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.600
 as a base, focusing above all 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.910
 in the inner corner and on the arch 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:30.910
 brow and we go with our fingers 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:32.680
 to spread we mix 2 put orange 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.590
 they are lighter and the other darker and there 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.700
 we feel on all the mobile eyelid e 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.290
 since it violates an eye shadow 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.970
 from the orange in the golden we go to 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.440
 take a golden shimmer eye shadow for 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.150
 recreate these reflections using a 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.390
 brown shimmer eyeshadow we recreate 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:56.320
 the shadow of the crease of the eye and with the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.120
 let's go to fade it with a 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.100
 white eye shadow shimmer create stitches 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.180
 light in the inner corner of the eye e 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.180
 under the eyebrow arch 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.610
 take an angled brush with a 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.440
 black gel eyeliner and trace one 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.690
 eyeliner line taking care to do 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:21.650
 a little something elongated to have a 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:23.420
 eye effect with a tapered 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.250
 matte brown eyeshadow and a brush 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.640
 angled we intensify the hairline 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.500
 lower lashes and I have to admit 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.550
 a butter-colored pencil in the rhyme 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.550
 lower part of our eye 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:45.430
 with the mascara we most prefer we go 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.380
 intensify the upper lashes e 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.130
 the lower ones trying to volumize 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.130
 at most 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.340
 at this point if we want we can 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.290
 apply false eyelashes to make 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.980
 our look even more magnetic 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:04.600
 of course this optional step now 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.040
 there is nothing left but to redesign the 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.120
 our eyebrows to give her a 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.120
 more defined character 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.200
 the last step is to put one 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.810
 dyed for the fuchsia color lips 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.810
 I use the New York 496 all 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.100
 the make up is finished if you want to know 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.440
 how to recreate the violet series too 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.210
 follow me in the next video tutorial vi 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.210
