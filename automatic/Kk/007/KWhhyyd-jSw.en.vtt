00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and it lists down or you can see the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.930 
and it lists down or you can see the
inside<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.780> bearing<00:02:40.079> race<00:02:40.579> you<00:02:41.579> just<00:02:41.760> take

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
inside of the bearing race you just take

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.530 
inside of the bearing race you just take
a<00:02:41.970> punch<00:02:42.410> stick<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:44.239> touching<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.510> inside

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
a punch stick it in touching the inside

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.039 
a punch stick it in touching the inside
collar<00:02:46.819> amrish<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:48.750> will<00:02:48.870> move<00:02:48.989> the

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
collar amrish and it will move the

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.620 
collar amrish and it will move the
collar<00:02:49.380> sideways<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.549> can<00:02:50.700> get<00:02:50.819> access<00:02:51.030> to

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.629 
collar sideways so you can get access to
get<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:51.959> inner<00:02:52.200> race<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.069> bearing<00:02:53.099> on

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
get to that inner race of the bearing on

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.280 
get to that inner race of the bearing on
the<00:02:53.790> opposite<00:02:54.060> side<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.930> want<00:02:55.109> to<00:02:55.170> take

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
the opposite side and you want to take

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.550 
the opposite side and you want to take
the<00:02:55.410> punch<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.099> inner<00:02:56.340> race<00:02:56.959> tap<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:58.200> once

one side the other side keep going back
and<00:03:22.110> forth<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.770> can<00:03:23.730> keep<00:03:23.910> looking<00:03:24.390> to

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
and forth and you can keep looking to

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.180 
and forth and you can keep looking to
make<00:03:24.959> sure<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.290> bearing<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.680> coming<00:03:26.040> out

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
make sure the bearing is coming out

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.070 
make sure the bearing is coming out
straight<00:03:27.030> one<00:03:27.569> thing<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.810> want<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.019> be

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
straight one thing you want to be

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.130 
straight one thing you want to be
careful<00:03:28.319> of<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.819> bearing<00:03:30.180> gets<00:03:30.840> a

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
careful of is that the bearing gets a

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.690 
careful of is that the bearing gets a
little<00:03:31.470> sideways<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.310> keep<00:03:32.459> tapping

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
little sideways and you keep tapping

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.080 
little sideways and you keep tapping
that<00:03:32.910> one<00:03:33.269> side<00:03:33.510> too<00:03:33.780> much<00:03:33.989> it'll<00:03:34.920> curl<00:03:35.340> the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
that one side too much it'll curl the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.479 
that one side too much it'll curl the
inside<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.720> Aryan<00:03:37.349> race<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.739> take<00:03:38.310> up

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
inside of the Aryan race and take up

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.830 
inside of the Aryan race and take up
some<00:03:38.670> aluminum<00:03:39.120> which<00:03:39.330> could<00:03:39.510> destroy<00:03:39.600> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
some aluminum which could destroy the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.289 
some aluminum which could destroy the
hub<00:03:40.110> so<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.190> keep<00:03:41.310> going<00:03:41.610> back<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:41.880> forward

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
hub so just keep going back and forward

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.840 
hub so just keep going back and forward
tapping<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.440> making<00:03:44.280> sure<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.549> bearings

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
tapping it making sure the bearings

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.360 
tapping it making sure the bearings
coming<00:03:45.150> out<00:03:45.269> one<00:03:45.989> bearing<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.350> pop<00:03:46.560> out<00:03:46.769> then

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
coming out one bearing to pop out then

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.039 
coming out one bearing to pop out then
the<00:03:47.549> other<00:03:47.730> variant<00:03:48.150> is<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.299> lot<00:03:48.569> easier<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.900> get

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
the other variant is a lot easier to get

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.280 
the other variant is a lot easier to get
out<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:49.590> both<00:03:50.030> bearings<00:03:51.030> on<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.780> drive<00:03:51.989> cider

a<00:06:53.150> propane<00:06:54.080> torch<00:06:54.350> is<00:06:54.680> a<00:06:55.400> great<00:06:56.120> tool<00:06:56.360> to<00:06:56.420> use

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 
a propane torch is a great tool to use

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.590 
a propane torch is a great tool to use
what<00:06:57.590> you<00:06:57.680> want<00:06:57.890> to<00:06:58.010> do<00:06:58.160> is<00:06:58.400> just<00:06:58.730> heat<00:06:59.180> up<00:06:59.210> the

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 
what you want to do is just heat up the

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.270 
what you want to do is just heat up the
outside<00:06:59.810> of<00:07:00.140> the<00:07:00.200> bearing<00:07:00.470> race<00:07:00.650> for<00:07:00.860> about<00:07:01.010> 30

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
outside of the bearing race for about 30

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.640 
outside of the bearing race for about 30
seconds<00:07:01.730> and<00:07:01.940> it<00:07:02.420> expands<00:07:02.900> that<00:07:03.140> aluminum<00:07:03.590> a

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
seconds and it expands that aluminum a

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.350 
seconds and it expands that aluminum a
little<00:07:03.890> bit<00:07:04.040> and<00:07:04.160> then<00:07:04.670> break<00:07:04.940> some<00:07:05.180> of<00:07:05.270> the

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
little bit and then break some of the

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.880 
little bit and then break some of the
rust<00:07:05.540> and<00:07:05.750> corrosion<00:07:05.870> of<00:07:06.200> the<00:07:06.260> bearings<00:07:06.680> that

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
rust and corrosion of the bearings that

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.920 
rust and corrosion of the bearings that
will<00:07:07.610> make<00:07:07.790> the<00:07:07.940> bearing<00:07:08.240> pop<00:07:08.450> out<00:07:08.630> a<00:07:08.660> lot

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
will make the bearing pop out a lot

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.590 
will make the bearing pop out a lot
easier<00:07:09.140> same<00:07:09.860> with<00:07:10.010> the<00:07:10.100> retainer<00:07:10.460> ring<00:07:10.600> those

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:11.600 
easier same with the retainer ring those

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.240 
easier same with the retainer ring those
get<00:07:11.840> corroded<00:07:12.050> a<00:07:12.380> lot<00:07:12.590> in<00:07:12.770> the<00:07:12.800> threads

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
get corroded a lot in the threads

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.710 
get corroded a lot in the threads
because<00:07:13.550> they<00:07:13.790> don't<00:07:13.940> have<00:07:13.970> any<00:07:14.180> lubricant

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
because they don't have any lubricant

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.680 
because they don't have any lubricant
that<00:07:14.870> comes<00:07:15.080> from<00:07:15.290> the<00:07:15.520> factories<00:07:16.520> so<00:07:17.420> getting

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690 
that comes from the factories so getting

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.060 
that comes from the factories so getting
the<00:07:17.870> retainer<00:07:18.170> ring<00:07:18.290> out<00:07:18.530> might<00:07:18.740> be<00:07:18.770> a<00:07:18.920> little

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070 
the retainer ring out might be a little

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.010 
the retainer ring out might be a little
tough<00:07:19.340> but<00:07:19.880> if<00:07:20.030> you<00:07:20.180> use<00:07:20.210> a<00:07:20.330> little<00:07:20.600> bit<00:07:20.780> of<00:07:20.840> the

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.020 
tough but if you use a little bit of the

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.080 
tough but if you use a little bit of the
propane<00:07:21.410> torch<00:07:21.710> heat<00:07:21.980> it<00:07:22.100> up<00:07:22.220> that'll<00:07:22.940> break

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.090 
propane torch heat it up that'll break

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.220 
propane torch heat it up that'll break
up<00:07:23.330> the<00:07:23.420> corrosion<00:07:23.750> and<00:07:24.050> break<00:07:24.650> everything<00:07:24.920> up
