00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 but 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.400
 without a doubt it is one of the most 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.559
 expected is assassin's believe not only 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.210
 because that franchise was responsible for 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.400
 true games with a very high 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.530
 popularity but also because the 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.480
 history has such interesting edges 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.120
 that really deserves a version 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.280
 cinematographic the miedito is like 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.559
 always the adaptation I can do 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.510
 hollywood of the argument although there was 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.460
 successes when moving video games to 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.590
 cinema we also had to eat 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.479
 true disrespect like dom or 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.190
 max payne as if it were not enough 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.440
 'assassin's creed' needs a 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.360
 large-scale production we talk about a 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.460
 game with a very elaborate argument 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.770
 a lot of historical load scenarios 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.560
 awesome and very strong characters 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.479
 In fact, we would be encouraged to say that 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.550
 could even be synthesized in a 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.460
 single movie but going to the axis of the 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.840
 news the issue is that the site 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.740
 boxofficemojo was encouraged to put a date 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.869
 exact to premiere May 22, 2015 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.570
 however in India they still do not reflect 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.820
 that data if both agree that the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.890
 role of desmond thousands would be assigned to 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.590
 michael fassbender we can see 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.990
 making a young magneto in x-men 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.030
 david class in prometheus there is no 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.340
 still confirmation of director or of 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.890
 secondary actors but yes of scriptwriter 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.869
 the english michael leslie that so far 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.479
 he played that role in shorts but not in 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.310
 renowned films with so many 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.649
 missing it's hard to talk about day 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.110
 exact premiere although we do not believe that 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.179
 be far from that date considering 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.480
 how much of mc film new regency 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.769
 pictures as ubisoft entertainment 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.400
 confirmed a strong commitment to 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.400
 take it forward
