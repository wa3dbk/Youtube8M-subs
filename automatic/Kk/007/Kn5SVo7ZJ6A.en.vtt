00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
filling handle you know you can really

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.950 
filling handle you know you can really
push<00:02:31.290> into<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:31.980> get<00:02:32.700> some<00:02:32.970> good<00:02:33.450> work<00:02:33.720> out

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
push into it and get some good work out

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.490 
push into it and get some good work out
of<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:36.770> look<00:02:37.770> at<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.780> almost<00:02:39.780> all<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.200> way<00:02:40.230> up

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
of it look at that almost all the way up

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.900 
of it look at that almost all the way up
pretty<00:02:41.190> nice<00:02:41.370> also<00:02:42.240> one<00:02:42.510> idea<00:02:43.170> for<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.590> guys

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
pretty nice also one idea for you guys

pretty nice also one idea for you guys
for<00:02:44.910> kydex<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:46.430> gave<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.580> right<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.330> these

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
for kydex I gave it right to this these

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.090 
for kydex I gave it right to this these
are<00:02:50.840> whether<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.459> malice<00:02:53.459> clip<00:02:55.100> Melissa

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
are whether this malice clip Melissa

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.510 
are whether this malice clip Melissa
clip<00:02:56.550> from<00:02:56.970> tactical<00:02:57.810> tailor<00:02:58.200> its<00:02:59.160> plastic

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
clip from tactical tailor its plastic

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.760 
clip from tactical tailor its plastic
and<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.540> nice<00:03:00.720> thing<00:03:00.750> about<00:03:00.990> this<00:03:01.410> is<00:03:01.650> that

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
and the nice thing about this is that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.490 
and the nice thing about this is that
you<00:03:02.010> already<00:03:02.280> have<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.730> holes<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:04.050> are

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
you already have the holes that are

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.949 
you already have the holes that are
pretty<00:03:04.860> much<00:03:05.100> aligned<00:03:05.430> with<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.000> one<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:06.900> a

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
pretty much aligned with the one and a

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.550 
pretty much aligned with the one and a
half<00:03:06.990> inch<00:03:07.380> holes<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.550> Cadillac<00:03:08.760> sheets

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
half inch holes in the Cadillac sheets

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.310 
half inch holes in the Cadillac sheets
so<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.620> can<00:03:10.860> mount<00:03:11.010> them<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.840> Sam<00:03:12.840> like<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.140> did

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
so you can mount them and Sam like I did

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.290 
so you can mount them and Sam like I did
with<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.680> automotive<00:03:14.280> straps<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.820> can<00:03:14.970> use

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
with the automotive straps you can use

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.759 
with the automotive straps you can use
them<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:16.140> these<00:03:16.440> are<00:03:16.800> cool<00:03:17.420> because<00:03:18.769> they

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
them but these are cool because they

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.710 
them but these are cool because they
actually<00:03:19.950> like<00:03:20.550> it's<00:03:20.820> not<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.390> clip<00:03:21.690> that

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
actually like it's not just a clip that

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.650 
actually like it's not just a clip that
clicks<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:23.190> actually<00:03:23.610> lags<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.180> place<00:03:24.450> in

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
clicks this actually lags in place in

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.080 
clicks this actually lags in place in
this<00:03:24.780> tab<00:03:25.050> so<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.100> lift<00:03:26.489> this<00:03:26.640> up<00:03:26.700> with

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
this tab so you just lift this up with

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.210 
this tab so you just lift this up with
if<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.750> have<00:03:27.870> strong<00:03:28.200> nails<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.739> can<00:03:28.950> lift<00:03:29.100> it

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
if you have strong nails you can lift it

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.640 
if you have strong nails you can lift it
up<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.519> unlock<00:03:30.300> it<00:03:30.510> but<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.230> little

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
up and unlock it but it's a little

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.350 
up and unlock it but it's a little
stiffer<00:03:32.070> than<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.310> nylon<00:03:33.060> webbing<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:35.360> it's

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
stiffer than the nylon webbing and it's

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.800 
stiffer than the nylon webbing and it's
pretty<00:03:36.600> cool<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.580> know<00:03:38.580> that<00:03:38.940> little<00:03:39.180> little

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
pretty cool you know that little little

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.620 
pretty cool you know that little little
more<00:03:40.050> security<00:03:40.470> in<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.980> locking<00:03:41.370> mechanism

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
more security in the locking mechanism

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.470 
more security in the locking mechanism
is<00:03:42.630> pretty<00:03:43.260> cool<00:03:43.560> feature<00:03:44.220> for<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.180> mode

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
is pretty cool feature for this mode

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.060 
is pretty cool feature for this mode
like<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:46.260> one<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.530> little<00:03:46.590> different

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
like this one is a little different

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.250 
like this one is a little different
because<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.459> this<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:48.030> under<00:03:48.480> my<00:03:48.660> kayak<00:03:48.870> shade

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
because the this is under my kayak shade

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.350 
because the this is under my kayak shade
is<00:03:49.410> little<00:03:49.709> thin<00:03:49.920> so<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:50.730> wouldn't<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.180> one

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
is little thin so this wouldn't this one

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.630 
is little thin so this wouldn't this one
would<00:03:51.540> need<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.870> rubber<00:03:52.200> spacers<00:03:52.830> but

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
would need the rubber spacers but

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.229 
would need the rubber spacers but
further<00:03:54.290> for<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.380> other<00:03:55.730> high-tech<00:03:56.730> shit<00:03:57.090> it

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
further for the other high-tech shit it

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.160 
further for the other high-tech shit it
should<00:03:57.720> work<00:03:57.900> perfect<00:03:59.540> actually<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:00.959> this

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
should work perfect actually like this

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.410 
should work perfect actually like this
probably<00:04:01.560> even<00:04:01.739> better<00:04:01.860> than<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.310> nylon<00:04:03.209> ones

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
probably even better than the nylon ones

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.650 
probably even better than the nylon ones
I<00:04:03.799> mean<00:04:04.799> they<00:04:05.250> have<00:04:05.400> ups<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:05.760> downs<00:04:05.850> it's<00:04:06.480> more

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
I mean they have ups and downs it's more

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.500 
I mean they have ups and downs it's more
plastic<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.290> than<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.680> an<00:04:07.799> island<00:04:08.190> but<00:04:08.510> the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
plastic a than the an island but the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.110 
plastic a than the an island but the
security<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.410> stiffness<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.670> it's

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
security and the stiffness of it it's

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.690 
security and the stiffness of it it's
pretty<00:04:12.480> nice<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:14.040> tell<00:04:14.340> me<00:04:14.370> what<00:04:14.549> you<00:04:14.640> think
