00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.840
 you are 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:09.230
 and good the quarterfinals the match 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.900
 must between Altamira and Juan Road Runner 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.280
 Carlos Zúñiga present the narration of 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.930
 district of this match a match 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.330
 interesting especially for the 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.220
 expectation that you had about this 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.500
 game could not be 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.449
 nicolás willow the forward holder of 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.940
 that squad of roadrunners follows 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.650
 injured neither sara were today 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.720
 Rafael died and in front there we are 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.070
 already seeing some of the actions of 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.829
 first time where correcaminos 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.929
 He pressed hard on the header 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.999
 diego main and the reaction would 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.339
 part of high school students that 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:42.319
 He came out a little nervous in this first 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.909
 part of zamora but finally they achieve 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:47.329
 reverse the marker and take a 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.100
 advantage to marte r gómez 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.070
 it is a good advantage 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.220
 Zamora but as we said yesterday in him 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.260
 irapuato in the end is not enough 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.030
 although the lion has to say it can 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 lose up by having to lose by 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.690
 two goals to be eliminated here with 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.369
 that roadrunner wins happens if it is not and 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.020
 it is very feasible when at home the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.550
 set of roadrunners that gives you 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.340
 back also think it was always a 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.540
 rival or rather a very solid team 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.119
 at home I do not think it's not 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.770
 surprising that you win to run 200 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.390
 roadrunner still in second place from 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.770
 the table we think that in the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.840
 team sense of the greater set 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.430
 garcía logar minimum advantage but one 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.410
 advantage to the end not here we the goal with 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.080
 Jotas de Ray Torres overtook the 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.840
 squad of roadrunners rafa pass 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.369
 murguía is at bay and from this 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.680
 way the squadron would go forward 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.380
 from one to zero, it seemed that the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.300
 Things were going to be quiet from 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.369
 the 24th minute that this first one fell 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.110
 annotation nacho rodríguez the post 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.789
 champion technician until the time of 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.250
 ascension league got it with the 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.140
 squad of irapuato dominated already in this 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.420
 final straight of the first half the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.250
 set of roadrunners out there there were 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.080
 some changes already from the squadron of 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.780
 Altamira that only helped a lot 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.150
 to reverse the score from 2 to 1 the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.970
 advantage for altamira after going 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.230
 losing is the redeemable thing of this 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.230
 team 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:15.990
 something complicated on Sunday on Sunday 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.240
 still because it's also a rivalry 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.030
 that must be remembered have also been given 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.020
 even with the bucket 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.450
 last when there was invasion of court 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.350
 part of a good entry good entry 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.300
 in the stadium altamira by the way the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.700
 return match told us some 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.320
 people during the transmission that the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.660
 entrance will be free for some 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.240
 people depending on the tickets that 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.860
 you have is all for a matter of 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.990
 government that are putting the entry 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.820
 to see the roadrunner match 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.520
 against altamira the return that we will have 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.040
 in 13 sports here it started already at 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.530
 Students squad to press the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.910
 entrance of the couple and we see nacho 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.660
 rodríguez give the latest indications 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:02.760
 to this one because he's late nacho 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.310
 Rodriguez came the shots already 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.140
 by the Altamira squad and 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.439
 there we are looking at the annotation of 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.629
 christian red to 62 practically without 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.730
 marca diego menghi stays around 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.799
 floating and in this way it tied the 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.260
 party and aggravates already much more confidence 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.260
 that squad that nobody followed him 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.159
 and also with one leg for the height 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.319
 more change from the squadron of 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.620
 he began to come the way 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.930
 night something nacho rodríguez began to 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.090
 press the roadrunner square 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.909
 I will come is half an office 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.090
 still not enough to specify the 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.620
 plays of danger the few that generated 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.930
 roadrunner in the second part and here 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.780
 would come the mascareñas pass for 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.840
 eleazar that also took advantage only 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.609
 unmarked that they did to this young man of 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.739
 Altamira students to give 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.200
 the return to the scoreboard and take a 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.430
 win the second leg if you 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.459
 we said to one is not enough 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.200
 but well at least it 's something is some 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.069
 kind of advantage I go to roadrunners 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.469
 much much superior to altamira without 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.079
 But good here can give some kind 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:20.690
 of surprise this card is already 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.789
 final in the last minutes of the match 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.550
 and well the second leg already knows 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.380
 as said by Juan Carlos Zuniga by TBS 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.330
 sports this Sunday will have to see 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.889
 also if it is achieved to recover nicolás 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.479
 willow the scorer of the squadron of 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.970
 roadrunners and also indies ma the 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.099
 balad is the exam scorer of 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.380
 Altamira who also got injured in 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.330
 this match the two attack men 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.300
 that has as much mario garcía as nacho 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.300
 Rodriguez to see if they can give 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.300
 you
