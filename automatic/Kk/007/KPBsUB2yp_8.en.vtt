important part the tutorial keep the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580 
important part the tutorial keep the
port<00:01:50.819> number<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.149> same<00:01:51.330> should<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.690> 80<00:01:52.200> 80

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
port number the same should be 80 80

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.919 
port number the same should be 80 80
this<00:01:53.459> is<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.670> main<00:01:53.819> thing<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.060> bypasses<00:01:54.630> all

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
this is the main thing that bypasses all

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.309 
this is the main thing that bypasses all
of<00:01:55.110> your<00:01:55.259> patches<00:01:55.470> goes<00:01:56.959> so<00:01:57.959> why'd<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.110> went
