00:00:48.249 --> 00:01:00.969
 tablespoon of tomato paste with let it short 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:03.659
 with roasting my fans get it too 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.659

 roast in the chances of the beginning of may 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.789
 and to be delicious to smell namely 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:41.140
 also a good splash 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:43.439
 lemon juice and leave that off now me 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.439

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.439
 try out 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.450
 there you can also normal vegetable broth 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.850
 Also take water otherwise we will go 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.750
 hard-packed zinc I have today 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.750
 homemade 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:30.430

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.470
 I also the rest of the vegetables photos 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.770
 to 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.760
 which is really too expensive in relation 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.760
 then prefer to continue in your own 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:51.160
 and do not give anymore 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:56.380
 Oat cream a little bit of marjoram 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:01.860
 and then I leave that together with the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.860
 noodles minutes simmer 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.230
 you can either do that now 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.570
 to serve together on a plate or 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.530
 I really like that with noodles 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.970
 I really should like it a lot 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.959
 I just smeared you in the pan 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.830
 give the sauce to give and then already 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.630
 Serve with stirring yes and me 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.709
