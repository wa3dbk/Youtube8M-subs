00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
much easy with JPEG file it doesn't

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.830 
much easy with JPEG file it doesn't
behave<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.549> open<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.450> by

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
behave like that if you open it by

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.700 
behave like that if you open it by
double-clicking<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:20.630> file<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.560> going

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
double-clicking the file it's just going

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.609 
double-clicking the file it's just going
to<00:01:22.860> open<00:01:23.070> straight<00:01:23.759> into<00:01:24.180> Photoshop<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:27.619> if

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to open straight into Photoshop and if

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:38.780 
to open straight into Photoshop and if
you<00:01:30.079> open<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:34.009> here<00:01:36.890> it's<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.040> kind<00:01:38.729> of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you open it in here it's just kind of

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.780 
you open it in here it's just kind of
open<00:01:39.299> straight<00:01:39.570> into<00:01:39.780> Photoshop<00:01:40.200> again<00:01:40.790> so

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
open straight into Photoshop again so

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.679 
open straight into Photoshop again so
the<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:43.009> we<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.420> we<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:47.689> click

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the way that we do this we have to click

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.440 
the way that we do this we have to click
on<00:01:49.790> this<00:01:50.790> format<00:01:51.560> drop-down<00:01:52.560> menu<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.060> I

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
on this format drop-down menu here so I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.550 
on this format drop-down menu here so I
want<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> open<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.799> file<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.750> camera<00:01:58.259> RAW

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
want to open this file in the camera RAW

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.999 
want to open this file in the camera RAW
format<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:00.960> basically<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.500> this

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
format so it's basically just this

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.210 
format so it's basically just this
important<00:02:02.759> bit<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.810> click<00:02:04.020> open<00:02:06.649> ok<00:02:07.649> now

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
important bit and we click open ok now

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.510 
important bit and we click open ok now
the<00:02:08.280> JPEG<00:02:08.700> file<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.239> open<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.520> photoshop

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
the JPEG file is open in the photoshop

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.050 
the JPEG file is open in the photoshop
raw<00:02:12.060> editor

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
raw editor

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.869 
raw editor
so<00:02:15.060> again<00:02:15.420> I'm<00:02:15.859> just<00:02:16.859> assuming<00:02:17.159> that<00:02:17.489> this<00:02:17.639> is

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
so again I'm just assuming that this is

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.849 
so again I'm just assuming that this is
the<00:02:18.599> wide<00:02:18.870> area<00:02:19.650> or<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.329> white<00:02:21.329> ball<00:02:21.659> and<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:22.739> just

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
the wide area or a white ball and I just

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.429 
the wide area or a white ball and I just
click<00:02:23.129> at<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:24.150> white<00:02:24.450> ball<00:02:24.749> and<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.260> white

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
click at the white ball and the white

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.940 
click at the white ball and the white
balance<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.889> fix<00:02:26.540> its<00:02:27.540> attempt<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.170> pride<00:02:28.499> so

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
balance is fix its attempt to pride so

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.629 
balance is fix its attempt to pride so
I'll<00:02:29.849> just<00:02:30.889> pull<00:02:31.889> the<00:02:32.069> expo<00:02:32.609> down<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:33.180> bit

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:34.639 
I'll just pull the expo down a bit

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.660 
I'll just pull the expo down a bit
there<00:02:35.639> you<00:02:35.730> go<00:02:36.079> that's<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.139> before<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.889> just

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
there you go that's the before and just

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.929 
there you go that's the before and just
after<00:02:40.250> spray<00:02:41.250> pretty<00:02:41.730> much<00:02:41.819> easy<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.790> other

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
after spray pretty much easy the other

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.839 
after spray pretty much easy the other
way<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.230> opening<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.409> file<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.919> the<00:02:47.099> other<00:02:47.519> web

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
way is opening the file in the other web

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.399 
way is opening the file in the other web
Adobe<00:02:48.419> bridge<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:49.790> hit<00:02:50.790> command<00:02:51.689> or<00:02:51.900> Apple

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
Adobe bridge and hit command or Apple

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.110 
Adobe bridge and hit command or Apple
are<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:52.949> Macintosh<00:02:53.489> or<00:02:55.040> control<00:02:56.040> are<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.639> PC

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
are on Macintosh or control are on PC

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.479 
are on Macintosh or control are on PC
and<00:02:58.849> it's<00:02:59.849> doing<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.659> same<00:03:00.780> thing<00:03:02.419> and<00:03:04.489> one

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
and it's doing the same thing and one

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.759 
and it's doing the same thing and one
more<00:03:05.760> thing<00:03:05.790> about<00:03:06.120> these<00:03:06.329> fix<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.169> it<00:03:07.560> only

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
more thing about these fix that it only

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.619 
more thing about these fix that it only
