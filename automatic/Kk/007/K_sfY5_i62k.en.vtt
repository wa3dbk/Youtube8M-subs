 Hello everyone and welcome in this 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.679
 occasion we are going to make this flower made 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.740
 with very easy paper tubes 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.480
 do and fast so I invite you to see 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.160
 how I did it give me a like 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.990
 subscribe and share it with your friends 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.240
 well to do this craft very 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.080
 simple as you could see we are going to 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.260
 use cardboard tubes either paper 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.440
 hygienic or paper towels then 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.530
 The first thing we do is crush them 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.860
 the good paper tube once we have 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.270
 crushed the tube 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:51.050
 let's take our rule and let's 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.300
 divide the paper tube into strips of 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.390
 Thickness that you want I am 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.540
 doing 1 centimeter so each 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.180
 centimeter let's mark a line by 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:07.180
 which we will divide our tube 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.680
 we have drawn lines to be able to cut and 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.490
 by the line we cut 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.590
 once we have already cut our 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.470
 strips we will need four of 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.650
 these strips for each petal of our 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.040
 flower then we take one we leave it 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.040
 just as it is then we take another and what 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.229
 we are going to fold in half and once 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.520
 we have it folded in half we are going to 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.520
 place some glue 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.290
 at the apex of the doubles 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.890
 and we paste it in the little corner 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.890
 from the other tub 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.750
 we take another strip we bend it in the 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.750
 half again 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.200
 we put white glue or the glue that 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.710
 you are using 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.200
 and we will place it in the other corner 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.050
 with the two tips inside the previous 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.540
 what we had put 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.870
 and the last one we go back to double by the 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.870
 half 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.310
 we put glue 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.260
 and we 're going to hit it in the corner of 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.260
 first we put 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.370
 we stick it closed so that it is 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.200
 within the second 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.950
 and we will stay like this we are going to do 5 of 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.260
 these pieces that will be the petals of 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.860
 our flower and once we have 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.799
 5 we just left them together for 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.709
 one of the corners to form our 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.530
 flower and now we are taking each of 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.260
 the petals and we're going to place the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.049
 glue 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.700
 in one of the corners we're going to let 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.189
 this is that we arrange them well and 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.989
 we let this be what and how can 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.510
 see these flowers made of tubes 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.239
 paper are very easy to do very 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.060
 fast we can also do with the 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.760
 children and if you want to decorate them 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.640
 you can paint them or put them in glitter 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.720
 glitter or frost as you know it 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.510
 and you can decorate your bus we're going to do 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.209
 a few small rolls for the center 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.250
 our flower and we will give it another touch 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.319
 And we will also give you stability 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.209
 let's take one of the strips that 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.040
 we had an inch and we're going to 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.920
 cut to half the width ie 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.430
 let's make medium strips 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.430
 centimeter 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.050
 I'm going to open it on one side 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.230
 it looks like this and what I'm going to do is 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.620
 roll it in itself is to say I want 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.610
 make a little roll so I'm going 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.330
 to go rolling 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.170
 and while I'm winding up I'm going to put 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:11.100
 a few inches of glue so that 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.970
 stay fixed and let's do two one for 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.040
 each side of our flower 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.190
 once we have the two rolls there 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.360
 let's take the flower in the center of 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.360
 placed some glue 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.510
 and what I do is paste one of the 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.510
 rolls there 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.630
 this is going to be that the 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.000
 union and also gives a little touch 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.710
 different to our flower because we are going to 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.930
 do on both sides wait for it to 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.210
 dry I'll turn it over and I'll hit the 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.620
 another side the other roll that we have 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.680
 fact 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.530
 and now we have to add a tape to 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.870
 string to hang it either from our 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.630
 Christmas tree or wherever you want 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.860
 place it then I have chosen a 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.830
 lace cited gilded 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:04.469
 which is roughly 20 centimeters 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.469
 and what I do is fold half 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.290
 pass it through one of the leaves by the 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.290
 central part 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:22.830
 and then put the ends in the ring 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.800
 that is done once there we make a knot 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.750
 at the end and we have ready 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.629
 well that's how we have our 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.539
 Christmas decoration very simple as they can 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:37.479
 see the end of the video I leave more 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:40.270

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.580
