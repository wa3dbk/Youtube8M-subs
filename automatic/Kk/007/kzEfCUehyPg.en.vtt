00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.820
 after that period the domain of the sun in which the 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.659
 three have been proving 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.659
 we ended up lessa pr-al of the 1st vestibular of 2011 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.720
 ian that now we are here doing some of these items of this last test 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.810
 these terms are people as it was published he went to work and to 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.990
 compensate 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.239
 to specify 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.369
 then the name of April are the biology teachers that gives rise to 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.569
 I made two items of this test 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:30.859
 like six khar 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.859
 items are the items of the proof of order notebook 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.480
 in the first item that we are going to work and a lot in 28 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.940
 the proof finally found to work a little devolution right 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.879
 We have some evolution issues, prefer to work from here, because to you. 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.680
 starting with the 128 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740
 no one plays the next day or 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.409
 that the theory of evolution by natural selection 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.690
 involves chance and need 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.310
 chance is present in the differential production process of individuals 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.780
 better adapted 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.130
 to the east 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.280
 eric item he is working with the idea of ​​randomness with the case 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.730
 present within evolution 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.890
 problem is that it makes clear the invoice per year especially 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.140
 mutation rates within the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.760
 with which we are not dealing during the evolutionary process 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.680
 one more item works specifically with the reproduction of expert of the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 individuals 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.659
 the so-called sexual selection 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.980
 in which the female of the species is any species, 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.320
 this tv can selecting is looking within the landmarks she has 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.470
 as availability from within her sample universe 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.340
 so I have to select 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.660
 what she considers unrealistic, she considers this material on account of a 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.979
 feature set 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.820
 and then of course these characteristics do not vary a little bit from females pm 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.980
 but there's going to be something in that guy for peace picking 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.820
 which she finds interesting 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.080
 either because he is tall or because he is strong he always has a carretinha 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.890
 bright 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.510
 is something happens 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.850
 that females that but the interesting 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.560
 The fact that I find this but interesting 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.930
 do not be put to the test of discouragement unlearn 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.719
 have these characteristics 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:14.569
 already what attracted her theoretically to him other beasts also then has to 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.390
 ensure the reproductive future 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.469
 of their offspring from their offspring 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.709
 so the moment you have a selection of the high sisu you have a 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.520
 selection 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.119
 of the sexual partner by pm 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.309
 from that moment the randomness was through the window 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:29.680
 so invented 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.020
 this process 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.550
 specifically the reproductive process 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.180
 He is part of you a sexual selection 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.770
 she will work 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.400
 with the process and that has nothing in report the fair in question 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.190
 but it was a set of characteristics thus being 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.300
 the interpreted 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.170
 is working with randomness within a process in which there is a 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.549
 specific selection has certain factors 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.949
 no mysteries right 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:58.719
 so he will now work with others in himself does not have 123 this proof 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.709
 the ipc-3i is a matter of how to act 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:09.289
 this item working with the idea of ​​proposals within an ecosystem 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.270
 luiz esteves 3 he with this seductive speech 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.660
 the ecosystem 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.059
 changes in biomass and has a level of the food chain 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:22.059
 may result in changes in biomass at other levels because of the 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:26.409
 existence of mechanisms similar to those described for complex and 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.579
 dynamics presented in the text 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.519
 the utrecht one he is talking plot squares of collor theory set d 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.110
 now the interesting detail that they will work with 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.080
 the village of the food arcade 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.729
 related to biomass 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:48.290
 biomass emater organic to the media biomass of the organism 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.080
 you take those organic components of that organism 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.410
 and goes on during a team training especially we have a great 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.830
 amount of water 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.520
 inside our body is 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.000
 and what remains is the organic danger of these organisms 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.129
 It's called March 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.239
 if you put one of those so-called ecological crimes, we're still here. 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.359
 ecological pyramid of biomass 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.040
 will work culture and sports education the way of application 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.249
 of applications by producers 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:20.169
 right here on the second level primary consumers themselves are 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.620
 feeding ten producers 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.960
 I wanted to have been proposed in 12 counties would have limited resting 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.710
 primates 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.460
 the idea comes this whole sequence that the gentlemen 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.330
 is to allow the present mass 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.720
 on the base would be enough to keep the top mark 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.789
 superior framing teams 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.110
 if you have a change in the biomass of any of these proper names 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.210
 even if it is in the base at the middle point 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.059
 this will generate an operation throughout the food chain 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:49.749
 after all you have a change for example that in the middle 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:54.159
 we hope it will be in a heated 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.760
 segmentation boarding escape 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.480
 and feeding on these vacancies of a family of life-giving humans who 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.510
 she did from time to time make fresh 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.650
 manassas in the chain 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.490
 it is with scenes that have a disease something that kills a lot 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.909
 of these brands of their cows 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:08.889
 this means 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.550
 that the biomass of this system in the second level changes that less consumers 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.370
 primary 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.419
 it decreases 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.090
 what is that abdelmassih that before was all this biomass that it stays 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.469
 restricted to the lowest value 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.240
 of biomass 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.240
 at the time when the lowest biomass was reported 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:29.749
 change the entire food chain and not only grow 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:30.360
 next 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.550
 if you stop to analyze those then there's less cow here 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.979
 whether you - massad vacari if you have less cow dough and have fewer vacancies 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.870
 This means that we have cows eating grass that feed 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.550
 producers 7- vacancies element producers the trend 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.139
 hackers and producers increase amount increases in 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.930
 then the increase in number 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.630
 and consequently of weight 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.969
 I applaud condominium proof as a whole to increase 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:55.599
 so if the current trend 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.909
 to increase this level proposes that it be a little bit 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:01.629
 the number of companies and these plants 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.619
 yesterday 10 to increase at least vacancy feeding from them 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:06.279
 in compensation 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.490
 at the moment there are fewer vacancies serving human food prices 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.509
 if these stalls are roque main food process 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:14.810
 of these bodies 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.630
 if we keep massacres with me 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.020
 And if that magic is small enough 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.020
 the tendency is that these humans will not have enough food 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.540
 this different substitutes or food is like malnutrition 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:27.990
 tend to die 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.229
 and certainly no decrease in body weight 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:32.369
 as a result 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:34.929
 it has to be neutral with consumers and with the wheel of a 

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:35.960
 trend 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.520
 shows a decrease 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.460
 then a biomass change that happened here, right? 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.710
 in structure 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.550
 Sunday according to the procon primary consumers 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.550
 it may end up operating all other airports 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:51.720
 so intense that it had 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.800
 ipc 23 but I ended up working with this idea 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.700
 that the operation however can operate the others it is promising the 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:06:59.400
 gifts 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.009
 within this structure 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:02.360
 hence the spheres 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.070
 I hope the Saints did a good test, I hope that the 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:08.330
 minimum is not difficult at all. 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.009
 an extensive production and if I left well I hope to see them again 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:14.220
 oab enters the heat 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.060
 we talk 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.040
 the gentlemen's arm
