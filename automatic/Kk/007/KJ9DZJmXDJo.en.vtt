photo I'm taking today or I took like
two<00:02:07.320> days<00:02:07.500> ago

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
two days ago

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.630 
two days ago
as<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.410> can<00:02:08.560> see<00:02:08.709> from<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.950> photo<00:02:09.250> I<00:02:09.520> can

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
as you can see from the photo I can

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.059 
as you can see from the photo I can
notice<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.270> huge<00:02:10.539> difference<00:02:10.629> in<00:02:11.319> my<00:02:11.379> it's

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
notice a huge difference in my it's

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.220 
notice a huge difference in my it's
pretty<00:02:12.370> much<00:02:12.519> because<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.480> was<00:02:13.959> just<00:02:14.050> really

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
pretty much because I was just really

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.470 
pretty much because I was just really
bloated<00:02:14.530> everywhere<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:15.489> arms<00:02:15.940> hips<00:02:16.180> legs

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
bloated everywhere like arms hips legs

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.000 
bloated everywhere like arms hips legs
or<00:02:16.690> whatever<00:02:16.870> but<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.200> most<00:02:17.410> part<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:17.980> I

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
or whatever but the most part that I

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.309 
or whatever but the most part that I
noticed<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.489> in<00:02:18.580> is<00:02:18.760> like<00:02:18.970> my<00:02:19.180> size<00:02:19.690> of<00:02:19.930> my<00:02:20.019> hips

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
noticed it in is like my size of my hips

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.550 
noticed it in is like my size of my hips
and<00:02:20.590> how<00:02:20.800> they're<00:02:21.459> no<00:02:21.670> longer<00:02:21.879> like<00:02:22.239> this<00:02:23.170> and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
and how they're no longer like this and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.050 
and how they're no longer like this and
then<00:02:23.830> discs<00:02:24.099> they're<00:02:24.400> kind<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.700> more<00:02:24.849> just

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
then discs they're kind of more just

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.000 
then discs they're kind of more just
like<00:02:25.239> straight<00:02:25.989> if<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.410> makes<00:02:26.620> sense

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
like straight if that makes sense

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.559 
like straight if that makes sense
give<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.430> probably<00:02:27.730> another<00:02:27.880> two<00:02:28.120> months<00:02:28.269> and

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
give it probably another two months and

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.210 
give it probably another two months and
I<00:02:28.599> think<00:02:28.840> I'll<00:02:28.959> be<00:02:29.050> confident<00:02:29.470> enough<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.860> be

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
I think I'll be confident enough to be

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.920 
I think I'll be confident enough to be
like<00:02:30.340> oh<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.819> show<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.239> guys<00:02:31.420> my<00:02:31.599> body<00:02:31.780> on

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
for me I noticed a huge difference when

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.039 
for me I noticed a huge difference when
I<00:03:02.560> just<00:03:03.069> eat<00:03:03.579> really<00:03:03.880> well<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.569> know<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.750> don't

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
I just eat really well you know I don't

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.199 
I just eat really well you know I don't
have<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.410> exercise<00:03:05.650> but<00:03:06.099> in<00:03:06.220> saying<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.700> if<00:03:06.970> I

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
have to exercise but in saying that if I

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.240 
have to exercise but in saying that if I
exercise<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:08.200> way<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.560> probably<00:03:08.890> fall<00:03:09.220> off

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
exercise the way and probably fall off

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.430 
exercise the way and probably fall off
by<00:03:09.610> double<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.390> amount<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.049> is<00:03:11.170> something

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
by double the amount and it is something

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.259 
by double the amount and it is something

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
though like not that it tastes bad but

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.770 
though like not that it tastes bad but
it's<00:03:45.609> like<00:03:45.760> anything<00:03:46.180> if<00:03:46.329> you<00:03:46.450> ate<00:03:46.600> only

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
it's like anything if you ate only

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.020 
it's like anything if you ate only
apples<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.980> get<00:03:48.220> sick<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.459> apples<00:03:48.850> if<00:03:48.940> you

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
apples you get sick of apples if you

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.699 
apples you get sick of apples if you
know<00:03:49.150> what<00:03:49.269> I'm<00:03:49.329> saying<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:49.930> yes<00:03:50.109> I<00:03:50.260> started

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
know what I'm saying so yes I started

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.650 
know what I'm saying so yes I started
out<00:03:50.829> like<00:03:51.340> basing<00:03:51.880> everything<00:03:52.030> around<00:03:52.480> this

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
out like basing everything around this

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.289 
out like basing everything around this
but<00:03:52.900> then<00:03:53.079> I<00:03:53.349> slowly<00:03:53.920> learned<00:03:54.250> that<00:03:54.489> like<00:03:54.670> this

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
but then I slowly learned that like this

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.789 
but then I slowly learned that like this
isn't<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.630> quick<00:03:55.810> fix<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.200> if<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.470> offer<00:03:56.650> a

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
isn't a quick fix and if you offer a

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.650 
isn't a quick fix and if you offer a
quick<00:03:57.069> fix<00:03:57.280> something<00:03:58.030> like<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:58.359> isn't

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
quick fix something like this isn't

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.089 
quick fix something like this isn't
going<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.840> work<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.290> if<00:03:59.349> it<00:03:59.470> does<00:03:59.620> you'll<00:03:59.920> like

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
going to work and if it does you'll like

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.530 
going to work and if it does you'll like
have<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.310> quick<00:04:00.549> fix<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:00.910> then<00:04:01.030> get<00:04:01.209> over<00:04:01.480> it

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
have a quick fix and then get over it

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.530 
have a quick fix and then get over it
but<00:04:01.930> taking<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:02.709> has<00:04:03.099> definitely<00:04:03.639> motivated

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
but taking this has definitely motivated

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.900 
but taking this has definitely motivated
me<00:04:05.139> to<00:04:05.169> keep<00:04:05.769> eating<00:04:06.220> better<00:04:06.459> if<00:04:06.700> you<00:04:06.819> know

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
me to keep eating better if you know

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.640 
me to keep eating better if you know

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
what I'm saying so this is kind of like

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.280 
what I'm saying so this is kind of like
the<00:04:08.889> start<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:09.519> me<00:04:10.269> eating<00:04:10.720> good<00:04:10.900> or<00:04:11.109> whatever
