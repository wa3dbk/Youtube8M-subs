00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.840
 good hello in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.379
 teach how to make a paper pyramid 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.190
 they need a square sheet of 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.190
 any size 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.830
 I have to be square size 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.830
 well first we double this way 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.760
 okay 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.870
 we open and we bend in the same way 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.870
 but on the other side 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.970
 we have something like an X 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.970
 okay 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.190
 we started to fold 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.270
 A) Yes 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.990
 now we have to see a 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.990
 fletcher but without the back 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.990
 obviously 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.579
 ok this point 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.059
 this 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.059
 and up 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.550
 the other changes 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.820
 and with the other side we do the same 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:17.990
 because in itself this pyramid 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.990
 It's very good, well I'll keep it that way 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.880
 okay 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.720
 grab one side 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.720
 and bend this way 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.220
 A) Yes 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.890
 the relay equal 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.579
 and the back of the same form 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.060
 well we have here I made the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.530
 first part 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.310
 now 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.659
 we open 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.650
 A) Yes 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:08.740
 we doubled this point 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.740
 in this way that they stay like this 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.159
 and we put back 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.030
 we do the same with the other three sides 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.030
 what do we have left 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.930
 let's see 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.700
 okay 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.240
 almost 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.580
 good 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.790
 when they have already made the four 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.940
 tips stuck 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.150
 they will have something left 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.599
 A) Yes 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.880
 then he grabbed the ends and we started 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:09.560
 to speak in this way 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:14.209
 it is expanding and then the soft 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.319
 prisoner and that's it 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.319
 a paper pyramid 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.930
 thank you very much because I have it
