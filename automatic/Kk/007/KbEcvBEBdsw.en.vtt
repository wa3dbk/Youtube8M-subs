see back here
this<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.760> three-dimensional<00:02:12.540> here<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:12.930> yeah<00:02:13.080> I

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
this is three-dimensional here so yeah I

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.990 
this is three-dimensional here so yeah I
would<00:02:13.349> cut<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.709> out

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
would cut this out

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.320
