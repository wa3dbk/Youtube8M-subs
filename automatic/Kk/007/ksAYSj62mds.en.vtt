have<00:00:57.329> my<00:00:57.480> fog<00:00:57.750> lamps<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.350> my<00:00:58.649> corner<00:00:59.100> lights<00:00:59.280> on

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
have my fog lamps on my corner lights on

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.200 
have my fog lamps on my corner lights on
and<00:00:59.789> my<00:01:00.030> halos<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.500> low<00:01:01.680> beams<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.250> I

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and my halos on not the low beams and I

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.700 
and my halos on not the low beams and I
also<00:01:03.390> think<00:01:03.840> it'd<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:03.960> pretty<00:01:04.140> cool<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.530> have

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
also think it'd be pretty cool to have

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.280 
also think it'd be pretty cool to have
fog<00:01:05.189> lights<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> high<00:01:06.000> beams<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.960> I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
fog lights on with the high beams so I

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.200 
fog lights on with the high beams so I
should<00:01:08.159> start<00:01:08.369> out<00:01:08.490> by<00:01:08.640> saying<00:01:08.850> every

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
should start out by saying every

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.260 
should start out by saying every
Explorer<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.930> kind<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> different<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.760> my

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
Explorer is kind of different in like my

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.410 
Explorer is kind of different in like my
limited<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> most<00:01:13.020> common<00:01:13.470> way<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> is

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
limited the most common way to do it is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.600

there is normally on most explorers I've
seen<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> square<00:01:47.759> relay<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:50.340> box

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
seen you see a square relay here a box

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.179 
seen you see a square relay here a box
another<00:01:51.689> square<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.320> relay<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.100> then

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
another square like relay here and then

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.700 
another square like relay here and then
a<00:01:53.220> box<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.820> two<00:01:54.119> separate<00:01:54.930> relays<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.500> this

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
a box of two separate relays like this

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.289 
a box of two separate relays like this
one<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.009> yeah<00:01:56.100> there's<00:01:56.310> two<00:01:56.490> separate<00:01:56.850> ones<00:01:57.030> if

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
on your right is the fog lamp isolation

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.990 
on your right is the fog lamp isolation
relay<00:02:04.259> which<00:02:04.740> makes<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.159> fog<00:02:05.340> lights<00:02:05.579> go<00:02:05.790> off

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
relay which makes the fog lights go off

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.969 
relay which makes the fog lights go off
when<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.360> high<00:02:06.509> beams<00:02:06.719> come<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.439> that

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
when your high beams come on in that

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.100 
when your high beams come on in that
case<00:02:08.310> all<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.239> want<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.899> want<00:02:10.050> to

and break off one of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.070 
and break off one of
three<00:02:14.280> little<00:02:14.550> tabs<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.270> row<00:02:15.450> either<00:02:15.660> out

it<00:02:18.660> back<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.870> there<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.740> way<00:02:19.920> your<00:02:20.070> fog

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
it back in there that way your fog

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.160 
it back in there that way your fog
lights<00:02:20.340> won't<00:02:20.850> go<00:02:21.000> off<00:02:21.240> when<00:02:21.660> your<00:02:21.780> parking

lights come on or your high beams come
on<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:24.990> they<00:02:25.110> will<00:02:25.350> go<00:02:25.500> off<00:02:25.710> if<00:02:25.890> your

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
on but they will go off if your

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.620 
on but they will go off if your
headlights<00:02:26.460> are<00:02:26.640> off<00:02:26.760> that's<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.360> cool<00:02:27.600> thing

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630

headlights are off that's the cool thing
about<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.200> now<00:02:28.890> some<00:02:29.760> explorers<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.390> think

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
about this now some explorers I think

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.720 
about this now some explorers I think
they're<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.080> newer<00:02:31.290> ones<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.770> 99<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.580> up

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
they're the newer ones like 99 and up

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.690 
they're the newer ones like 99 and up
have<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.540> fog<00:02:33.750> lamp<00:02:34.050> relay<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:35.370> power

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
have the fog lamp relay in this power

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.230 
have the fog lamp relay in this power
box<00:02:36.060> over<00:02:36.450> here<00:02:36.780> by<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.320> brake<00:02:37.920> booster<00:02:38.370> which

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
box over here by the brake booster which

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.500 
box over here by the brake booster which
is<00:02:39.450> normally<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> little<00:02:40.500> bit<00:02:40.620> bigger<00:02:41.240> but<00:02:42.240> in

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
is normally a little bit bigger but in

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.150 
is normally a little bit bigger but in
my<00:02:42.690> Explorer<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.380> one's<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> little<00:02:43.770> smaller

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
my Explorer this one's a little smaller

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.790 
my Explorer this one's a little smaller
because<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:45.060> an<00:02:45.300> auxilary<00:02:45.870> relay<00:02:46.410> box

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
because I have an auxilary relay box

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.760 
because I have an auxilary relay box
number<00:02:47.220> one<00:02:47.490> right<00:02:48.150> here<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.870> now<00:02:49.440> if<00:02:49.590> you're

if you go into your Explorer and you

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.270 
if you go into your Explorer and you
look<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:53.280> see<00:02:53.640> our<00:02:54.630> two<00:02:55.620> relays<00:02:55.980> up

look in it and you see our two relays up
top<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.910> one<00:02:57.330> big<00:02:57.600> relay<00:02:57.959> here<00:02:58.670> don't<00:02:59.670> get<00:02:59.820> me

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
top and one big relay here don't get me

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.540 
top and one big relay here don't get me
wrong<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.630> glanced<00:03:01.500> at<00:03:01.620> glanced<00:03:02.310> at<00:03:02.430> the

is<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.489> rear<00:03:21.060> wiper<00:03:21.600> motor<00:03:22.470> relay<00:03:23.239> so<00:03:24.239> um<00:03:24.799> we

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
is the rear wiper motor relay so um we

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.560 
is the rear wiper motor relay so um we
can't<00:03:26.100> take<00:03:26.340> up<00:03:26.519> any<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.910> these<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.269> break<00:03:27.420> the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
can't take up any of these and break the

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.270 
can't take up any of these and break the
tabs<00:03:27.810> off<00:03:28.080> because<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.560> won't<00:03:28.769> work<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.160> we

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
tabs off because it won't work and we

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.800 
tabs off because it won't work and we
only<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.580> one<00:03:29.610> related<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.360> fog<00:03:30.540> lights

little bit I just took it and ripped it

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.160 
little bit I just took it and ripped it
down<00:04:08.910> because<00:04:09.239> I'm<00:04:09.330> gonna<00:04:09.420> wrap<00:04:09.660> electrical

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
down because I'm gonna wrap electrical

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.630 
down because I'm gonna wrap electrical
tape<00:04:10.350> around<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.739> when<00:04:10.890> I'm<00:04:10.980> all<00:04:11.100> done<00:04:11.130> or

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
these lights and you're going to want to

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.719 
these lights and you're going to want to
splice<00:05:42.030> into<00:05:42.419> it<00:05:42.570> with<00:05:43.169> that<00:05:43.409> blue<00:05:43.830> wire<00:05:44.070> that

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
splice into it with that blue wire that

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.350 
splice into it with that blue wire that
way<00:05:45.800> because<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:46.919> blue<00:05:47.099> wire<00:05:47.340> is<00:05:47.639> the<00:05:48.150> wire

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
way because the blue wire is the wire

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.689 
way because the blue wire is the wire
that<00:05:48.389> runs<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.469> the<00:05:49.500> headlights<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.310> tell<00:05:50.520> the

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
that runs to the headlights to tell the

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.270 
that runs to the headlights to tell the
relay<00:05:51.199> for<00:05:52.199> the<00:05:52.289> fog<00:05:52.500> lights<00:05:52.770> when<00:05:52.949> the<00:05:53.070> low

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
relay for the fog lights when the low

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.040 
relay for the fog lights when the low
beams<00:05:53.520> are<00:05:53.729> on<00:05:53.849> so<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.210> fog<00:05:54.389> lights<00:05:54.659> can<00:05:54.870> come

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
beams are on so the fog lights can come

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.170 
beams are on so the fog lights can come
on<00:05:55.169> but<00:05:55.620> when<00:05:55.740> you<00:05:55.830> flip<00:05:56.009> to<00:05:56.190> high<00:05:56.370> beam<00:05:56.669> the

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
on but when you flip to high beam the

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.240 
on but when you flip to high beam the
relay<00:05:57.569> doesn't<00:05:58.289> work<00:05:58.500> because<00:05:58.710> there's<00:05:59.069> no

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
relay doesn't work because there's no

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.820 
relay doesn't work because there's no
power<00:05:59.610> going<00:05:59.940> to<00:06:00.060> it<00:06:00.240> so<00:06:00.960> if<00:06:01.259> we<00:06:01.409> turn<00:06:01.590> it<00:06:01.740> to

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
power going to it so if we turn it to

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.040 
power going to it so if we turn it to
the<00:06:01.919> corner<00:06:02.400> lights<00:06:02.699> as<00:06:02.969> in<00:06:03.539> your<00:06:03.659> parking
