hey everyone it's Jordan from JB Fitch
90<00:00:03.060> reptiles<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.830> in<00:00:04.830> this<00:00:04.950> video<00:00:05.220> I'm<00:00:05.310> going

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
90 reptiles and in this video I'm going

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.059 
90 reptiles and in this video I'm going
to<00:00:05.520> do<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.640> quick<00:00:05.910> review<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:07.080> Cascade

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
to do a quick review of the Cascade

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:31.760 
to do a quick review of the Cascade
internal<00:00:08.849> filter<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:10.320> 300<00:00:10.889> series

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.910 

so<00:00:32.770> this<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.309> packaging<00:00:33.850> for<00:00:34.059> it<00:00:34.239> and<00:00:34.960> these

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
so this the packaging for it and these

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.160 
so this the packaging for it and these
instructions<00:00:36.430> and<00:00:36.790> everything<00:00:37.150> on<00:00:37.420> different

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
instructions and everything on different

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.640 
instructions and everything on different
ways<00:00:38.260> you<00:00:38.350> can<00:00:38.440> use<00:00:38.500> it<00:00:38.590> for<00:00:39.150> and<00:00:40.200> anyways<00:00:41.200> so

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
ways you can use it for and anyways so

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.850 
ways you can use it for and anyways so
this<00:00:42.340> filter<00:00:42.640> is<00:00:42.879> so<00:00:43.030> far<00:00:43.269> is<00:00:43.480> a<00:00:44.170> really<00:00:44.739> good

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
this filter is so far is a really good

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.400 
this filter is so far is a really good
filter<00:00:45.190> it's<00:00:45.370> submersible<00:00:45.940> like<00:00:46.059> I<00:00:46.210> said<00:00:46.449> this

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
filter it's submersible like I said this

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.130 
filter it's submersible like I said this
is<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.650> 300<00:00:48.010> series<00:00:48.190> so<00:00:48.550> it's<00:00:48.699> it's<00:00:49.000> only<00:00:49.140> that

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
is the 300 series so it's it's only that

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.850 
is the 300 series so it's it's only that
big<00:00:50.410> from<00:00:50.710> them<00:00:51.430> they're<00:00:51.730> top<00:00:52.030> there<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.860> what

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
big from them they're top there and what

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.430 
big from them they're top there and what
I<00:00:53.890> really<00:00:54.129> like<00:00:54.250> about<00:00:54.309> this<00:00:55.290> filter<00:00:56.290> in

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
I really like about this filter in

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.160 
I really like about this filter in
particular<00:00:56.949> is<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.670> um<00:00:58.120> you<00:00:58.899> can<00:00:59.050> either

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
particular is that um you can either

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.279 
particular is that um you can either
either<00:00:59.620> have<00:00:59.890> this<00:01:00.850> hose<00:01:01.149> right<00:01:01.329> here<00:01:01.690> which

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
either have this hose right here which

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.079 
either have this hose right here which
is<00:01:02.469> the<00:01:02.590> one<00:01:02.710> that<00:01:02.829> my<00:01:03.280> sister<00:01:03.579> put<00:01:03.760> on<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.030> I

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
is the one that my sister put on and I

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.120 
is the one that my sister put on and I
recommend<00:01:04.539> it<00:01:04.780> you<00:01:04.960> should<00:01:05.140> put<00:01:05.379> on<00:01:05.410> because<00:01:05.890> I

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
recommend it you should put on because I

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.219 
recommend it you should put on because I
like<00:01:07.119> a<00:01:07.149> little<00:01:07.300> bit<00:01:07.509> better<00:01:07.690> it's<00:01:07.960> kind<00:01:08.140> of

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
like a little bit better it's kind of

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.540 
like a little bit better it's kind of
like<00:01:08.320> our<00:01:08.470> filter<00:01:08.800> downstairs<00:01:09.220> it<00:01:09.399> works

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
like our filter downstairs it works

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.570 
like our filter downstairs it works
really<00:01:09.700> good<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.500> or<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.860> can<00:01:12.009> put<00:01:12.220> on<00:01:12.340> like

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
really good and or you can put on like

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.460 
really good and or you can put on like
little<00:01:12.700> air<00:01:12.970> tube<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.600> sort<00:01:13.869> of<00:01:13.960> have<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.259> just

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
little air tube and sort of have it just

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.490 
little air tube and sort of have it just
do<00:01:14.649> sort<00:01:15.009> of<00:01:15.750> almost<00:01:16.750> more<00:01:16.990> like<00:01:17.020> a<00:01:17.170> bubbler

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
do sort of almost more like a bubbler

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.440 
do sort of almost more like a bubbler
sort<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.830> thing<00:01:18.009> but<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.700> said<00:01:19.149> you<00:01:19.210> should<00:01:19.360> do

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
sort of thing but I said you should do

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.910 
sort of thing but I said you should do
go<00:01:19.690> for<00:01:19.930> more<00:01:20.050> of<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.229> filter<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.649> like<00:01:20.770> have

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
go for more of the filter and like have

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.279 
go for more of the filter and like have
a<00:01:20.950> stream<00:01:21.310> up<00:01:21.430> top<00:01:21.610> so<00:01:21.850> by<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.869> way<00:01:22.990> this<00:01:23.110> is<00:01:23.259> a

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
a stream up top so by the way this is a

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.350 
a stream up top so by the way this is a
five<00:01:23.800> gallon<00:01:23.950> fish<00:01:24.280> tank<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.910> right<00:01:25.119> now<00:01:25.240> she

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
five gallon fish tank and right now she

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.680 
five gallon fish tank and right now she
has<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:27.520> little<00:01:27.670> dwarf<00:01:28.030> aquatic<00:01:28.330> frog<00:01:28.539> in

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
has one little dwarf aquatic frog in

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.450 
has one little dwarf aquatic frog in
there<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.020> then<00:01:29.170> if<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:29.890> day<00:01:29.979> she's<00:01:30.190> getting

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
there and then if you day she's getting

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.149 
there and then if you day she's getting
a<00:01:30.610> snail<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.689> a<00:01:31.930> couple<00:01:32.170> neon<00:01:32.500> tetras<00:01:32.920> that's

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
a snail and a couple neon tetras that's

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.390 
a snail and a couple neon tetras that's
why<00:01:33.340> we<00:01:33.520> have<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.960> heater<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.920> filter<00:01:36.340> in

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
why we have the heater and the filter in

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.760 
why we have the heater and the filter in
there<00:01:36.549> so<00:01:37.540> what's<00:01:37.840> really<00:01:37.960> neat<00:01:38.259> about<00:01:38.439> this

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
there so what's really neat about this

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.600 
there so what's really neat about this
filter<00:01:39.220> is<00:01:39.400> also<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:41.049> it's<00:01:41.829> really<00:01:42.189> easy<00:01:42.460> to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
filter is also that it's really easy to

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.960 
filter is also that it's really easy to
replace<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.509> carbon<00:01:44.110> as<00:01:44.350> well<00:01:44.590> as<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:45.100> actual

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
replace the carbon as well as the actual

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.420 
replace the carbon as well as the actual
um<00:01:47.640> what's<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.790> word<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.119> actual<00:01:49.540> foam<00:01:50.430> sort

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
um what's the word the actual foam sort

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.999 
um what's the word the actual foam sort
of<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.579> foam<00:01:51.759> part<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.380> basically<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.979> just

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
of the foam part and basically it just

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.350 
of the foam part and basically it just
comes<00:01:54.579> in<00:01:54.820> two<00:01:55.060> parts<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.790> there<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:59.040> this

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
comes in two parts so there is this

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.480 
comes in two parts so there is this
sponge<00:02:01.360> part<00:02:01.689> right<00:02:01.840> here<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.320> then<00:02:03.189> there's

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
sponge part right here and then there's

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.969 
sponge part right here and then there's
the<00:02:03.700> carbon<00:02:04.090> up<00:02:04.210> there<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.740> just

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
the carbon up there and it just

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.850 
the carbon up there and it just
connected<00:02:06.820> in<00:02:06.939> like<00:02:07.090> three<00:02:07.329> things<00:02:07.630> so<00:02:07.990> if<00:02:08.320> you

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
connected in like three things so if you

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.449 
connected in like three things so if you
see<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.390> right<00:02:10.390> in<00:02:10.540> there<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:11.410> sort<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.340> like

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
see it right in there the sort of like

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.920 
see it right in there the sort of like
the<00:02:12.579> blue<00:02:12.820> part<00:02:13.239> I<00:02:13.450> don't<00:02:13.570> know<00:02:13.690> if<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.810> can

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
the blue part I don't know if you can

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.800 
the blue part I don't know if you can
see<00:02:15.780> hold<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:18.600> right<00:02:19.600> here<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:21.100> carbon<00:02:21.400> is

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
see hold on so right here the carbon is

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.270 
see hold on so right here the carbon is
there<00:02:22.810> sort<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.290> sponges<00:02:23.739> right<00:02:23.769> here

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
there sort of sponges right here

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.690 
there sort of sponges right here
and<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.820> carbon<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.209> up<00:02:25.360> there<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:26.700> this

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
and the carbon is up there and this this

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.360 
and the carbon is up there and this this
part<00:02:28.000> comes<00:02:28.239> down<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.590> detaches<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.220> guess

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
part comes down so it detaches I guess

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.670 
part comes down so it detaches I guess
you<00:02:30.459> could<00:02:30.579> say<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.360> it's<00:02:31.630> easy<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.200> just

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
you could say so it's easy to just

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.759 
you could say so it's easy to just
refill<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.310> with<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.510> carbon<00:02:34.930> we<00:02:35.350> replace<00:02:35.739> it

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
refill and with the carbon we replace it

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.550 
refill and with the carbon we replace it
every<00:02:36.310> month<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.699> with<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.930> sponge<00:02:38.320> we

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
every month and with the sponge we

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.960 
every month and with the sponge we
replaced<00:02:39.040> every<00:02:39.250> six<00:02:39.459> months

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
replaced every six months

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.270 
replaced every six months
so<00:02:40.060> what<00:02:40.300> we<00:02:40.420> rinse<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.960> every<00:02:41.170> month<00:02:41.380> as<00:02:41.740> well

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
so what we rinse it every month as well

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.140 
so what we rinse it every month as well
so<00:02:43.560> go<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.770> get<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.280> it's<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.970> tiny

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
so go and get that it's just a tiny

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.960 
so go and get that it's just a tiny
little<00:02:46.300> filter<00:02:47.400> submersible<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.610> said<00:02:48.820> so

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
little filter submersible like I said so

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.220 
little filter submersible like I said so
it's<00:02:49.090> great<00:02:49.210> for<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.420> tank<00:02:49.630> like<00:02:49.810> this<00:02:49.990> where
