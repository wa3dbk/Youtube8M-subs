00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.960
 thank you for joining me good that you 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.960
 I can comment on the rainy season 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.150
 continue here in japan the rain is a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.080
 of the things that I do not like so much about 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.380
 live here and mention the typhoons 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.300
 we will have one that approaches Japan and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 probably the week comes around 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.210
 that goes in but good enough about the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.180
 weather today is July 7 here in japan and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.910

 the video today if I can and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.020
 the reason why I decided to comment on it is 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.960
 because many of my colleagues in 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.840
 work they have reminded me about this day 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.530
 they told me what you do not know is the day 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.390
 today is July 7 is the robe and I 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.000
 they asked that is the story he is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.350
 the robe and how are you so excited about 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.470
 tell me the story 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.259
 that they do to me, I told them not to 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.390
 They eat them and they started telling me 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.130
 the today they told me how 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.890
 four times 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.860
 so I'm going to take the opportunity to tell you 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.750
 probably a lot of you already know the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.789
 know but I do not want to let the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.549
 opportunity I'm going to simplify the 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.500
 story if you want to know more about this 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.710
 I invite you to check it in the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.210
 internet since there are different versions 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.460
 and according to the area of ​​the stories 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.140
 they are told in different ways I 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.659
 I will tell you what I have been told 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.020
 good tells the story that the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.750
 Princess Orihime and Kiko Bossi were 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.409
 separated by the father of the princess and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.630
 the ham ogawa river separated them and only 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.140
 they were allowed to meet once a year 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.849
 on July 7 but could not meet 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.509
 because there was no bridge that 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:02:00.149
 let cross a flock of magpies 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.819
 He offered to build a bridge with his 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.950
 fairies so that everyone could enjoy and 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.369
 get together 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.920
 but if it rains on the day of the navata 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.610
 magpies can not go to build the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.560
 bridge and orihime and cobos and you can not 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.019
 see and they will have to wait until the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.530
 next year and that's mainly the 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.870
 history 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.080

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.300

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.450
 the bamboo branches with pieces of paper 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.150
 in which they write wishes and in other 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.610
 areas one is done in different things the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.739
 of bamboo branches is the sign that the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.989
