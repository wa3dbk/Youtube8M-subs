00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.760 
experiment yet but here I have a some
hot<00:00:53.969> water<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.360> some<00:00:54.690> tin<00:00:54.899> foil<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:57.000> glass

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770

water here to add mmm now I'm going to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.000 
water here to add mmm now I'm going to
add<00:01:04.970> just<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.150> add<00:01:06.270> baking<00:01:06.780> soda<00:01:09.799> not<00:01:10.799> much

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
add just to add baking soda not much

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:20.430 
add just to add baking soda not much
doubt<00:01:11.960> gonna<00:01:12.960> add<00:01:13.080> salt<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.470> much<00:01:15.020> salt

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.280 

and<00:01:21.790> some<00:01:22.790> boiling<00:01:23.060> water<00:01:23.120> just<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.990> keep<00:01:24.110> it

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
and some boiling water just to keep it

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.940 
and some boiling water just to keep it
nice<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.470> hot<00:01:26.050> heat<00:01:27.050> tends<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.590> speed<00:01:27.830> up

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
nice and hot heat tends to speed up

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.930 
nice and hot heat tends to speed up
chemical<00:01:28.130> reactions<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:30.700> supposedly<00:01:31.700> all

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
chemical reactions and supposedly all

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.520 
chemical reactions and supposedly all
you<00:01:32.060> do<00:01:32.210> is<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.510> drop<00:01:32.690> it<00:01:32.900> in<00:01:32.990> there<00:01:33.170> on<00:01:33.380> the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
you do is you drop it in there on the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.480 
you do is you drop it in there on the
tin<00:01:33.740> foil<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:35.210> tarnish<00:01:35.510> goes<00:01:35.690> away<00:01:36.490> so

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
tin foil and the tarnish goes away so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.300 
tin foil and the tarnish goes away so
let's<00:01:37.729> have<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.910> look<00:01:38.060> here<00:01:38.270> what<00:01:38.420> we've<00:01:38.509> got

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
let's have a look here what we've got

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:49.650 
let's have a look here what we've got
this<00:01:40.310> piece<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:40.990> absolutely<00:01:41.990> foul<00:01:43.119> okay<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:47.830> I

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
this piece is absolutely foul okay and I

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.680 
this piece is absolutely foul okay and I
don't<00:01:50.660> see<00:01:50.810> anything<00:01:51.020> oh<00:01:55.390> it's<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.450> little

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
don't see anything oh it's a little

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.290 
don't see anything oh it's a little
lighter<00:01:56.840> looking<00:01:57.140> at<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:57.350> was<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:58.119> think<00:01:59.119> the

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
lighter looking at it was I think the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.330 
lighter looking at it was I think the
problem<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.780> it's<00:01:59.930> got<00:02:00.410> a<00:02:00.440> lot<00:02:00.619> of<00:02:00.649> dirt<00:02:00.950> on<00:02:01.160> it

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
problem is it's got a lot of dirt on it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.880 
problem is it's got a lot of dirt on it
as<00:02:01.460> well<00:02:01.640> as<00:02:02.200> tarnish<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.380> won't<00:02:03.530> take<00:02:03.770> the

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
as well as tarnish it won't take the

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.529 
as well as tarnish it won't take the
dirt<00:02:04.070> off<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.430> can<00:02:04.580> rub<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.910> dirt<00:02:05.060> off<00:02:05.210> or<00:02:05.390> use

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
dirt off you can rub the dirt off or use

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.740 
dirt off you can rub the dirt off or use
soap<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:07.300> just<00:02:08.300> rub<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.539> between<00:02:08.600> your

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
soap and just rub it between your

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.070 
soap and just rub it between your
fingers<00:02:09.519> but<00:02:10.519> it<00:02:11.420> does<00:02:11.600> look<00:02:11.780> like<00:02:11.900> the

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
fingers but it does look like the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.530 
fingers but it does look like the
tarnish<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.560> gone<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:13.730> was<00:02:13.910> quite<00:02:14.209> badly

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
tarnished now it is just a piece of

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.039 
tarnished now it is just a piece of
dirty<00:02:19.250> silver<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:26.390> can<00:02:26.510> still<00:02:26.750> see<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:26.989> it's

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049
