make it transfer all the vibration down
through<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.220> body<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.670> voicing<00:02:31.660> some

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
through to the body and voicing some

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.830 
through to the body and voicing some
other<00:02:32.080> things<00:02:32.410> some<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.340> which<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.840> understand

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
other things some of which I understand

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.320 
other things some of which I understand
and<00:02:35.050> some<00:02:35.350> don't<00:02:35.950> but<00:02:36.160> probably<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.030> two

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
and some don't but probably the two

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.970 
and some don't but probably the two
biggest<00:02:37.570> things<00:02:38.020> I've<00:02:38.200> noticed<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:38.740> far<00:02:38.890> as

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
biggest things I've noticed as far as

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.380 
biggest things I've noticed as far as
playability<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.850> this<00:02:40.600> hand<00:02:40.870> shaped<00:02:41.140> neck<00:02:41.410> is

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
playability is this hand shaped neck is

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.800 
playability is this hand shaped neck is
a<00:02:43.390> lot<00:02:44.260> flatter<00:02:44.650> here<00:02:45.160> than<00:02:45.370> I'm<00:02:45.490> used<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.810> then

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
a lot flatter here than I'm used to then

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.780 
a lot flatter here than I'm used to then
other<00:02:46.990> ukuleles<00:02:47.530> I've<00:02:47.770> played<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.490> ones<00:02:48.640> I

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
other ukuleles I've played the ones I

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.340 
other ukuleles I've played the ones I
own<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.360> ones<00:02:49.510> I've<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:49.900> played<00:02:50.200> with

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
own and the ones I've just played with

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.530 
own and the ones I've just played with
and<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.590> stays<00:02:50.860> flatter<00:02:51.370> for<00:02:51.760> longer<00:02:52.240> so

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
and it stays flatter for longer so

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.660 
and it stays flatter for longer so
before<00:02:53.350> it<00:02:53.410> starts<00:02:53.680> getting<00:02:53.740> large<00:02:54.160> here<00:02:54.490> by

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
before it starts getting large here by

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.160 
before it starts getting large here by
the<00:02:55.440> by<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.500> joint<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:58.510> result<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:58.990> you've

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
the by the joint so in result is you've

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.560 
the by the joint so in result is you've
got<00:02:59.520> if<00:03:00.520> you<00:03:00.670> play<00:03:00.880> like<00:03:01.060> me<00:03:01.270> with<00:03:01.450> the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
got if you play like me with the

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.260 
got if you play like me with the
invisible<00:03:01.750> thumb<00:03:02.230> behind<00:03:03.160> there<00:03:03.550> gives<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.180> a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
invisible thumb behind there gives you a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.960 
invisible thumb behind there gives you a
nice<00:03:04.450> good<00:03:04.720> platform<00:03:04.990> and<00:03:05.590> then<00:03:06.490> probably<00:03:06.760> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
nice good platform and then probably the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.850 
nice good platform and then probably the
biggest<00:03:07.150> feature<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.930> slight<00:03:08.380> radius

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
biggest feature is that slight radius

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.570 
biggest feature is that slight radius
they<00:03:09.820> put<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.270> fret<00:03:10.810> board<00:03:11.250> which<00:03:12.250> makes

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
they put on the fret board which makes

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.630 
they put on the fret board which makes
any<00:03:12.880> kind<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.210> barring<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.920> me<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.130> lot<00:03:15.280> easier

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
any kind of barring to me a lot easier

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.900 
any kind of barring to me a lot easier
on<00:03:15.730> some<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.090> my<00:03:16.120> other<00:03:16.210> hooks<00:03:16.570> if<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:17.910> you

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
on some of my other hooks if you you

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.540 
on some of my other hooks if you you
know<00:03:19.000> if<00:03:19.090> your<00:03:19.240> hand<00:03:19.770> if<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.950> crease<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.430> your

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
know if your hand if the crease and your

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.280 
know if your hand if the crease and your
finger<00:03:21.940> kind<00:03:22.120> of<00:03:22.270> lands<00:03:22.480> right<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.900> string

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
finger kind of lands right on a string

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.520 
finger kind of lands right on a string
it<00:03:24.250> kind<00:03:24.459> of<00:03:24.520> deadens<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.959> just<00:03:29.230> doesn't

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
it kind of deadens it that just doesn't

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.440 
it kind of deadens it that just doesn't
happen<00:03:29.680> on<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.100> one<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:33.760> wanted<00:03:34.300> a

some picking too so one of the first
things<00:05:24.290> I<00:05:24.470> noticed<00:05:24.890> just<00:05:25.100> besides<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.760> sound

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
things I noticed just besides the sound

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.840 
things I noticed just besides the sound
mmm<00:05:26.840> it's<00:05:27.229> sounding<00:05:27.620> very<00:05:28.130> good<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.640> this<00:05:28.729> is

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
mmm it's sounding very good and this is

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.370 
mmm it's sounding very good and this is
the<00:05:29.000> only<00:05:29.150> high-end<00:05:31.240> but<00:05:32.240> the<00:05:32.870> one<00:05:33.080> thing<00:05:33.290> I

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
the only high-end but the one thing I

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.990 
the only high-end but the one thing I
noticed<00:05:33.740> right<00:05:33.860> away<00:05:33.919> was<00:05:34.190> when<00:05:34.850> you're

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
noticed right away was when you're

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.110 
noticed right away was when you're
playing<00:05:35.240> higher<00:05:35.540> up<00:05:35.750> on<00:05:35.870> them<00:05:36.140> maybe<00:05:37.100> the<00:05:37.250> 1st

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
playing higher up on them maybe the 1st

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.650 
playing higher up on them maybe the 1st
and<00:05:38.270> 2nd<00:05:38.600> strings<00:05:38.660> and<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:40.520> C<00:05:40.729> is<00:05:40.880> open<00:05:41.090> when

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
and 2nd strings and the C is open when

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:49.690 
and 2nd strings and the C is open when
you're<00:05:41.780> strumming<00:05:42.200> like<00:05:42.500> that

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.450 

on<00:05:50.700> my<00:05:50.940> other<00:05:51.090> ones<00:05:51.390> that<00:05:51.750> opens<00:05:52.170> II<00:05:52.770> kind<00:05:53.340> of

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
on my other ones that opens II kind of

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.560 
on my other ones that opens II kind of
drones<00:05:53.910> and<00:05:55.280> drowns<00:05:56.280> out<00:05:56.640> the<00:05:56.700> rest<00:05:57.180> of<00:05:57.420> the

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
drones and drowns out the rest of the

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.450
