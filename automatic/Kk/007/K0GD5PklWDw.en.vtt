00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
decided to do it with this cuz we put it

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.490 
decided to do it with this cuz we put it
together<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.600> were<00:00:48.660> able<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> get<00:00:49.020> 100

together and we were able to get 100

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.990 
together and we were able to get 100
chemistry<00:00:49.770> which<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.039> guys<00:00:50.190> usually<00:00:50.460> beg<00:00:50.789> for

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
chemistry which you guys usually beg for

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.920 
chemistry which you guys usually beg for
cuz<00:00:51.149> you're<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.360> what's<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> point<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
cuz you're like what's the point of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.180 
cuz you're like what's the point of
making<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.289> team<00:00:52.440> unless<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.829> doesn't<00:00:52.860> under

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
chemistry so we're able to get it this

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.790 
chemistry so we're able to get it this
time<00:00:54.449> we're<00:00:55.140> gonna<00:00:55.199> take<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> look<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.739> the
