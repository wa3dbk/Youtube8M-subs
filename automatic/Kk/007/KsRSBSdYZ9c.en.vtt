00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.670
 hello how are I Oscar Oscar Acosta part 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.980
 of electronic corporation we are going to 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.330
 present you this application that nothing 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.750
 It is very practical for the industry 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.779
 We are using this airbox printer 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.120
 xb 2000 is an industrial printer of 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.160
 pretty easy to use that good in others 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.170
 videos we already explain here what 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.539
 we want to demonstrate is the use of this 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.580
 printer by means of only one 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.129
 keyboard in this case is a keyboard 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.770
 normal computer is pretty 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.500
 economic and is also using a 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.360
 scanner now these two devices the 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.730
 we connect directly to the printer 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.560
 which means we're not 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.560
 using any computer 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.820
 intermediate or to send the information 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.240
 and we can operate all the information 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.610
 directly in our printer we go 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.830
 to be an example right now we load 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.440
 a label and the only thing I have to 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.710
 give is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.020
 click on the skate button then ran my 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.750
 detector application and in this case it is a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.340
 example we are not going to put the name of 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.670
 Someone can not put us 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.789
 oscar gonzÃ¡lez enter let's be able to 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.500
 scan a code that in this case then 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.740
 here I have several codes as per 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.500
 example the code one can the amount 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.300
 of labels and repetitions 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.990
 and at that moment I can already have a 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.240
 label with the name the code the logo 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.490
 etcetera without the intervention of the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.650
 computer I will go back to 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.810
 repeat it 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.720
 let's put the name we're going to put the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.030
 pt name 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.870
 enter we scan our code 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.910
 and we give / 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.250
 this application is very useful for when 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.500
 We have a work station where 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.030
 we want to be printing 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.470
 presentations or just some 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.140
 data or repeated codes 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.120
 for more information do not hesitate 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.650
 connect with us or contact you 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.650
