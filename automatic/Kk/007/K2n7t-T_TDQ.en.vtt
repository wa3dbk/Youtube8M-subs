00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
 what 's up with friends of the internet 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.510
 to welcome back 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.839
 have first 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.200
 from the place 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.989
 youtube wants his still this summer 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.849
 own gaming platform start over 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.619
 25,000 games are on the side of one 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.930
 get your own category and a big one 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.970
 Of course , the focus is also live 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.619
 Streaming and the topic experiences 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.780
 To make even more beautiful is currently on 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.809
 Other features worked training in 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.699
 60 fps and the conversion of streams 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.530
 in videos that's nothing new 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.079
 but what else will be added is that 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.000
 each youtube or youtube stream but 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.949
 own link gets on the always the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.900
 the spectator knows the stream is white 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.670
 So click exactly on which link 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.589
 must to get to the stream as well 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.509
 to the chat function to be improved 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.680
 what is really needed because with so far 

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:58.920
 live streams or google 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.089
 Hangout was always like that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.159
 youtube deming is the name of the platform 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.290
 easy and should naturally occurs 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.119
 properly compete as I said 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.009
 this summer should be the page 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.799
 For the time being, however, the start is only possible 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.200
 in the usa and in the uk when 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.909
 And if she comes to Germany that 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.979
 is not known then push 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.140
 friday is a new song from casey 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.840
 Rebell appeared with in the video 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.020
 the good situation how the song finally is 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.020
 you 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.490
 his first line i am alone and if 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.439
 we go we are two of you you do 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.090
 me, I 'll turn you on 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.219
 believe me you take me to the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.810
 The understanding in these few days has been the 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.909
 Song already over three million times 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.380
 but clicked on whether the song is like that 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.390
 Well sold that we will be fine 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.429
 only in the charts see bistro year is 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.170
 something pretty commercial 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.149
 one certainly to certain target groups 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.340
 arrive pretty good again will be many 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.959
 Windows from the web community can do that 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.429
 song does not win so much what you do 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.280
 can also clearly say that is the 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.959
 text now not so blatant is actually 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.399
 He is totally banal, the video acts on 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.170
 me a little bit that somehow 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.340
 tried to install there again 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.810
 I think the story still has 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.940
 the pictures can tell better 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.410
 but they are really pretty 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.060
 if you are on it you will find that 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.739
 video course below in the video 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.810
 description and how do you like that 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.519
 first purely in the comments too 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.379
 Short is a new cooking channel on 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.510
 started youtube showing you how to 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.310
 just great cooking dishes 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.420
 jan tamtam calls itself this cool at 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.910
 the channel is not that any 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.190
 mongo chefs would like to show you 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.639
 how to cook cool, hip dishes 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.799
 on 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.150
 youtube cooks what i cooked 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.530
 also pretty cool is that 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.720
 I know the people who cook for you 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.790
 because there are good friends of mine for 1 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.519
 since the ministers of breaking unicorns 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.230
 and the felix of future and then is 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.079
 even the good fairy li with you 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.280
 one knows as event cook and 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.780
 cookbook author and thus is due 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.489
 So the profi in the house and who felix 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.109
 if the white man really has something 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.760
 but by saying that minister 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.810
 manages to cook without getting lost every time 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.280
 to cut off the hand 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.440
 I did not expect that and 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.849
 even on the camera are youtube was 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.340
 friends of mine and that is what they are 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.349
 keywords of keywords especially in the case of 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.639
 channel is it is a branded channel and 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.349
 powered by dicker what I personally 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.180
 It is very nice though it is 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.919
 branded channel is the youtube one 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.690
 really a lot of freedom left and this 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.280
 Freedoms make sure that 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.109
 youtube can really live it out 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.700
 and not be adjusted before the camera 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.319
 which I personally find extremely important 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.519
 I was recently invited to bring 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.410
 and I could make a picture of it like 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.359
 the production runs so close together 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.349
 made with melissa bacon hot dogs and 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.930
 they were really good 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.190
 although it was made by me there are 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.319
 actually bacon spices for pans 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.700
 taste very crazy 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.999
 everything with benches there are also away into the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.099
 pavement so now respectfully prefer mountain 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:44.700
 Thank god for the beautiful bacon 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.349
 we look forward to more of these good ones 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.999
 I really enjoy everything 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.159
 really cool and if this continues 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:51.900
 then the channel can be really big 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.280
 Incidentally, I approached Integrally 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.840
 I wondered if I have the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.430
 I can become a guest 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.569
 could make me a picture of the whole 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.379
 and therefore also good conscience 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.359
 say 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.400
 July channel fell really because of that 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.980
 if you buck it there have pure you 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.870
 link to the channel below in the video 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.260

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.989
 the veb video prize 2015 and first time 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.579
 this mtv was transmitted and mine 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.709
 Essen was the big one this year 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.359
 anyway, somehow everything actually has 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.130
 works quite well and I think so too 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.509
 that the gala really in the 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.370
 Contrary to last year's blatant 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.860
 has increased to the best video of the 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.020

 most personal app product ever 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.139
 should enrich the lives of its users 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.180
 and the apple ecosystem is a cool one 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.979
