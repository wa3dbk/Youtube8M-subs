I'll be posting it there with the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.630 
I'll be posting it there with the
evaluation<00:01:58.619> sheet<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.070> guys<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.460> look

evaluation sheet that you guys can look

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.910 
evaluation sheet that you guys can look
at<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.060> course<00:02:00.659> there's<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.320> lot<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.680> criteria

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
at of course there's a lot of criteria

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.789 
at of course there's a lot of criteria
as<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.430> guys<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.240> careful<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.810> when

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
as you guys have to be careful of when

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.070 
as you guys have to be careful of when
you're<00:02:05.159> working<00:02:05.490> on

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
you're working on

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.999 
you're working on
portfolio<00:02:06.680> such<00:02:07.040> an<00:02:07.160> ass<00:02:07.280> line<00:02:07.460> quality<00:02:08.000> and

Composition<00:02:10.009> whatever<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.510> one<00:02:11.900> thing<00:02:12.260> I

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
Composition whatever but one thing I

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.680 
Composition whatever but one thing I
want<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.920> all<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.190> keep<00:02:13.550> in<00:02:13.700> mind<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.240> the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
want you all to keep in mind is the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.750 
want you all to keep in mind is the
structure<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.770> course<00:02:15.950> if<00:02:16.160> you're<00:02:16.280> working<00:02:16.550> in

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
structure of course if you're working in

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.570 
structure of course if you're working in
animation<00:02:16.970> structures<00:02:18.190> one<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.370> most

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
animation structures one of the most

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.890 
animation structures one of the most
important<00:02:20.030> things<00:02:20.240> because<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.600> course<00:02:20.870> for

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
important things because of course for

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.570 
important things because of course for
example<00:02:21.320> if<00:02:21.380> you're<00:02:21.530> drawing<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.860> hand<00:02:22.160> you

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
example if you're drawing a hand you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.710 
example if you're drawing a hand you
have<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.790> know<00:02:23.150> what<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:23.450> going<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.630> look

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
have to know what it's going to look

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.780 
have to know what it's going to look
like<00:02:24.260> if<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:24.740> on<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.040> side<00:02:25.280> or<00:02:25.460> if<00:02:25.640> it's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
like if it's on the side or if it's

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.720 
like if it's on the side or if it's
moving<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.260> have<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.620> understand<00:02:28.460> the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
moving so you have to understand the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.120 
moving so you have to understand the
structure<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.330> have<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.630> show<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.170> as

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
structure and you have to show that as

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.880 
structure and you have to show that as
opposed<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:32.180> drawing<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:33.230> know<00:02:33.260> details

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
opposed to to drawing you know details

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.010 
opposed to to drawing you know details
or<00:02:34.250> shading<00:02:34.850> you're<00:02:35.120> you're<00:02:35.480> enjoying<00:02:35.870> too

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
or shading you're you're enjoying too

or shading you're you're enjoying too
much<00:02:36.170> Michelle<00:02:36.680> will<00:02:36.830> say<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.220> you'll<00:02:37.700> see

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
much Michelle will say it you'll see

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.000 
much Michelle will say it you'll see
it's<00:02:39.380> not<00:02:40.310> relevant<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.540> shade<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.680> drawing

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
it's not relevant to shade the drawing

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.410 
it's not relevant to shade the drawing
as<00:02:43.160> much<00:02:43.400> as<00:02:43.580> showing<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.000> actual

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
as much as showing the actual

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.090 
as much as showing the actual
understanding<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.440> structure<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:45.980> you

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
understanding of the structure that you

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.750 
understanding of the structure that you
may<00:02:46.220> have<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:48.800> next<00:02:49.040> subject<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.520> want<00:02:49.700> to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
may have the next subject I want to

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.550 
may have the next subject I want to
tackle<00:02:49.970> is<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> bit<00:02:50.780> weird<00:02:50.990> to<00:02:51.170> me<00:02:51.320> but

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
tackle is a bit weird to me but

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.699 
tackle is a bit weird to me but
apparently<00:02:52.190> it's<00:02:52.730> been<00:02:53.600> recurring<00:02:53.990> in<00:02:54.500> the

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
apparently it's been recurring in the

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.090 
apparently it's been recurring in the
fall<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.540> previous<00:02:56.540> years<00:02:56.840> some<00:02:57.709> teachers

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
fall and previous years some teachers

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.910 
fall and previous years some teachers
wanted<00:02:58.370> me<00:02:58.490> to<00:02:58.520> talk<00:02:58.970> about<00:02:59.240> plagiarism

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
wanted me to talk about plagiarism

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.910 
wanted me to talk about plagiarism
apparently<00:03:00.920> some<00:03:01.700> people<00:03:02.410> plagiarize<00:03:03.410> their

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
apparently some people plagiarize their

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.860 
apparently some people plagiarize their
portfolios<00:03:04.459> or<00:03:04.610> even<00:03:04.940> buy<00:03:05.150> their<00:03:05.360> portfolio

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
portfolios or even buy their portfolio

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.610 
portfolios or even buy their portfolio
which<00:03:06.560> i<00:03:06.740> think<00:03:06.800> is<00:03:07.130> just<00:03:08.320> ridiculous<00:03:09.320> really

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
which i think is just ridiculous really

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.979 
which i think is just ridiculous really
it<00:03:10.190> has<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.519> do<00:03:10.640> with<00:03:10.670> integrity<00:03:11.090> partly<00:03:11.750> but

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
it has to do with integrity partly but

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.380 
it has to do with integrity partly but
also<00:03:12.470> if<00:03:12.739> you're<00:03:13.010> applying<00:03:13.730> for<00:03:13.910> this<00:03:14.180> program

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
also if you're applying for this program

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.350 
also if you're applying for this program
you'll<00:03:14.810> see<00:03:15.080> that<00:03:15.670> you'll<00:03:16.670> have<00:03:16.940> to<00:03:17.090> do<00:03:17.209> the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
you'll see that you'll have to do the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.290 
you'll see that you'll have to do the
portfolio<00:03:17.840> over<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.260> over<00:03:18.500> again<00:03:18.620> it's<00:03:19.300> you

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
portfolio over and over again it's you

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.360 
portfolio over and over again it's you
have<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.690> design<00:03:21.350> characters<00:03:21.860> all<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.100> time

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
have to design characters all the time

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.020 
have to design characters all the time
you<00:03:22.580> have<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.940> draw<00:03:23.360> backgrounds<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.050> have<00:03:24.260> to

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
you have to draw backgrounds you have to

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.180 
you have to draw backgrounds you have to
do<00:03:26.030> all<00:03:26.360> of<00:03:26.390> that<00:03:26.780> if<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.350> don't<00:03:27.620> think<00:03:27.860> if

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
do all of that if you don't think if

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.890 
do all of that if you don't think if
you're<00:03:28.400> not<00:03:28.550> even<00:03:28.790> able<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.120> do<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.450> portfolio

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
you're not even able to do the portfolio

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.479 
you're not even able to do the portfolio
honestly<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.380> might<00:03:30.560> not<00:03:31.280> be<00:03:31.820> suited<00:03:32.239> for<00:03:32.600> a

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
honestly you might not be suited for a

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.580 
honestly you might not be suited for a
the<00:03:34.489> program<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:35.030> animation<00:03:35.570> so<00:03:35.600> that's<00:03:36.410> just

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the program of animation so that's just

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.560 
the program of animation so that's just
one<00:03:37.100> thing<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:37.370> think<00:03:37.880> it<00:03:38.150> kind<00:03:38.360> of<00:03:38.390> goes<00:03:38.540> with

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
one thing I think it kind of goes with

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.390 
one thing I think it kind of goes with
the<00:03:38.840> logic<00:03:39.170> but<00:03:39.290> they've<00:03:39.620> had<00:03:39.830> it<00:03:39.980> in<00:03:40.070> previous

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
the logic but they've had it in previous

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.650 
the logic but they've had it in previous
years<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.790> they're<00:03:40.940> really<00:03:41.180> careful<00:03:41.540> with

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
years and they're really careful with

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.650 
years and they're really careful with
that<00:03:41.840> now<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:42.290> I'm<00:03:42.830> telling<00:03:43.220> you<00:03:43.400> guys<00:03:43.660> you

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
that now so I'm telling you guys you

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.660 
that now so I'm telling you guys you
might<00:03:44.989> be<00:03:45.140> influenced<00:03:45.800> by<00:03:45.950> an<00:03:46.100> artist<00:03:46.489> or

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
might be influenced by an artist or

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.210 
might be influenced by an artist or
something<00:03:46.820> and<00:03:47.300> that's<00:03:47.959> good<00:03:48.260> but<00:03:48.709> just<00:03:48.739> be

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
something and that's good but just be

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.640 
something and that's good but just be
careful<00:03:49.610> not<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.820> plagiarize<00:03:50.209> either<00:03:50.870> because

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
careful not to plagiarize either because

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.050 
careful not to plagiarize either because
sometimes<00:03:52.010> it's<00:03:52.220> not<00:03:52.400> necessarily

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
sometimes it's not necessarily

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.690 
sometimes it's not necessarily
intentional<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.900> understand<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.700> well

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
intentional and I understand that well

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.000 
intentional and I understand that well
see<00:03:55.880> in<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.060> next<00:03:56.180> video<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:56.810> actually<00:03:56.989> did<00:03:57.530> a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
see in the next video I actually did a

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.220 
see in the next video I actually did a
character<00:03:58.640> that<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.030> put<00:03:59.330> later<00:03:59.690> on<00:03:59.900> in<00:04:00.080> my

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
character that I put later on in my

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.100 
character that I put later on in my
extras<00:04:00.830> instead<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.850> putting<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:02.269> in<00:04:02.510> my<00:04:02.570> own

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
extras instead of putting it in my own

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.710 
extras instead of putting it in my own
original<00:04:03.680> character<00:04:04.340> because<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:05.239> ended<00:04:05.630> up

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
original character because it ended up

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.560 
original character because it ended up
kind<00:04:06.110> of<00:04:06.380> looking<00:04:06.860> like<00:04:06.890> a<00:04:07.150> character<00:04:08.150> from

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
kind of looking like a character from

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.020 
kind of looking like a character from
over<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.019> hedge<00:04:09.230> so<00:04:09.920> I<00:04:09.950> drew<00:04:10.340> a<00:04:10.370> raccoon<00:04:10.820> and

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
over the hedge so I drew a raccoon and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.640 
over the hedge so I drew a raccoon and
it<00:04:11.150> looked<00:04:11.390> like<00:04:11.450> character<00:04:12.080> that<00:04:12.230> already

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
it looked like character that already

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.110 
it looked like character that already
existed<00:04:13.250> which<00:04:13.580> I<00:04:13.760> didn't<00:04:14.060> realize<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.750> I

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
existed which I didn't realize and I

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.840 
existed which I didn't realize and I
look<00:04:15.360> at<00:04:15.510> any<00:04:15.840> resources<00:04:16.739> for<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.190> but<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.790> just

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
look at any resources for it but it just

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.580 
look at any resources for it but it just
turned<00:04:18.209> out<00:04:18.329> that<00:04:18.389> way<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.500> I

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
turned out that way and I and I

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.879 
turned out that way and I and I
redesigned<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.430> character<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.090> um<00:04:21.560> be<00:04:22.560> careful

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
redesigned a character so um be careful

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.460 
redesigned a character so um be careful
with<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.330> as<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:24.570> said<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:24.810> put<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.139> Red<00:04:25.320> Queen

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
with that as I said I put the Red Queen

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.560 
with that as I said I put the Red Queen

the program and now you definitely see
their<00:05:47.190> improvements<00:05:47.849> if<00:05:48.750> I<00:05:49.349> think<00:05:49.590> about<00:05:49.800> it<00:05:49.919> a

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
their improvements if I think about it a

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.430 
their improvements if I think about it a
lot<00:05:50.340> of<00:05:50.520> them<00:05:50.729> are<00:05:51.030> some<00:05:51.720> of<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:51.960> stronger

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
lot of them are some of the stronger

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.620 
lot of them are some of the stronger
students<00:05:53.190> in<00:05:53.310> first<00:05:53.820> year<00:05:54.060> because<00:05:54.389> they've

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
students in first year because they've

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.969 
students in first year because they've
worked<00:05:54.660> at<00:05:55.050> it<00:05:55.169> so<00:05:55.289> much<00:05:55.440> and<00:05:55.590> they<00:05:55.710> they

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
worked at it so much and they they

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.300 
worked at it so much and they they
really<00:05:56.060> develop<00:05:57.060> their<00:05:57.210> talents<00:05:57.690> so<00:05:58.130> it<00:05:59.130> may

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
really develop their talents so it may

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.580 
really develop their talents so it may
be<00:05:59.370> discouraging<00:06:00.120> to<00:06:00.180> not<00:06:00.690> get<00:06:00.960> accepted<00:06:01.440> but

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
be discouraging to not get accepted but

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.110 
be discouraging to not get accepted but
honestly<00:06:02.130> it<00:06:02.250> may<00:06:02.460> not<00:06:02.669> be<00:06:02.849> a<00:06:02.880> bad<00:06:03.060> thing

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
honestly it may not be a bad thing

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.710 
honestly it may not be a bad thing
either<00:06:03.479> because<00:06:03.840> I<00:06:04.880> you'll<00:06:05.880> just<00:06:06.090> end<00:06:06.360> up

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
either because I you'll just end up

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.810 
either because I you'll just end up
being<00:06:07.500> better<00:06:07.889> if<00:06:08.490> you<00:06:08.760> if<00:06:09.030> you<00:06:09.630> reapply<00:06:10.820> one

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
being better if you if you reapply one
