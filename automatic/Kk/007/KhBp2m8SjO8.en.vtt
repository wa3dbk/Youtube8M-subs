00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.410
 congratulations it seems that the final 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.680
 it was a crazy thing you won 4 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.960
 0 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.639
 finally his supremacy but it was tight 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.080
 still in the heats we won 4 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.849
 0 but it's clear that it was really 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.469
 really very tight it's frankly 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.940
 as we said after the war it was 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.990
 one of the tightest matches we have 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.699
 did another career but after that it's 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.310
 clear that we did not lose a single 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.779
 map of the tournament so it remains we are 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.150
 Proud enough our performance but a 4 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.400
 0 the final awaits respect anyway to 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.650
 supremacy but it still remains a 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.760
 beautiful victory 4 0 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.710
 frankly we do not discuss and after 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.110
 behind you become the call of duty 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.960
 proteam tournament that was organized in 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.920
 partnership with acti vision xbox 360 and 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.989
 game one i want to remind him

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.970
 victory 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.100
 goes a little bit it was trained to 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.330
 we still had it anyway 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.940
 four to five hours of play per day 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.130
 even more to win we have it we have 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.090
 neglected a European tournament for for 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.810
 to be concerned about this tournament 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.100
 today we still do not come back 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.970
 because it's really official 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.130
 comes to sign a contract 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.350
 so that's a lot what so signed a 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.550
 pro gamer contract exactly his 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.750

 best french team on call of 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.960
 duty 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.780
 a little word customs lorraine now 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.290

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.729

 does that mean what does it mean 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.680
 now you are expected in 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.960

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.820
 you are expected online you are 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.009
 waited by all this puts a pressure that 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.750
 yeah minimum pressure but hey we got 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.640
 always this small pressure facet 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.500
 because we won there on black ops 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 a lan in europe already blackpool on 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.740
 had won in England and we were 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.119
 was already waiting a little bit everywhere 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.259
 have seen bad surprises for us 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.790
 and and then the bomb 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.590
 we did a good thing with this 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.540
 tournament is clear so now maxim 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.000
 like that means in the team 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.069
 now we train more we do 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.440
 more training where lived in the 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.050
 same region by no not at all so 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.500
 training online it online on 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.530
 Internet 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.490
 yes you can stall your job 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.750

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.490

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.710
 nice stage and I have the others 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.420
 behind 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.520
 so I was in pro trade and 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.410
 so I have not stopped my bac I 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.520
 Do it 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.050
 here and there I will resume 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.510
 normally correspondence courses 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.090
 in the year just after and 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.740
 samir and corentin bah me i was 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.210
 pastry chef of the coup I stopped 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.750
 work for this tournament and I'm going 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.430
 resume resume soon 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.200
 beautiful and you corentin me the same 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.880
 it was student I was in the industry and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.110
 for the tournament I stopped I did a 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.120
 little break somehow 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.070
 and in the end I do not really know if I 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.300
 take us back if I concentrated more 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.800
 only in my passion that is to say and games 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.560
 videos etc 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.360
 so small question there is call of duty 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.040
 black ops 2 which will be released on the 12th of 13 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.060
 November forgiveness with an evening of 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.250
 just launch on the 12th 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.280
 did you see the risk you 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.720
 have tested game yet we do not have 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.530
 still tested the game we've seen videos 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.700
 we could 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.610
 some of them could not attend 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.720
 to the premieres but hey we are waiting for him 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.260
 impatiently is clear that as soon as we 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.120
 will test it 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.130
 yes like little children with their 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.420
 first game what do you think of the options 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.610
 precisely that were inserted into the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.240
 game access options to sport 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.890
 electronic 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.890
 because behind that will allow with 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.870
 an xbox 360 call of duty to make 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.000
 caste show to comment on matches 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.440
 it's very focused on electronics they have 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.300
 thought finally confesses that's it 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.940
 come back one was heard in relation to the 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.590
 previous symposium they made a big 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.550
 step forward for the competition I 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.130
 find that very very well what they have 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.600
 done and and frankly I'm waiting 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.709
 blackhawks 2 impatiently true because 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.900
 that as soon as he goes out I'll have to 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.800
 to train the guys down santini I 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.240
 think we're going to be the team to shoot down 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.830

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.870

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.720
 status to keep is that of the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.520
