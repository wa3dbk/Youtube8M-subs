00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
our scavenger so important but I figured

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.889 
our scavenger so important but I figured
they'd<00:01:56.520> because<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.850> get<00:01:56.969> 300<00:01:57.420> rounds<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.810> an

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
they'd because you get 300 rounds of an

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.010 
they'd because you get 300 rounds of an
LMG<00:01:58.259> anyway<00:01:58.619> I'd<00:01:59.159> rather<00:01:59.430> take<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.119> tactical<00:02:00.780> or

well<00:02:04.970> as<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.240> sidearm<00:02:05.630> because<00:02:06.230> when<00:02:06.770> LMGs<00:02:07.400> are

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550
