really quick now look at this when I
turn<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.740> notice<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
turn it on the do you notice that this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.180 
turn it on the do you notice that this
is<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:35.880> spinning

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
is not spinning

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.180 
is not spinning
you<00:01:37.580> see<00:01:37.760> ordinary<00:01:38.270> saws<00:01:38.570> spin<00:01:39.020> or<00:01:39.650> they

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
you see ordinary saws spin or they

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.040 
you see ordinary saws spin or they
reciprocate<00:01:40.910> and<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.270> be<00:01:41.390> dangerous<00:01:41.630> and

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
reciprocate and to be dangerous and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.380 
reciprocate and to be dangerous and
difficult<00:01:42.230> to<00:01:42.560> control<00:01:42.860> but<00:01:43.610> not<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.060> multi

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
difficult to control but not the multi

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.060 
difficult to control but not the multi
master<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:45.140> multi<00:01:45.410> master<00:01:45.560> works<00:01:45.890> by

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
master the multi master works by

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.530 
master the multi master works by
oscillating<00:01:46.820> back<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.030> forth<00:01:47.420> that

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
oscillating back and forth that

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.780 
oscillating back and forth that
twenty-one<00:01:48.050> thousand<00:01:48.500> times<00:01:48.710> per<00:01:48.980> minute<00:01:49.100> but

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
twenty-one thousand times per minute but

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.600 
twenty-one thousand times per minute but
just<00:01:49.970> watch<00:01:50.180> how<00:01:50.450> well<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.930> cuts<00:01:51.460> safety<00:01:52.460> glass

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
just watch how well it cuts safety glass

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.180 
just watch how well it cuts safety glass
but<00:01:53.120> your<00:01:53.270> safety<00:01:53.540> glasses<00:01:53.630> on<00:01:53.960> it<00:01:54.320> works<00:01:54.590> it

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
but your safety glasses on it works it

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.600 
but your safety glasses on it works it
could<00:01:55.250> easily<00:01:55.580> cut<00:01:56.090> through<00:01:56.330> this<00:01:56.450> would<00:01:57.610> look

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
could easily cut through this would look

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.290 
could easily cut through this would look
at<00:01:58.760> this<00:01:58.910> goatee

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.359 

also<00:02:03.050> cuts<00:02:03.320> right<00:02:03.500> through<00:02:03.800> plastic

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.160 

folks<00:02:09.369> most<00:02:09.850> tools<00:02:10.210> don't<00:02:10.450> cut<00:02:10.780> through<00:02:11.020> metal

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
folks most tools don't cut through metal

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.660 
folks most tools don't cut through metal
but<00:02:11.470> watch<00:02:11.710> this<00:02:11.920> go<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.130> work<00:02:12.370> on<00:02:12.520> this

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
but watch this go to work on this

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.820 
but watch this go to work on this
downspout

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.990 

look<00:02:18.830> at<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.010> precision<00:02:19.490> cut<00:02:19.700> with<00:02:19.880> you

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
look at the precision cut with you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.900 
look at the precision cut with you
awesome<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.530> prorated<00:02:21.980> just<00:02:22.610> when<00:02:22.790> you

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
awesome that is prorated just when you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.120 
awesome that is prorated just when you
think<00:02:23.150> you've<00:02:23.360> seen<00:02:23.390> everything<00:02:23.800> watch<00:02:24.800> this

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
think you've seen everything watch this

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.860 
think you've seen everything watch this

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
master I would not do this but look at

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.740 
master I would not do this but look at
that<00:02:30.920> what<00:02:33.700> see<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.850> multi<00:02:35.090> master<00:02:35.270> does<00:02:35.600> it

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
that what see the multi master does it

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.930 
that what see the multi master does it
cut<00:02:35.959> your<00:02:36.140> skin<00:02:36.470> because<00:02:36.920> soft<00:02:37.280> material<00:02:37.819> like

part of my job is testing tools the nice

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.009 
part of my job is testing tools the nice
thing<00:03:13.610> about<00:03:13.819> that<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.330> multi<00:03:14.600> master<00:03:14.780> is

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
thing about that the multi master is

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.890 
thing about that the multi master is
because<00:03:15.440> it's<00:03:15.950> so<00:03:16.250> compact<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.360> tight<00:03:17.600> and

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
because it's so compact and tight and

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.750 
because it's so compact and tight and
and<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.440> pains<00:03:18.830> all<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.130> its<00:03:19.250> energy<00:03:19.340> very

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
and it pains all of its energy very

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.130 
and it pains all of its energy very
nicely<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.360> puts<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.720> right<00:03:20.840> where<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.110> needs

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
nicely and puts it right where it needs

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.509 
nicely and puts it right where it needs
to<00:03:21.410> be<00:03:21.560> right<00:03:21.590> at<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:21.920> cutting<00:03:22.130> part<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.459> a

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
to be right at the cutting part of a

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.190 
to be right at the cutting part of a
tool<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:23.150> can<00:03:23.269> actually<00:03:23.570> control<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:24.019> very

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
tool you can actually control it very

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.990 
tool you can actually control it very
well<00:03:24.350> so<00:03:24.530> it's<00:03:24.650> easy<00:03:24.829> to<00:03:24.980> do<00:03:25.100> fine<00:03:25.430> work<00:03:25.700> with

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
well so it's easy to do fine work with

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.940 
well so it's easy to do fine work with
it<00:03:26.150> but<00:03:27.049> still<00:03:27.260> have<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.410> lot<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.650> aggressive
