whole<00:01:56.960> war<00:01:57.229> thing<00:01:57.259> but<00:01:57.890> if<00:01:58.399> we<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:59.060> know<00:01:59.179> do

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
whole war thing but if we you know do

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.270 
whole war thing but if we you know do
you<00:01:59.689> think<00:01:59.960> she<00:02:00.200> should<00:02:00.229> just<00:02:00.500> go<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.920> jail
