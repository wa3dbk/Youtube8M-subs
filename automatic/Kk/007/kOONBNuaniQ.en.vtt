there are no fat people you are the bad

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:31.609 
there are no fat people you are the bad
person<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.540> step<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> plate

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
person so then we step up to the plate

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.020 
person so then we step up to the plate
and<00:01:32.009> hit<00:01:32.729> X<00:01:34.369> apparently<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.729> useful

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and hit X apparently this is useful

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210 
and hit X apparently this is useful
because<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.840> actually<00:01:37.290> fix<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:37.770> car<00:01:37.979> if
