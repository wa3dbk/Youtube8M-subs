00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.800 
like it make a video on it and that was
the<00:02:21.340> trade-off<00:02:21.790> he<00:02:22.240> sent<00:02:22.450> me<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.600> hundred

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the trade-off he sent me a hundred

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.320 
the trade-off he sent me a hundred
dollars<00:02:23.230> worth<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.770> taco<00:02:24.760> racks<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:27.330> used

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
dollars worth of taco racks and I used

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.270 
dollars worth of taco racks and I used
them<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:29.020> them<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:29.590> i<00:02:29.620> did<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> video<00:02:30.100> on

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
them and I like them so i did a video on

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.190 
them and I like them so i did a video on
it<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.760> i<00:02:31.390> guess<00:02:31.600> i<00:02:31.720> should<00:02:31.900> have<00:02:31.930> done<00:02:32.050> a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
it and i guess i should have done a

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.190 
it and i guess i should have done a
different<00:02:32.890> way<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.580> maybe<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.209> made<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.720> look<00:02:34.959> too

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
different way I maybe I made it look too

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.949 
different way I maybe I made it look too
much<00:02:35.350> like<00:02:35.410> an<00:02:35.680> infomercial<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:37.360> maybe<00:02:37.750> that

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
much like an infomercial so maybe that

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.800 
much like an infomercial so maybe that
was<00:02:38.110> my<00:02:38.350> mistake<00:02:38.910> but<00:02:39.910> for<00:02:40.239> somebody<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.569> call

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810
