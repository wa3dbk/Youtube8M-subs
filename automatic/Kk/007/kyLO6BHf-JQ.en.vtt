00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.140 
is
you<00:04:26.370> kind<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.700> shape<00:04:27.690> your<00:04:28.260> face<00:04:28.830> like<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:32.150> so

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
you kind of shape your face like that so

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.100 
you kind of shape your face like that so
it<00:04:33.360> makes<00:04:33.570> your<00:04:33.810> face<00:04:33.960> look<00:04:35.120> smaller<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.810> way

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
it makes your face look smaller that way

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.800 
it makes your face look smaller that way
I<00:04:37.640> usually<00:04:38.640> don't<00:04:38.910> do<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.240> because<00:04:39.390> I<00:04:39.510> don't

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
I usually don't do that because I don't

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.410 
I usually don't do that because I don't
care<00:04:40.110> but<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.830> can<00:04:40.980> also<00:04:41.130> do<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:42.210> that's

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
care but you can also do that so that's

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.960
