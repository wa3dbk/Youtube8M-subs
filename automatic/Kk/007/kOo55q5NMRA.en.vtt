00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.039 

okay<00:00:01.469> here<00:00:01.740> we<00:00:01.890> have<00:00:02.780> 79<00:00:03.780> through<00:00:04.140> 93<00:00:04.680> Mustang

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
okay here we have 79 through 93 Mustang

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.020 
okay here we have 79 through 93 Mustang
with<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.170> typical<00:00:07.589> rear<00:00:07.799> bumper<00:00:08.160> sag<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.849> this

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
with the typical rear bumper sag on this

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.740 
with the typical rear bumper sag on this
particular<00:00:09.330> car<00:00:10.400> as<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.700> can<00:00:11.880> see<00:00:12.150> we<00:00:12.570> have

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
particular car as you can see we have

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.980 
particular car as you can see we have
approximately<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.740> one-inch<00:00:14.309> sag<00:00:14.809> between<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
approximately a one-inch sag between the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.720 
approximately a one-inch sag between the
taillight<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.920> upper<00:00:17.310> part<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
taillight and the upper part of the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.439 
taillight and the upper part of the
bumper<00:00:18.060> cover<00:00:19.340> these<00:00:20.340> covers<00:00:20.730> typically<00:00:21.180> sag

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
bumper cover these covers typically sag

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.200 
bumper cover these covers typically sag
because<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.590> rear<00:00:23.070> bumper<00:00:23.310> support<00:00:23.640> is

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
because the the rear bumper support is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.599 
because the the rear bumper support is
made<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.050> very<00:00:25.230> thin<00:00:25.470> metal<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.920> rots<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
made of very thin metal and rots out and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.429 
made of very thin metal and rots out and
becomes<00:00:26.880> very<00:00:27.090> flimsy<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:28.019> no<00:00:28.199> longer

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
becomes very flimsy and is no longer

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.740 
becomes very flimsy and is no longer
able<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.830> support<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
able to support it

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.440 
able to support it
okay<00:00:31.410> we've<00:00:31.590> removed<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.160> bumper<00:00:32.489> cover<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
okay we've removed the bumper cover and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.200 
okay we've removed the bumper cover and
as<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.899> see<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.440> support<00:00:34.920> has<00:00:35.730> given<00:00:36.120> up

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
as you can see that support has given up

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.650 
as you can see that support has given up
the<00:00:36.329> ghost<00:00:36.649> is<00:00:37.649> right<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.190> which<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> typical

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the ghost is right it which is typical

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.740 
the ghost is right it which is typical
of<00:00:39.899> all<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.200> them<00:00:40.760> Ford<00:00:41.760> does<00:00:41.940> not<00:00:42.120> prime<00:00:42.480> or

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
of all of them Ford does not prime or

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.590 
of all of them Ford does not prime or
paint<00:00:42.960> these<00:00:43.170> metal<00:00:43.710> reinforcements<00:00:44.600> so

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
paint these metal reinforcements so

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.299 
paint these metal reinforcements so
therefore<00:00:46.079> they<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.620> rot<00:00:47.039> they're

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
therefore they they just rot they're

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.639 
therefore they they just rot they're
caught<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.670> there<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> debris<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
caught in there with all the debris and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.850 
caught in there with all the debris and
salt<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.340> whatever<00:00:50.550> else<00:00:50.879> goes<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.989> rots

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
salt and whatever else goes on and rots

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.410 
salt and whatever else goes on and rots
away<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.520> see<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.030> even<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
away as you can see this one even the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.959 
away as you can see this one even the
stud<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.899> gone<00:00:55.320> away<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.100> there's<00:00:56.309> there's

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
stud is gone away so there's there's

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.569 
stud is gone away so there's there's
literally<00:00:57.329> no<00:00:57.629> way<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.899> support<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.949> going

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
literally no way to support it going

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.209 
literally no way to support it going
over<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.940> car<00:01:00.649> this<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.039> looks

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
over to the car this is what it looks

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.270 
over to the car this is what it looks
like<00:01:02.399> putting<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.730> off<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.040> stud

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
like putting it off you can see the stud

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.539 
like putting it off you can see the stud
holes<00:01:05.750> at<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.080> support<00:01:07.770> goes<00:01:07.979> through<00:01:10.549> next

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
holes at this support goes through next

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.410 
holes at this support goes through next
we<00:01:11.670> will<00:01:11.880> show<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.860> replacement<00:01:13.860> and

how<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.770> start<00:01:17.759> putting<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> product

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
how to start putting the product

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.420 
how to start putting the product
together<00:01:19.310> first<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.860> IPT<00:01:22.860> specific

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
together first we have the IPT specific

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.760 
together first we have the IPT specific
clips<00:01:23.869> that<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.200> snapped<00:01:25.530> in

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
clips that are going to be snapped in

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.649 
clips that are going to be snapped in
the<00:01:25.799> holes<00:01:26.220> where<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> studs<00:01:27.060> used<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> go

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the holes where the studs used to go

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.940 
the holes where the studs used to go
through<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> OEM<00:01:28.740> bracket<00:01:33.650> there<00:01:34.650> they're

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
through on the OEM bracket there they're

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.590 
through on the OEM bracket there they're
tight<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.520> they<00:01:35.670> will<00:01:35.790> take<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> little<00:01:36.390> bit<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
tight so they will take a little bit of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.900 
tight so they will take a little bit of
effort<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> put<00:01:37.110> them<00:01:37.200> on

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:51.620 

there's<00:01:44.910> four<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.300> them<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.510> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
there's four of them and we have to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.240 
there's four of them and we have to
spread<00:01:51.870> it<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.170> little<00:01:52.410> bit<00:01:52.620> just<00:01:52.800> to<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.040> some

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
spread it a little bit just to get some

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.580 
spread it a little bit just to get some
tightness<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.820> there<00:01:54.090> okay<00:01:55.050> so<00:01:55.110> we're<00:01:55.410> good

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
tightness on there okay so we're good

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.000 
tightness on there okay so we're good
with<00:01:55.620> that<00:01:55.920> next<00:01:57.230> we<00:01:58.230> will<00:01:58.380> show<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.710> how<00:01:58.980> to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
with that next we will show you how to

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.340 
with that next we will show you how to
install<00:01:59.820> right<00:02:00.090> here<00:02:00.330> we<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.780> IPT

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
you put it up behind the bumper cover

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:17.540 
you put it up behind the bumper cover
you<00:02:08.250> Center<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:15.740> slide<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.920> over<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.250> crash
