game<00:00:43.280> doesn't<00:00:43.490> have<00:00:43.700> been<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:43.850> pretty

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
game doesn't have been a pretty

game doesn't have been a pretty
interesting<00:00:44.450> way<00:00:44.960> I<00:00:45.940> think<00:00:46.990> the<00:00:47.990> game<00:00:48.200> wasn't

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
interesting way I think the game wasn't

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.150 
interesting way I think the game wasn't
everything<00:00:49.220> that<00:00:49.340> I<00:00:49.430> expected<00:00:50.000> it<00:00:50.120> to<00:00:50.270> be<00:00:50.300> I

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
everything that I expected it to be I

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.490 
everything that I expected it to be I
was<00:00:52.160> hoping<00:00:52.280> maybe<00:00:52.550> combat<00:00:53.090> would<00:00:53.210> be<00:00:53.500> even

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
was hoping maybe combat would be even

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.230 
was hoping maybe combat would be even
more<00:00:54.800> varied<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.400> interesting<00:00:55.520> than<00:00:55.910> it<00:00:55.970> was

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
more varied and interesting than it was

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.080 
more varied and interesting than it was
but<00:00:56.930> it's<00:00:57.080> definitely<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.710> kernel<00:00:58.220> of<00:00:58.520> a<00:00:58.640> good

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
but it's definitely the kernel of a good

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.180 
but it's definitely the kernel of a good
game<00:00:59.329> there's<00:01:00.020> definitely<00:01:00.410> some<00:01:00.920> really

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
game there's definitely some really

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.640 
game there's definitely some really
interesting<00:01:01.460> ideas<00:01:02.090> in<00:01:02.300> here<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:02.900> it<00:01:03.230> flows

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
interesting ideas in here and it flows

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.730 
interesting ideas in here and it flows
fairly<00:01:04.250> smoothly<00:01:04.900> it's<00:01:05.900> a<00:01:05.960> two-player<00:01:06.409> game

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
fairly smoothly it's a two-player game

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.620 
fairly smoothly it's a two-player game
and<00:01:07.040> works<00:01:07.310> really<00:01:07.550> well<00:01:07.670> back<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:08.390> forth

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
and works really well back and forth

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.980 
and works really well back and forth
between<00:01:08.840> two<00:01:09.230> people<00:01:09.650> I<00:01:10.640> would<00:01:11.330> say<00:01:11.630> that<00:01:11.840> it's

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
between two people I would say that it's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.190 
between two people I would say that it's
much<00:01:12.380> more<00:01:12.650> advanced<00:01:13.250> version<00:01:14.000> of<00:01:14.120> war<00:01:14.540> but<00:01:15.170> I

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
much more advanced version of war but I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.410 
much more advanced version of war but I
don't<00:01:15.380> want<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.850> disparage<00:01:16.850> this<00:01:17.120> by<00:01:17.240> saying

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
don't want to disparage this by saying

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.820 
don't want to disparage this by saying
that<00:01:17.570> it's<00:01:17.690> even<00:01:17.780> remotely<00:01:18.170> close<00:01:18.409> to<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.710> in

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
that it's even remotely close to the in

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.410 
that it's even remotely close to the in
war<00:01:19.070> but<00:01:19.430> that's<00:01:19.610> kind<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:19.909> what<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.150> feels

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
war but that's kind of what it feels

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.780 
war but that's kind of what it feels
like<00:01:20.570> at<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.440> same<00:01:21.620> time<00:01:21.920> it's<00:01:22.280> light<00:01:22.760> enough

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
like at the same time it's light enough

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.130 
like at the same time it's light enough
that<00:01:23.000> you<00:01:23.240> could<00:01:23.330> probably<00:01:23.540> crack<00:01:23.900> one<00:01:24.050> of

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
that you could probably crack one of

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.800 
that you could probably crack one of
these<00:01:24.260> games<00:01:24.500> out<00:01:24.800> in<00:01:24.940> 20<00:01:25.940> minutes<00:01:26.120> when<00:01:26.780> you

cards of for example woodlands you get

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.010 
cards of for example woodlands you get
three<00:06:00.439> points<00:06:00.620> each<00:06:00.860> woodland<00:06:01.310> is<00:06:01.460> worth<00:06:01.639> one

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
will make five points total so the game

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.320

army ready to go right away I like that
idea<00:06:26.089> also<00:06:26.479> I<00:06:26.870> guess<00:06:27.469> I<00:06:27.589> was<00:06:27.740> kind<00:06:27.770> of<00:06:27.919> hoping

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
idea also I guess I was kind of hoping

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.159 
idea also I guess I was kind of hoping
for<00:06:28.430> maybe<00:06:28.520> longer<00:06:28.969> battles<00:06:29.419> because<00:06:29.810> four

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
for maybe longer battles because four

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.869 
for maybe longer battles because four
cards<00:06:30.529> is<00:06:30.620> not<00:06:30.770> a<00:06:30.800> very<00:06:31.039> impressive<00:06:31.399> battle<00:06:31.759> I

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:31.879

even play my fourth card and sometimes

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.600 
even play my fourth card and sometimes
battles<00:06:38.470> are<00:06:38.560> really<00:06:38.740> quick<00:06:38.919> they<00:06:39.220> play<00:06:39.400> one

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
my hand and I understand that that keeps

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.480 
my hand and I understand that that keeps
the<00:06:43.810> game<00:06:43.960> moving<00:06:44.110> quickly<00:06:44.500> it<00:06:44.860> just<00:06:45.310> doesn't

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
the game moving quickly it just doesn't

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.550 
the game moving quickly it just doesn't
feel<00:06:45.729> as<00:06:45.880> epic<00:06:46.360> you<00:06:46.690> know<00:06:46.810> maybe<00:06:46.960> a<00:06:47.110> battle

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
feel as epic you know maybe a battle

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.500 
feel as epic you know maybe a battle
it's<00:06:48.100> just<00:06:48.280> like<00:06:48.340> I<00:06:48.550> had<00:06:48.910> the<00:06:49.000> wrong<00:06:49.120> card<00:06:49.419> at

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
it's just like I had the wrong card at

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.300 
it's just like I had the wrong card at
the<00:06:49.600> wrong<00:06:49.750> time<00:06:50.020> now<00:06:50.800> once<00:06:51.010> you<00:06:51.100> start

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
the wrong time now once you start

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.310 
the wrong time now once you start
throwing<00:06:51.520> in<00:06:51.610> action<00:06:52.030> cards<00:06:52.389> but<00:06:52.570> I<00:06:52.780> found

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
throwing in action cards but I found

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.020 
throwing in action cards but I found
that<00:06:53.470> it's<00:06:53.680> usually<00:06:54.160> fun<00:06:54.490> if<00:06:54.699> you<00:06:54.790> kind<00:06:54.910> of

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
that it's usually fun if you kind of

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.490 
that it's usually fun if you kind of
give<00:06:55.240> your<00:06:55.419> opponent<00:06:55.630> a<00:06:55.900> few<00:06:56.139> of<00:06:56.260> the<00:06:56.350> smaller

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500

give your opponent a few of the smaller
lands<00:06:57.100> and<00:06:57.220> you<00:06:57.669> hold<00:06:57.940> off<00:06:58.120> and<00:06:58.330> wait<00:06:58.360> for<00:06:58.630> that

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
lands and you hold off and wait for that

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.050 
lands and you hold off and wait for that
really<00:06:58.930> great<00:06:59.290> land<00:06:59.530> that<00:06:59.680> come<00:06:59.830> up<00:07:00.010> unless<00:07:00.940> of
