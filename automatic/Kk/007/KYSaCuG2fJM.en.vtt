00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.330
 and then they went to lift me 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.420
 They did not look for another chair that supposedly 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.520
 I was good and I turned to fall or be 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.840
 bad it's been almost three years without looking 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.070
 professor of biology came to take a 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.720
 Test without thinking that students will 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.809
 they had made their chairs wrong they are in 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.900
 the high school in the class on the street to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.019

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.880

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.160
 it was one but twice that the 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.690
 professor fell these were part of the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.190
 physical consequences suffered by the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.000
 professional but there was also 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.500
 psychological are situations that lead 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.500
 to live the moment this 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.340
 Of course I could not go to class and I went 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.890
 to a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist told me 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.930
 definitely can not be with more 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.729
 of 35 years of experience the supposed 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.490
 joke in the catholic school christ 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.810
 redeemer of the commune of the poplars 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.470
 he simply ended his career already 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.399
 this bullying is an aggression is a 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.500
 aggression that does not continue or is not 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.950
 leaves your home nor can you 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.770
 Hold group conversations 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.899
 - approaching the classrooms ensures that you live 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.670
 trauma that forced him to overtake his 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.520
 retirement that tells me you're in a 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.070
 blind situation 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.229
 and I definitely can not go to do 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.299
 class is the same commune in which so 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.310
 finished this teacher after being 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.939
 assaulted inside Felix school 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.939
 I sent him 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.019
 melo borroto 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.460
 I started writing when a classmate 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.890
 they left me stuck in what I would do the 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.140
 school does not want because she's going to 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.940
 hit again if I go to school the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.740
 is afraid of going back to school 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.990
 now proxies and students marched 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.940
 denouncing violence by the 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.950
 teachers the second one that will be a raid 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.970
 in these moments to meet with 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.430
 mittens with the knife inside some 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.330
 here they bring it as a game the protocols 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.610
 of security and each establishment 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.410
 it must also be done and that in 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.690
 set aggressions and bullying that both 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.700
 parties say denounce but in the case 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.920
 This teacher left her with a trauma 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.400
 that forced her to advance her retirement from 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.400
 the classrooms
