00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.710
 from his experience that was more than ten years ago because I recommend close 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.909
 to normal 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.179
 well let's start a hundred first 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.210
 for the quality of the milk 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.179
 protein and fat 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.989
 of these animals 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.140
 p compared to the trick May production that the voice of the surpasses can with great 

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:25.999
 difference 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.749
 we talk about proteins of three points including four that entails 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.149
 even better price to the producer than finally as producers 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.760
 farmers that are looking for profitability 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.210
 second the male is not that fact the males serve for the toilet in two years 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.290
 we can remove bull of 400 420 kilos 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.330
 third the decency that diseases have 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.560
 percent per quarter he wanted it 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.560
 cows from 8 9 up to esparto 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.960
 Another quality of the delivery facility does not present problems of these 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.750
 that I believe are a number of qualities that lead one to think 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.180
 which is an interesting base to have in an act 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.660
 another of the characteristics that this winner has that does not suffer problems of 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.000
 pigmentation 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.760
 i justice 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.380
 those poise allow them to walk through difficult and rugged places and where 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.380
 maybe it happened to us they are not of such good quality 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.210
 3 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 as they call to reflection those who strike 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.600
 good that we have worked artificial insemination for 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.610
 many years 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.650
 I certainly echo that the Norman rasa 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.650
 has all the bulls that one can imagine 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.160
 not on the cover of France or as here in the national houses 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.540
 then smoke is inseminated after doing an evaluation just here 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.330
 bulls are not recommended and as we will weigh one of the 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.430
 bulls and we maintain a permanent insemination program 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.780
 also 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.350
 I have a bull a bull so it is not median beforehand for not 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.180
 have consanguinity problems 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.029
 a bull brought from another ranch of d 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.209
 pure norman 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.450
 and we use it for the repeating cow and sometimes for the novillada 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.389
 first step 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.260
 fair 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.619
 oltra 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:26.019
 2 The Norman race has good milk production and is considered 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.089
 as the best that will be of the world the average production of the cows 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.019
 Norman in France for the year 2007 was 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.009
 6649 liters with four 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:41.099
 point 42% fat and 3 points 6 percent protein in colombia 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.889
 current average exceeds 4,600 liters and according to the examinations of 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.009
 Protein and fat content of processing plants 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.280
 it has been possible to observe an average of 4 points 35 percent fat and three 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.219
 points 42 percent of protein versus the prevention part 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:03.629
 when alarte has won a demand reached a peak of prevention the 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.729
 dementia what to bat 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:11.879
 pss theoretically that to the fifth party that I already have face to face 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.409
 percent 7 and 8 years this can attest that yes 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.659
 besides the heifers 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.999
 a heifer edge of a key question 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.799
 what production peak has 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.190
 we have had picón must who tweeted first pact 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.799
 then sequentially 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:36.599
 they are cows that the fifth parturition can sting in 30 35 euros scares by part of 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.070
 important to recommend for training 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.709
 in the academic part 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.870
 include all knowledge of the race decreasing 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.640
 for these characteristics that I mentioned this cattle is important 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.209
 notice 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.829
 which adapts to many regions of our country then for the 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.939
 students it is important to know 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.369
 which terraces can exploit what benefits they can achieve and is important 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:04.840
 that all students know cheeses gained adaptable to different 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:10.279
 topography will be different climates and so they can achieve against the best use 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:11.529
 of the yes 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:14.529
 this 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:17.120
 your texts 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.620
 my name is margarita maría uribe sierra 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.780
 I am a production engineer and dedicated myself to the raising of normal cattle and 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.009
 I am also part of the cattle and kim world
