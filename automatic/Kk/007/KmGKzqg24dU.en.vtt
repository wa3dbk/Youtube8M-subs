00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.660 
know how to do that either look it up
there's<00:02:03.250> not<00:02:03.370> many<00:02:04.170> oh<00:02:05.170> my<00:02:06.040> god<00:02:06.220> I'm<00:02:06.310> sorry

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
there's not many oh my god I'm sorry

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.090 
there's not many oh my god I'm sorry
it's<00:02:07.090> not<00:02:07.270> many<00:02:07.479> tutorials<00:02:07.930> one<00:02:08.800> had<00:02:09.070> a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
it's not many tutorials one had a

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.950 
it's not many tutorials one had a
one-foot<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:09.970> I<00:02:10.000> guess<00:02:10.270> I'll<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.450> help<00:02:10.780> out

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
one-foot so I guess I'll just help out

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.300 
one-foot so I guess I'll just help out
the<00:02:11.080> community<00:02:11.200> out<00:02:11.680> there<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.070> put<00:02:12.220> another

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
the community out there and put another

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.570 
the community out there and put another
how-to<00:02:12.640> one<00:02:12.940> push<00:02:13.210> for<00:02:14.170> come<00:02:14.380> get<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.430> more

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
how-to one push for come get you more

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.230 
how-to one push for come get you more
points<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:17.590> advanced<00:02:18.490> comps<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.209> a

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
points and it's advanced comps so it's a

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.930 
points and it's advanced comps so it's a
little<00:02:19.390> difficult<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:20.020> learn<00:02:20.200> but<00:02:21.070> start<00:02:21.790> out

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
little difficult to learn but start out

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.030 
little difficult to learn but start out
and<00:02:22.090> og<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.690> pushing<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.350> helps<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.680> out<00:02:23.740> a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
and og the pushing it helps you out a

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.210 
and og the pushing it helps you out a
ton<00:02:24.400> because<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.790> pushes<00:02:25.030> faster<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.010> makes

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
ton because it pushes faster so it makes

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.160 
ton because it pushes faster so it makes
it<00:02:27.340> easier<00:02:28.140> into<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.230> right<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:30.990> once<00:02:31.990> you

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
it easier into the right and once you

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.080 
it easier into the right and once you
land<00:02:32.940> want<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.030> revert<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.280> when

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
land want to revert just like that when

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.550 
land want to revert just like that when
I'm<00:02:37.180> ghost<00:02:37.450> rebirth<00:02:37.840> like<00:02:38.020> that<00:02:38.230> I'm<00:02:38.440> what

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
I'm ghost rebirth like that I'm what

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.949 
I'm ghost rebirth like that I'm what
that<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:38.739> do<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.070> out<00:02:39.190> keep<00:02:39.430> your<00:02:39.459> speed<00:02:39.959> and

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
that I do is out keep your speed and

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.140 
that I do is out keep your speed and
it's<00:02:41.140> easier<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.709> see<00:02:41.980> though<00:02:42.190> you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
it's easier for you to see though you

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.759 
it's easier for you to see though you
can<00:02:43.330> land<00:02:43.510> straight<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.290> can<00:02:50.440> see<00:02:50.590> I

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
can land straight and you can see I

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.220 
can land straight and you can see I
still<00:02:51.040> have<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> lot<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.550> speed<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.900> did<00:02:53.080> my

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
still have a lot of speed and I did my

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.530 
still have a lot of speed and I did my
next<00:02:53.500> trick<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.100> then<00:02:54.700> they<00:02:54.880> my<00:02:55.030> seatbelt

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
next trick and then they my seatbelt

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.000 
next trick and then they my seatbelt
nice<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.019> clean<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.880> after<00:02:57.880> that<00:02:58.709> well<00:02:59.709> then

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
nice and clean and after that well then

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.370 
nice and clean and after that well then
that<00:03:00.220> do<00:03:00.549> your<00:03:00.730> next<00:03:01.060> trick<00:03:01.420> landing<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:02.200> see

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
but again and once you land go through

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.229 
but again and once you land go through
it<00:03:04.180> again

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
it again

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.030
