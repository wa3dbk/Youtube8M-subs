00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.540
 i am Romina and we will learn to 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.430
 play the song ryan to your lips 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.780
 nicobar is a very simple song 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.780
 let's listen to our introduction 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.119
 and that's basically all our 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.180
 introduction is very simple let's 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.760
 put without minor in the second fret 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.770
 let's put the biggest 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.450
 My biggest 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.460
 and that would be all for our 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.110
 introduction and verse and we're going to touch the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 next arpeggio let's get smaller 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.790
 and we are going to play the fifth and second 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.890
 No Time Rope 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.740
 now the fourth rope first rope 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.130
 second fourth 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.130
 because that would be slow 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.130
 and 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.970
 we went to our next one I agreed that 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.970
 is the biggest and we do the same arpeggio 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:11.759
 we spend the greatest equal but we do 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.759
 in the region twice 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.770
 and so our diverse introduction remains 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.710
 do not 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.929
 remember in my senior we do twice 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.390
 breastfeed after we're going to pass on 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:39.920
 our pre-chorus that this one conforms to 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:46.570
 My minor has held lower I am older 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.570
 the major and minor and major 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.580
 ah 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.640
 and we passed to our choir that is very 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.700
 simple that is from least to greatest forgiveness 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.860
 the biggest 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.860
 if minor are greater and lesser 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:21.340
 ok then let's do this circle 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:24.070
 of network and they are twice until we move 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.390
 trouble radios down with my minor and 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.390
 they are older I am like that 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.830
 higher 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.120
 and we return our verse 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.080
 Y 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.620
 and you 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.720
 after the second choir there is a bridge 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.110
 in which we are going to play are the four 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.110
 chords that are major re major 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.379
 all right 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.390
 that 's totally how we have the choir 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.890
 so this is just that with both 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.890
 different chords that is my sun 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.500
 after touching these two times we are going to 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.500
 spend again remove 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:54.230
 and we go back to our colon for our 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:57.950
 last choir and final we will play only 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.620
 once our chords of relaxation and sun 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.099
 and then let's play twice what it is 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.099
 my minor 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.170
 and we touch again what is our 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.170
 introduction 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.350
 i 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.400
 ah 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.700
 and also our song we play 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.270
 our introduction but with pure 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.190
 strum and without our arpeggio I hope that 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.200
