something really interesting about this
one<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.590> has<00:00:22.710> creatine<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
one is that it has creatine and a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.189 
one is that it has creatine and a
protein<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.180> that's<00:00:24.300> rare<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.660> pre-workout

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
protein and that's rare in a pre-workout

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.470 
protein and that's rare in a pre-workout
drink<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:26.400> proteins<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.029> get<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.359> get

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
drink the proteins that you get you get

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.019 
drink the proteins that you get you get
both<00:00:27.660> whey<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.199> casein<00:00:28.369> protein<00:00:29.369> I'm<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.939> you

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
both whey and casein protein I'm so you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.060 
both whey and casein protein I'm so you
get<00:00:30.150> slow<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.810> fast<00:00:31.109> proteins<00:00:31.619> before<00:00:31.949> your

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
get slow and fast proteins before your

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.959 
get slow and fast proteins before your
workout<00:00:32.300> each<00:00:34.070> serving<00:00:35.070> comes<00:00:35.250> about<00:00:35.430> 81

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
workout each serving comes about 81

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.610 
workout each serving comes about 81
calories<00:00:36.540> which<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.780> pretty<00:00:37.020> high<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
calories which is pretty high for a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.380 
calories which is pretty high for a
pre-workout<00:00:38.129> drink<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.730> let's<00:00:39.120> go<00:00:39.180> ahead<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
pre-workout drink but let's go ahead and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.729 
pre-workout drink but let's go ahead and
talk<00:00:39.450> about<00:00:39.600> some<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> other<00:00:40.110> ingredients

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
talk about some of the other ingredients

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.160 
talk about some of the other ingredients
so<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> first<00:00:42.000> complexes<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.960> here

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so one of the first complexes in here

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
so one of the first complexes in here
that<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.440> listed<00:00:43.860> as<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> amino<00:00:44.670> acid<00:00:45.120> blend

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
that it's listed as a amino acid blend

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.380 
that it's listed as a amino acid blend
it's<00:00:45.930> kind<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.230> designed<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.969> give<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.120> more

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it's kind of designed to give you more

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.869 
it's kind of designed to give you more
absorption<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.260> help<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:50.640> more

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
absorption and help you kind of get more

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
absorption and help you kind of get more
out<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.329> other<00:00:51.480> ingredients<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.350> get

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
out of the other ingredients and you get

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.439 
out of the other ingredients and you get
I<00:00:52.980> mean<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> asked<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.030> l-leucine

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
I mean I asked it's like l-leucine

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.869 
I mean I asked it's like l-leucine
l-arginine<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.530> they're<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.340> there<00:00:56.820> for

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
l-arginine and they're really there for

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.000 
l-arginine and they're really there for
absorption<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:57.719> also<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.140> help<00:00:58.410> you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
absorption but they also do help you

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.619 
absorption but they also do help you
know<00:00:59.129> repair<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> muscles<00:01:00.120> during<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
know repair the muscles during the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.689 
know repair the muscles during the
workouts<00:01:01.020> kind<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.410> extends<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:02.039> sets<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you can get more and build a little more

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.100 
you can get more and build a little more
lean<00:01:07.500> muscle<00:01:07.530> mass<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:09.420> next<00:01:09.600> blend<00:01:09.869> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
lean muscle mass and your next blend is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.149 
lean muscle mass and your next blend is
going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> blend<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.650> stimulants<00:01:11.070> and
