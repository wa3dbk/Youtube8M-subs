00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.880 

so<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:00.960> lesson<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.380> going<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.560> be<00:00:01.650> about

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
so this lesson is going to be about

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.249 
so this lesson is going to be about
playing<00:00:02.159> closed<00:00:02.639> position<00:00:03.210> triads<00:00:03.780> on<00:00:04.020> bass

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
playing closed position triads on bass

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.079 
playing closed position triads on bass
and<00:00:04.529> we're<00:00:05.130> gonna<00:00:05.220> be<00:00:05.400> thinking<00:00:05.580> about<00:00:05.850> these

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
and we're gonna be thinking about these

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.730 
and we're gonna be thinking about these
shapes<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.629> little<00:00:06.899> bit<00:00:07.140> differently<00:00:07.500> than

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
shapes a little bit differently than

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.709 
shapes a little bit differently than
what<00:00:08.370> we<00:00:08.490> normally<00:00:08.670> do<00:00:08.970> when<00:00:09.179> we<00:00:09.300> are<00:00:09.510> thinking

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
what we normally do when we are thinking

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.379 
what we normally do when we are thinking
about<00:00:09.900> triads<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.280> playing<00:00:11.550> things<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.210> note

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
about triads and playing things one note

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.560 
about triads and playing things one note
at<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.630> time<00:00:13.549> normally<00:00:14.549> when<00:00:15.059> we're<00:00:15.179> doing<00:00:15.420> that

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
at a time normally when we're doing that

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.300 
at a time normally when we're doing that
we<00:00:16.230> have<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.440> tendency<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.890> always<00:00:17.160> think

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
we have the tendency to always think

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.920 
we have the tendency to always think
from<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.580> bottom<00:00:17.880> up<00:00:18.060> for<00:00:18.480> example<00:00:18.810> if<00:00:18.869> we

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
from the bottom up for example if we

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.090 
from the bottom up for example if we
have<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> D<00:00:19.320> major<00:00:19.529> triad<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.460> D<00:00:20.760> F<00:00:21.119> sharp<00:00:21.180> a

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
have a D major triad we have D F sharp a

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.320 
have a D major triad we have D F sharp a
obviously<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.279> start<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:23.609> DS<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.090> D<00:00:24.150> major

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
obviously we start with DS and D major

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.439 
obviously we start with DS and D major
triad<00:00:24.769> even<00:00:25.769> if<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.189> even<00:00:27.150> if<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.359> an

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
triad even if it's a even if it's an

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.710 
triad even if it's a even if it's an
inversion<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:28.170> example<00:00:28.560> second<00:00:29.039> inversion

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
inversion for example second inversion

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.420 
inversion for example second inversion
where<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.929> fifth<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> bottom<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.250> have

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
where the fifth is on the bottom we have

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.430 
where the fifth is on the bottom we have
a<00:00:33.140> D<00:00:34.140> F<00:00:34.500> sharp<00:00:35.450> it's<00:00:36.450> natural<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:36.960> us<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.290> think

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
a D F sharp it's natural for us to think

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.600 
a D F sharp it's natural for us to think
like<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:38.010> we're<00:00:38.160> base<00:00:38.309> players

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
like that because we're base players

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.080 
like that because we're base players
it's<00:00:39.239> also<00:00:39.390> most<00:00:40.200> amusing<00:00:40.440> theory<00:00:41.010> forces<00:00:41.940> us

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
it's also most amusing theory forces us

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.690 
it's also most amusing theory forces us
into<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.480> sort<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.780> mindset<00:00:43.170> where<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:44.520> now

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
into the sort of mindset where we're now

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
into the sort of mindset where we're now
going<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> think<00:00:45.149> about<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.690> terms<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
going to think about it in terms of the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.869 
going to think about it in terms of the
top<00:00:46.500> note<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.129> building<00:00:47.399> from<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> top

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
top note and then building from the top

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.520 
top note and then building from the top
note<00:00:48.120> down<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.750> there's<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.050> good<00:00:49.170> reason<00:00:49.200> for

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
note down and there's a good reason for

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.189 
note down and there's a good reason for
this<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.860> I'll<00:00:49.980> explain<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.640> second

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
this and I'll explain it in a second

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.569 
this and I'll explain it in a second
let's<00:00:52.199> first<00:00:52.469> start<00:00:52.590> with<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.829> basic<00:00:53.039> C<00:00:53.399> major

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
let's first start with a basic C major

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.029 
let's first start with a basic C major
triad<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.329> closed<00:00:54.510> position<00:00:54.890> normally<00:00:55.890> we'll

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
triad in closed position normally we'll

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.299 
triad in closed position normally we'll
think<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.149> gene<00:00:57.870> cool<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:59.129> we're

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
think see the gene cool now we're

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.529 
think see the gene cool now we're
thinking<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.850> differently<00:01:00.239> we're<00:01:00.359> gonna

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
thinking of it differently we're gonna

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.360 
thinking of it differently we're gonna
start<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> C<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.379> top<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.280> we're

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
start with the C on top and then we're

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.680 
start with the C on top and then we're
gonna<00:01:02.460> build<00:01:02.670> down<00:01:02.850> from<00:01:03.120> there<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.510> have

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
gonna build down from there so we have

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.940 
gonna build down from there so we have
seen<00:01:04.080> G<00:01:06.290> instead<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.439> C<00:01:08.280> eg<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.180> C<00:01:09.600> G<00:01:09.950> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
seen G instead of C eg we have C G and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.870 
seen G instead of C eg we have C G and
so<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.520> our<00:01:11.670> shape<00:01:11.880> right<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.729> C

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
so this is our shape right here the C

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.030 
so this is our shape right here the C
major<00:01:15.060> triad<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.630> C<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.020> top<00:01:16.259> which<00:01:16.740> ends<00:01:16.920> up

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
major triad with C on top which ends up

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.010 
major triad with C on top which ends up
being<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.340> same<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> first<00:01:18.210> inversion<00:01:18.509> C

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
being the same as a first inversion C

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.679 
being the same as a first inversion C
major<00:01:19.200> triad<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:20.189> more<00:01:20.729> importantly<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.570> our

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
major triad but more importantly for our

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.910 
major triad but more importantly for our
purposes<00:01:22.080> right<00:01:22.140> now<00:01:22.409> we're<00:01:22.590> thinking<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
purposes right now we're thinking of

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.149 
purposes right now we're thinking of
this<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> C<00:01:23.460> major<00:01:23.640> shape<00:01:23.939> with<00:01:24.119> C<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.479> top

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
this as the C major shape with C on top

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.210 
this as the C major shape with C on top
we<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.610> course<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:27.000> E<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.360> top<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
we can do this of course with E on top a

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.490 
we can do this of course with E on top a
G

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
G

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.240 
G
or<00:01:31.190> ECG<00:01:32.230> there<00:01:33.230> we<00:01:33.320> go<00:01:33.440> which<00:01:33.710> ends<00:01:33.860> up<00:01:33.950> being<00:01:34.010> a

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
or ECG there we go which ends up being a

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.190 
or ECG there we go which ends up being a
second<00:01:34.580> inversion<00:01:34.820> triad<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:35.900> course<00:01:36.110> we

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
second inversion triad and of course we

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.030 
second inversion triad and of course we
can<00:01:36.320> do<00:01:36.380> with<00:01:36.530> Gionta

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
can do with Gionta

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.510 
can do with Gionta
G<00:01:37.750> C<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:40.430> these<00:01:40.550> are<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.820> three<00:01:41.030> shapes<00:01:42.250> of<00:01:43.250> C

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
G C so these are the three shapes of C

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.310 
G C so these are the three shapes of C
major<00:01:43.729> but<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.450> way<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.720> we<00:01:44.840> arrived<00:01:45.110> at

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
major but the way that we arrived at

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.120 
major but the way that we arrived at
them<00:01:45.470> in<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.680> way<00:01:45.800> that<00:01:45.979> we're<00:01:46.100> thinking

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
them in the way that we're thinking

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.250

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.740 
about them is with the top note being

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
sort of our or Nexus that's where we're

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.859

thinking of top note me on top C on top
Gionta<00:01:54.700> can<00:01:55.700> do<00:01:55.790> this<00:01:55.910> of<00:01:56.030> course<00:01:56.060> with<00:01:56.360> all

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
Gionta can do this of course with all

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.370 
Gionta can do this of course with all
the<00:01:56.630> all<00:01:56.810> four<00:01:57.470> types<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:57.800> triads<00:01:59.140> we<00:02:00.140> can<00:02:00.290> do

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
the all four types of triads we can do

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.090 
the all four types of triads we can do
it<00:02:00.530> with<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.710> minor<00:02:01.040> tread<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:01.610> C<00:02:01.970> G<00:02:02.630> B<00:02:03.140> flat<00:02:03.440> E

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
it with a minor tread so C G B flat E

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:13.900 
it with a minor tread so C G B flat E
flat<00:02:04.399> G<00:02:04.729> C<00:02:05.800> G<00:02:06.800> E<00:02:07.100> flat<00:02:07.550> C<00:02:11.950> cool<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.580> we<00:02:13.700> can<00:02:13.820> do

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
flat G C G E flat C cool so we can do

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.350 
flat G C G E flat C cool so we can do
that<00:02:14.060> with<00:02:14.180> diminished<00:02:14.690> triad<00:02:15.040> C<00:02:16.040> D<00:02:16.670> flat<00:02:16.970> E

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
that with diminished triad C D flat E

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
of course G flat B flat C and that one

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.110 
of course G flat B flat C and that one
is<00:02:24.320> probably<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.860> least<00:02:25.010> practical<00:02:25.280> try<00:02:25.820> it's

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
is probably the least practical try it's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.600 
is probably the least practical try it's
very<00:02:26.380> yeah<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:27.620> kind<00:02:27.800> of<00:02:27.830> annoying<00:02:28.070> stretch

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
very yeah it's kind of annoying stretch

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.770 
very yeah it's kind of annoying stretch
and<00:02:28.820> it<00:02:28.880> doesn't<00:02:29.120> really<00:02:29.239> sound<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.660> great

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
and it doesn't really sound that great

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.170 
and it doesn't really sound that great
anyway<00:02:30.190> we<00:02:31.190> can<00:02:31.310> also<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.670> with<00:02:31.730> augmented

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
anyway we can also do it with augmented

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.940 
anyway we can also do it with augmented
triads<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.690> remember<00:02:32.989> augmented<00:02:33.410> triads<00:02:33.770> are

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
triads and remember augmented triads are

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.500 
triads and remember augmented triads are
symmetrical<00:02:34.640> which<00:02:34.940> means<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.420> the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
symmetrical which means that the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.060 
symmetrical which means that the
intervals<00:02:35.930> in<00:02:36.170> between<00:02:36.530> each<00:02:36.709> one<00:02:36.739> of<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
intervals in between each one of the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.949 
intervals in between each one of the
notes<00:02:37.310> are<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.120> same<00:02:38.360> they're<00:02:38.660> all<00:02:38.690> major

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
notes are the same they're all major

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.870 
notes are the same they're all major
thirds<00:02:39.320> so<00:02:39.709> that<00:02:39.950> basically<00:02:40.100> means<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.700> we

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
thirds so that basically means that we

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.340 
thirds so that basically means that we
have<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.000> same<00:02:41.269> exact<00:02:41.600> chord<00:02:41.870> shape<00:02:42.110> no

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
have the same exact chord shape no

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.820 
have the same exact chord shape no
matter<00:02:42.530> where<00:02:42.769> we<00:02:42.799> are<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.269> triad<00:02:44.540> so<00:02:45.019> C<00:02:45.380> G

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
matter where we are in the triad so C G

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.229 
matter where we are in the triad so C G
sharp<00:02:46.070> C<00:02:47.650> G<00:02:48.650> sharp<00:02:48.920> G<00:02:49.430> sharp<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.850> C<00:02:52.060> it's<00:02:53.060> kind<00:02:53.209> of

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
sharp C G sharp G sharp a C it's kind of

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.440 
sharp C G sharp G sharp a C it's kind of
a<00:02:53.330> nice<00:02:53.840> thing<00:02:54.049> to<00:02:54.080> play<00:02:54.769> play<00:02:55.070> around<00:02:55.250> with

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
a nice thing to play play around with

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.630 
a nice thing to play play around with
anyway<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:56.510> those<00:02:57.290> are<00:02:57.470> those<00:02:57.709> are<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.920> basic

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
anyway so those are those are the basic

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.640 
anyway so those are those are the basic
chord<00:02:59.269> shapes<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.720> basic<00:02:59.959> tries<00:03:00.170> if<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.500> can

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
chord shapes and basic tries if you can

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.259 
chord shapes and basic tries if you can
go<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:00.920> practice<00:03:01.010> them<00:03:01.430> but<00:03:02.030> more

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
go and practice them but more

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.300 
go and practice them but more
importantly<00:03:02.329> why<00:03:03.049> why<00:03:03.380> did<00:03:03.530> we<00:03:03.650> do<00:03:03.769> it<00:03:03.920> why<00:03:04.100> did

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
importantly why why did we do it why did

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.800 
importantly why why did we do it why did
we<00:03:04.430> do<00:03:04.549> it<00:03:04.670> like<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.820> well<00:03:05.239> it's<00:03:05.390> important

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
we do it like that well it's important

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.060 
we do it like that well it's important
because<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.170> concept<00:03:06.560> called<00:03:06.709> chord

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
because of the concept called chord

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.060 
because of the concept called chord
melody<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:08.360> basically<00:03:08.660> says<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.799> given

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
melody it basically says that in a given

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.530 
melody it basically says that in a given
chord<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.489> top<00:03:10.730> note<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.239> one<00:03:11.390> that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
chord the top note is the one that

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.140 
chord the top note is the one that
really<00:03:11.750> matters<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.440> if<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.250> arrange<00:03:13.549> chords

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
really matters and if you arrange chords

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.240 
really matters and if you arrange chords
in<00:03:14.269> a<00:03:14.329> certain<00:03:14.600> way<00:03:14.780> it's<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.590> top<00:03:15.860> note<00:03:16.100> which

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
in a certain way it's the top note which

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.069 
in a certain way it's the top note which
is<00:03:16.400> going<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.670> sound<00:03:17.060> like<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.420> melody<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
is going to sound like the melody the

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.370 
is going to sound like the melody the
melody<00:03:18.110> note<00:03:18.730> in<00:03:19.730> this<00:03:19.850> way<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.180> court<00:03:20.630> guitar

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
melody note in this way the court guitar

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.110 
melody note in this way the court guitar
players<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:21.950> piano<00:03:22.130> players<00:03:22.370> they've<00:03:22.910> known

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
players and piano players they've known

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.660 
players and piano players they've known
this<00:03:23.239> forever

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
this forever

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.030 
this forever
they<00:03:24.120> can<00:03:24.300> create<00:03:24.569> melodies<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.740> ear

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
they can create melodies and the ear

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.880 
they can create melodies and the ear
naturally<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.640> drawn<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.209> taught<00:03:27.569> note

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
naturally is drawn to the taught note

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.680 
naturally is drawn to the taught note
and<00:03:28.890> by<00:03:29.160> thinking<00:03:29.520> of<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.880> by<00:03:30.330> thinking<00:03:30.630> of

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
and by thinking of it by thinking of

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.270 
and by thinking of it by thinking of
these<00:03:30.840> shapes<00:03:31.080> this<00:03:31.230> way<00:03:31.410> we<00:03:31.860> can<00:03:32.010> sort<00:03:32.250> of

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
these shapes this way we can sort of

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.339 
these shapes this way we can sort of
draw<00:03:32.760> not<00:03:33.060> only<00:03:33.239> our<00:03:33.390> ear<00:03:33.599> but<00:03:33.840> our<00:03:33.959> sort<00:03:34.290> of

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
draw not only our ear but our sort of

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.809 
draw not only our ear but our sort of
mindset<00:03:34.770> in<00:03:34.980> terms<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.310> like<00:03:35.459> how<00:03:35.640> we're

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
mindset in terms of like how we're

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.430 
mindset in terms of like how we're
thinking<00:03:36.120> about<00:03:36.180> playing<00:03:36.450> chords<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.200> top

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440
