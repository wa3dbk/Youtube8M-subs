they know how to fight a fire but they

they know how to fight a fire but they

cutting extinguisher was and we found

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.820 
cutting extinguisher was and we found
out<00:05:11.890> that<00:05:12.190> was<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.510> solution<00:05:13.510> for<00:05:13.810> our<00:05:14.050> Navy

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
out that was the solution for our Navy

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.470 
out that was the solution for our Navy
to<00:05:15.610> get<00:05:15.820> a<00:05:16.030> safer<00:05:16.660> environment<00:05:16.960> on<00:05:17.470> together

without risk here the crews health and
safety<00:05:24.940> in<00:05:25.570> the<00:05:25.720> beginning<00:05:26.080> of<00:05:26.170> 2009<00:05:26.950> we

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
safety in the beginning of 2009 we

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.740 
safety in the beginning of 2009 we
bought<00:05:28.090> our<00:05:28.450> two<00:05:29.200> first<00:05:29.790> systems<00:05:30.790> with<00:05:31.300> the

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
bought our two first systems with the

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.650 
bought our two first systems with the
cutting<00:05:32.260> extinguishers<00:05:32.920> to<00:05:33.580> our<00:05:33.790> Corvette

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
cutting extinguishers to our Corvette

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.850 
cutting extinguishers to our Corvette
Stockholm<00:05:35.350> and<00:05:35.670> Maru<00:05:36.670> air<00:05:37.090> was<00:05:37.960> going<00:05:38.410> down<00:05:38.830> to

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
Stockholm and Maru air was going down to

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.990 
Stockholm and Maru air was going down to
Aden<00:05:39.610> Bay<00:05:39.820> to<00:05:40.480> fight<00:05:40.750> fires<00:05:41.700> hopefully<00:05:42.700> in<00:05:42.880> the

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
Aden Bay to fight fires hopefully in the

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.100 
Aden Bay to fight fires hopefully in the
future<00:05:43.150> we<00:05:44.020> won't<00:05:44.260> need<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:45.780> do<00:05:46.780> any<00:05:47.050> ba

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
future we won't need to do any ba

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.010 
future we won't need to do any ba
attacks<00:05:51.060> because<00:05:52.060> we<00:05:52.240> could<00:05:52.420> use<00:05:52.630> the<00:05:52.810> cutting

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
attacks because we could use the cutting

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.570 
attacks because we could use the cutting
extinguisher<00:05:53.620> first<00:05:54.370> attack

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
extinguisher first attack

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.000 
extinguisher first attack
and<00:05:56.390> I<00:05:56.630> think<00:05:56.960> that<00:05:57.440> this<00:05:57.620> cutting

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
and I think that this cutting

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.550 
and I think that this cutting
extinguishers<00:05:58.640> would<00:05:59.120> be<00:05:59.270> a<00:05:59.300> splendid<00:06:00.020> tool

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
extinguishers would be a splendid tool

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.140 
extinguishers would be a splendid tool
even<00:06:00.980> for<00:06:01.400> the<00:06:02.000> merchant<00:06:02.420> fleet<00:06:02.720> because<00:06:04.150> they

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
even for the merchant fleet because they

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.320 
even for the merchant fleet because they
have<00:06:05.360> lesser<00:06:06.050> crews<00:06:06.670> than<00:06:07.670> we<00:06:07.850> have<00:06:08.090> in<00:06:08.300> the

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
have lesser crews than we have in the

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.080 
have lesser crews than we have in the
Navy<00:06:08.600> and<00:06:09.050> they<00:06:10.010> have<00:06:10.190> left<00:06:10.430> a<00:06:10.580> time<00:06:10.850> for

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
Navy and they have left a time for

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.770 
Navy and they have left a time for
education<00:06:11.180> than<00:06:11.930> we<00:06:11.960> have<00:06:12.860> in<00:06:13.010> the<00:06:13.160> Navy<00:06:13.450> so<00:06:14.450> I

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
education than we have in the Navy so I

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.620 
education than we have in the Navy so I
think<00:06:14.900> for<00:06:15.830> the<00:06:15.920> merchant<00:06:16.310> fleet<00:06:16.580> that<00:06:17.150> this

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
think for the merchant fleet that this

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.360 
think for the merchant fleet that this
would<00:06:17.840> be<00:06:17.990> splendid<00:06:18.320> if<00:06:18.680> they<00:06:18.890> had<00:06:19.070> the

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
would be splendid if they had the

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.950 
would be splendid if they had the
capping<00:06:19.670> extinguishers<00:06:20.330> on<00:06:20.570> board<00:06:20.780> their

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
capping extinguishers on board their

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.720 
capping extinguishers on board their
ships<00:06:21.200> also<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.970> crew<00:06:23.180> on<00:06:23.510> board<00:06:23.570> ships<00:06:24.730> felt

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
ships also the crew on board ships felt

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.630 
ships also the crew on board ships felt
much<00:06:26.030> safer<00:06:26.630> when<00:06:27.470> they<00:06:27.620> had<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:28.220> cutting

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
much safer when they had the cutting

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.490 
much safer when they had the cutting
extinguisher<00:06:29.270> on<00:06:29.300> board<00:06:29.630> I<00:06:29.780> could<00:06:29.960> do<00:06:30.080> the

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
extinguisher on board I could do the

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.560 
extinguisher on board I could do the
first<00:06:30.770> attack<00:06:31.100> with<00:06:31.370> that<00:06:31.510> instead<00:06:32.510> of

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
first attack with that instead of

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.330 
first attack with that instead of
Dillingham<00:06:33.260> ba<00:06:33.620> attack<00:06:34.220> now<00:06:34.880> in<00:06:35.380> 2010<00:06:36.380> we<00:06:37.160> have

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
Dillingham ba attack now in 2010 we have

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.900 
Dillingham ba attack now in 2010 we have
four<00:06:37.640> units<00:06:37.910> on<00:06:38.330> board<00:06:38.510> our<00:06:38.660> Corvettes<00:06:39.410> and

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
four units on board our Corvettes and

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.090 
four units on board our Corvettes and
hopefully<00:06:40.910> next<00:06:41.120> year<00:06:41.450> we<00:06:41.630> will<00:06:41.780> have<00:06:42.100> five

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
hopefully next year we will have five

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.520 
hopefully next year we will have five
more<00:06:43.340> units<00:06:43.910> on<00:06:44.150> board<00:06:44.390> our<00:06:44.510> new<00:06:44.900> these<00:06:45.320> big
