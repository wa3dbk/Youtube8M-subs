science in Antarctica let's start with

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.150 
science in Antarctica let's start with
the<00:00:06.120> obvious<00:00:06.240> one<00:00:06.629> first<00:00:06.930> for<00:00:07.109> me<00:00:07.379> sure<00:00:07.770> and

this you join unfurl this yeah so this
is<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.940> flag<00:00:15.540> from<00:00:15.929> Halle<00:00:16.710> Bay<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.400> Antarctica

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
is a flag from Halle Bay in Antarctica

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.200 
is a flag from Halle Bay in Antarctica
now<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> raw<00:00:18.779> Society<00:00:19.289> had<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.980> base<00:00:20.490> in

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
now the raw Society had a base in

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.620 
now the raw Society had a base in
Antarctica<00:00:21.660> from<00:00:22.670> 1956<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:23.910> International

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
Antarctica from 1956 for International

Antarctica from 1956 for International
Geophysical<00:00:24.900> Year<00:00:25.560> actually<00:00:26.519> went<00:00:26.789> down

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
Geophysical Year actually went down

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.009 
Geophysical Year actually went down
there<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.240> study<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.289> region<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.939> in<00:00:29.939> 1956<00:00:30.689> as

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
there to study the region and in 1956 as

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.810 
there to study the region and in 1956 as
you<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.260> see<00:00:31.410> from<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> label<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.399> raised

you can see from the label it raised
this<00:00:33.120> flag<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.079> they<00:00:34.260> were<00:00:34.320> down<00:00:34.590> in

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
this flag so they were down in

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.069 
this flag so they were down in
Antarctica<00:00:35.149> they<00:00:36.149> raise<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.719> flag<00:00:36.930> for

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
Antarctica they raise this flag for

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.970 
Antarctica they raise this flag for
about<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> year<00:00:38.190> yep<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:40.050> harsh<00:00:40.530> winds

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
about a year yep in the the harsh winds

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.639 
about a year yep in the the harsh winds
of<00:00:41.250> Antarctica<00:00:41.910> indeed<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.930> see<00:00:43.200> it's

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
of Antarctica indeed and we can see it's

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.160 
of Antarctica indeed and we can see it's
really<00:00:44.250> gone<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.610> town<00:00:44.850> here<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:46.020> is

see<00:03:05.390> penguin<00:03:05.810> eggs<00:03:05.990> you<00:03:06.290> think<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.740> Scott<00:03:07.160> and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
see penguin eggs you think of Scott and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.330 
see penguin eggs you think of Scott and
that<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:08.510> crazy<00:03:08.870> dangerous<00:03:09.440> mission<00:03:09.710> it<00:03:10.100> was

that that crazy dangerous mission it was

that that crazy dangerous mission it was

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
truly truly awful and this is why they

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.240 
truly truly awful and this is why they
did<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:15.350> I'm<00:03:15.470> betting<00:03:15.680> even<00:03:16.070> those

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
did that and I'm betting even those

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.640 
did that and I'm betting even those
people<00:03:16.280> in<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.790> 1950s<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.990> get<00:03:18.140> this<00:03:18.290> penguin

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
people in the 1950s to get this penguin

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.290 
people in the 1950s to get this penguin
egg<00:03:18.890> they<00:03:19.310> probably<00:03:19.520> didn't<00:03:19.820> have<00:03:19.880> an<00:03:20.120> easy

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
egg they probably didn't have an easy

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.570 
egg they probably didn't have an easy
ride<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.900> they<00:03:21.650> didn't<00:03:21.860> have<00:03:21.920> an<00:03:22.070> easy<00:03:22.160> war

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
ride of it they didn't have an easy war

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.330 
ride of it they didn't have an easy war
ride<00:03:22.790> but<00:03:23.000> at<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.540> stage<00:03:23.930> what<00:03:24.740> Disney<00:03:25.190> was

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
ride but at that stage what Disney was

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.370 
ride but at that stage what Disney was
making<00:03:25.670> movies<00:03:25.850> in<00:03:26.270> our<00:03:26.570> dark<00:03:26.870> because<00:03:27.230> so

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
making movies in our dark because so

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.860 
making movies in our dark because so
things<00:03:27.590> were<00:03:27.770> just<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.820> little<00:03:29.120> bit<00:03:29.270> better<00:03:29.510> by

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
things were just a little bit better by

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.080 
things were just a little bit better by
the<00:03:29.930> 50s<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:30.740> it<00:03:30.920> really<00:03:31.190> just<00:03:31.490> shows<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:32.060> how

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
the 50s so it really just shows you how

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.170 
the 50s so it really just shows you how
in<00:03:32.960> the<00:03:33.290> course<00:03:33.620> of<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.310> relatively<00:03:34.850> short

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
indeed getting to look at ourselves and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.660 
indeed getting to look at ourselves and
the<00:03:51.410> people<00:03:51.710> at<00:03:51.800> home<00:03:51.920> have<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.280> even<00:03:52.520> better

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
the people at home have it even better

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.460 
the people at home have it even better
because<00:03:53.270> you<00:03:53.450> don't<00:03:53.630> even<00:03:53.780> have<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.050> move<00:03:54.260> off

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
because you don't even have to move off

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.260 
because you don't even have to move off
your<00:03:54.650> chair<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.100> you<00:03:55.550> get<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.820> see<00:03:55.940> an<00:03:56.030> emperor

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
your chair and you get to see an emperor

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:05.530 
your chair and you get to see an emperor
penguin<00:03:56.300> egg<00:03:56.800> there<00:03:57.800> you<00:03:57.860> go<00:04:04.240> perhaps<00:04:05.240> most

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
penguin egg there you go perhaps most

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.260 
penguin egg there you go perhaps most
interestingly<00:04:05.870> we<00:04:06.530> are<00:04:06.680> reminded<00:04:07.460> here<00:04:07.730> that

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
interestingly we are reminded here that

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.720 
interestingly we are reminded here that
this<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.570> a<00:04:08.600> standard<00:04:08.990> yard<00:04:09.440> but<00:04:10.130> only<00:04:10.400> at

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
this is a standard yard but only at

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.449 
this is a standard yard but only at
sixty<00:04:11.420> two<00:04:11.660> point<00:04:12.080> one<00:04:12.530> Fahrenheit

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
sixty two point one Fahrenheit

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.760 
sixty two point one Fahrenheit
temperature<00:04:14.270> has<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.570> be<00:04:14.660> absolutely<00:04:15.260> exact

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
temperature has to be absolutely exact

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.670 
temperature has to be absolutely exact
to<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:16.520> get<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:16.850> to<00:04:16.970> measure<00:04:17.180> precisely<00:04:17.989> one

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
to to get it to measure precisely one
