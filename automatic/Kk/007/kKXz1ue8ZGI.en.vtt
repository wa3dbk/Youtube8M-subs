00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.450
 I am posting a gunpla production video It is gunpla 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.970
 From this time 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:13.580
 This was previously circulated only 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.580
 We would like to enter the neodymium of production 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.550
 But I was refused a little time from the opening video 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:28.949
 Second I want to be the same policy 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.410
 Still doing it is from where you cut out the parts First than not out also key at all part 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.180
 I think that want to go 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:40.750
 The day I really change the par setting 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.750
 Yeah It's day-to-day Dashitsu's also hard time 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.460
 wh 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.980
 What 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.980
 It is this kind of matte you Kamasei kun become such a state 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.790
 Hmm 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.399
 2 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.300
 Hmm 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.880
 Hmm 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.680
 ani 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.560
 I'm waiting 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.490
 It has been 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.490
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.770
 It is an arty mind that started 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.770
 The body is not a 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.780
 I'm putting 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.240
 It's about to assemble this time 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.790
 I tried to make the pass all weapons 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.470
 The number of parts is not so much though 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:58.830
 It is such a state because it is large 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.240
 First corner so I think let's make the same kind of procedure as Gundam, which Well has been made until now 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.750
 It is from putting 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.750
 this 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.250
 I think that I want to do Sumiri with it in the corner that I always use 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.319
 Minutes 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.110
 Hmm 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.310
 Yup 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.120
 7 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.870
 me 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.870
 me 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.300
 Hmm 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.190
 Hmm 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.190
 Hmm 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.020
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.030
 me 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.030
 Whoa 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.900
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.900
 Masu Tei 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.830
 Completed in the corner took quite some time 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.290
 Hmm 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.470
 It takes a little time still wider area the part is large minute violet 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.470
 I will 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:22.349
 It is this part, and I do not do it at all for nine minutes or so, but how is this? 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:32.770
 It is this part 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.790
 Such place of parts that do this kind of looks like this part of the place referred to in the blueprint place 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.620
 Though 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.050
 The photos of Well now remains blueprint 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:45.080
 Though this color of this gray remains 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.720
 Because I think I want to put out a metallic feeling a little 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:52.200
 I think this is going to be painting a little 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:58.349
 I think that the color is titanium gold 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:02.950
 It is a good color that I used when I made the previous Psycho Zak 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:05.460
 I think I'm in the picture for a moment now 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.490
 It is a dog feel 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:14.790
 For now 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:18.900
 Here of pants After inking the paint is dry because has ended like this Chosumi purse 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.259
 I 'm going to come and put on Tsukiekispoon and I want to do so 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.259
 I'm sorry
