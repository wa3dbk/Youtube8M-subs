using the thern a milliliter horses the

were very careful in choosing our

were very careful in choosing our

balloon volume other studies have

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.570 
balloon volume other studies have
previously<00:01:07.229> inflated<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.010> 80<00:01:08.250> milliliters

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
previously inflated to 80 milliliters

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.370 
previously inflated to 80 milliliters
and<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.119> were<00:01:09.210> somewhat<00:01:09.510> uncomfortable<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and we were somewhat uncomfortable of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.310 
and we were somewhat uncomfortable of
going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.040> high<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.580> inflation<00:01:12.320> when

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
going to that high of a inflation when

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.679 
going to that high of a inflation when
we<00:01:13.470> blow<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.070> 30<00:01:14.400> milliliter<00:01:14.909> bard<00:01:15.240> balloon

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
we blow up a 30 milliliter bard balloon

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.929 
we blow up a 30 milliliter bard balloon
it<00:01:16.170> meets<00:01:16.350> quite<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> bit<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.890> resistance<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.580> 60

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
it meets quite a bit of resistance of 60

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
it meets quite a bit of resistance of 60
milliliters<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.869> felt<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
milliliters so we felt that that was the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.700 
milliliters so we felt that that was the
inflation<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.060> most<00:01:21.270> safe<00:01:21.509> too

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
inflation that is most safe too

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.280 
inflation that is most safe too
we<00:01:23.280> also<00:01:23.460> did<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.760> few<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.090> our<00:01:24.180> own<00:01:24.210> tests<00:01:25.170> in

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
we also did a few of our own tests in

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.690 
we also did a few of our own tests in
our<00:01:25.380> own<00:01:25.530> Hospital<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.130> had<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> very<00:01:26.520> difficult

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
our own Hospital I had a very difficult

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.140 
our own Hospital I had a very difficult
time<00:01:27.090> getting<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.350> explode<00:01:29.130> per<00:01:29.640> se<00:01:29.880> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
time getting this to explode per se and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.760 
time getting this to explode per se and
actually<00:01:30.659> could<00:01:30.780> never<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.590> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
actually could never get it to do that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.710 
actually could never get it to do that
so<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.070> feel<00:01:32.250> very<00:01:32.280> comfortable<00:01:32.580> at<00:01:33.030> 60<00:01:33.390> cc's

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
so we feel very comfortable at 60 cc's

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.390 
so we feel very comfortable at 60 cc's

some<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> other<00:01:55.920> things<00:01:56.190> people

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
some of the other things people

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.070 
some of the other things people
discussed<00:01:56.880> using<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.300> multi<00:01:57.600> balloons<00:01:57.960> is

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
discussed using with multi balloons is

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.660 
discussed using with multi balloons is
actually<00:01:58.380> an<00:01:58.470> infusion<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:59.009> water<00:01:59.250> through

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
actually an infusion of water through

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.880 
actually an infusion of water through
that<00:01:59.820> Foley<00:02:00.060> balloon<00:02:00.390> wash<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.350> around<00:02:01.679> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that Foley balloon wash it around the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.430 
that Foley balloon wash it around the
outside<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.640> intact<00:02:02.910> fetal<00:02:03.330> membranes<00:02:03.509> is

another<00:02:04.710> method<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.100> people<00:02:05.429> consider<00:02:05.729> and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
another method that people consider and

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.249 
another method that people consider and
then<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.420> course<00:02:06.479> there's<00:02:06.810> your<00:02:06.960> standard

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
then of course there's your standard

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.979 
then of course there's your standard
oxytocin<00:02:08.009> as<00:02:08.190> well<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:09.390> every<00:02:09.570> patient<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
oxytocin as well and for every patient I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.240 
oxytocin as well and for every patient I
believe<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.320> a<00:02:10.410> combination<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:11.100> those

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
believe it's a combination of those

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.830 
believe it's a combination of those
things<00:02:11.580> depending<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> individual

thousand dollars per dose a fully bloom

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.840 
thousand dollars per dose a fully bloom
is<00:02:30.360> very<00:02:30.630> cheap<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.260> matter<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.590> dollars<00:02:32.130> and

is very cheap in a matter of dollars and

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.420 
is very cheap in a matter of dollars and
is<00:02:33.000> disposable<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:34.709> very<00:02:34.920> safe<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.250> use
