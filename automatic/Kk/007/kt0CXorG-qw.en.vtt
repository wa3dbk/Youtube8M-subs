00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello to all and welcome to this after 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.420
 session that will be devoted to star trek 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.560
 into darkness of jay-jay abrams then 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.700
 for those who do not know 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.630
 not too much star trek I may have done 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.580
 a quick return on 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.900
 originally star trek it's a series of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.050
 science fiction that was broadcast in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.880
 the sixties between 1966 and 1969 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.199
 so it was a pretty short series but 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.570
 which is over time has become 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.490
 extremely cult tells the adventures 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.810
 of the crew of the uss enterprise who 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.679
 is a spaceship whose mission 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.900
 is to go to the far reaches of the galaxy 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.829
 to discover new worlds and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.210
 as I said it's a series that 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.100
 has become extremely cult and who has 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.510
 gave birth to other series which in 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.790
 are excrescences as at the end 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.250
 of the 80s appeared the star series 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.830
 next generation trek of deep space nine 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 corporate travelers in the years 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.690
 2000 so some series and this series 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.720
 of origin has also given rise to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.980
 several movies 6 1 6 movies in all that 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.420
 are based on the adventures of 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.830
 the original crew and at the end of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.240
 2000s was making the decision to 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.220
 redo movies that would be based on 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.690
 the adventures of this original crew 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.130
 with the only difference that he 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.540
 would be reboot that would tell the 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.409
 youth of his characters how they 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.759
 have become the characters that one 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.159
 know and that's what made it 2 days 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.920
 abrams coming out the the star trek from 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.659
 2009 is now the second installment of 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.009
 this reboot star trek into darkness who 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.810
 was released this Wednesday in theaters 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.859
 so djediat brahms samek fascinating I 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.149
 find because he's the perfect example 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.920
 of how the cinema these 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.990
 hybrids and in the 2000s to the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.609
 junction of the late 1990s and the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.319
 early 2000s there are several 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:26.729
 series that appeared that have 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.259
 started to take the codes 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.880
 cinematographers to readapt them to 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.460
 their format I think especially about 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.719
 Sopranos or Six Feet Under dared to 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.009
 other series yet that created 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.960
 a whole new generation of series 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.340
 who should be inspired more and more 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.109
 cinematographic codes but in 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.700
 rare and adapting to their format with a 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.979
 longer temporality including who 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.270
 allowed to develop its codes to 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.889
 create a dramaturgy even more 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.389
 intense as it unfolded on 

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:51.509
 more time suddenly it's longer 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:52.920
 that a movie by definition is sacred 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.189
 really series absolutely 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.840
 fantastic and cinema seeing this the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.819
 cinema began to get re inspired to his 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.039
 turn of his series and there is a species 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.659
 of cyclical influenced who set themselves who 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.950
 started the diagrams I 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.779
 said it was a good example of this 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.250
 hybrid side growing between the cinema 

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:09.580
 and the series because I think he 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.869
 am really synthesize 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.820
 two influences and the two formats of 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.810
 the best possible way he has 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.640
 started to make itself known to the great 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.680
 public with the espionage series aka 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.120
 then of course with lost which he has 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.200
 been the show runner for a certain 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.580
 time and then he passed the hand 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.460
 damon lindelof we forget a little too much 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.140
 often there was fringe then the series 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.210
 but especially in parallel he started 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.910
 a career as a director 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.710
 with impossible mission iii with super 8 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.150
 which was a most personal film and 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.100
 that many have seen as a tribute to 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.360
 spielberg from the big time and the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.620
 incredible stuff with abrams it's 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.060
 that between the first episode of alias that 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.100
 I could see some ten years 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.990
 star trek into darkness today he 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.640
 there is a coherence there is a common thread 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.840
 the guy has imposed a style that 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.610
 is his alone and that's 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.780
 extremely strong from the start i 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.950
 the impression that his writing on 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.810
 TV series was already extremely 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.700
 cinematographic and subsequently his 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.050
 writing about the movies was very 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.850
 influenced by his experience with 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.959
 series so he really knew to be at 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.220
 horse on both formats of the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.720
 best way possible what in 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.730
 I think was one of the best 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.050
 choice for course directed star trek 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.910
 it's hard to know who is doing the 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.170
 style the director there are some 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.160
 elements that are more identifiable than 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.670
 others like for example and the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.600
 themes 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.560
 there are certain themes that 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.900
 often come back in the playoffs and 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.610
 in abrams movies or even 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.680
 small visuals like for example the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.820
 clear line facts which abrams use is 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.860
 sure abuses in his films today 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.450
 these halo species of aestheticized light 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.170
 that it is needed everywhere but 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.250
 overall it's true it's 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.690
 difficult to understand what makes the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.040
 paw of a director I am 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.239
 questionnary about the style of abrams and 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.010
 I realized that it's also 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.750
 and especially not badly related to the notion of 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.190
 dosage the way of doses and everything 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.320
 that there will be in the film the structure 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.910
 overall scenario the events the 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.280
 dramaturgy incursions into humor 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.620
 it's really a notion of 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.150
 dosing dosing feeling is what 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.260
 will in my opinion also to say the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.940
 difference between a good and a bad 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.190
 blockbuster a lot of blockbusters that 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.940
 I could appreciate that I saw I am 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.019
 on the paper there was a lot 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.310
 elements that could have annoyed me 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.820
 in but as he was skillfully 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.920
 dose 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.209
 it worked and this notion of 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.680
 dosage is what characterizes to my 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.450
 meaning all the success that is star trek 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.160
 into darkness to make you history 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.540
 very schematically it's a terrorist 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.459
 which targets starfleet academy 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.330
 which is the institution that deals with 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.970
 space exploration 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.980
 the terrorist runs away the hero 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.260
 kirk and his crew of him and his 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.660
 scents take him on the hunt and 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.680
 from there suspense good I will not 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.880
 get into the different details of 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.769
 the intrigued nor the flips of 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.759
 situation not to spoil you 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.319
 but I can tell you that I loved this 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.669
 movie really it's been a long time since 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:23.379
 I did not much like a blockbuster 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.300
 for me it's an optimized version of 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.520
 what already made the success of the film 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.319
 from 2009 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.729
 the 2009 movie were very good but 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.319
 we felt that there was still a whole 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.060
 little bit cautious and shy by 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.580
 report to all star patrimony 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.110
 trek they had to respect and we 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.120
 feel that he wanted above all to show his 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.830
 fidelity all the time of course taking 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.900
 a new path in terms of aesthetics 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.099
 in terms of rhythm and all there because 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.930
 that they wanted to impose gels rams 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.039
 and into darkness assures even better this 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.720
 big gap between loyalty and 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.220
 innovations especially thanks to a 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.139
 pretty clever and intelligent scenario that 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.150
 sits on one of the cult moments and 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.150
 very famous of the original star trek 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.550
 but without repeating it by offering 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.780
 an inverted mirror effect that has pretty much 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.979
 seen and that it already works 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.330
 objectively a film in terms of 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.680
 dramaturgy even for spectators 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.000
 who have no knowledge of 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.500
 the universe of star trek but that 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.909
 also works as part of this 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.259
 universe and that's what's very strong this 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.880
 which was already appreciable in the movie 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.250
 of 2009 and who is even more so with 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.810
 those with into darkness secure abrams has 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.789
 succeeded in infusing real energy 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.120
 renewed in star patrimony 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.340
 trek 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.599
 which was not won considering 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.099
 the overwhelming and massive institution that 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.560
 worried star trek but he really 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.349
 managed to instill a breathe a 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.969
 juvenile energy in the film what is 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.289
 completely fitting with also with the 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.560
 thematic of the film and the youth of 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.000
 character he describes and abrams has 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.469
 managed to do that especially by having 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.690
 the intelligence not to confuse the 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.710
 rhythm and speed it's a pitfall that 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.020
 a lot of blockbusters 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.000
 bottom I find but he does not do it 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.409
 not so abrams knows how to take his time 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.270
 but here too the intelligence and the nerve 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.590
 in his scenario of re-funding this 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.360
 universe of star trek in the world 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.009
 current or rather in a sensation of 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.080
 current world especially as you the 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.539
 will see with certain imagery that are 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.979
 inherited directly from 9/11 that 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.479
 are really very very sassy I know 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.740
 not how was it received in the United States 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.630
 but in any case it's laudable enough 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.370
 to have managed to re invoked to all this 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.020
 imaginary not in an aim of 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.219
 sensationalism or two to pull a 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.330
 larmichette but really because 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.289
 it's justified in the scenario 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.639
 so that's star trek are all 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.690
 darkness I strongly advise you 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.000
 he has many who like to say 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.409
 apparently that abrams signed his empire 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.040
 counter attack which is not quite 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.200
 true i find 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.820
 the movie is darker of course than 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.440
 that of 2009 when it also touches on 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.330
 foundations of what we believe in 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.310
 characters but overall it remains a 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.360
 pretty bright film is carried by 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.890
 hope so it's not quite 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.540
 true but what a beautiful transition for 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.850
 finish this video because like a lot 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.900
 of you probably know it 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.650
 abrams is going to be the director of the 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.750
 next star wars 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.580
 episode 7 which is supposed to come out in 2015 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.750
 and that will be produced by disney I 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.370
 you confess I do not understand at all the 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.110
 most people's reactions since 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.860
 a few months but personally 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.240
 the departure I found it was a 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.280
 good idea to update the cape goes hand 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.480
 already disney it's not mickey mouse they 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.370
 have a product of very good films 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.470
 whether they are mainstream or not and 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.730
 secondly finally george lucas is a 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.780
 very good businessman it's a very good 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.960
 producer is a very good creator 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.730
 of history but it's not a very good 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.230
 director and above all it's a very 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.790
 bad writer but really very 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.320
 bad writer Thursday is he 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.140
 must I speak again of the monologue 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.130
 sand in star wars episode 2 so 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.480
 the fact that he passes the hand I find 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.070
 already that's a good thing at the base 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.180
 but besides that it's abrams that get 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.030
 occupy it's the best news 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.950
 possible if people still doubt it 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.870
 star trek into darkness is above all 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.010
 a proof that djédjé brahms is part 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.090
 people who are best placed for 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.740
 make a star wars 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.960
 this is my opinion on star trek into 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.040
 darkness I forgot the 3d kills she is 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.240
 really good and I do not say that 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.010
 often I am not necessarily a 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.640
 defender of the 3d its use in the 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.230
 current cinema 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.730
 but here she is really good 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.560
 it gives full meaning to some of 

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.970
 aesthetic choices of abrams including the 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.080
 side lines flers with all the assets 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.270
 the halos of light that gives meaning 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.920
 from depth to image so that's it 

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.280
 have fun watching them this movie 

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.280
 and I'll see you soon
