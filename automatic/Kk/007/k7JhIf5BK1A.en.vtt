00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
really fast and it really does help when

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.700 
really fast and it really does help when
you're<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.509> kill<00:01:18.720> streak<00:01:18.990> same<00:01:19.530> with

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
you're going to kill streak same with

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.770 
you're going to kill streak same with
silencer<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.610> enemies<00:01:20.939> can't<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:21.689> you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
silencer the enemies can't see when you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.840 
silencer the enemies can't see when you
shoot<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.619> does<00:01:23.009> help<00:01:23.040> out<00:01:23.490> having

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
shoot so it really does help out having

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.730 
shoot so it really does help out having
the<00:01:23.880> tiles<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.900> does<00:01:25.080> only<00:01:25.290> make<00:01:25.560> it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the tiles up but that does only make it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.590 
the tiles up but that does only make it
really<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.220> close<00:01:26.430> range<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.360> i<00:01:27.390> definitely

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
really for close range so i definitely

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.319 
really for close range so i definitely
recommend<00:01:27.960> rushing<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:29.070> camping<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
recommend rushing not camping with the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.420 
recommend rushing not camping with the
vector<00:01:30.659> with<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> silencer<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
vector with a silencer on it so the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
vector with a silencer on it so the
actual<00:01:32.579> perks<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.450> i<00:01:33.540> use<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> lightweight

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
actual perks that i use a lightweight

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
actual perks that i use a lightweight
scavenger<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.130> dexterity<00:01:35.670> i<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:35.939> dexterity

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
scavenger in dexterity i like dexterity

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.810 
scavenger in dexterity i like dexterity
push<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.840> off<00:01:36.930> obviously<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.500> min<00:01:37.829> faster<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
push it off obviously a min faster and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
push it off obviously a min faster and
it<00:01:38.909> helps<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> lot<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.750> we've<00:01:40.320> also<00:01:40.470> got

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it helps a lot and we've also got

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.679
