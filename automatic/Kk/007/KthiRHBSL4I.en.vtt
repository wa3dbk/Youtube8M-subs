00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
basically spoke about ground tutorial 5

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
basically spoke about ground tutorial 5
online<00:01:01.590> introducing<00:01:02.520> things<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:02.940> pets<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
online introducing things like pets and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.000 
online introducing things like pets and
animals<00:01:03.539> now<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:04.589> actually<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.949> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
animals now I'm actually going to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
animals now I'm actually going to
basically<00:01:05.400> speak<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:06.000> these<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.390> same<00:01:06.659> but

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
basically speak about these the same but

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.960 
basically speak about these the same but
so<00:01:07.439> I've<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> different<00:01:08.310> opinion<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.790> them

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
so I've got a different opinion on them

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
so I've got a different opinion on them
so<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:09.750> actually<00:01:10.020> thought<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.590> grand

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
so we all actually thought that grand

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.859 
so we all actually thought that grand
theft<00:01:10.979> auto<00:01:11.159> 5<00:01:11.610> would<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:11.939> introducing

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
theft auto 5 would be introducing

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.469 
theft auto 5 would be introducing
animals<00:01:13.470> into<00:01:13.920> GTA<00:01:14.220> 5<00:01:14.549> online<00:01:14.790> when<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
animals into GTA 5 online when a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.660 
animals into GTA 5 online when a
next-gen<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.259> released<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.890> obviously<00:01:17.430> this

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
next-gen was released and obviously this

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.219 
next-gen was released and obviously this
didn't<00:01:17.970> happen<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.509> we've<00:01:18.930> heard<00:01:19.080> nothing

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
didn't happen and we've heard nothing

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.590 
didn't happen and we've heard nothing
about<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.950> year<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:21.000> personally<00:01:21.360> thought

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
about this year and I personally thought

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480 
about this year and I personally thought
is<00:01:21.750> becoming<00:01:22.140> gruffalo<00:01:22.590> 5<00:01:22.799> next<00:01:23.070> gen<00:01:23.159> because

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
is becoming gruffalo 5 next gen because

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.160 
is becoming gruffalo 5 next gen because
we<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.790> actually<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.330> capabilities<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
we do actually have the capabilities and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.429 
we do actually have the capabilities and
the<00:01:25.680> hardware<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.670> actually<00:01:27.540> introduced<00:01:28.080> UTA

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
the hardware to actually introduced UTA

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
the hardware to actually introduced UTA
five<00:01:28.710> animals<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:29.549> why<00:01:29.700> rocks<00:01:29.970> are<00:01:30.119> haven't

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
online I'm not too sure because

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.230

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
animals into the single player then I

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.649 
animals into the single player then I
think<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> bit<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.520> extra<00:01:53.939> boost<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.479> bit

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
think with a bit of extra boost in a bit

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.990 
think with a bit of extra boost in a bit
of<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.930> sort<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.200> an<00:01:55.290> extra<00:01:55.680> bit<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> work<00:01:56.460> then

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
of a sort of an extra bit of work then

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.580 
of a sort of an extra bit of work then
they<00:01:57.299> could<00:01:57.360> probably<00:01:57.659> introduced<00:01:58.110> at<00:01:58.290> GTA

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
they could probably introduced at GTA

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.740 
they could probably introduced at GTA
online<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.729> if<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.909> guys<00:02:00.060> are<00:02:00.210> thinking<00:02:00.390> what

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
online but if you guys are thinking what

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.170

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
about pets what about these pets which

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.929 
about pets what about these pets which

could become too grandpa to apply online
personally<00:02:05.939> I'm<00:02:06.090> not<00:02:06.119> too<00:02:06.509> sure<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:06.960> there

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
personally I'm not too sure if there

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.710 
personally I'm not too sure if there
would<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.469> pets<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.069> GTA<00:02:08.399> 5<00:02:08.610> online<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.509> see

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
would be pets in GTA 5 online I can see

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.669 
would be pets in GTA 5 online I can see
it<00:02:09.840> would<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.020> something<00:02:10.229> which<00:02:10.440> would<00:02:10.530> be

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it would be something which would be

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.610 
it would be something which would be
quite<00:02:11.009> complicated

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
quite complicated

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.589 
quite complicated
to<00:02:11.799> add<00:02:11.950> in<00:02:12.129> as<00:02:12.340> well<00:02:12.909> as<00:02:13.150> something<00:02:13.510> which

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
to add in as well as something which

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.509 
to add in as well as something which
won't<00:02:13.840> really<00:02:14.019> make<00:02:14.200> sense<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:15.220> reason

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
won't really make sense and the reason

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.160 
won't really make sense and the reason
for<00:02:15.549> that<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.940> because<00:02:15.970> if<00:02:16.510> rocks<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.900> did

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
for that is because if rocks I did

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.500 
for that is because if rocks I did

something something which would just be

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.550 
something something which would just be

we could have the kind of pet which
basically<00:03:40.269> follows<00:03:40.780> us<00:03:40.900> around<00:03:41.049> our

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
basically follows us around our

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.319 
basically follows us around our
apartment<00:03:41.470> if<00:03:41.949> we<00:03:42.069> wanted<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.459> which<00:03:43.150> would

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
apartment if we wanted to which would

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.879 
apartment if we wanted to which would
kind<00:03:43.569> of<00:03:43.599> make<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.989> bit<00:03:44.230> more<00:03:44.260> sense<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.769> be<00:03:44.859> a

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
kind of make a bit more sense to be a

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.009 
kind of make a bit more sense to be a
bit<00:03:45.069> more<00:03:45.220> fun<00:03:45.549> but<00:03:46.090> whether<00:03:46.299> or<00:03:46.510> not<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:46.840> would

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
bit more fun but whether or not it would

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.289 
bit more fun but whether or not it would
be<00:03:47.079> more<00:03:47.769> suitable<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:48.639> whether<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.060> will

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
be more suitable and whether it will

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.180 
be more suitable and whether it will
work<00:03:49.329> more<00:03:49.840> I'm<00:03:50.049> not<00:03:50.230> too<00:03:50.440> sure<00:03:50.709> but

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
work more I'm not too sure but

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.220 
work more I'm not too sure but
definitely<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:51.790> don't<00:03:52.120> think<00:03:52.389> we'd<00:03:52.510> have<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.750> GTA

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230
