how<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.170> make<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.560> starburst<00:00:02.129> wrapper<00:00:02.550> chain<00:00:02.790> I

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
how to make a starburst wrapper chain I

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.030 
how to make a starburst wrapper chain I
have<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.810> starburst<00:00:04.170> wrappers<00:00:04.560> I'm<00:00:04.859> going<00:00:04.980> to

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
have to starburst wrappers I'm going to

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.349 
have to starburst wrappers I'm going to
actually<00:00:05.130> show<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:05.400> twice<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.029> then<00:00:06.210> show

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
actually show you twice and then show

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.509 
actually show you twice and then show
you<00:00:06.420> how<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.629> put<00:00:06.779> them<00:00:06.870> together<00:00:07.370> put<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
you how to put them together put the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.640 
you how to put them together put the
purple<00:00:08.910> on<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.030> side<00:00:09.330> for<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.750> moment<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.290> we'll

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
purple on a side for a moment and we'll

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.870 
purple on a side for a moment and we'll
do<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.920> orange<00:00:11.190> one<00:00:11.370> first<00:00:12.500> first<00:00:13.500> step<00:00:13.880> is

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
do the orange one first first step is

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.990 
do the orange one first first step is
have<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:16.440> pic<00:00:16.920> which<00:00:17.100> side<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.550> want<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.850> cover

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
have a pic which side you want to cover

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.150 
have a pic which side you want to cover
up<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.510> want<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.810> cover<00:00:18.930> pale<00:00:19.350> sides<00:00:19.650> if<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.980> get

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
up I want to cover pale sides if I get

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.120 
up I want to cover pale sides if I get
more<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.490> color<00:00:20.720> and<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:22.230> fold<00:00:22.470> one<00:00:22.980> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
more of the color and you fold one of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.540 
more of the color and you fold one of
the<00:00:23.250> longer<00:00:23.609> end<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:24.000> over<00:00:24.830> in<00:00:25.830> towards<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the longer end is over in towards the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.400 
the longer end is over in towards the
middle<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.269> want<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> get<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
middle you want to get it so that it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.359 
middle you want to get it so that it
covers<00:00:28.619> up<00:00:28.939> exactly<00:00:29.939> half<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.679> the<00:00:31.679> area<00:00:32.040> so

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
covers up exactly half of the area so

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.700 
covers up exactly half of the area so
you've<00:00:32.489> got<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.969> pale<00:00:33.780> stripe<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.440> colored

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
you've got a pale stripe and a colored

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.119 
you've got a pale stripe and a colored
stripe<00:00:35.040> through<00:00:35.340> exactly<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.969> same<00:00:36.149> size

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
stripe through exactly the same size

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.830 
stripe through exactly the same size
then<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.489> fold<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.910> side<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.360> don't<00:00:39.390> want

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
then you fold the side you don't want

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.459 
then you fold the side you don't want
the<00:00:40.649> pale<00:00:40.890> side<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.430> case<00:00:42.110> back<00:00:43.110> over

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the pale side in this case back over

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.440 
the pale side in this case back over
that<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.370> basically<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:44.910> fold<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that so basically you just fold the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
that so basically you just fold the
whole<00:00:45.570> thing<00:00:45.840> thirds<00:00:47.750> then<00:00:48.750> take<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.710> piece

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
whole thing thirds then take this piece

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.939 
whole thing thirds then take this piece
that's<00:00:50.250> fold<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.579> into<00:00:50.730> thirds<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.710> fold<00:00:52.710> it

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
that's fold it into thirds and fold it

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.479 
that's fold it into thirds and fold it
in<00:00:53.250> half<00:00:54.860> hmm<00:00:57.379> make<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.559> no<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.309> long

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
in half hmm make you no one really long

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.389 
in half hmm make you no one really long
piece<00:01:00.320> then<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.469> need<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> make<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> crease<00:01:02.219> in

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
piece then you need to make a crease in

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.609 
piece then you need to make a crease in
the<00:01:02.489> middle<00:01:02.789> show<00:01:03.570> exactly<00:01:03.989> where<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.379> middle

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the middle show exactly where the middle

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.640 
the middle show exactly where the middle
is<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.450> hold<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.140> two<00:01:07.380> end

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
is so do that you hold the two end

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.330 
is so do that you hold the two end
points<00:01:08.159> together<00:01:09.950> pinch<00:01:10.950> them<00:01:11.220> together

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
points together pinch them together

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.440 
points together pinch them together
exactly<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.740> pull<00:01:13.740> out<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.700> loop<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.390> it

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
exactly and pull out the loop so it

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.530 
exactly and pull out the loop so it
makes<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.750> crease<00:01:16.049> right<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> end<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:18.360> want

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
makes a crease right at the end you want

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.050 
makes a crease right at the end you want
to<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:18.720> sure<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:19.280> two<00:01:20.280> prongs<00:01:20.670> here

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
to make sure your two prongs here

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.700 
to make sure your two prongs here
exactly<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.689> same<00:01:21.900> length<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.409> was<00:01:22.500> off<00:01:22.680> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
exactly the same length that was off a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.700 
exactly the same length that was off a
little<00:01:22.979> bit<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.460> I'm<00:01:23.520> trying<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.939> again<00:01:24.710> all

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
little bit so I'm trying it again all

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 
little bit so I'm trying it again all
right<00:01:26.180> they're<00:01:27.180> pretty<00:01:27.390> close<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.659> same

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
right they're pretty close the same

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.950 
right they're pretty close the same
length<00:01:28.430> then<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.579> take<00:01:29.759> both<00:01:30.150> ends<00:01:30.780> these

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
length then you take both ends these

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.830 
length then you take both ends these
prongs<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.650> one<00:01:32.070> at<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> time<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:33.360> fold<00:01:33.630> them

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
prongs and one at a time you fold them

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.460 
prongs and one at a time you fold them
in<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.140> middle<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.909> so

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.620 

you<00:01:38.860> end<00:01:39.070> up<00:01:39.220> with<00:01:39.460> two<00:01:39.760> prongs<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.330> each

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
you end up with two prongs that each

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.730 
you end up with two prongs that each
have<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:41.200> hole<00:01:41.440> in<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.830> middle<00:01:41.920> of<00:01:42.130> them<00:01:43.650> see<00:01:44.650> if

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
have a hole in the middle of them see if

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.160 
have a hole in the middle of them see if
I<00:01:44.860> can<00:01:45.040> pooch<00:01:45.970> out<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.330> hole<00:01:46.540> so<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:46.840> can<00:01:46.960> see

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
I can pooch out the hole so you can see

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.610 
I can pooch out the hole so you can see
it<00:01:47.260> better<00:01:51.360> yeah<00:01:52.360> there<00:01:52.810> now<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.350> can<00:01:53.530> see

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
it better yeah there now you can see

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.020 
it better yeah there now you can see
they<00:01:53.740> both<00:01:53.920> have<00:01:54.160> holes<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:54.700> them<00:01:54.850> they're

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
they both have holes in them they're

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.870 
they both have holes in them they're
technically<00:01:55.450> loops<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:57.250> want<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.550> end<00:01:57.700> up

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
technically loops you want to end up

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.660 
technically loops you want to end up
doing<00:01:58.180> that<00:01:58.330> twice<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.920> I'll<00:02:00.040> plot<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.340> purple

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
doing that twice so I'll plot the purple

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.760 
doing that twice so I'll plot the purple
one<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.450> again<00:02:01.540> this<00:02:02.110> time<00:02:02.380> with<00:02:02.440> less

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
one and do it again this time with less

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.990 
one and do it again this time with less
explanation<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:03.580> more<00:02:03.700> folding<00:02:05.790> fold<00:02:06.790> it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
explanation and more folding fold it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.910 
explanation and more folding fold it
into<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.420> middle<00:02:08.340> fold<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.520> other<00:02:09.670> end<00:02:09.970> over

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
into the middle fold the other end over

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.900 
into the middle fold the other end over
fold<00:02:11.920> all<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.490> in<00:02:12.790> half<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.430> now<00:02:15.730> you've

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
fold all of that in half and now you've

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.230 
fold all of that in half and now you've
got<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.150> long<00:02:16.330> piece<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:17.680> want<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:18.090> hold<00:02:19.090> the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
got the long piece you want to hold the

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.930 
got the long piece you want to hold the
ends<00:02:19.540> together<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.070> make<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.610> crease

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
ends together so you can make the crease

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.170 
ends together so you can make the crease
exactly<00:02:22.510> in<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.660> middle<00:02:23.340> fold<00:02:24.340> both<00:02:24.670> ends

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
exactly in the middle fold both ends

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.280 
exactly in the middle fold both ends
into<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.690> crease<00:02:25.959> in<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.500> middle<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
into the crease in the middle so and

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.820 
into the crease in the middle so and
then<00:02:32.890> fold<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.340> whole<00:02:33.520> thing<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:33.880> half<00:02:34.830> all

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
then fold the whole thing in half all

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.900 
then fold the whole thing in half all
right<00:02:36.390> now<00:02:37.390> I've<00:02:37.600> got<00:02:37.890> two<00:02:39.060> links<00:02:40.060> for<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.330> chain

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
right now I've got two links for a chain

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.009 
right now I've got two links for a chain
to<00:02:42.910> grab<00:02:43.150> these<00:02:43.450> links<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:46.150> can<00:02:46.330> see<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.900> on

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
to grab these links you can see that on

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.310 
to grab these links you can see that on
on<00:02:47.830> these<00:02:48.100> things<00:02:48.370> on<00:02:48.640> one<00:02:49.000> side<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.600> can<00:02:50.290> see

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
on these things on one side you can see

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.930 
on these things on one side you can see
there's<00:02:50.769> just<00:02:50.950> two<00:02:51.130> different<00:02:51.250> layers<00:02:51.640> to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
there's just two different layers to

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.270 
there's just two different layers to
each<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.239> prongs<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:53.890> other<00:02:53.950> side

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
each of the prongs and on the other side

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.210 
each of the prongs and on the other side
there's<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.640> whole<00:02:54.940> bunch<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.600> layers<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:57.040> want

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
there's a whole bunch of layers you want

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.500 
there's a whole bunch of layers you want
to<00:02:57.310> make<00:02:57.430> sure<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:57.640> when<00:02:57.970> you're<00:02:58.060> pushing

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
to make sure that when you're pushing

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.210 
to make sure that when you're pushing
one<00:02:58.720> link<00:02:58.959> into<00:02:59.260> another<00:02:59.500> you're<00:02:59.860> pushing

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
one link into another you're pushing

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.990 
one link into another you're pushing
into<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:01.019> only<00:03:02.019> two<00:03:02.260> pieces<00:03:02.500> side<00:03:03.250> otherwise

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
into the only two pieces side otherwise

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000 
into the only two pieces side otherwise
it's<00:03:04.420> really<00:03:04.660> really<00:03:05.320> difficult<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.890> then<00:03:08.890> you

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
it's really really difficult so then you

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.330 
it's really really difficult so then you
take<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:11.110> have<00:03:11.200> two<00:03:11.350> prongs<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:11.890> two<00:03:12.040> prongs

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
take you have two prongs and two prongs

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.690 
take you have two prongs and two prongs
and<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.640> want<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:12.910> get<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:14.010> two<00:03:15.010> prongs<00:03:15.340> fit

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
and you want to get it so two prongs fit

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.229 
and you want to get it so two prongs fit
into<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.330> other<00:03:16.510> pieces<00:03:16.930> two<00:03:17.260> problems<00:03:18.239> into

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
into the other pieces two problems into

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.140 
into the other pieces two problems into
the<00:03:19.330> little<00:03:19.570> loops<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.370> they<00:03:21.580> will

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
the little loops so that they will

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.050 
the little loops so that they will
actually<00:03:22.510> go<00:03:22.690> through<00:03:23.340> that's<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.820> part

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
actually go through that's the part

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.370 
actually go through that's the part
that's<00:03:25.120> kind<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.630> pain<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.260> will

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
that's kind of a pain and it will

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.620 
that's kind of a pain and it will
probably<00:03:26.560> take<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:26.920> some<00:03:27.070> practice<00:03:27.630> I'm

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
probably take you some practice I'm

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.990 
probably take you some practice I'm
usually<00:03:28.870> not<00:03:29.080> quite<00:03:29.590> this<00:03:29.769> bad<00:03:29.980> at<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.340> but<00:03:30.670> hey

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
usually not quite this bad at it but hey

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.400 
usually not quite this bad at it but hey
I'm<00:03:31.209> on<00:03:31.330> camera<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:31.900> I'm<00:03:31.989> supposed<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.290> be

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
I'm on camera so I'm supposed to be

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.979 
I'm on camera so I'm supposed to be
nervous<00:03:32.560> right<00:03:33.120> yeah<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:34.510> then<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.750> get<00:03:34.900> it

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
nervous right yeah so then you get it

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.820 
nervous right yeah so then you get it
pulled<00:03:35.230> through<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:37.560> they<00:03:38.560> are<00:03:38.620> now

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
pulled through and they are now

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.340 
pulled through and they are now
connected<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.489> can<00:03:39.610> see<00:03:39.880> how<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.810> purple<00:03:41.200> one

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
connected you can see how the purple one

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.960 
connected you can see how the purple one
is<00:03:41.380> on<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.650> outside<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.250> red<00:03:42.400> one<00:03:42.580> on<00:03:42.610> both

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
is on the outside of the red one on both

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.080 
is on the outside of the red one on both
sides<00:03:43.500> but<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.950> middle

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
sides but in the middle

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.290 
sides but in the middle
they<00:03:47.930> are<00:03:48.220> not<00:03:49.220> they're<00:03:49.790> not<00:03:49.879> going<00:03:50.090> through

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
they are not they're not going through

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.690 
they are not they're not going through
the<00:03:50.420> same<00:03:50.599> prompt<00:03:50.989> that<00:03:51.650> way<00:03:51.830> you've<00:03:52.670> got

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
the same prompt that way you've got

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.449 
the same prompt that way you've got
started<00:03:53.500> then<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.830> can<00:03:54.980> do<00:03:55.069> that<00:03:55.190> about

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
started then you can do that about

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.540 
started then you can do that about
10,000<00:03:56.209> more<00:03:56.360> times<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:57.220> possibly<00:03:58.220> end<00:03:58.430> up

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
10,000 more times and possibly end up

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.750 
10,000 more times and possibly end up
with<00:03:58.760> something<00:03:58.940> I<00:03:59.360> can<00:04:00.290> do<00:04:00.379> this<00:04:00.530> my<00:04:01.250> giant

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
with something I can do this my giant

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.160 
with something I can do this my giant
starburst<00:04:02.150> wrapper<00:04:02.420> chain<00:04:02.629> is<00:04:02.840> something

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
starburst wrapper chain is something

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.640 
starburst wrapper chain is something
like<00:04:03.349> 40<00:04:03.739> feet<00:04:03.860> long<00:04:05.110> this<00:04:06.110> will<00:04:06.379> probably

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
like 40 feet long this will probably

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.559 
like 40 feet long this will probably
take<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.190> ridiculous<00:04:07.790> amount<00:04:07.819> of<00:04:08.030> time<00:04:08.239> and

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
take you a ridiculous amount of time and

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.839 
take you a ridiculous amount of time and
give<00:04:08.989> you<00:04:09.080> a<00:04:09.110> couple<00:04:09.290> of<00:04:09.440> cavities<00:04:09.860> so<00:04:10.250> do<00:04:10.730> it

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
give you a couple of cavities so do it

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.430 
give you a couple of cavities so do it
slowly<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.299> little<00:04:11.360> bit<00:04:11.629> of<00:04:11.750> time<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.230> brush

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
slowly a little bit of time and brush

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.180 
slowly a little bit of time and brush
regularly<00:04:13.930> all<00:04:14.930> right<00:04:15.110> now<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:15.739> can<00:04:15.920> even<00:04:15.980> see

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
regularly all right now you can even see

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.390 
regularly all right now you can even see
my<00:04:16.310> thumbs<00:04:16.579> up<00:04:16.729> because<00:04:16.880> cameras<00:04:17.750> too<00:04:17.870> close

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
my thumbs up because cameras too close

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.400 
my thumbs up because cameras too close
now
