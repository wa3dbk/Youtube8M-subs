00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.570
 you liked the workout 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.969
 I think it's interesting 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.969
 I do something like a garden for the first time and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.500
 let's talk about professional 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.500
 boxing 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.430
 in a week we will be waiting for Votkinsk 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.099
 said what you think about this fight and how 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.770
 it will form in my mind 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.989
 win yes i think we can 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.360
 cheat and not let see as cobweb 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.550
 it knocks I think Bernard Hopkins 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.420
 hurts from his shoulder 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.970
 injured 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.739
 or the back is injured I don't think that we 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.000
 we get 100 percent of what we like 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.980
 fans should get you thinking how 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.930
 only Hopkins will feel the power of Kovalev 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.559
 man just try to find a way 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.939
 avoid fight 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.280
 he will look for an easy escape route 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:02.680
 he will look for a way to give up evil 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.239
 and declare that his injury could 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.479
 talk about what you do in 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.220
 I am currently a coach 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.720
 professional boxing besides that i 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.400
 I work like we stuff everything 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.390
 I work constantly for me very 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.250
 loaded schedule it feels like I'm 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.150
 I am in all places at the same time I 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.060
 was in japan 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:27.280
 from japan came here i'm coming back to 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.990
 Wednesday and I think 1 well, just six hours 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.659
 because then we need to go to 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.460
 australia from australia i will go to 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.200
 mexico matiz swordsman back to japan 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.780
 december i 'll go to germany so i 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.250
 very busy if I'm not mistaken you worked 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.740
 with nicholas walters in front of him 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.710
 duel with us the dinner yes I worked 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.330
 fights with age so many 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.590
 believed that he would win but nonetheless 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.590
 the victory was impressive 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.170
 we must not forget that everything has 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.020
 beginning and the end 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.909
 new generations are coming in dnr one of 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.920
 the nicest people you can 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:11.009
 meet more and indeed among all 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.330
 people are a wonderful person he and his family 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:20.069
 just amazing people 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:21.660
 but unfortunately it is very cruel to him 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.230
 had to fight the mattress he was 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.090
 the champion 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.739
 he had to fight this rival 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.390
 the train is already here when we thought you were not 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.930
 think that after this fight career 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.090
 doner 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.010
 complete i don't think it's complete i 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.840
 I think that the donorâ€™s affairs will be much 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.700
 better if he fights first 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.920
 tricks or bantamweight 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.350
 I believe that he is still at the level of 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.049
 fighter when you take a step out of you when 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.000
 you take on more than you can master 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.209
 I think that the weight of the elevator for him it 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.190
 too on the bars said it would be 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:04.320
 make a fight between wolter females basil 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.060
 Lomachenko I do not really like fight games 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.459
 I think that this is a difficult fight 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.820
 Of course, he is still ready to meet 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.549
 by any 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.650
 these fighters occupy if you ask in 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.609
 motherboard say wait but still it's their 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.970
 work but i think both are now 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.170
 moving in different directions 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.390
 it seems to me that they should meet 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.740
 more when this fight is for everyone and 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.530
 more profitable than finance 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.090
 what do you think about Lomachenko I think that on 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.920
 great fighter and I think that he is not 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.820
 lost solido he was supposed to be 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.100
 numbers 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.540
 but unfortunately when you have a boyfriend 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.480
 which is so the lambs 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.640
 can do many things sorry 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.550
 no necessary changes were made to 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:51.330
 duel why are you so lovely 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.460
 the fighter had to be made changes 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.430
 but I learn from mistakes and I hope about what 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.350
 his mistakes he and his team because 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.990
 this teamwork is not about this 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.790
 man from the whole team everyone has their own 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.440
 work and everyone should do their want 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.280
 generally do if not then they have no place 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.280
 like a boxer 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.670
 worked at the corner mike alvarado in 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.560
 duel with Ruslan conductor after 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.410
 this ruslan went to search rice uniform 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.750
 and lost the battle 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.889
 do you think the camp deserved to win in 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.780
 tom match to your 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:30.630
 and be guided in a month from what you 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.610
 like with the observer but beyond that 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.090
 There are drawings that look battle under 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.370
 different angles and I'll tell you what 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.080
 if you watch will be live 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.060
 it is a different story than when 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:49.130
 you watch on TV and therefore 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.520
 may differ give you an example 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.919
 Brandon Rios 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.080
 when you fight brandon rio yourself 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.390
 it seems that he so often misses a beat 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.730
 and but in reality he misses wrong 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.680
 much as people think we do 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.560
 small movements that prevent 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.690
 drawing a clean gift and on tv 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.760
 this is not visible I did not see it because 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.760
 i was mind and watched it all me 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:20.389
 now come with erik got a fight with manny 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.639
 pakiao what do you think about this will weaken if 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.270
 in boxing someone has a chance that 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:29.569
 do it in practice saboteurs 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:34.159
 it's great because it's not easy 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:35.960
 work is not easy and won the lottery 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:39.349
 and he sort of won inside 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.509
 ray spatial it will earn money 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.520
 more than ever before if he 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:46.099
 win the one he was waiting for even greater 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.229
 thing in the future and every fighter 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:55.490
 amateur or professional and should 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:57.560
 ultimately experience success you 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.529
 worked with many fighters phenomenon 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.860
 100 of them are most enjoyable 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:02.860
 by man 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.500
 and when they are all nice people 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:14.330
 most fighters like boxing and in 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:17.669
 the amount they are very unpleasant people 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.030
 george enver never think that he 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.030
 superstar 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.120
 no plus johnson is a very good fighter 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.919
 wonderful on indiscreet is ordinary 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:34.669
 people will you be surprised when 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:37.500
 meet them they are ordinary people there 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.300
 I met twice to John Jones 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.960
 This I read many comments on 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.520
 him that he judge independently on 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.120
 when you meet him he is nice 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.789
 guy 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.500
 Here are the games when you meet them who 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:51.500
 you form your own opinion about them 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.020
 so I say they are modest and pleasant 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:01.319
 guys do you hear a lot of negative 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:05.849
 things of them also you need to understand that 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:07.560
 they will always be the center of attention 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:09.539
 situations when they don't want to give 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.409
 you interview because they are busy to 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:14.190
 or they don't want 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:15.930
 and wash it full right if they 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.900
 don't want to talk to you they don't 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.729
 should we don't need to turn and for 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.620
 against them and because until you 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:24.620
 find yourself in their place and you will not understand 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:33.599
 chest and a few words for Russian fighters 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:35.669
 maybe advice furniture silence 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:38.880
 proper nutrition your career will 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:41.009
 better if you know the model how 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:46.199
 prices over proper nutrition and how she 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:48.509
 important for a fighter when the fighter is right 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:52.289
 food on guest percy how to look 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:54.270
 give one hundred percent is the best advice 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:57.380
 for any athlete this is very 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:01.280
 important you work on your skills 

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.280
 aha period skills
