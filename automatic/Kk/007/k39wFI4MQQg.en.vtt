I just happen to brought along my old
Suzuki<00:00:39.840> winch<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.950> thing<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.340> actually

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
Suzuki winch this thing is actually

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.990 
Suzuki winch this thing is actually
rated<00:00:41.940> about<00:00:42.450> 750<00:00:43.350> kilos<00:00:43.739> which<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.670> nowhere

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
rated about 750 kilos which is nowhere

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.060 
rated about 750 kilos which is nowhere
near<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.539> capacity<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.289> car<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:46.829> it's

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
near the capacity of this car now it's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.170 
near the capacity of this car now it's
quite<00:00:47.280> an<00:00:47.399> interesting<00:00:47.550> thing<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.090> we

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
quite an interesting thing can we

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.270 
quite an interesting thing can we
actually<00:00:48.480> use<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> winch<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.140> small<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:50.100> pull

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
actually use a winch this small to pull

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.709 
actually use a winch this small to pull
something<00:00:50.520> these<00:00:50.730> damn<00:00:50.969> heavy<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.420> which<00:00:51.629> is

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
something these damn heavy out which is

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.670 
something these damn heavy out which is
about<00:00:51.870> three<00:00:52.140> tonnes

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
about three tonnes

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.430 
about three tonnes
the<00:00:53.250> answer<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.730> absolutely<00:00:53.850> yes<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.020> safety

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the answer is absolutely yes the safety

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.080 
the answer is absolutely yes the safety
factor<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.890> cables<00:00:56.399> about<00:00:56.610> three<00:00:56.940> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
factor and that cables about three to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
factor and that cables about three to
one<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.510> therefore<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> braking<00:00:58.260> capacity<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
one so therefore the braking capacity is

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.709 
one so therefore the braking capacity is
about<00:00:58.949> three<00:00:59.280> times<00:00:59.489> we<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.359> put<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> snatch

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
about three times we can put a snatch

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.959 
about three times we can put a snatch
block<00:01:00.750> onto<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.350> tree<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.670> gently

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
block onto that tree and we can gently

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
block onto that tree and we can gently
pull<00:01:03.239> some<00:01:03.480> power<00:01:03.690> onto<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.019> car<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.680> it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
pull some power onto this car and it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:13.160 
pull some power onto this car and it
will<00:01:04.890> quite<00:01:05.070> happily<00:01:05.100> pull<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.670> out

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.690 

you've<00:01:13.620> got<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.800> snatch<00:01:13.980> block<00:01:14.010> attached<00:01:14.550> to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.330 
pressures down a little bit of digging
and<00:01:42.930> I'm<00:01:43.080> cleaning<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.650> underneath<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.250> we

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and I'm cleaning up underneath and we

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.859 
and I'm cleaning up underneath and we
should<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.580> able<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.790> ready<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> go<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.630> yes

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
should be able to ready to go so yes

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.960 
should be able to ready to go so yes
certainly<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.590> will<00:01:46.680> work<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.190> lot<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.790> people

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
certainly it will work a lot of people

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.670 
certainly it will work a lot of people
ask<00:01:48.270> us<00:01:48.420> about<00:01:48.540> shear<00:01:48.930> pins<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.410> what<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.560> they

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
ask us about shear pins and what do they

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.890 
ask us about shear pins and what do they
do<00:01:49.740> these<00:01:50.610> two<00:01:50.910> things<00:01:50.940> here<00:01:51.509> these<00:01:51.750> little

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
do these two things here these little

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.170 
do these two things here these little
silver<00:01:52.259> bits<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:52.740> are<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:53.009> shear<00:01:53.220> pins<00:01:53.520> this

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
silver bits here are the shear pins this

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
silver bits here are the shear pins this
handle<00:01:54.720> operates<00:01:55.470> by<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.950> backward<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
handle operates by going backward and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.060 
handle operates by going backward and
forward<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:58.200> shear<00:01:58.530> pin<00:01:58.800> will

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
forward like so that shear pin will

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
forward like so that shear pin will
break<00:01:59.430> before<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> witch<00:02:00.330> lets<00:02:00.600> go<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.140> you

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
break before the witch lets go so you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.660 
break before the witch lets go so you
have<00:02:01.410> absolute<00:02:01.860> safety<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.369> you're<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.580> to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
have absolute safety if you're going to

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.550 
have absolute safety if you're going to
break<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.940> shear<00:02:03.149> pin<00:02:03.360> first<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.200> thing<00:02:04.410> will

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
break the shear pin first the thing will

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.749 
break the shear pin first the thing will
not<00:02:04.649> let<00:02:04.830> go<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.040> will<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.280> lock<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.610> and

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
not let go it will just lock up and

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.270 
not let go it will just lock up and
nothing<00:02:05.970> will<00:02:06.090> move
