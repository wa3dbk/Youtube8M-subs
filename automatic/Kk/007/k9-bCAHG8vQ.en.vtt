00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.090 

this<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> vertical<00:00:52.949> she<00:00:53.789> also<00:00:54.329> got<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:55.100> poor

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
this is a vertical she also got a poor

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.630 
this is a vertical she also got a poor
aerator<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.629> does<00:00:57.809> pull<00:00:58.050> cores<00:00:58.430> now<00:00:59.430> what

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
aerator so it does pull cores now what

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.749 
aerator so it does pull cores now what
will<00:00:59.760> happen<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.559> from<00:01:01.559> vertically<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:03.420> field

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
will happen is from vertically the field

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.749 
will happen is from vertically the field
we're<00:01:05.759> gonna<00:01:05.880> encourage<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:07.080> lot<00:01:08.009> of<00:01:08.070> lateral

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
we're gonna encourage a lot of lateral

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.240 
we're gonna encourage a lot of lateral
growth<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.659> runners<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> Bermuda<00:01:10.890> will

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
growth the runners of the Bermuda will

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.580 
growth the runners of the Bermuda will
begin<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.880> run<00:01:12.330> into<00:01:12.750> some<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.110> these<00:01:13.229> bare

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
begin to run into some of these bare

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.420 
begin to run into some of these bare
spots<00:01:14.299> we<00:01:15.299> also<00:01:15.509> do<00:01:15.869> our<00:01:16.020> heavy<00:01:16.290> feeding<00:01:16.860> this

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
spots we also do our heavy feeding this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.410 
spots we also do our heavy feeding this
time<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.970> year<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.229> Bermuda<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.180> should

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
time of year on the Bermuda so we should

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.870 
time of year on the Bermuda so we should
get<00:01:21.630> complete<00:01:22.619> coverage<00:01:23.190> here<00:01:23.520> within<00:01:23.700> a
