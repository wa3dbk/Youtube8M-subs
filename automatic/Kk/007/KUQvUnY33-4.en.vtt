00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.430

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.960

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.929
 Today the that and it may not be worth can not 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.019
 be less the one who loves so much and now 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.399

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.679

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.429

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.480
 here one 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.560
 two 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.560
 but in another 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.340
 are expected to come down here because if 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.340
 they are going to go there 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.200
 the thing gets complicated because I want to 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.159
 when evaluating the flight 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.960
 on the run, we are going well 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.550
 rent cars and just in case and 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.550
 well let's go there 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.429
 but dies 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.379
 let's specialist 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.120
 the state is there 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.519
 voucher voucher 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.230
 let's see yes 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.989
 why 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.030
 then now 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.420
 for the perfect some authors have to 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.420
 porcel 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.590
 let's see here the shooter helps 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.590
 very much the truth 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.590
 they will not be around here I guess 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.490
 is to continue here 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.030
 to catch these who go here if 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.030
 they wrote 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.670
 but fuck just spamming here 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.319
 so it will connect in pulling to see 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.470
 because it is the last we have 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.470
 taken away 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.740
 it will be quite useful that over here 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.170
 vale vale 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:52.120

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.120
 streak of 12 or 13 out there 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.840
 here we are going to close 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.000
 but if they take 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.870
 then I like it I like it more 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.870
 to arrange 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.350
 after all, find it 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.479

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.959

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.410

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.010

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:03.210
 kill or something if you can not go for the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.689
 water because they say that you kill more 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.880

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.410

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.200
 falls and rose 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.550
