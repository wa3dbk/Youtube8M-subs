and<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.479> first<00:02:03.719> time<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.079> tried<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.439> was<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.130> I

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
and the first time I tried it was like I

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.580 
and the first time I tried it was like I
was<00:02:05.250> kind<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.729> weird<00:02:05.909> flavor<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:07.110> then<00:02:07.259> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
was kind of a weird flavor but then it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.680 
was kind of a weird flavor but then it
grows<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> more<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.119> eat<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
grows on you the more you eat it the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.730 
grows on you the more you eat it the
more<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.110> want<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.709> so

gmo-free<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:58.410> was<00:02:59.410> reading<00:02:59.620> online<00:02:59.740> that<00:03:00.010> unit

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
gmo-free I was reading online that unit

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.010 
gmo-free I was reading online that unit
by<00:03:00.490> chia<00:03:00.760> seeds<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.210> come<00:03:01.450> from<00:03:01.600> China

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
by chia seeds that come from China

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.800 
by chia seeds that come from China
because<00:03:02.860> they're<00:03:03.010> poor<00:03:03.310> quality<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.390> there<00:03:04.540> I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
because they're poor quality and there I

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.690 
because they're poor quality and there I
forget<00:03:05.740> what<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:05.920> was<00:03:05.950> but<00:03:06.310> there's<00:03:06.460> something

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
forget what it was but there's something

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
about chia seeds from China that are not

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.130 
about chia seeds from China that are not
healthy<00:03:08.860> for<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.340> now<00:03:10.330> these<00:03:10.480> ones<00:03:10.750> are<00:03:10.900> from

Bolivia and it says vegan on there but

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.440 
Bolivia and it says vegan on there but

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
it doesn't safe there GMO so I'm gonna

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.000 
it doesn't safe there GMO so I'm gonna
look<00:03:19.570> into<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:19.930> but<00:03:19.990> I<00:03:20.140> really<00:03:20.590> tried

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
look into that but I really tried

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.380 
look into that but I really tried
looking<00:03:21.310> into<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.610> knife<00:03:21.790> in<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:21.970> really<00:03:22.210> fine

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
looking into a knife in it really fine

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.780 
looking into a knife in it really fine
much<00:03:22.600> so<00:03:22.750> I'm<00:03:22.840> going<00:03:22.990> to<00:03:23.020> keep<00:03:23.200> looking<00:03:23.650> if<00:03:24.640> I

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
much so I'm going to keep looking if I

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.190 
much so I'm going to keep looking if I
find<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.300> maybe<00:03:25.540> they're<00:03:25.720> not<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.990> greatest

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
find that maybe they're not the greatest

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.720 
find that maybe they're not the greatest
quality<00:03:26.890> I'll<00:03:27.070> switch<00:03:27.250> back<00:03:27.460> to<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.640> other

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
quality I'll switch back to the other
