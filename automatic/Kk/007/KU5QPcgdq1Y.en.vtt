00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.070 
have and the falafel released so I think
this<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.670> me<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> better<00:02:00.209> time<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
this for me this is a better time to

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.930 
this for me this is a better time to
come<00:02:01.289> out<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> open<00:02:02.039> I<00:02:02.429> think<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.789> should

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
come out in the open I think that should

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.550 
come out in the open I think that should
be<00:02:02.970> a<00:02:03.090> prerequisite<00:02:03.569> for<00:02:03.690> anything<00:02:04.050> you<00:02:04.380> come

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
be a prerequisite for anything you come

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.900 
be a prerequisite for anything you come
on<00:02:04.709> because<00:02:04.830> when<00:02:05.369> you're<00:02:05.490> doing<00:02:05.550> a<00:02:05.729> first

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
on because when you're doing a first

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.059 
on because when you're doing a first
film<00:02:06.209> you<00:02:06.330> feel<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.660> out<00:02:06.690> of<00:02:06.869> place<00:02:07.050> and<00:02:07.470> so

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
film you feel so out of place and so

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.309 
film you feel so out of place and so
unsure<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.520> where<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.630> what<00:02:10.170> you're

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
unsure of where you are in what you're

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.900 
unsure of where you are in what you're
doing<00:02:10.349> if<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.830> right<00:02:11.069> or<00:02:11.099> not<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:11.730> it's

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
doing if it's right or not because it's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.510 
doing if it's right or not because it's
your<00:02:12.030> very<00:02:12.150> first<00:02:12.390> film<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.870> don't<00:02:13.020> really

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
your very first film so you don't really

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.250 
your very first film so you don't really
comparisons<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.240> make<00:02:14.390> or<00:02:14.600> any<00:02:14.690> knowledge

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
comparisons to make or any knowledge

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.690 
comparisons to make or any knowledge
that<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.710> fight<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.950> higher<00:02:16.190> order<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:16.610> is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
that you fight a higher order this is

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.860 
that you fight a higher order this is
