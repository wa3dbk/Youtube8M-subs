00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello with you dmitry theme at the exhibition 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.240
 mvc 2015 barcelona 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.040
 Today, perhaps the most mysterious most 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.630
 the most anticipated news 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.250
 I am writing this live to you this is new galaxy s6 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.670
 just look like it is similar to 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.490
 iPhone on the sides and in the back here is typical 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.289
 Chinese flagship or previous version 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.769
 There are several samsungs here 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.250
 versions 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.099
 there is a second version of the edge she would 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.930
 curved display looks in hand 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.140
 keeps me lying down so it seems to me 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.540
 good with 6 because well, probably with 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.809
 iPhone 6 after iPhone 6 is easier but 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.780
 stand it here for example 5 a little not 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.510
 very convenient because you can hold it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.010
 accidentally click on the side panels if 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.870
 want full review subscribe to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.329
 write our channel comments 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.100
 I also want to note what is worth the new 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.320
 touch visa on android lollipop 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.510
 just look now i'll show you 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.570
 how everything interacts 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.549
 For example, on the desktop of Tunisia, no 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.729
 changes here are new animations appeared 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.189
 we include something like 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.200
 cameras let's turn on the camera and 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.890
 let's see how to photograph say something 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.060
 what is new just chip cameras 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.020
 installed just some 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.840
 revolutionary 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.640
 I by the way do without much installation and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.409
 so 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.170
 sorry if hesitates and stutters 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.830
 closed tabs are similar to safari gauzer 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.680
 on ios 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.680
 but I will not be modest because chrome 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.070
 for example the same tab nile long ago 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.259
 Multiple windows that's impressive you can 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.360
 do anything for example from 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.590
 changed the panel and a half the screen of the table 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.660
 and it is much more convenient 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.800
 it seems lollipop is much more beautiful 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.470
 what was u 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.970
 before this android operating system and 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.300
 in principle, android do not use it 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.710
 as the main competitor and ios all thanks 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.420
 great for attention if what if you 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.869
 want a full review write to 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.869
