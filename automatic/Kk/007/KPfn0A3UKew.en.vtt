00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
Dragon Ball xenoverse now this one I

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.599 
Dragon Ball xenoverse now this one I
would<00:01:00.690> say<00:01:00.719> out<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> races<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.489> have

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
would say out of all the races that have

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.910 
would say out of all the races that have
been<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.149> getting<00:01:03.480> thrown<00:01:03.719> around<00:01:03.920> for

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
been you know getting thrown around for

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.320 
been you know getting thrown around for
our<00:01:05.040> character<00:01:05.430> creation<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.790> say<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.240> is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
our character creation I say this one is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.570 
our character creation I say this one is
probably<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.960> most<00:01:07.260> likely<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.460> main

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
probably the most likely and the main

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.950 
probably the most likely and the main
reason<00:01:08.880> being<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.240> because<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.540> think<00:01:09.750> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
reason being is because I think that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.050 
reason being is because I think that
Android<00:01:10.439> characters<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.790> really

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
Android characters are really really

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.940 
Android characters are really really
interesting<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.229> able<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> create<00:01:13.650> one

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
interesting and to be able to create one

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.590 
interesting and to be able to create one
you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:14.909> in-depth<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you can go really really in-depth and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.880 
you can go really really in-depth and
really<00:01:15.840> make<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.020> look<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.380> own<00:01:16.560> because

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
really make it look your own because

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.660 
really make it look your own because
well<00:01:17.549> there<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.150> machines<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
well there are machines you can have a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.950 
well there are machines you can have a
pink<00:01:20.670> face<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> pink<00:01:22.049> jaw<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:23.100> red

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
pink face a pink jaw and like red

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.240 
pink face a pink jaw and like red
forehead<00:01:24.960> something<00:01:25.560> whatever<00:01:25.890> you're<00:01:26.159> an

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
forehead something whatever you're an

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.770 
forehead something whatever you're an
Android<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.880> whatever<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.360> hell<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.600> want

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
Android do whatever the hell you want

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.910 
Android do whatever the hell you want
and<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.259> terms<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.619> character

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and I think in terms of character

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.100 
and I think in terms of character
customization<00:01:29.119> there<00:01:30.119> will<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.360> lot<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
customization there will be a lot in the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.410 
customization there will be a lot in the
ways<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.560> offerings<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
ways of offerings for that and the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.789 
ways of offerings for that and the
different<00:01:33.869> clothings<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.470> different

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
different clothings and different

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.679 
different clothings and different
accessories<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.880> all<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.060> stuff<00:01:36.240> it's

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
accessories and all that stuff it's

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.780 
accessories and all that stuff it's
going<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.380> cool<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.579> can

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
going to be so cool if we actually can

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.749 
going to be so cool if we actually can
create<00:01:39.000> Android<00:01:39.960> characters<00:01:40.590> now<00:01:41.220> speaking

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
ribbon army ones so like 13 14 15 16 17

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.569 
ribbon army ones so like 13 14 15 16 17
18<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.649> we<00:01:52.799> talking<00:01:53.040> about<00:01:53.070> people<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
18 are we talking about people like that

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.789 
18 are we talking about people like that
like<00:01:54.030> doctor<00:01:54.329> zero<00:01:54.659> 19<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.320> all<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.590> stuff

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
like doctor zero 19 and all that stuff

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.670 
like doctor zero 19 and all that stuff
or<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.759> even<00:01:56.909> go<00:01:57.060> deeper<00:01:57.420> into<00:01:57.960> something

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
or can we even go deeper into something

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.179 
or can we even go deeper into something
that's<00:01:58.770> maybe<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.219> cell<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.740> don't<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.860> guys

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
that's maybe like cell I don't know guys

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.609 
that's maybe like cell I don't know guys
what<00:02:03.090> kind<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.299> androids<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.200> expect<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
what kind of androids can we expect to

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.370 
what kind of androids can we expect to
create<00:02:04.920> here<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.250> will<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.579> get<00:02:05.790> Android

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
create here and will we get Android

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.719 
create here and will we get Android
transformations<00:02:07.380> that's<00:02:08.039> another<00:02:08.399> thing

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
transformations that's another thing

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.969 
transformations that's another thing
will<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.509> will<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.050> able<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.470> use

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
will be will we be able to use

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.530 
will be will we be able to use
transformations<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.910> our<00:02:12.000> androids<00:02:12.360> like

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
transformations for our androids like

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.790 
transformations for our androids like
super<00:02:12.900> 13

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
super 13

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.460 
super 13
and<00:02:13.890> super<00:02:14.520> 17<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.120> stuff<00:02:15.240> like<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.630> if<00:02:15.930> it's

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and super 17 and stuff like that if it's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.830 
and super 17 and stuff like that if it's
even<00:02:16.710> possible<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:17.340> transform<00:02:18.000> or<00:02:18.270> not<00:02:18.720> to

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
even possible to transform or not to

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.330 
even possible to transform or not to
transform<00:02:19.290> if<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.740> even<00:02:19.920> possible<00:02:20.070> to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
transform if it's even possible to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.120 
transform if it's even possible to
create<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.940> character<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:22.170> game<00:02:22.260> let<00:02:23.010> me
