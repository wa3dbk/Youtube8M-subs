00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.140
 filming is not very good because 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.850
 I'm making the cell phone is looking 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.539
 without pressing the totoloto switch and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.109
 road here cutting acceleration facing 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.340
 to your side is good local radio here 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.340
 connect the battery 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.050
 it is important to leave it to this 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.660
 stabilization as everything for ballets tÃ¡ 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.879
 good not to test with the radio 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:03.160
 accelerated throttle control all 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:06.310
 Links works by simultaneously tapping 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:13.600
 Clothes falling forward breaking to 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:16.660

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:38.530
 occurs, however, with a greater intensity 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:42.100
 it's there 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:47.910
 however the commands have to work 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.910
 responding to stick movement 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:56.160

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.160
