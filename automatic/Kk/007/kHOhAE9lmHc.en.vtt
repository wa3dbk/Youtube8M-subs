hey YouTube it's gold Spurs hey today
going<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.000> do<00:00:03.600> something<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.870> little<00:00:04.049> different

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
going to do something a little different

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.340 
going to do something a little different
I<00:00:04.500> got<00:00:04.710> some<00:00:04.920> 25<00:00:05.370> pound<00:00:05.730> blocks<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.330> clay<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.930> I

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
I got some 25 pound blocks of clay and I

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.600 
I got some 25 pound blocks of clay and I
thought<00:00:07.529> it'd<00:00:07.649> be<00:00:07.680> kind<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:07.980> cool<00:00:08.160> just<00:00:08.400> take

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
thought it'd be kind of cool just take

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.280 
thought it'd be kind of cool just take
some<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.849> my<00:00:08.910> concealed<00:00:09.300> carry<00:00:09.599> guns<00:00:09.960> and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
some of my concealed carry guns and

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.290 
some of my concealed carry guns and
shoot<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> different<00:00:11.610> calibers<00:00:12.030> at<00:00:12.179> these

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
shoot the different calibers at these

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.999 
shoot the different calibers at these
blocks<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.960> kind<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.230> compare<00:00:13.559> them<00:00:13.679> all<00:00:13.830> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
blocks and kind of compare them all and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.620 
blocks and kind of compare them all and
see<00:00:14.130> what<00:00:14.280> kind<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.490> damage<00:00:14.700> gets<00:00:15.120> done<00:00:15.389> so

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
see what kind of damage gets done so

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.660 
see what kind of damage gets done so
today<00:00:16.560> we're<00:00:17.130> gonna<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.310> hitting<00:00:17.550> these

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
today we're gonna be hitting these

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.359 
today we're gonna be hitting these
blocks<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> 380<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.109> 9<00:00:19.500> millimeter<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.310> a

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
blocks with a 380 a 9 millimeter and a

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.630 
blocks with a 380 a 9 millimeter and a
45<00:00:20.880> ACP<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.869> once<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.550> we're

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
45 ACP and once we do that then we're

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.040 
45 ACP and once we do that then we're
going<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.820> cut<00:00:24.029> them<00:00:24.150> apart<00:00:24.210> take<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> look<00:00:24.869> on

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
going to cut them apart take a look on

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.140 
going to cut them apart take a look on
the<00:00:25.199> inside<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.920> see<00:00:26.550> what<00:00:26.699> kind<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.939> damage

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
the inside and see what kind of damage

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.800 
the inside and see what kind of damage
they<00:00:27.420> caused<00:00:28.189> so<00:00:29.189> first<00:00:29.490> up<00:00:29.730> was<00:00:29.939> my<00:00:30.060> Glock<00:00:30.330> 42

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
they caused so first up was my Glock 42

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.840 
they caused so first up was my Glock 42
and<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.650> were<00:00:31.710> firing<00:00:32.009> some<00:00:32.430> hornaday

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
and we were firing some hornaday

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.260 
and we were firing some hornaday
critical<00:00:33.329> defense<00:00:33.770> these<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:35.040> 380<00:00:35.790> autos

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
critical defense these are 380 autos

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.209 
critical defense these are 380 autos
they're<00:00:36.540> 90<00:00:36.899> grains<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.620> come<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
they're 90 grains and come out of the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.660 
they're 90 grains and come out of the
muzzle<00:00:38.430> about<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> thousand<00:00:39.270> feet<00:00:39.420> per<00:00:39.450> second

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
muzzle about a thousand feet per second

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.860 
muzzle about a thousand feet per second
so<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.940> slow-mo<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.600> see<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
so here in slow-mo you can see the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.060 
so here in slow-mo you can see the
bullet<00:00:43.020> pretty<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.680> rips<00:00:43.890> right

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
bullet pretty much just rips right

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.190 
bullet pretty much just rips right
through<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> block<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.300> block<00:00:45.539> itself<00:00:45.899> does

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
through the block the block itself does

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.930 
through the block the block itself does
jump<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.800> little<00:00:46.980> bit<00:00:47.190> moves<00:00:47.460> backward

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
jump up a little bit moves backward

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.850 
jump up a little bit moves backward
about<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.210> half<00:00:48.510> an<00:00:48.690> inch<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.410> did<00:00:49.620> put<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
about a half an inch so it did put a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.410 
about a half an inch so it did put a
little<00:00:50.039> bit<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.340> its<00:00:50.489> energy<00:00:50.850> into<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.180> block

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
little bit of its energy into that block

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.209 
little bit of its energy into that block
and<00:00:51.449> push<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.930> backwards<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:52.590> let's<00:00:52.920> cut<00:00:53.100> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
and push it backwards but let's cut it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:05.310 
and push it backwards but let's cut it
open<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.699> see<00:00:54.180> what<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> inside<00:00:54.510> looks<00:00:54.690> like

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.770 

so<00:01:06.040> we<00:01:06.250> got<00:01:06.460> just<00:01:06.910> about<00:01:07.180> a<00:01:07.210> three<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.660> half

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
so we got just about a three and a half

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.690 
so we got just about a three and a half
inch<00:01:08.050> wound<00:01:08.290> cavity<00:01:08.560> here<00:01:08.980> out<00:01:09.160> of<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.340> 380

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
inch wound cavity here out of the 380

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.980 
inch wound cavity here out of the 380
which<00:01:10.000> was<00:01:10.180> pretty<00:01:10.450> impressive

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
which was pretty impressive

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.110 
which was pretty impressive
but<00:01:11.320> go<00:01:12.220> ahead<00:01:12.340> move<00:01:12.640> on<00:01:12.850> to<00:01:13.030> the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
but go ahead move on to the

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.200 
but go ahead move on to the
nine-millimeter<00:01:14.940> so<00:01:15.940> for<00:01:16.150> the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
nine-millimeter so for the

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.820 
nine-millimeter so for the
nine-millimeter<00:01:16.870> we'll<00:01:17.080> be<00:01:17.170> using<00:01:17.320> my<00:01:17.530> Smith

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
nine-millimeter we'll be using my Smith

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.880 
nine-millimeter we'll be using my Smith

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
&amp; Wesson M&amp;P 9 compact and we'll be

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.840 
&amp; Wesson M&amp;P 9 compact and we'll be
firing<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.430> Barnes<00:01:22.210> tack<00:01:22.720> XPD<00:01:23.610> which<00:01:24.610> is<00:01:24.820> a

firing the Barnes tack XPD which is a

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.850 
firing the Barnes tack XPD which is a
hundred<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.360> fifteen<00:01:25.840> grain<00:01:26.170> hollow-point

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
hundred and fifteen grain hollow-point

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.030 
hundred and fifteen grain hollow-point
and<00:01:27.130> should<00:01:27.550> be<00:01:27.640> traveling<00:01:27.880> about<00:01:28.740> 1125<00:01:29.740> feet

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
and should be traveling about 1125 feet

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.030 
and should be traveling about 1125 feet
per<00:01:30.190> second<00:01:30.550> from<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.700> muzzle<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.710> when<00:01:33.010> I

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
per second from the muzzle so when I

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.920 
per second from the muzzle so when I
took<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.400> shot<00:01:33.640> at<00:01:33.790> this<00:01:33.970> block<00:01:34.240> I<00:01:34.510> may<00:01:34.810> have

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
took the shot at this block I may have

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.960 
took the shot at this block I may have
had<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.410> barrel<00:01:36.070> angled<00:01:36.400> slightly<00:01:36.580> at<00:01:36.910> an

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
had the barrel angled slightly at an

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.609 
had the barrel angled slightly at an
upward<00:01:37.180> angle<00:01:37.450> which<00:01:37.900> may<00:01:38.140> have<00:01:38.259> contributed

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
upward angle which may have contributed

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.920 
upward angle which may have contributed
to<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.979> top<00:01:39.250> blowing<00:01:39.759> out<00:01:39.940> but<00:01:40.509> you<00:01:40.570> can<00:01:40.720> see

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
to the top blowing out but you can see

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.660 
to the top blowing out but you can see
the<00:01:41.290> increased<00:01:41.680> speed<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.160> round<00:01:42.490> how

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
the increased speed of this round how

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.910 
the increased speed of this round how
fast<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.330> zips<00:01:43.630> through<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.960> clay<00:01:44.259> and<00:01:44.500> the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
fast it zips through the clay and the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.499 
fast it zips through the clay and the
block<00:01:45.130> itself<00:01:45.610> really<00:01:45.880> doesn't<00:01:46.000> move

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
block itself really doesn't move

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.540 
block itself really doesn't move
backwards<00:01:47.170> at<00:01:47.380> all<00:01:47.560> probably<00:01:48.040> because<00:01:48.310> most

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.780 
backwards at all probably because most
of<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.729> pressure<00:01:49.000> came<00:01:49.630> out<00:01:49.840> through<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.110> top

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.400 

but<00:01:54.790> overall<00:01:55.540> this<00:01:55.869> was<00:01:56.110> a<00:01:56.140> pretty

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
but overall this was a pretty

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:03.600 
but overall this was a pretty
devastating<00:01:57.190> hit<00:01:57.400> by<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.640> 9-millimeter<00:02:02.610> next

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
devastating hit by the 9-millimeter next

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
these are 230 grain hollow points

traveling about 900 feet per second and
we'll<00:02:13.600> be<00:02:13.720> shooting<00:02:14.050> them<00:02:14.200> out<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.530> my<00:02:15.040> Colt

1991<00:02:17.200> compact<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.870> at<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.170> 45<00:02:20.739> I<00:02:21.010> got<00:02:21.190> it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
1991 compact so at the 45 I got it

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.830 
1991 compact so at the 45 I got it
angled<00:02:21.700> straight<00:02:22.000> through<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.570> went<00:02:22.750> ahead

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
angled straight through it went ahead

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.259 
angled straight through it went ahead
and<00:02:23.080> hit<00:02:23.230> pretty<00:02:23.470> hard<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:24.370> can<00:02:24.880> see<00:02:25.120> the

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
and hit pretty hard you can see the

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.509 
and hit pretty hard you can see the
block<00:02:25.510> itself<00:02:25.959> jumps<00:02:26.500> up<00:02:26.650> moves<00:02:27.010> back<00:02:27.250> about

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
block itself jumps up moves back about

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.340 
block itself jumps up moves back about
two<00:02:27.790> inches<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.480> really<00:02:28.660> gave<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.200> good

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
two inches so it really gave it a good

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.740 
two inches so it really gave it a good
umph<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.880> let's<00:02:31.060> cut<00:02:31.239> this<00:02:31.390> thing<00:02:31.450> open

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
umph and so let's cut this thing open

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:43.920 
umph and so let's cut this thing open
and<00:02:32.049> see<00:02:32.170> what<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> wound<00:02:32.590> cavity<00:02:32.799> looks<00:02:33.190> like

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.179 

and<00:02:44.930> here<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.230> can<00:02:45.349> see<00:02:45.560> we<00:02:45.739> got<00:02:45.859> just<00:02:46.159> a

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
and here you can see we got just a

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.099 
and here you can see we got just a
little<00:02:46.400> over<00:02:46.640> six<00:02:46.849> inch<00:02:47.120> wound<00:02:47.390> cavity<00:02:47.689> so

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
little over six inch wound cavity so

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.080 
little over six inch wound cavity so
about<00:02:48.379> pretty<00:02:48.950> close<00:02:49.219> to<00:02:49.400> double<00:02:49.760> what<00:02:49.939> the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
about pretty close to double what the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.759 
about pretty close to double what the
380<00:02:50.510> was<00:02:52.299> all<00:02:53.299> right<00:02:53.569> so<00:02:53.780> we<00:02:54.019> shot<00:02:54.260> all<00:02:54.500> three

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
380 was all right so we shot all three

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.190 
380 was all right so we shot all three
blocks<00:02:55.099> and<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:56.150> was<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.299> heck<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.599> a<00:02:56.689> lot<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:56.870> fun

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200
