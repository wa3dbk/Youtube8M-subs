 fundamentally new with great 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.350
 the number of participants and therefore very 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:39.629
 laborious and in the organization we considered everything 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.420
 subtleties and features and next time 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.460

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.140
 one of the past issues of the video blog in 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.360
 We have two connections to this event. 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.220
 news is good and bad how to start 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.310
 okay at the time of the move the game will be 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.770
 unavailable transfer of all data is large and 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.360
 complicated process by our estimates 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.060
 system administrators this can 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.190
 take eight to twelve hours well 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.470
