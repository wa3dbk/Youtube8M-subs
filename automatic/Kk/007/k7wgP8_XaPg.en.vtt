of<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:41.219> nails<00:00:41.489> because<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.149> personally<00:00:42.960> find

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
of your nails because I personally find

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.049 
of your nails because I personally find
that<00:00:43.260> bit<00:00:43.410> irritating<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.219> me<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.579> that's

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
that bit irritating for me that that's

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.990 
that bit irritating for me that that's
too<00:00:45.420> thin<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.649> formula<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.789> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
too thin of a formula so I like that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.880 
too thin of a formula so I like that
because<00:00:48.320> there's<00:00:49.320> always<00:00:49.440> someone<00:00:49.710> who's

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
because there's always someone who's

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.220

like peridot I wouldn't have worn it and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.219 
like peridot I wouldn't have worn it and
I<00:01:50.610> also<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:51.149> liked<00:01:51.299> graphite<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.140> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
I also really liked graphite and if I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.810 
I also really liked graphite and if I
could<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:53.009> another<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.340> then<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.549> would<00:01:53.700> get

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
could get another one then I would get

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.219 
could get another one then I would get
that<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.299> now<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.140> love<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.649> color<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:57.000> me<00:01:57.229> my

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
that but now I love this color to me my

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.440 
that but now I love this color to me my
personal<00:01:58.469> opinion<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.969> mix

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
personal opinion is that this is a mix

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.950 
personal opinion is that this is a mix
between<00:02:01.049> silver<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.219> gold<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.689> kind

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
between silver and gold and so it's kind

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.420 
between silver and gold and so it's kind
of<00:02:04.020> ended<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.560> kind<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.829> topi<00:02:05.219> brown

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
of ended up this kind of topi brown

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.920 
of ended up this kind of topi brown
color<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:05.880> that's<00:02:06.000> because<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.600> mix

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
color but that's because it's this mix

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.809 
color but that's because it's this mix
of<00:02:07.079> metallics<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.429> also<00:02:08.550> just

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
of metallics and it's also just

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.780 
of metallics and it's also just
jam-packed<00:02:09.270> full<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.110> shimmer<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.770> I've<00:02:11.640> got

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
jam-packed full of shimmer and I've got

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.050 
jam-packed full of shimmer and I've got
it<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:11.970> my<00:02:12.060> nails<00:02:12.270> now

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
although obviously this doesn't pack

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.559 
although obviously this doesn't pack
half<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.709> punch<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.220> one<00:02:51.400> does<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.819> this<00:02:52.330> is

over the top this is just a gun metal
gray<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:56.049> think<00:02:56.200> it's<00:02:56.319> just<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.530> really<00:02:56.680> nice

there's<00:03:01.180> not<00:03:01.269> much<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.540> say<00:03:01.690> about<00:03:01.780> this<00:03:01.989> and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
there's not much to say about this and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.539 
there's not much to say about this and
I've<00:03:02.410> just<00:03:02.440> think<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.040> looks<00:03:03.190> really<00:03:03.250> nice

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
I've just think it looks really nice

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.390 
I've just think it looks really nice
during<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.150> darker<00:03:04.510> months<00:03:05.099> so<00:03:06.099> that's<00:03:06.280> my

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
during the darker months so that's my

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.570 
during the darker months so that's my
pic<00:03:06.610> kind<00:03:06.880> of<00:03:06.970> a<00:03:07.030> gunmetal<00:03:07.360> color<00:03:08.190> next<00:03:09.190> up<00:03:09.340> is

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
pic kind of a gunmetal color next up is

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.770 
pic kind of a gunmetal color next up is
that<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.180> other<00:03:11.160> shake<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.190> up<00:03:12.340> other<00:03:12.780> OPI

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
that this other shake it up other OPI

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.130 
that this other shake it up other OPI
color<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.440> this<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.680> OPI<00:03:15.130> ink<00:03:15.549> suede<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.930> this

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
color and this is OPI ink suede so this

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.930 
color and this is OPI ink suede so this
actually<00:03:17.380> is<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.980> special<00:03:18.519> formula<00:03:18.730> that

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
actually is a special formula that

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.610 
actually is a special formula that
drives<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.450> kind<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.630> a<00:03:19.690> matte<00:03:19.930> finish<00:03:19.959> unless

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
drives to kind of a matte finish unless

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.680 
drives to kind of a matte finish unless
you<00:03:20.739> want<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:20.950> apply<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.160> topcoat<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:22.480> think

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
you want to apply a topcoat and I think

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.449 
you want to apply a topcoat and I think
sometimes<00:03:22.930> it's<00:03:23.230> just<00:03:23.260> nice<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.560> mix<00:03:24.040> up<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.340> bit

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
sometimes it's just nice to mix up a bit

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.090 
sometimes it's just nice to mix up a bit
and<00:03:24.579> have<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.760> different<00:03:25.180> formula<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:26.350> I'm<00:03:26.620> it's

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
and have a different formula so I'm it's

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.740 
and have a different formula so I'm it's
just<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.340> really<00:03:27.519> nice<00:03:27.730> kind<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.120> rich<00:03:28.359> blue

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
just a really nice kind of rich blue

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
don't know if you can see that so you

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.930 
don't know if you can see that so you
can<00:04:37.740> kind<00:04:37.950> of<00:04:37.980> paint<00:04:38.190> your<00:04:38.310> nails<00:04:38.460> really

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
quickly and the formula is just really

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.740 
quickly and the formula is just really
nice<00:04:40.970> because<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.060> can<00:04:42.180> just<00:04:42.300> buy<00:04:42.540> it<00:04:42.600> in<00:04:42.720> the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
nice because you can just buy it in the

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.350 
nice because you can just buy it in the
drugstore<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.730> yeah<00:04:44.730> I<00:04:44.790> think<00:04:45.060> it's<00:04:45.210> nice

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
drugstore and yeah I think it's nice

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.940 
drugstore and yeah I think it's nice
because<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.810> don't<00:04:45.990> I've<00:04:46.200> never<00:04:46.500> really<00:04:46.800> worn

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
because I don't I've never really worn

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.650 
because I don't I've never really worn
black<00:04:47.220> nail<00:04:47.670> polish<00:04:47.880> but<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.240> think<00:04:48.450> this<00:04:48.510> is

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
black nail polish but I think this is

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.390 
black nail polish but I think this is
kind<00:04:48.810> of<00:04:48.900> close<00:04:49.080> but<00:04:49.770> obviously<00:04:50.040> when<00:04:50.280> you

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
kind of close but obviously when you

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.620 
kind of close but obviously when you
move<00:04:50.580> your<00:04:50.700> hands<00:04:50.880> then<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.180> has<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.450> kind<00:04:51.540> of

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
move your hands then it has that kind of

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.140 
move your hands then it has that kind of
reflective<00:04:52.200> Sheen<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:52.830> now<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:53.790> really<00:04:54.060> let

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
reflective Sheen so now I really let

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.500 
reflective Sheen so now I really let
that<00:04:54.620> another<00:04:55.620> boudoir<00:04:56.130> one<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:57.120> same

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
that another boudoir one is the same

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.800 
that another boudoir one is the same
brand<00:04:57.960> but<00:04:58.290> this<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.860> think<00:04:59.580> number<00:05:00.030> two<00:05:00.300> and

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
brand but this is I think number two and

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.080 
brand but this is I think number two and
this<00:05:00.840> is<00:05:01.320> kind<00:05:01.500> of<00:05:01.560> the<00:05:01.620> rich<00:05:01.860> red<00:05:02.160> one<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:02.640> I

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
this is kind of the rich red one and I

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.150 
this is kind of the rich red one and I
think<00:05:03.330> again<00:05:04.110> with<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.440> neutrals<00:05:04.860> this<00:05:05.040> is

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
think again with the neutrals this is

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.400 
think again with the neutrals this is
kind<00:05:05.340> of<00:05:05.370> like<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.550> classic<00:05:05.910> color<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.660> nice<00:05:07.110> deep

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
Chanel one yeah it's just a really nice

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.620 
Chanel one yeah it's just a really nice
I<00:05:47.340> think<00:05:47.400> Green<00:05:47.730> is<00:05:47.760> in<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.090> color<00:05:48.270> that<00:05:48.419> a<00:05:48.480> lot

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
I think Green is in the color that a lot

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.940 
I think Green is in the color that a lot
of<00:05:48.660> people<00:05:48.750> wear<00:05:49.169> a<00:05:49.200> bit<00:05:49.380> because<00:05:49.530> it's<00:05:49.740> dark

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
of people wear a bit because it's dark

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.400 
of people wear a bit because it's dark
enough<00:05:50.250> it's<00:05:50.840> it's<00:05:51.840> kind<00:05:52.080> of<00:05:52.110> a<00:05:52.169> bit<00:05:52.290> more

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
enough it's it's kind of a bit more

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.990 
enough it's it's kind of a bit more
subtle<00:05:52.680> so<00:05:53.040> people<00:05:53.310> don't<00:05:53.460> always<00:05:53.550> see<00:05:53.850> what

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
subtle so people don't always see what

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.880 
subtle so people don't always see what
you're<00:05:54.120> wearing<00:05:54.210> at<00:05:54.419> first<00:05:54.660> and<00:05:55.080> then<00:05:55.680> they<00:05:55.770> do

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
you're wearing at first and then they do

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.200 
you're wearing at first and then they do
and<00:05:56.010> I<00:05:56.070> think<00:05:56.220> it<00:05:56.310> looks<00:05:56.460> nice<00:05:56.610> against<00:05:56.910> pale

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
and I think it looks nice against pale

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.420 
and I think it looks nice against pale
skin<00:05:57.690> I<00:05:57.930> think<00:05:58.860> people<00:05:58.950> wish<00:05:59.160> to<00:05:59.220> acquire

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430

products<00:05:59.910> that<00:06:00.030> look<00:06:00.060> nice<00:06:00.270> against<00:06:00.540> tan<00:06:00.810> skin

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080
