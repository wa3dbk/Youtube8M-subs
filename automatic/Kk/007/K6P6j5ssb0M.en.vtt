00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.670
 Hello everyone and today we have a video on 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.410
 they asked me so many times 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.920
 make a bear from beads 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.080
 I decided to fulfill this request from me 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.119
 such a mouse made of beads 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.420
 if you're curious to know how to weave 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.820
 mouse look further this video for 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.380
 bead mice we need you 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.900
 two color beads 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.880
 I take white and lilac for some reason 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.009
 I wanted to make just such flowers 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.040
 mouse you can choose any colors 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.020
 which you will like scissors 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.989
 the container on which we will pour 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.379
 beads then we need fishing line I'll 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.379
 cut 1 meter and the scheme of the mouse itself 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:52.540
 so I have it as usual I laid out 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.150
 for you and and vkontakte let's begin i 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.090
 cut that one meter and start 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.360
 weave from the tail of the mouse moving to 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.360
 spout 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.350
 recruit one little white bead 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.350
 emitted in the middle of the line 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:16.750
 after that one lilac and pass 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.750
 cross line 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.679
 it turns out like this we weave 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.969
 in the same way as usual I show everything 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.460
 beaded toys 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:34.740
 I think that those who watch my long 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.740
 video for you is not a problem 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.250
 one more bead and again crosswise 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.210
 so we you cook them all 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.450
 tail do as long as you want 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.540
 In principle, that is, the tail can be 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.680
 absolutely any short long same 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.680
 how he likes 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.340
 I have such a tail here 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.350
 mice and now we look at our pattern 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.180
 then we collect 3 beads and make 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.030
 again the line crosswise 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.630
 on expansion we work up to this 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.030
 row here we get 7 beads 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.230
 we need to do two rows and then 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.230
 we will work on narrowing 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.400
 that 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.990
 at 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.860
 I got such a body at the mouse 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.450
 I finished this series I made 5 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.880
 beads and now we need to do 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.390
 ears now I'll show you how it is 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:09.040
 done for this I leave one line 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.040
 1 I take and type 5 Syria in the pass market 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.420
 then one white 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.000
 five lilac 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.530
 that's what I get 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.890
 after that we return to the body 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.950
 here as you see i have 5 beads 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.310
 we are the last two who are closer to this 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.379
 fishing line and skip to the other three us 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.379
 Need to thread our this tip 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.450
 in such a way and tighten as 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.230
 you can see and we formed the first 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.690
 eyelet 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.319
 and in the same way we need to do 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:03.610
 second ear and then everything is very simple we 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:08.560
 weave according to the scheme we weave 5 beads 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:11.440
 the next row and then 4433 2 and one here 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.650
 will need to make eyes here we have 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.750
 scheme which can be seen in the front row and the spout 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.620
 me it is white bead and all ours 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.470
 the mouse will be ready here I got 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.820
 such a mouse and we stay only after 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.600
 one bead make two nodules and 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.600
 trim our fishing line 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.710
 all cut the line 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:58.479
 Here is such a mouse, it is very 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.479
 little baby so 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.700
