00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
have the USB port and this is what will

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.289 
have the USB port and this is what will
power<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> microphone<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.790> could<00:01:08.970> plug<00:01:09.119> that

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
power the microphone you could plug that

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.550

cable<00:01:09.659> into<00:01:09.900> your<00:01:09.930> back<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.380> your<00:01:10.470> computer

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
cable into your back of your computer

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.920 
cable into your back of your computer
and<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.939> what<00:01:12.150> will<00:01:12.270> make<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.570> computer

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and this is what will make the computer

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.880 
and this is what will make the computer
make<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> microphone<00:01:14.460> go<00:01:15.500> now<00:01:16.500> let's<00:01:16.710> set

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
make the microphone go now let's set

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.780 
make the microphone go now let's set
that<00:01:16.920> aside<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.610> keep<00:01:17.759> digging<00:01:17.909> into<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> box

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
that aside and keep digging into the box

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.789 
that aside and keep digging into the box
so<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.360> dig<00:01:21.570> into<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> box<00:01:22.049> further<00:01:22.380> we

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
so as we dig into the box further we

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.249 
so as we dig into the box further we
have<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.340> cable<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.939> which<00:01:24.270> will<00:01:24.900> make<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
have the cable in which will make the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.070 
have the cable in which will make the
microphone<00:01:25.860> work<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.299> four<00:01:27.570> foot<00:01:27.750> cable

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
microphone work it's a four foot cable

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.870 
microphone work it's a four foot cable
so<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.350> quite<00:01:28.530> generous<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.490> think<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
so it is quite generous and I think it

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
so it is quite generous and I think it
will<00:01:30.030> work<00:01:30.060> even<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.110> you're<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> longer

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
will work even if you're at a longer

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.840 
will work even if you're at a longer
distance<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.369> myself<00:01:34.430> take<00:01:35.430> me<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.700> even

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
distance like myself take me and even

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.850 
distance like myself take me and even
further<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.450> black<00:01:36.810> velvet<00:01:37.170> Samson
