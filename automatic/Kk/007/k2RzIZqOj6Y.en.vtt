just has those one or two really good

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.259 
just has those one or two really good
maps<00:02:24.859> so<00:02:25.129> let's<00:02:25.370> start<00:02:25.549> off<00:02:25.640> with<00:02:25.790> like<00:02:25.909> mono

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
maps so let's start off with like mono

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.619 
maps so let's start off with like mono
or<00:02:26.510> 42<00:02:26.900> had<00:02:27.230> like<00:02:27.470> hi<00:02:28.040> rush<00:02:28.370> una<00:02:28.879> mano<00:02:29.239> por<00:02:29.480> tu

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.589 
probably had the best maps in comedy
history<00:02:31.430> at<00:02:31.730> least<00:02:31.909> in<00:02:32.000> my<00:02:32.120> opinion<00:02:32.239> I<00:02:32.540> don't

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
history at least in my opinion I don't

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.660 
history at least in my opinion I don't
think<00:02:32.720> there's<00:02:32.959> one<00:02:32.989> map<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.739> didn't<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:34.489> my

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
think there's one map I didn't like my

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.059 
think there's one map I didn't like my
favorite<00:02:34.849> map<00:02:35.090> nw2<00:02:35.750> with<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.170> rail<00:02:36.409> so<00:02:36.739> forget

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
favorite map nw2 with the rail so forget

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.580 
favorite map nw2 with the rail so forget
about<00:02:37.129> that<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:37.609> like<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:38.000> think<00:02:38.689> after<00:02:38.810> mw2

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
about that but like I think after mw2

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.520 
about that but like I think after mw2
starting<00:02:40.189> from<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.909> think<00:02:41.359> really<00:02:41.510> from<00:02:41.750> MW<00:02:42.260> 3

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
starting from I think really from MW 3

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.960 
starting from I think really from MW 3
s'n<00:02:42.799> things<00:02:42.980> started<00:02:43.220> going<00:02:43.280> downhill<00:02:43.609> like

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
s'n things started going downhill like

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.069 
s'n things started going downhill like
nw3<00:02:44.720> only<00:02:45.650> had<00:02:45.889> hard<00:02:46.400> hat<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.239> maybe<00:02:47.629> dome

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
nw3 only had hard hat and maybe dome

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.199 
nw3 only had hard hat and maybe dome
those<00:02:48.500> like<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.769> only<00:02:49.129> fun<00:02:49.400> maps<00:02:49.639> to<00:02:49.819> play<00:02:50.060> on

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
those like the only fun maps to play on

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.819 
those like the only fun maps to play on
and<00:02:50.540> then<00:02:51.409> black<00:02:51.829> ops<00:02:52.099> 2<00:02:52.669> had<00:02:53.090> raid<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.590> had

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
and then black ops 2 had raid and it had

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.449 
and then black ops 2 had raid and it had
I<00:02:55.370> think<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.629> was<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.959> just<00:02:57.560> raid<00:02:57.980> like<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.340> was

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
I think that was it just raid like I was

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.099 
I think that was it just raid like I was
the<00:02:58.489> only<00:02:58.669> member<00:02:58.849> really<00:02:59.269> liked<00:02:59.659> in<00:02:59.900> black

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
the only member really liked in black

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.409 
the only member really liked in black
ops<00:03:00.349> 2<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.859> maybe<00:03:01.040> sand<00:03:01.459> off<00:03:01.639> was<00:03:01.849> okay<00:03:02.000> in

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:02.419 
ops 2 and maybe sand off was okay in

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.559 
ops 2 and maybe sand off was okay in
Yemen<00:03:02.870> but<00:03:03.709> like<00:03:04.129> after<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.579> I<00:03:04.760> really

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
Yemen but like after that I really

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.199 
Yemen but like after that I really
despised<00:03:06.079> every<00:03:06.709> map<00:03:06.919> in<00:03:07.220> called<00:03:07.489> black<00:03:07.669> ops<00:03:07.939> 2

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
despised every map in called black ops 2

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.569 
despised every map in called black ops 2
as<00:03:08.419> well<00:03:08.569> as<00:03:08.689> mw3<00:03:09.109> and<00:03:09.560> call<00:03:09.919> vide<00:03:10.129> goes<00:03:10.310> it's

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
as well as mw3 and call vide goes it's

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.280 
as well as mw3 and call vide goes it's
the<00:03:10.700> same<00:03:10.970> thing<00:03:11.000> all<00:03:11.450> we<00:03:11.540> have<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:11.900> strike

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
the same thing all we have this strike

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.159 
the same thing all we have this strike
zone<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.919> that's<00:03:13.609> it<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.329> what<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:14.930> want<00:03:15.109> the

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:15.169 
zone and that's it so what I want the

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.680 
zone and that's it so what I want the
developers<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.769> do<00:03:15.889> is<00:03:16.129> to<00:03:16.280> create<00:03:16.669> maps<00:03:17.150> with

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
developers to do is to create maps with

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.199 
developers to do is to create maps with
the<00:03:17.840> same<00:03:18.169> appeal<00:03:18.769> as<00:03:18.799> a<00:03:19.010> strike<00:03:19.370> zone<00:03:19.669> but<00:03:19.909> 10

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
the same appeal as a strike zone but 10

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.309 
the same appeal as a strike zone but 10
times<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.989> why<00:03:21.889> can't<00:03:22.190> they<00:03:22.310> have<00:03:22.519> 10<00:03:23.419> strike

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
times so why can't they have 10 strike

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.129 
times so why can't they have 10 strike
zone<00:03:24.680> appealing<00:03:25.280> maps<00:03:25.549> in<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.060> game<00:03:26.780> right

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
zone appealing maps in the game right

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.780 
zone appealing maps in the game right
when<00:03:27.199> it<00:03:27.409> comes<00:03:27.440> out<00:03:27.769> instead<00:03:28.099> of<00:03:28.159> one<00:03:28.459> or<00:03:28.609> two

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
when it comes out instead of one or two

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.439 
when it comes out instead of one or two
and<00:03:29.569> then<00:03:30.379> eight<00:03:30.979> terrible<00:03:31.760> ones<00:03:31.940> why<00:03:32.209> does<00:03:32.359> it

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
and then eight terrible ones why does it

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:34.449 
and then eight terrible ones why does it
always<00:03:32.720> have<00:03:33.169> to<00:03:33.199> be<00:03:33.409> like<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:33.709> like<00:03:34.220> why

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
always have to be like that like why

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.210 
always have to be like that like why
can't<00:03:34.549> they<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.060> get<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.690> right<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.470> that's

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
can't they just get it right so that's

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.699 
can't they just get it right so that's
what<00:03:37.370> I'm<00:03:37.459> hoping<00:03:37.579> for<00:03:37.760> is<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.120> they<00:03:38.359> make<00:03:38.750> 10

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
what I'm hoping for is that they make 10

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.520 
what I'm hoping for is that they make 10
strike<00:03:40.340> zone<00:03:40.699> appealing<00:03:41.540> map<00:03:41.690> so<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.109> say<00:03:42.349> that

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
strike zone appealing map so to say that

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.710 
strike zone appealing map so to say that
makes<00:03:42.680> any<00:03:42.799> sense<00:03:42.979> at<00:03:43.340> all<00:03:43.459> I<00:03:43.669> think<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:44.419> next

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
makes any sense at all I think the next

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.939 
makes any sense at all I think the next
thing<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:45.049> wish<00:03:45.260> out<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.590> call<00:03:45.799> duty

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
thing that I wish out of call duty

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.520 
thing that I wish out of call duty
advanced<00:03:46.280> warfare<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:47.030> that<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:47.959> want<00:03:48.319> them<00:03:48.500> to

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
advanced warfare is that I want them to

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.500 
advanced warfare is that I want them to
