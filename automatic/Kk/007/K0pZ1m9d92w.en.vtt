00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.850
 Yes then 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:09.990
 It's easy to say how to collect Dragon Ball 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.700
 I think that I want to describe 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.090
 Yes 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.640
 First of all 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.310
 offline 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.220
 so 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.210
 of 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.210
 8 pq 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.020
 Why? Cry 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.750
 This of a little of the best possible Well retry 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.880
 Or rather weakness of the city bus 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.750
 Oh Na it is like a Tokonan 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.750
 In the first place 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.740
 Dragon Ball 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.210
 I'm dropping 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.210
 That pq 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:57.150
 Once from the patrol had come to kill and get salt items Battle corresponding 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.150
 It is so Gar Dragon Ball of you 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:06.510
 So I bought how to beat that patrol unit efficiently but this biggest fake milk 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.390
 It is but a good best 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.990
 Such battle and 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.510
 If you did not get gears in 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.170
 It comes out in the first area 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:21.630
 It takes one shot if you do not need time and effort scouting. 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.630
 It is easy to understand look into if not understand horse 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.300
 False rumor 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.500
 Until you come back to retry many times 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.090
 I have no idea 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.230
 Coach and fast forward s 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.440
 This is faster than the maximum charge 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.440
 It doesn't have to be right or wrong. 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.600
 I think I also remember some people who noticed 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.010
 I totally hate the computer 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.010
 It is a fixed artillery game 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.010
 Ne material item It will not come out at the time of material item anymore 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.570
 that 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:08.530
 I think it is up to two of the units that putter will drop 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.530
 Results done several times 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.190
 You 6 material item Material item 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.190
 It is not appropriate Material item important item is turning 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.540
 I will beat 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.150
 I I early 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.670
 10 other people also do 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.240
 After all, I just cut off and clear this 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.980
 Once cleared 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.159
 Great 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.170
 I also struggled with tofu too much 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.170
 Thank you for coming in
