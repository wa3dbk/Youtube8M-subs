00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.669 
people like it but you know dead man's
hand<00:02:06.920> from<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.670> think<00:02:08.600> it<00:02:08.780> was<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.440> modern

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
hand from I think it was the modern

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.960 
hand from I think it was the modern
warfare<00:02:09.739> 3<00:02:09.920> there's<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.280> lot<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.429> just<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.759> lot<00:02:10.880> of

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
warfare 3 there's a lot of just a lot of

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.780 
warfare 3 there's a lot of just a lot of
stuff<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:12.739> by<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.220> way<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.400> think<00:02:13.519> black

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
stuff and and by the way I think black

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.000 
stuff and and by the way I think black
ops<00:02:14.000> who<00:02:14.120> has<00:02:14.359> has<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.810> best<00:02:14.959> balance<00:02:15.590> as<00:02:15.769> far

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
ops who has has the best balance as far

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.210 
ops who has has the best balance as far
as<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.609> know<00:02:16.730> fun<00:02:17.090> factor<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.900> BS<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.980> and

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
as you know fun factor and BS and and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.650 
as you know fun factor and BS and and
that's<00:02:19.579> the<00:02:19.760> main<00:02:19.910> thing<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.269> think<00:02:20.329> if<00:02:20.570> they

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
that's the main thing I think if they

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.880 
that's the main thing I think if they
could<00:02:20.810> just<00:02:20.840> get<00:02:21.109> that<00:02:21.290> right<00:02:21.350> because

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
could just get that right because

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.170 
could just get that right because
there's<00:02:22.070> they're<00:02:22.280> gonna<00:02:22.370> put<00:02:22.609> in<00:02:22.730> some<00:02:22.760> BS

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
there's they're gonna put in some BS

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.400 
there's they're gonna put in some BS
there's<00:02:23.540> they're<00:02:23.810> gonna<00:02:23.930> put<00:02:24.079> in<00:02:24.200> something

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
there's they're gonna put in something

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.160 
there's they're gonna put in something
that<00:02:24.620> annoys<00:02:24.859> everybody<00:02:25.870> because<00:02:26.870> they<00:02:27.109> think

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
that annoys everybody because they think

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.050 
that annoys everybody because they think
it's<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.530> good<00:02:27.650> idea<00:02:27.769> or<00:02:28.040> they<00:02:28.670> think<00:02:28.730> it'll

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
it's a good idea or they think it'll

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.420 
it's a good idea or they think it'll
just<00:02:29.090> bring<00:02:29.390> new<00:02:29.570> customers<00:02:30.070> or<00:02:31.070> whatever<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
just bring new customers or whatever the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.039 
just bring new customers or whatever the
case<00:02:31.459> may<00:02:31.730> be<00:02:31.760> but<00:02:32.060> they're<00:02:32.690> gonna<00:02:32.780> throw<00:02:32.930> it

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
case may be but they're gonna throw it

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.220 
case may be but they're gonna throw it
in<00:02:33.140> look<00:02:33.260> at<00:02:33.320> this

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
in look at this

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.470 
in look at this
that<00:02:34.860> isn't<00:02:35.069> work<00:02:35.159> this<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.430> where<00:02:35.640> kg<00:02:36.180> never

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
that isn't work this is where kg never

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.089 
that isn't work this is where kg never
fails<00:02:38.330> yeah<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.599> like<00:02:39.780> black<00:02:40.500> ops<00:02:40.709> 2<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.890> think

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
fails yeah so like black ops 2 I think

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.589 
fails yeah so like black ops 2 I think
it<00:02:41.190> had<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.489> good<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.879> know<00:02:41.970> balance<00:02:42.390> like

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
it had like a good you know balance like

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.970 
it had like a good you know balance like
it<00:02:42.659> was<00:02:42.780> like<00:02:42.870> 50<00:02:43.200> 50<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.620> know<00:02:43.709> they<00:02:43.830> had<00:02:43.950> a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
it was like 50 50 you know they had a

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.460 
it was like 50 50 you know they had a
good<00:02:44.250> big<00:02:44.760> %<00:02:45.120> fun<00:02:45.540> factor<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.110> then<00:02:46.200> fifty

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
good big % fun factor and then fifty

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.710 
good big % fun factor and then fifty
percent<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.769> it<00:02:46.920> was<00:02:47.069> BS<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:48.000> know<00:02:48.060> some<00:02:48.690> of

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
percent of it was BS you know some of

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.420 
percent of it was BS you know some of
the<00:02:48.840> sniping<00:02:49.260> someone<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.159> can't<00:02:50.370> even

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
the sniping someone just I can't even

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.740 
the sniping someone just I can't even
think<00:02:50.549> of<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.760> right<00:02:50.910> now<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:51.150> just<00:02:51.360> as<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> lot

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
think of it right now but just as a lot

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.690 
think of it right now but just as a lot
of<00:02:51.900> stuff<00:02:52.319> like<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.560> EMPs<00:02:52.890> just<00:02:53.340> come<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.580> my

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
of stuff like the EMPs just come to my

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.089 
of stuff like the EMPs just come to my
head<00:02:53.910> every<00:02:54.510> time<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.989> think<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.620> black<00:02:55.769> ops<00:02:55.950> 2

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
head every time I think of black ops 2

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.070 
head every time I think of black ops 2
bottom<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.580> then<00:02:57.090> modern<00:02:57.420> warfare<00:02:57.569> 3<00:02:57.690> that

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
bottom and then modern warfare 3 that

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.860 
bottom and then modern warfare 3 that
was<00:02:58.230> like<00:02:58.410> 25<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.430> 75<00:02:59.819> percent<00:03:00.360> for<00:03:00.480> me<00:03:00.629> and

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
was like 25 to 75 percent for me and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.680 
was like 25 to 75 percent for me and
then<00:03:01.620> ghost<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.370> like<00:03:02.519> five<00:03:02.760> percent<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.299> utter

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
then ghost is like five percent in utter

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.819 
then ghost is like five percent in utter
BS<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.840> just<00:03:07.019> hope<00:03:07.110> they<00:03:07.319> just<00:03:07.349> you<00:03:07.709> know

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
BS so so I just hope they just you know

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.770 
BS so so I just hope they just you know
get<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.099> good<00:03:08.280> balance<00:03:08.459> as<00:03:08.790> far<00:03:09.000> as<00:03:09.120> fun<00:03:09.360> factor

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
get a good balance as far as fun factor

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.449 
get a good balance as far as fun factor
and<00:03:09.900> bs<00:03:10.170> because<00:03:10.590> that's<00:03:11.190> all<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.430> really

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459
