00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 hello very good to all before the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.280
 informative 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:14.130
 good on this occasion we will see how 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:18.060
 how to reactivate activate with iphone 4 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.000
 what is jumping in the main step 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.790
 when he asks us 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.550
 that we activate the iphone with some and 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:31.640
 that is from the operator of our iphone and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.620
 good if in our case for example 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.220
 our iphone was one more version 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.199
 before and I was in jailbreak and now 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.320
 free and now as we have updated to 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.850
 the version 7 0 2 that is the last one now 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.260
 same 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.530
 it gives us the problem that we can not 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.409
 activate it and good this time we go 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.440
 to see how to activate it or how to jump 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:01.060
 these steps and enter our terminal 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.800
 in a normal way 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:09.159
 I must remember that the mobile is an iphone4 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.880
 normal is not the 4s alone is the 4 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.640
 since there is this method that we are going to 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.380
 use is not compatible with the iphone 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.649
 4s is only with the iphone 4 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.430
 good to do this we should download 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.270
 the folder that I will leave in the article 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.340
 on my page to link dotcom 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.340
 and then we're going to 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.159
 to see what it is 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.280
 how it gets good first of all we go 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.980
 to open the file that I will leave among the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.550
 ssh files is a java file 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.550
 we open it 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.829
 and as you see here he asks us to connect 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.380
 the mobile in how a connection is connected 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:04.950
 iphone in fruit mode first of all 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.850
 we turn off the terminal 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.850
 once off 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.099
 and as you see once we turn off we press 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.110
 the power key the home key happens 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.730
 first on the x key until it appears 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.280
 the apple we press the home key 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.920
 of the middle we want to press the two 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.150
 keys turn off and let go of the by 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.010
 what is pressed the key 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.110
 until our computer detects the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.040
 iphone as you can see right now what 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.040
 just detected 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.030
 start doing what is the exploit and 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.030
 those things 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.500
 and here in our mobile when when and 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.980
 you have sent the exploits and randis if 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.190
 it has to be on this screen with the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.490
 apple duct and this bar 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.360
 Once this is the case, the mobile phone already 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.300
 have connected 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.670
 through an ssh now what are we going to 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.270
 to do is to open the program win sct 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.270
 we open it 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.159
 and here we put 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.579
 local post in the server name on 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:37.209
 port that we are going to use is 2022 the 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.599
 root user and the password at the end 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.599
 foot 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.160
 connect 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.910
 here we see that the session is already 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.940
 initiated 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.080
 once here we're going to finish 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.160
 we open the terminal 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.160
 we give you to accept 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.190
 open session here we are going to write 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.450
 montt 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.810
 sh 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.220
 we give him in, he runs the mountain and has 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.660
 mounted what is the root we are going to close 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.660
 once here we will level up 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.860
 once we are here we enter the mont 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.290
 one before oscar pÃ©rez who I think we're going to 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.440
 enter the first one in montuno let's go 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:36.660
 to go to applications and then we go down and 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.650
 we look for where it puts setup point app 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.670
 let's delete highlight this application 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.670
 remove accept 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:52.840
 but it will erase once for nothing anymore 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.689
 we are going to close the program in sct 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.569
 He tells us s 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:03.449
 accept and now we're here we're going to 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:05.779
 pay our terminal to be 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.779
 turn off 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:14.060
 This method is done by pressing the key 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.060
 home and the key to be able 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.460
 once off 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.229
 it restarts 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.500
 and now we will enter the mode 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:31.539
 recovery as you can see here and now 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.169
 to get out in this way what we should 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:37.580
 do is open tony umbrella that also 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.840
 I will leave 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.840
 between the archives 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.450
 once we are here for you 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.970
 we select our iphone that comes from 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.280
 this way we give you where they succeed 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.889
 Recover 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.250
 already shut down and be initiated so 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:06.260
 normal and we are missing the step of activating 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:09.190
 the iphone using a sd card or with 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.190
 a sim card 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.819
 to start our mobile 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.670
 degrees 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:56.030
 and until he puts us there is no 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:58.980
 card like this to activate the iphone in 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:03.000
 be from a card like that of me and so so 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:05.780
 and once this we can already see that 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.250
 we are on our iphone 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.620
 activated or we have already skipped the 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.640
 step of the activation without having the 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:17.460
 iphone operator sim card 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.950
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.009
