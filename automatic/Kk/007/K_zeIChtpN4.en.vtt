00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.309
 And then everyone's right is as follows. 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.259
 Here the video is somewhat unusual because 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.389
 People are going to do a books in the people. 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.150
 got here for the channel recently 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.859
 a Glasses Developer Kit 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.920
 griffith that thing of reality 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.920
 virtual 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.130
 We can bring some videos 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.960
 demonstrating this technology for you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.480
 here but before we have to take 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.880
 This from the box this is going to be boxing. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.700
 of the green glasses and face you 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.620
 developer two go away then 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.780
 crowd is here the box it comes in 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.210
 because this is not a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.219
 product to put on the shelf of 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.559
 a store is a kit for developers 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.149
 gaming product here in theory was not 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.010
 launched on the market is still in 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.449
 development process and I do not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.430
 I can talk development neither 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.640
 Can I get it out of here? 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.730
 there I think it was beauty reuse now 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.530
 here the green glasses and carew the first 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.570
 Once I used one I used the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.729
 developer development a 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.970
 I play the delicate desire to play the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.850
 Face willingness to exchange this here is the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.100
 2 in several new things one of them is the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.710
 fact that now you can use this 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.780
 thing that looks like a webcam to power 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.700
 detect the movement of this trinket that 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.400
 now it not only has a function of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.840
 movements and to see but he can see 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.119
 also how much you are inclining 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.090
 the head this here is very interesting to 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.650
 People have here first 20 glasses and it comes 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.900
 with a little box here for you to 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.670
 place it on your computer and such and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.130
 people have various accessories for you 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.850
 be able to adapt it to your dry eye 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.619
 place it in the computer and I hdmi 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.770
 just tank it is a lens 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.380
 no one from bb dtvm about the glasses who 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.790
 never saw one being used here and if 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.619
 connect with plastic still obviously 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.390
 It was not used, I'm going to give it a shot. 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.549
 in it now and pass a conjunctivitis 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.890
 here for the next person to use this 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.600
 Truth you suffer like this in theory. 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.850
 I'm going to take my hat off, it 's for him. 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.799
 get in your head 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.239
 Only in the gigantic head does it leave me 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.619
 Talk to you, we'll make a 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.230
 effort here counts 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.090
 It's more or less that way, and that's it. 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.129
 regulates things for your eye and eye 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.680
 this is very interesting, very cool guy 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.989
 and obviously has the camera that 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.299
 is used to detect movement of 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.519
 1 sensors that you have inside the 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.890
 he only detects this movement 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.500
 here basically a little of itself with the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.690
 camera it detects that also in 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.769
 theory now you do not have to just look 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.569
 to one side to the other up and down 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.549
 down you can for example stay the 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.110
 head and look over a wall 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.750
 which is very interesting in the kit of 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.790
 original developer1 that I've tested 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.590
 there on my channel such a feat of nerd 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.900
 People did not have this, that's a novelty. 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.970
 to you who are also questions 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.760
 people have so much to be able to clean 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.609
 his lens you can change accordingly 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.220
 with grades tomorrow and I think it 's 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.500
 basically this box is not so cool 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.000
 the kit as housing the developer 1 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.519
 box of a video in a box 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.890
 plastic isaac in cardboard use even more 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.629
 Finally're worth so I think that neca 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.090
 This is it, I'm going to put on a hat. 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.769
 come back because the hair is horrible that 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.140
 This was a quick video to show 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.359
 For you a box of this stretch here . 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.099
 virtual reality if you did not know 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.019
 This is a way for you to be able to 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.000
 you enter into the computer such you put 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.130
 in your head you have two screens in your 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.680
 in front of which is very interesting people 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.019
 will try to straighten out all the things that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.760
 do all the tests here is a kit 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.349
 developer still means that 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.239
 not a product ready for the public 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.829
 You have to do a lot of testing. 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.269
 attempt to leave things 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.859
 working but once people 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.709
 to be able to do everything we bring 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.569
 Here you have some games on the glasses 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.880
 green and I know the guys will want 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.680
 watch horror game only has one person from 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.239
 control two here in vancouver for 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.150
 be able to record with that which is where 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.889
 glasses are on then you already know you're going 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.239
 have to make a video I see you in the 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.700
 next even more guys 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.269
 Bye, this is the one we 're here for. 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.160
 Come back with me and brk and cdu on the other side 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.379

 reviews
