00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
suzuka circuit by the way this is right

00:01:48.890 --> 00:02:00.260 
suzuka circuit by the way this is right
after<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.310> Japan<00:01:49.640> f1<00:01:50.119> grand<00:01:50.450> prix

slow<00:03:01.860> down<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.100> bit<00:03:02.250> around<00:03:03.209> 6,000<00:03:03.900> rads<00:03:05.090> this

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
slow down a bit around 6,000 rads this

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.970 
slow down a bit around 6,000 rads this
uphill<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> little<00:03:07.019> difficult<00:03:07.200> to

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.170 

the<00:03:54.900> transmission<00:03:55.500> feels<00:03:55.890> okay<00:03:56.310> but<00:03:57.060> the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
the transmission feels okay but the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.910 
the transmission feels okay but the
uphill<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.780> little<00:03:58.050> tough

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.590 

integra<00:04:04.920> are<00:04:05.160> obviously<00:04:05.790> has<00:04:06.060> more<00:04:06.390> power

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
integra are obviously has more power

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.840 
integra are obviously has more power
from<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.960> bigger<00:04:07.200> engine<00:04:07.620> but<00:04:08.250> this<00:04:08.430> Civic

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850
