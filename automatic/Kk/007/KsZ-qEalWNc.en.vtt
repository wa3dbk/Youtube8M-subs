00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
but really that was just about it

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.859 
but really that was just about it
and<00:01:43.100> even<00:01:43.399> if<00:01:43.520> we'd<00:01:43.700> gotten<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.090> romero<00:01:44.479> film

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
and even if we'd gotten the romero film

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.859 
and even if we'd gotten the romero film
it<00:01:45.170> still<00:01:45.440> wouldn't<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:45.950> been<00:01:46.070> very<00:01:46.369> good

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
it still wouldn't have been very good

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.219 
it still wouldn't have been very good
really

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229
