00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.660
 tests like kings like ourense like 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.720
 ferrol that they are here and for that 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.640
 we still have so much hobby 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.360
 and in Galicia but not 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.360
 are the ones that 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.420
 and you have to sign up 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.810
 get things here are there and 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.050
 then fight until the end of a 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.050
 bit 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.700
 and camacho 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.520
 in the end he gives everything everything everything everything and 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.289
 good 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.149
 to spend a little sad I was going 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.270
 in the end the horns were also 

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:56.010
 within the race 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.480
 and bad luck he has been very stupid 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.750
 besides the cone he played has not been 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.950
 one with a lot of difficulty and good 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:08.690
 wish you luck waiting for Juan 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.690
 then have some low or something 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.750
 types of pilots selections 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.130
 randomly selected random but a 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.690
 coach that is selected 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.180
 because he has seen you better or worse and 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.819
 final what counts is the stopwatch 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.889
 now good I have to run with the car 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.410
 I'm running lately on the 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.710
 rally is the Basque country and in cantabria 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.910
 I have a clio group in the running and 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.889
 pretty well I've already had three races with 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.780
 bad luck that if a puncture that yes 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.090
 a mechanical breakdown and now this is the 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.330
 cone, then you will see what happens 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.330
 rope 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.659
 to 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.659
 how 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:21.060
 I feel 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.830
 at this moment a little shabby but to 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.210
 the time very happy because the 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.350
 experience has really been very 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.730
 gratifying 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.650
 I would like to congratulate the 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.010
 ptc people and the people of that ere 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.660
 because Han is an exceptional job and 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.310
 Well, I've spent my whole life on this and 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.340
 I greatly value 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.230
 that everything has been so clean so clear 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.180
 and so with equal opportunities to 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.400
 everyone really I have attended 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.090
 many events these in my life and I'm 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.090
 pleasantly surprised 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.150
 between the first and the third that was me 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.430
 there were two tenths with four hundredths 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.920
 after two minutes of testing and the 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.050
 previous now they were fifty ago 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.530
 fifty thousandths or more equality 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.530
 impossible 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.030
 yes 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:32.460
 I would encourage everyone to good 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.890
 there is always a saying of these stories 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.140
 people sometimes distrustful of whether they are 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:40.830
 legal or not this is legal one hundred percent 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:43.550
 I put my hand in the fire for it 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.550
 to
