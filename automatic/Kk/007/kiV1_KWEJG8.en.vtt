00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 so here we are in pebbles and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.359
 sticks so pebbles and sticks that 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.429
 did you go see a game mode 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.469
 which is really better because years I 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.000
 finds out from me because I do not know 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.000
 not if you remember on call of 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.470
 black duty ops first of the name we 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.590
 planes wholesale ballistic knives 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.600
 who did not come back we said at the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.930
 moc who did not come in and we had 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.060
 crossbow games that did not fit 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.460
 not either and so what gave that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.910
 it was pretty much all about luck 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.219
 that sarah pose is so is there you 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.440
 see that it's a lot more 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.540
 style 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.800
 finally I think 1 according to me or so I 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.190
 I'm really lucky on this 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.809
 gameplay 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.879
 in this case I did a good job 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.620
 for once in notebooks the stick that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.420
 is not a mode that I appreciate or 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.489
 rather than I liked because there I 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.610
 meaning I'm fine the one who does this 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.920
 game mode so I played a lot at 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.899
 ballistic knife and automatic because 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.840
 I like throwing knives 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.049
 ballistic as you come to see it 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.600
 as they fit the crossbow well as 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.700
 I told you earlier 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 it makes less hanau I did not want 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.500
 actually says that it does less damage 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.540
 actually in pebbles and sticks so he 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.369
 it's almost almost necessary to 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.049
 stocks the guy to be able to kill him 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.280
 so I think it's not that bad 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.500
 because sometimes there were people 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.909
 who came a bit the kind yarn is a 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.610
 guys trying to escape and 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.939
 finally ben he was getting himself 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.579
 was taking a small crossbow in 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.700
 the bone so also a big peculiarity 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.880
 finally big novelty of this pebble and 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.240
 bat we know that to see supported finally I do not 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.159
 do not know if you press black ops 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.490
 first name to take back a 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.920
 tomahawk or a ballistic knife 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.850
 it was press square galÃ©rait 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.490
 and so that's where I actually know iron 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.509
 square but I thought it was weird 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.670
 because we did not see the little acronym 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.670
 square for finally because and I mom I'm 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.650
 on xbox plus so that's x 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.190
 like that both include more 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.440
 so we had to do x or squares for 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.959
 recover the tomahawk or knife 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.970
 ballistics emanating actually everything 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.160
 you simply have to pass over 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.560
 so find yourself more vote tomahawk 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.840
 it's good you have to go a little 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.330
 on the corpse of the guy is normally 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.569
 you should be able to pick it up 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.030
 tranquillou so you can see that 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.000
 the ballistic knives returns 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.019
 really better with the black ops 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.620
 black ops goes out and the state is also missing at 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:56.370
 crossing so if not the crossbow that is 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.280
 very futuristic also sees a little a 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.560
 new design is rather rather 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.110
 stylish I find 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.989
 we also see that she can shoot 3 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.830
 crossbow at the same time to see at the same 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.989
 time not at the same time 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.700
 in almost at the same time I do not know 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.380
 too much how do you finally say I play 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.739
 choice you have eyes and you know 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.060
 understood what I meant so I 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.510
 find that it's I think it's 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.359
 much better for the for the the 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.340
 pebble and sticks anyway and there I 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.750
 go galley with these guys the assets 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.310
 that I will empty all ammunition 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.820
 and then choice I'll even mess it up 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.680
 at the end 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:37.250
 the cut just as a little precision 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.859
 in fact or so you will see in the 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.380
 last gameplay announced a ball in 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.880
 the room a and gameplay a ball 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.780
 in the child's room a ball a 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.810
 loaded ball and so in fact I forgot 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.480
 to specify also in the gameplay 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.550
 and elite I think it was 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.700
 that when we have no secondary weapons 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.970
 in fact we have a simple knife and 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.480
 I had a shooter game 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.470
 elite 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.290
 before the game I introduced you 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.340
 where I had the knife from when we did 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.530
 no way of calling it when we 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.870
 does not have a secondary school so it's 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.250
 possible just little anecdote that it's 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.750
 possible that you have the knife of 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.340
 tears when we have no weapons 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.440
 secondary sniper 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.900
 so I think it's not 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.840
 so badly he is quite funny this 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.090
 little knife is in any case me me he 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.540
 I like it so here's for the little 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:43.290
 anecdote we do not care about you can 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.130
 see that I lead quite widely to 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.889
 score level 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.389
 but remember that I can 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.460
 take a tomahawk to the last 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.770
 second and lose all my points 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.360
 so is it going to happen to me well I 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.740
 you leave the surprise at the end of the 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.120
 video is here so I'm going galley 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.270
 with this guy I did not understand the step 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.010
 to eat so it's really something 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.130
 very rare thing people from this fund to a 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.060
 rate less than at the end of the gameplay but 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.140
 bah is that they are things that 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.919
 come I want to say it's 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.440
 things that happen and so is in this 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.900
 gameplay and well it's not going to happen and 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.520
 I'm going to win and I'm sure there's 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.979
 was full of holes that were there at the muc 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.940
 where it is grilled it is sure that there is 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.979
 takes a less rake than the supply in 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.260
 course and no I will take me a 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.810
 ballistic knife so it's okay me 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.950
 do and I will win with it anyway 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.990
 a nice margin 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.160
 so I was pretty happy with that 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:45.240
 gameplay I hope this mini that's it 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.850
 that this thing is that this sequel to 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.810
 videos in pebbles and bat you will have 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:54.990
 so more so we end up all of 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.669
 next for a gameplay in a ball 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.669
 charge or a valve in the room
