00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.330
 maranello connection channel all the ferrari that won the title 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.330
 consultori these years 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.079
 montezemolo 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:20.050
 even the presidents have a fever 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.810
 should be on the phone what a good day should have 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.810
 recognized 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.940
 because we showed what is not working but we also have 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.840
 underlined what works in our country 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.620
 because there is ferrari wins 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.680
 because it invests a lot of your money, I remind everyone that before it arrived 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380
 montezemolo the ferrari 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.410
 consultiva even me anaphase so critical you can love it 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.600
 of tractors, that is to say, people must be given a revolving mattel 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.250
 a name that the name of Italy in the world is why it's so difficult 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.810
 italy to do of certain public level in short you want to explain me why there 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.590
 successful private flights 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.660
 marmirolo 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.930
 well I listened to what you said 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.140
 from my point of view and how it never goes well 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.100
 making the figure of the first class la ferrari is one of the companies of 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.260
 excellence unfortunately in Italy 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.880
 pardon 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.890
 many many bullshit I believe that in extreme synthesis we open things to say 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.850
 which are the most important fb horse races the first is a country that does not 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.670
 invest in research is a country that does not invest in its future this is the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.340
 the most important card to say for a country is the fruitfulness of scourging 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.160
 very strong 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.910
 for the most important things to do are found 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.250
 if you do not put research on the same juridical 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.050
 you suck crap real crap tomorrow they'll find you for so many things totally 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.070
 I repeat the priorities of a country 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.590
 because research means young mobile future means competitiveness and here 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.550
 ferrari arrives 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.060
 if we do not proactively keep ourselves important for research every year 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.130
 technological that is a research we launched a man for the environment formula 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.709
 work and safety 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.890
 we will not be able to win eight world championships that escaped in 10 years 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.719
 and we will not always be at the forefront of the truth to find the money for the 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.959
 research soon I love other things but it is patty to specify that the search 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.629
 the most important thing is to become a boston, now we are going to fly 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.629

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.259
