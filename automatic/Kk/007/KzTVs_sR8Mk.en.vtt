00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.709
 I got a refrigeration refrigerator not here 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.339
 You can hear the kick on the compressors 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:25.169
 But you can hear one of the first things to check that the fan is not kicking at 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.109
 So the fan can just be stuck 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.199
 So 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.340
 What we will do is remove the ice pack deal 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.250
 Just by paying here 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.340
 Slip it out and there are two bolts on the back of the channel that carry the fan in 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.410
 So I'm gonna remove these two screws here 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.760
 This is one of the first things to check out and when you've got a fridge that is not cooling 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.580
 Check for the first engine fan of its kind stuck 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.130
 Now it may not be the only thing that goes on 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.390
 Lift this fan channel here and slide it out 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.840
 Okay 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.790
 Andres our fan, you can see it is not very fast spinning 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.570
 It should be faster than spinning 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.010
 Chances are what it is that it is very close 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.980
 The fan blade is very close 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.580
 See how it was rubbing against the return 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.960
 That is why it was not spinning too fast 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.330
 So what I'm gonna do is pull forward that little bit more 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.970
 Is probably a little safer to 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.050
 The first power off but I'm just gonna get this done 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.570
 ok 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.720
 I took the whole thing off there 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 Anyway put this on and now it's a little more and do what you should now keep the air from being able to blow down to the freezer and freezer will not rotate the air as it should 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.569
 Behind the fan channel in this aspect it got modified here 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.999
 You usually do not have to set these to much 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:24.999
 But if you want your fridge to be cooler or your fridge cooler need to be cooler you can adjust this demand by pulling out and converting it, each model has its own peculiarities. Ok now that our refrigerator is fixed in theory what we need to verify is 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:40.219
 Under the pan to see if there is any ice there which is probably there is probably a blockage of the drain line of the freezer 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.480
 The way you can tell this is if we get water dripping 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.879
 to here 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.659
 We do that which need to go into it obviously 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:48.249
 But I will put it on the next video clip.
