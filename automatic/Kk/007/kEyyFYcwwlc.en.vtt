00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.089
 world and make this artificial shrimp 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.589
 artificial 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.019
 I'll tell you a material that I 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.509
 I used supersimples here in roll 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.299
 I used this little flag to put 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.439
 I put in the amount I use the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.039
 mold the mold I used a pvc pipe 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:27.180
 ask to cut the barrel 200 mm and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.429
 I used plaster was to buy the plaster by law 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.470
 the plaster in the water to make the mold 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.739
 I played 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.250
 I got the shrimp I got the shrimp 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.980
 monster I put the shrimp fixer 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.420
 I put it in half after I 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.239
 I put it in half 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.989
 if you play the direct plaster will stay 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.590
 grasped 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.059
 So what do you do, I got margarine. 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.340
 I picked margarine here over in 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.280
 the whole area I went over here after 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.649
 of the dump and again another 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.359
 plaster to make the second layer 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.150
 I put it in half as you can see 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.310
 this half here I put the first 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.470
 hand i hope ck waits about 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.299
 two hours to dry 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.689
 After I did the second part, I waited. 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.909
 two more hours after I did this 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 in this total of four hours I came beat 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:27.930
 and then I'd rather open that 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.259
 I removed the two parts and pulled 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.290
 there ready says I fixed it from inside 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.770
 the silicone with had played 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.200
 I'm using politics 's silicon is like 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.240
 You can see from the politec ink that I 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.130
 I used this paint that suvinil 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.310
 you can trust anywhere 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.479
 I passed the prisons of lacquer before 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.130
 play the second step and used brightness 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.659
 This is where you are called by Purina. 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.960
 some rain of glitter right? 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.149
 and to paint the eye I bought ink 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.009
 acrylic synthetic enamel even for 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.319
 to pass the final result is this one 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.769
 Shrimp have made and silicone 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.030
 You can see his city and I already pulled it. 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.280
 because I'm not holding the camera 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.400
 but you can pull the will explain 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.200
 Well, the hardest part was really. 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.019
 to cut snows and cut 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.510
 right cut of the shrimp and such 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.889
 I'm doing several sizes and here 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.810
 is the result 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.290
 basically how they stayed right? 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.719
 after I painted a shrimp 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.700
 also with all the details yes and it is 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:41.669
 basically this is the total I spent 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.859
 was 35 reais in all this material 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:45.389
 and there I will now produce several with 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.030
