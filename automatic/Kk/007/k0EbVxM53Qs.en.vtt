00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.819
 hi everyone guys 2 tm and today i am 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.779
 back with a new video on call of 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.759
 duty black ops 2 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.530
 today I propose a normal video though 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.199
 take advantage of this video to tell you a 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.080
 nice bit of things since I have little time e 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.720
 too many things to say and leave immediately 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.060
 to analyze the class I discovered 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.769
 that this is the boh class to me it seems 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.000
 stronger than the game because it's one thing 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.289
 unbelievable 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.570
 I saw it in a video of an American 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.730
 the omitted or made in one day three nuclei 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.510
 with this weapon it is a really thing to 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.040
 fear 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.000
 I really recommend it and above 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.660
 amber I am going to analyze then it was one 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.280
 n 94 studied with three accessories 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.620
 the first was the viewfinder the new reflexes 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.500
 as you can see then I had the loader 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.750
 increased and the calcium is adjustable 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.930
 these are the three because stronger on 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.120
 this weapon because I didn't think so too 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.469
 that was so strong but instead they are 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 really found the first one very well 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.199
 game I played so try a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.390
 bit to make sure that a nuclear 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.000
 if it comes out played in a group it will be released by 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.939
 safe with this weapon is why and how 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.090
 using jackal splinter and then the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.970
 third wild card that had used it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.210
 with tactical mascara and dexterity 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.240
 then you will have to get used to playing 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.590
 without c4 if you are a player who 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.110
 they use g4 a lot even at first 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.230
 times me 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.580
 how to say I forgot I no longer had c4 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.850
 and so I was making the film to launch 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.710
 maybe I was dying even afterwards though 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.460
 you guys will see that you do it right away 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.200
 the habit and therefore nothing this was the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.400
 class that I really recommend to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.890
 then use and passing it a little 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.890
 other updates that are happening 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.410
 these days I wanted you right away 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.080
 that I forget to say go through the 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.360
 hamas design channel that made me 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.430
 as you have seen the new graphics of the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.220
 channel but had asked to 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.420
 sponsor it from before the video of 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.009
 zombie 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.540
 just that in that video I forgot 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.670
 then after the other video it seems to me that it was 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.170
 the one who had been eyeing but he 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.300
 I didn't tell her to say then I had 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.450
 made the nuclear a veteran and now 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.890
 I make this video and I take advantage of it for 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.709
 to let you pass in his channel that 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.360
 really a great editor is a policeman 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.190
 truly spectacular if so yes 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.230
 they can call because the has changed 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.630
 youtube graphics so I don't know if yes 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.120
 still calls biblio lay out and I do n't know 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.459
 however, as a liar a lot is a 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.560
 graphic really good in case vi 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.730
 I leave the link in description past the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.650
 channel does 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.220
 fabi g lay out how you want to call it 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.370
 free just being a lot 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.349
 also good at the many jobs to be done 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.450
 so maybe he wo n't do it for you 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.670
 same day but maybe it will take one 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.530
 week a week and a half then 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.860
 these are just a little waiting time 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.260
 this is the first thing I wanted then 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.879
 tell you another things about that channel 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.010
 zero stops of my clan 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.200
 we are now slowly coming back 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.120
 active because I didn't want to do before 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.040
 video because it was useless that I did 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.620
 video there too having two channels I don't 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.879
 it really seemed to be the case and therefore 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.940
 I had decided not to commit anymore 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:22.859
 on zero fenni until he did 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.940
 1tb and just sent me a message 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:29.040
 where it was written that he had done the 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:32.109
 commentaries then maybe tomorrow or 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.319
 the day after tomorrow but I think more the day after tomorrow 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:38.170
 therefore today that newspaper the 9 therefore 10 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.730
 el 11 you will have the video on this year femi 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.120
 and I leave the link in the description 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.590
 passed also for our channel and that 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.790
 like I said before but we're coming back 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.790
 active slowly 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.430
 and past if maybe you like videos 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.379
 just sign up for the other reason to 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.379
 which I no longer wanted to do 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.959
 video on that channel I received for 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.879
 a few visuals I like then opening 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.609
 this channel 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:07.040
 I've had more face on this channel before 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.290
 having 300 400 subscribers the more I like it 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.319
 9 a little bit and then dropped mere 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.930
 make videos there and have more fun doing 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.799
 video on this channel where I saw that 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.400
 the subscribers were a little more active here 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.940
 is this was the other thing then 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.610
 what was other things I'm forgetting 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.340
 I had to tell you what the channel was 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.210
 I said this, in fact I wanted to say 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.840
 something I already had in mind to do 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.310
 for some time only then for various 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.400
 reasons I said no maybe it's too much 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.430
 soon wait another little was to open 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.850
 a facebook page where you could 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:51.990
 maybe contact me ask me questions 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:55.449
 a bit so a little more private because 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.400
 so at least he answers more willingly not 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.190
 that I do n't do it here too but maybe 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.600
 on facebook it gets better and so I had 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.280
 a little intention to open a page 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.560
 facebook maybe let me know in the 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.690
 comments how many would register who a 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.240
 facebook these things not to facebook 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.940
 here and we are going for the thousand 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.099
 subscribers if anything we'll get to do is 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.410
 a kind of openlab since many of 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.500
 you in the comments write me if I could 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.590
 add you to the list they wanted 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.039
 you wanted to play with me just like I have 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.849
 say 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.889
 toh the friend list is unfortunately already full 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.410
 and so I was going to do a 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.430
 this thing, however, you see 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.020
 updates in other videos 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.669
 not the guys the video ends here 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.210
 greet you and feel the next one 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.210
 beautiful raga
