00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.170
 Personal beauty also comes back with one more 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.089
 video of the wood performance for you 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.309
 I already discussed the subject will be oil 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.150
 lubricant will be maintenance with 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.889
 oil motorcycle periodic exchange 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.809
 Do you know what happens in your engine? 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.250
 in case you miss time on it you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.439
 must imagine that something must happen 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.630
 which is good in some parts here 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.310
 behind that I'll show you to 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.430
 you have an idea of what you can 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.680
 and southern geography 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.240
 It's very important that you take care of the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.160
 maintenance of your motorcycle with regard to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.380
 the publication of the exchange of 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.239
 periodic oil filter oil filter is 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.860
 a bike service note in manual 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.370
 the owner says in some 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.379
 bikes then you change the oil every 10,000 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.000
 twelve thousand kilometers is 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.129
 particularly I think it's a little 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.660
 exaggeration find very okay because our 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.329
 gasoline here in Brazil unfortunately not 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.010
 is the best half-baptized gas 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.860
 many times you end up without knowing 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 putting the gas and is baptized beyond 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.170
 of the favela motorcycle causes a series of 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.270
 damage to the engine and that gasoline with 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.010
 time it ends up mingling with the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.710
 the organism that burns that 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.110
 burned gasoline it ends up contaminating 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.960
 oil, but from there you are also 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 lose a little of the lifetime of the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.799
 oil 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.479
 friction also brings pieces between 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.189
 the two pieces of metal that are 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.770
 if she cares, she lets go 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.439
 metal particles that they end up 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.140
 one is presided over by ending life 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.540
 useful oil but if it is then it 's us 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.710
 thinks a lot 10 2011 we recommend that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.740
 on wood performance with customers 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.729
 They exchange looks every 3 thousand at the most 5 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.470
 one thousand kilometers 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.780
 another important thing always changes 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.150
 oil filter join people called by 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.860
 there when my door you exchange now 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.950
 change the filter timber all a 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.450
 new speech that is exchange barely exchange yes and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.939
 another does not change the filter every 10,000 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.590
 miles if this is good. 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.360
 exchange every 10,000 people 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.939
 they would do the 10 but it is not not much 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.770
 damaging you and changing the oil 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.290
 leaving the oil filter there you go 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.230
 leave about 300 to 400 ml of oil 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.450
 contaminated 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.580
 absurd your engine within the filter in 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.960
 line then this is not going to work 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.720
 a lot because you're going to put order in 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.460
 engine those 400 and 300 ml will join 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.830
 contaminate the oil earlier then not 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.960
 ceases to be a not insignificant 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.910
 smart is so we exchange time 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.040
 has oil filters good from the market today 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.530
 has a cheaper filter and thirty 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.710
 forty reais and the most expensive I fell in 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.050
 item reflow mc entee and good filters 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.120
 quality in the market and today it is 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.550
 You'll spend a little more 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.440
 your engine will thank you in the long run 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.400
 you will have a longer useful life of your 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.170
 engine is something else let's say that the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.880
 why what happens what happens 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.710
 engine failure when oil is lacking 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.750
 diesel and lubricating oil and forms a 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.520
 film is not there between metal parts 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.800
 the engine and other parts are 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.050
 rubbing this film prevents wear 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.800
 of the engine and prevents the parts from 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.080
 wears 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.030
 however when you do not change the oil is the 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.850
 leaves a year thick mown is very old the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.590
 oil level too low than the case 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.930
 I'll show you all of them here. 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.650
 unfortunately they parted in the exchange of 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.630
 oil 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.580
 this oil film does not make you more 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.830
 will have metal with metal rubbing going 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.930
 generate an absurd heat and will start to 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.030
 crumble the pieces and you have 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.530
 a spinning engine and you'll get 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.660
 shatter almost all its 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.540
 engine with no lubrication then 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.830
 Let's go here for the pieces that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.470
 we had people here it turns out well 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.030
 because the crankshaft is that part 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.920
 engine is that it goes first 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.660
 although when you leave time is missing 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.520
 so we have three levels here 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.170
 different break're 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.020
 We have one here that you should not 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.700
 also come where is the brand tam 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.840
 is marked with a risky neck 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.310
 crankshaft here 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.930
 that's the owner so I start to 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.209
 hear a noise on the bike and already cut 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.860
 clutch on the clutch and called 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.750
 People said my bike making noise. 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.000
 so for what should be the lack 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.520
 oil but scratched crankshafts I'm not going 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.590
 to see it there but risky if we 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.940
 Let's ride that same crankshaft 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.650
 based on the new law to have problem 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.080
 because the blouse brand and increase 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.090
 too much trouble and we'll have a problem here 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.140
 we're seeing an intermediary 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.550
 I was isolated 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.100
 you are not seeing is a bronze color 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.590
 It's more or less the one that lost a lot 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.860
 civil bric also rubbish material 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.200
 but did not break 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.299
 okay then that this BiÃ© she knows with 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.829
 exception was working here not 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.540
 came to break rod did not reach 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.460
 break the question or anything but the 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.470
 Blowers ate all of them right. 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.540
 there the piston hit up the valve 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.160
 You can mark the balls correctly and 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.830
 ended up taking a twist on two wheels 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.780
 still but also the owner stopped very fast 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.240
 and now here is a case more 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.420
 catastrophic it's seeing here that's okay 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.980
 ugly like the crankshaft this here was 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.630
 option that was working here was the 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.060
 that left the rod the rest the beautiful 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.190
 simply died whole and other 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.750
 piece of candle that was down there that 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.080
 stayed there on the engine was knocked on the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.820
 motor housing and the housing of the 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.960
 engine some points up almost 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.360
 broke we had to make a 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.430
 there welding service very well done by 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.520
 signal not to notice but with enough 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.720
 safety and let's reconsider all that shirt. 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.350
 I was working, look at the 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.570
 pieces of metal, then this is the 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.610
 first part that goes away in the engine is 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.910
 the lower crankshaft bearings 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.640
 cranks it's so expensive it's not a piece 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.560
 Cheap to come here is for you to have a 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.270
 idea we bring out when 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.580
 this happens here the people in the option with 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.200
 our client brings the pieces out of you 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.060
 have an idea a new piece today is that 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.310
 You should have around this one around 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.040
 16 to 18 thousand reais or so 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.570
 Crankshaft is then the owner's 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.100
 We do not want to have any cases. 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.090
 changed the whole new crankshaft not 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.070
 I wanted to put used 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.530
 we go the customer's option and bring 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.810
 outside the United States or Europe is 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.140
 I'll make a video then make a one 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.270
 parenthesis here for you a video to 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.220
 you later on there on pieces 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.050
 used here at tha Brazil is a subject 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.970
 very delicate and controversial we have 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.890
 have to buy the used part because the 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.450
 People do not know the origin of it but I go 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.669
 to deal with this subject in another video 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.590
 A little later he returned to the 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.300
 matter of the lubricating oil is that 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.040
 be very careful with the oil level 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.690
 weekly before you to the street and 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.220
 You make your weekend vest. 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.090
 where you can see and mainly 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.430
 okay it puts the motorcycle completely in 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.169
 vertical will swim and I had disliked the 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.750
 I cleaned milk rice that until the end 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.760
 always and pull again look at the level in 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.960
 which is between the maximum and the minimum 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.340
 preferably from the middle to top of the 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.620
 motorcycle that does not have variety on a 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.430
 motorcycle that has a zen back viewer 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.840
 vertically 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.850
 the same way has a June display 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.560
 maximum mark and the minimum there you go there 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.810
 look or see how it is between the 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.430
 maximum and the legal minimum of 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.080
 I mean, it's avoids this kind of 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.250
 negligence you saw there you can leave 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.810
 Qatar 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.220
 You'll ask me in the comments. 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.650
 As an agreement with the guys they spent 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.390
 depends a lot on the damage 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.790
 Let's say that you will spend on 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.070
 around and today depends on the motorcycle everything 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.570
 more than 8 thousand reais below 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.640
 it leaves just for you to have an idea 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.020
 new c crankshaft costs six to eight 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.820
 A thousand reais that I just told you 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.740
 then for this calculation how much is going 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.170
 have more manpower will have the most 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.750
 eyes sometimes service 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:09.300
 when it picks up the balls
