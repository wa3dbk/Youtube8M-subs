00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
last year I probably would have been

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.530 
last year I probably would have been
like<00:04:01.860> you're<00:04:02.190> crazy<00:04:03.380> but<00:04:04.380> yeah<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:06.090> was<00:04:06.300> it's

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
something different and it had to be

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.160 
something different and it had to be
kind<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.340> on<00:04:11.490> my<00:04:11.670> toes<00:04:11.910> all<00:04:12.210> season<00:04:12.630> we<00:04:13.020> even

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
kind of on my toes all season we even

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.360 
kind of on my toes all season we even
talked<00:04:13.440> about<00:04:13.500> at<00:04:13.710> the<00:04:13.770> end<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:13.920> last<00:04:14.070> year

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
talked about at the end of last year

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.130 
talked about at the end of last year
that<00:04:14.540> we're<00:04:15.540> gonna<00:04:15.630> probably<00:04:15.810> make<00:04:15.990> the

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
that we're gonna probably make the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.180 
that we're gonna probably make the
switch<00:04:16.320> of<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.500> I<00:04:16.560> am

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
switch of the I am

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.949 
switch of the I am
she<00:04:17.790> was<00:04:17.880> pretty<00:04:17.970> confident<00:04:18.480> that<00:04:18.630> even<00:04:18.780> at

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
she was pretty confident that even at

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.199 
she was pretty confident that even at
the<00:04:19.020> end<00:04:19.080> of<00:04:19.200> last<00:04:19.350> year<00:04:19.709> so<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:20.910> know<00:04:21.000> we

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
very confident in that switch going to

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.500 
very confident in that switch going to
the<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.050> am<00:04:28.370> and<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.850> know<00:04:29.970> obviously<00:04:30.150> her

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
the I am and you know obviously her

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.940 
the I am and you know obviously her
hundred<00:04:30.720> fly<00:04:30.900> she<00:04:31.170> was<00:04:31.260> very<00:04:31.440> confident<00:04:31.830> from

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
hundred fly she was very confident from

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.980 
hundred fly she was very confident from
last<00:04:32.220> year<00:04:32.460> -<00:04:32.640> I<00:04:33.000> knew<00:04:33.330> breaststroke<00:04:33.810> was

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
last year - I knew breaststroke was

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.570 
last year - I knew breaststroke was
going<00:04:34.140> to<00:04:34.200> kill<00:04:34.410> me<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.740> needed<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.460> go<00:04:35.550> out

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
going to kill me I needed to go out

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.990 
going to kill me I needed to go out
faster<00:04:36.420> back<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.110> fly<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:38.640> that's<00:04:38.790> very<00:04:38.880> good

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
faster back and fly so that's very good

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.030 
faster back and fly so that's very good
and<00:04:39.540> then<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:39.900> new<00:04:40.140> brushstroke<00:04:40.560> Julia<00:04:40.920> was

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
and then a new brushstroke Julia was

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.410 
and then a new brushstroke Julia was
gonna<00:04:41.130> catch<00:04:41.340> up<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:41.700> I<00:04:41.760> knew<00:04:41.880> Morgan<00:04:42.120> had<00:04:42.390> a

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
gonna catch up and I knew Morgan had a

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.320 
gonna catch up and I knew Morgan had a
really<00:04:42.660> good<00:04:42.780> back<00:04:42.990> half<00:04:43.640> so<00:04:44.640> I<00:04:44.700> had<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:45.000> just

really good back half so I had to just

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.470 
really good back half so I had to just
stay<00:04:45.570> on<00:04:45.600> them<00:04:45.930> for<00:04:46.290> that<00:04:46.440> one<00:04:47.240> and<00:04:48.240> then<00:04:48.360> the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
stay on them for that one and then the

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.380 
stay on them for that one and then the
50<00:04:48.810> is<00:04:49.260> just<00:04:49.590> bringing<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.490> home<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:51.000> that's

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
to take a heck of a lot of work but I

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.400 
to take a heck of a lot of work but I
knew<00:04:58.740> that<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.980> was<00:04:59.100> possible<00:04:59.580> and<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:01.170> last

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
knew that it was possible and the last

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.350 
knew that it was possible and the last
year<00:05:01.770> kind<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.280> getting<00:05:02.490> beat<00:05:02.760> and<00:05:02.940> not<00:05:03.120> doing

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
year kind of getting beat and not doing

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.990 
year kind of getting beat and not doing
so<00:05:03.510> so<00:05:03.960> hot<00:05:04.170> in<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.830> backstroke<00:05:05.310> really<00:05:05.730> kind

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
so so hot in the backstroke really kind

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.480 
so so hot in the backstroke really kind
of<00:05:06.060> fuels<00:05:06.330> my<00:05:06.480> fire<00:05:06.510> I<00:05:06.750> guess<00:05:07.170> I<00:05:07.440> get<00:05:08.310> motivated

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
of fuels my fire I guess I get motivated

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.290 
of fuels my fire I guess I get motivated
from<00:05:09.060> her<00:05:09.210> energy<00:05:09.690> and

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
from her energy and

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.790 
from her energy and
I<00:05:10.330> think<00:05:10.509> we<00:05:10.599> kind<00:05:10.720> of<00:05:10.870> push<00:05:11.020> each<00:05:11.199> other<00:05:11.409> and

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
I think we kind of push each other and

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.550 
I think we kind of push each other and
since<00:05:12.789> we're<00:05:12.970> both<00:05:13.150> from<00:05:13.870> Naperville<00:05:14.139> teams

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
since we're both from Naperville teams

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.830 
since we're both from Naperville teams
it's<00:05:14.830> really<00:05:15.099> nice<00:05:15.340> to<00:05:15.370> kind<00:05:16.360> of<00:05:16.419> have<00:05:16.479> that

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
it's really nice to kind of have that

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.629 
it's really nice to kind of have that
privilege<00:05:17.229> of<00:05:17.710> racing<00:05:17.919> them<00:05:18.220> against<00:05:18.460> each

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
privilege of racing them against each

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.700 
privilege of racing them against each
other<00:05:18.789> a<00:05:18.940> lot<00:05:19.180> I<00:05:19.419> went<00:05:19.659> into<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:20.020> season<00:05:20.259> not
