00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.260
 Hello force is still fire in the axial 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.479
 The se side is called axis 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:18.570
 From now on in the series for your watercolor fan 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.439
 It is a point that is likely to fall into the wrong point 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.909
 While pointing out 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.909
 Yeah 3 to 5 minutes is a short time 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.560
 As quickly as possible 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.840
 Briefly 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.609
 Do 25 episodes 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.250
 I think that I want to do it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.000
 Yeah 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.990
 It is a difficult attitude many times and if you do not try it from now on 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.700
 Though 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.980
 Just as you think 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.060
 Continue about the three governors ぇ Tell everyone 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.740
 I think I want to do 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.850
 Then as the first 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 I would like to talk about the watercolor procedure 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.530
 As you say, when you write in watercolors, you are a soldier 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.740
 There are many people who bring a circle to 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.470
 it might be 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.580
 But I do not think I'm different 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.770
 Watercolor is 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.780
 on ecd color 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.690
 Or it is dark and bright is not good enough 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.509
 Because 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.100
 I think that bright color color is correct 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.990
 Then there is a bruise on the color that suits the gender 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.930
 Because I do not come out 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.710
 The staff of white paper and bright color people are the most beautiful 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.420
 Is not 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.100
 I think so 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.290
 It is supposed to be the first thing to see 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.250
 What kind of color is it? 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.300
 It does not mean returning home from seo 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.480
 But it is bright. 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.510
 Then bright color should be put at first 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.619
 As you say 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.110
 I have a shadow 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.350
 Red rose in case of the guard 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.420
 Flower is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.740
 Yes I could not say the point 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.600
 I want to put out a bright red 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.670
 I think 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.660
 However 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.980
 With the bright red as the escape, the first news is also high 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.200
 As you grow darker in the body, it's quite common in the Asai family 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.840
 Not 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.689
 So on the paper 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.619
 After the first ride 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.700
 You should keep strong deterioration 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.249
 think 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:18.289
 Though it is the paper of that high-class hair like the one in eight 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.839
 Because it tends to sink with flies and mosquitoes or plans 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:23.249
 Than 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:27.289
 I think it will be necessary to be strong and Kao 120 million 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.689
 And then 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.879
 Are you going to have a dark color 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.039
 I will finish it from Oiso 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.679
 I will explain later at another opportunity, but negative 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:42.679
 It will be done with negative painting 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:44.670
 While using light 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.429
 Let's get close from around 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.429
 And something like listening to you while talking 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.319
 I think that it is necessary 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.870
 Yes, because there is something that summarizes the process in an easy-to-understand manner 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.870
 Please see that 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.889
 I lose money with a pencil 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.539
 But this is that much demotion 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:06.869
 Not each 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:08.869
 Roughly 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.290
 While considering the balance of the direction and size of the flower 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.139
 Please add 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.319
 Yeah 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.869
 For wine glasses 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:19.079
 Resources 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.279
 So as not to be wrong 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.309
 I think the bottom is the point 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.539
 next 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.699
 Where was the mainstay 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.659
 Where was it daily or glass 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.680
 Where the flower petals really want to be left here 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:37.069
 masking 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.069
 I will put a link 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.520
 next 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.960
 It will be held at once in a red rose 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.839
 In this case using that used in Esca 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:50.649
 is 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:52.890
 That wind is also wintering ground 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.400
 Ochi regular skill or something I still put in 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.030
 But 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.609
 Anyway here 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.609
 I think this strong red is the point 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.839
 Yen where it is dry 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.839
 Do you want to expand the venue for the leading role 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.999
 It is a whiteish flower 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.799
 Writing from the neck 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.989
 2 is gradually putting color 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.669
 I will practice 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.680
 It is finished by this time and strong light from the left is made in the year 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.620
 That 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.970
 I think that Meiji University is the basic of light right and dark 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.970
 I think you should do not 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.349
 And at the end we make the back stronger 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.449
 It is said to be in front of the station 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.580
 Think of wine 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.259
 Wine glasses 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.340
 It is hard to put it or something 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.069
 At the very end 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.819
 In the case of me, the last shot is put 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.029
 Happa cry 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.450
 It's better to be younger 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.599
 It is said that it will come up clearly 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.599
 I will aim for things 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.990
 What did you think 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.659
 From the very beginning 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.110
 It is an air result 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.539
 Koiiro 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.509
 It is quite easy to come out at once 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.919
 Yes, because I have courage 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.240
 Yeah 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.240
 Please try it because it is overused 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.589
 Continue to secure se 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:28.749
 If you are doing just that 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:31.749
 Because I think that I can not do it without hesitation 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.469
 Have courage if you can 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.599
 Please put it first
