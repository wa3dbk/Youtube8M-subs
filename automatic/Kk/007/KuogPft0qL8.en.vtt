also<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.860> other<00:02:32.010> major<00:02:32.370> advantages<00:02:33.030> with<00:02:33.390> the

also the other major advantages with the

alongside<00:02:35.579> that<00:02:36.209> rapid<00:02:36.659> fire<00:02:37.040> there's<00:02:38.040> two

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
alongside that rapid fire there's two

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.349 
alongside that rapid fire there's two
other<00:02:38.430> things<00:02:40.069> which<00:02:41.069> are<00:02:41.280> quite<00:02:41.700> important

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
other things which are quite important

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.809 
other things which are quite important
to<00:02:42.450> note<00:02:42.599> one<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.769> has<00:02:43.950> very<00:02:44.250> low<00:02:44.459> scatter

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
to note one is it has very low scatter

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.039 
to note one is it has very low scatter
meaning<00:02:45.239> it's<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.450> only<00:02:45.629> very<00:02:45.870> light

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
meaning it's the only very light

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
infantry its firing at which makes quite

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.369 
infantry its firing at which makes quite
a<00:02:51.060> difference<00:02:51.090> them<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:51.810> beat<00:02:52.019> up<00:02:52.049> here

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
a difference them and just beat up here

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.009 
a difference them and just beat up here
for<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> person<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.159> get<00:02:53.340> moving<00:02:53.519> again<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.810> the

scatter<00:02:58.079> we<00:02:58.349> get<00:02:58.530> one<00:02:58.709> thirty<00:02:59.010> Alexa<00:02:59.549> charm

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
scatter we get one thirty Alexa charm

Blitzkrieg ability which again allows

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
you to be a lot more maneuver but still

kinda fought alongside that turret plus

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.580 
kinda fought alongside that turret plus
it's<00:04:52.490> cheaper<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.500> doesn't<00:04:54.500> require

it's cheaper and doesn't require

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.550 
it's cheaper and doesn't require
building<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:55.310> call<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:56.140> so<00:04:57.140> again<00:04:57.350> I<00:04:57.380> mean

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
building to call in so again I mean

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.580 
building to call in so again I mean

again<00:05:04.510> not<00:05:05.080> something<00:05:05.560> you<00:05:05.650> see<00:05:05.830> a<00:05:05.860> lot

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
again not something you see a lot

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.070 
again not something you see a lot
because<00:05:06.430> again<00:05:06.670> it<00:05:06.820> has<00:05:07.000> very<00:05:07.330> limited<00:05:07.600> effect

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080
