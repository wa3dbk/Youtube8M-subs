00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.880 
adult so let's get back in the line
let's<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.780> program<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.619> need<00:01:58.770> to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
let's get with the program they need to

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.749 
let's get with the program they need to
know<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.159> they're<00:01:59.280> not<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.700> able

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
know that they're not going to be able

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
know that they're not going to be able
to<00:01:59.969> push<00:02:00.329> through<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.899> point<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.710> they're

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
to push through that point that they're

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.219 
to push through that point that they're
testing<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.479> they<00:02:03.570> can<00:02:03.750> take<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
testing so that they can take it to the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.569 
testing so that they can take it to the
next<00:02:04.380> level<00:02:04.740> because<00:02:04.890> that's<00:02:05.189> what<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> lot<00:02:05.430> of

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
next level because that's what a lot of

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.190 
next level because that's what a lot of
them<00:02:05.759> will<00:02:05.939> do<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.630> don't<00:02:06.750> want<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
them will do you don't want to be like a

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.749 
them will do you don't want to be like a
drill<00:02:07.560> sergeant<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.310> important<00:02:08.729> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
drill sergeant but it's important that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.200 
drill sergeant but it's important that
they<00:02:08.879> understand<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.780> when<00:02:09.959> they're

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
they understand that when they're

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.360 
they understand that when they're
dealing<00:02:10.570> with<00:02:10.600> you<00:02:10.900> they're<00:02:11.650> dealing<00:02:12.100> with<00:02:12.130> an

all they have to do is think about and
focus<00:02:55.270> on<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.600> material<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.050> you're<00:02:56.350> going

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
focus on the material that you're going

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.530 
focus on the material that you're going
to<00:02:56.710> review<00:02:57.100> at<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.730> same<00:02:57.940> time<00:02:58.210> though<00:02:58.390> you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
to review at the same time though you

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.850 
to review at the same time though you
need<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.690> be<00:02:58.780> able<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.110> go<00:02:59.200> from<00:02:59.350> loud<00:02:59.650> and

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
need to be able to go from loud and

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.340 
need to be able to go from loud and
noisy<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.490> order<00:03:00.940> in<00:03:01.180> an<00:03:01.450> instant<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.020> then<00:03:02.200> be

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
noisy to order in an instant and then be

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.030 
able to tie up all the loose ends the
way<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.480> do<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:04.990> to<00:03:05.110> have<00:03:05.140> techniques<00:03:05.740> in

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
way to do this is to have techniques in

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.300 
way to do this is to have techniques in
place<00:03:06.520> day<00:03:07.480> one<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.110> I<00:03:08.800> personally<00:03:09.190> have

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
place day one and I personally have

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.310 
place day one and I personally have
found<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:09.790> something<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.480> involves<00:03:11.110> a

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
found that something that involves a

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.530 
found that something that involves a
physical<00:03:11.950> action<00:03:12.370> on<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.120> part<00:03:13.360> of<00:03:13.450> the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.290 
students whether it's vocally or
physically<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.830> best<00:03:18.070> thing<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.520> them<00:03:19.180> out

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
physically is the best thing to them out

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.700 
physically is the best thing to them out
of<00:03:19.420> their<00:03:19.510> moment<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.020> get<00:03:20.140> them<00:03:20.290> focused

back on you and back into order and
there's<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:23.560> many<00:03:23.710> different<00:03:24.160> ways<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.310> do

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
there's so many different ways to do

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.450 
there's so many different ways to do
this<00:03:24.820> but<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:26.260> could<00:03:26.440> involve<00:03:26.710> clapping<00:03:27.340> their
