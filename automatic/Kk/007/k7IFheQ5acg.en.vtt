okay<00:00:23.640> there's<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> high<00:00:24.060> possibility<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.779> being

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
okay there's a high possibility of being

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.210 
okay there's a high possibility of being
rushed<00:00:25.109> plus<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.500> map<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.710> kind<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.070> wonky

no<00:00:44.190> mistake<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> should<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.879> gone<00:00:44.969> for

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
no mistake here I should have gone for

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.729 
no mistake here I should have gone for
like<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.420> 10<00:00:45.750> pool<00:00:45.989> knowing<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.559> there's

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
like a 10 pool knowing that there's

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
like a 10 pool knowing that there's
probably<00:00:47.070> gonna<00:00:47.219> be<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.430> whole<00:00:47.969> lot<00:00:48.000> of

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
probably gonna be a whole lot of

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
probably gonna be a whole lot of
pressure<00:00:49.190> going<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.489> um<00:00:51.350> because<00:00:52.699> yeah<00:00:53.699> I'm

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
pressure going on um because yeah I'm

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060 
pressure going on um because yeah I'm
probably<00:00:54.329> I'm<00:00:54.840> pretty<00:00:54.899> exposed<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.770> think

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
probably I'm pretty exposed but I think

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.990 
probably I'm pretty exposed but I think
I<00:00:56.190> wait<00:00:56.399> yeah<00:00:57.059> i'm<00:00:57.149> at<00:00:57.270> 14<00:00:57.719> supply<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:59.000> 14

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
I wait yeah i'm at 14 supply here 14

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.090 
I wait yeah i'm at 14 supply here 14
pool<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.440> quite<00:01:01.920> late

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
pool that is really really quite late

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.979 
pool that is really really quite late
for<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.399> map<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.449> mean<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.780> were<00:01:03.809> all

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
for this map I think I mean we were all

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.509 
for this map I think I mean we were all
in<00:01:04.110> voice<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.559> think<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.890> may<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.040> ended<00:01:05.369> up

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
in voice I think I may have ended up

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030 
in voice I think I may have ended up
being<00:01:05.700> distracted<00:01:06.320> because<00:01:07.320> my<00:01:07.650> hope<00:01:07.830> was<00:01:07.979> to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
being distracted because my hope was to

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.520 
being distracted because my hope was to
get<00:01:08.310> some<00:01:08.460> zerglings<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:09.060> much<00:01:10.049> much<00:01:10.320> sooner

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
get some zerglings out much much sooner

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.230 
get some zerglings out much much sooner

well<00:01:43.380> right<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.770> am<00:01:44.159> building<00:01:44.490> some

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
well right now I am building some

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.719 
well right now I am building some
zerglings<00:01:46.170> try<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.619> them<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:46.860> luckily<00:01:47.549> my

marine help and good fought those guys
off<00:01:53.729> moving<00:01:54.240> my<00:01:54.829> spine<00:01:55.829> crawler<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> front

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
off moving my spine crawler to the front

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
off moving my spine crawler to the front
and<00:01:56.790> gonna<00:01:56.969> try<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.240> block<00:01:57.479> out<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:57.869> building

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and gonna try to block out here building

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.410 
and gonna try to block out here building
of<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> spine<00:01:58.619> crawler<00:01:59.149> hoping<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.270> this

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
of a spine crawler hoping that this

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.060 
of a spine crawler hoping that this
might<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.750> enough<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.020> defend<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:01.829> there's<00:02:01.979> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
might be enough to defend but there's a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.630 
might be enough to defend but there's a
huge<00:02:02.490> swarm<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.180> zerglings<00:02:03.450> coming<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:03.930> now

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
huge swarm of zerglings coming in now

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.309 
huge swarm of zerglings coming in now
so<00:02:05.640> let<00:02:05.969> me<00:02:05.999> pause<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.780> moment<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
so let me pause just a moment here and

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.249 
so let me pause just a moment here and
take<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.499> look<00:02:07.649> at<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> income<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.539> have<00:02:09.539> 16

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
take a look at the income I have 16

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.900 
take a look at the income I have 16
harvesters<00:02:10.920> actually<00:02:11.400> look<00:02:11.550> at<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.700> amount

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
harvesters actually look at the amount

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.610 
harvesters actually look at the amount
of<00:02:12.030> harvesters<00:02:12.420> they<00:02:12.989> wow<00:02:13.379> they<00:02:13.590> really

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
of harvesters they wow they really

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.930 
of harvesters they wow they really
rushed<00:02:14.190> us<00:02:15.019> six<00:02:16.019> harvesters<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:17.340> purple<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
rushed us six harvesters for purple and

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.660 
rushed us six harvesters for purple and
orange<00:02:18.239> only<00:02:19.080> yellow<00:02:19.379> has<00:02:19.560> more<00:02:20.069> harvesters

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
orange only yellow has more harvesters

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.660 
orange only yellow has more harvesters
so<00:02:20.849> both<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.150> these<00:02:21.330> guys<00:02:21.569> went<00:02:21.870> for<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.080> pure

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
so both of these guys went for a pure

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.000 
so both of these guys went for a pure
well<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> guess<00:02:23.879> a<00:02:23.910> seven<00:02:24.540> pool<00:02:24.860> since<00:02:25.860> then

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
well I guess a seven pool since then

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.589 
well I guess a seven pool since then
they<00:02:26.310> have<00:02:26.340> six<00:02:26.670> harvesters<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.120> one<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.510> them

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
they have six harvesters and one of them

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.660 
they have six harvesters and one of them
got<00:02:27.780> used<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.230> spawning<00:02:28.440> pool<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.489> both

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
got used for the spawning pool so both

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.460 
got used for the spawning pool so both
of<00:02:29.700> them<00:02:29.910> went<00:02:30.060> for<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.390> whole<00:02:30.930> hell<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.440> lot

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
of them went for a whole hell of a lot

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.220 
of them went for a whole hell of a lot
of<00:02:31.620> opening<00:02:32.069> pressure<00:02:32.629> which<00:02:33.629> i<00:02:33.780> guess<00:02:33.959> is<00:02:33.989> why

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
of opening pressure which i guess is why

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.050 
of opening pressure which i guess is why
it<00:02:34.319> was<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.590> hard<00:02:34.739> but<00:02:35.069> when<00:02:35.549> we<00:02:35.670> fought<00:02:35.910> off

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
it was so hard but when we fought off

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.330 
it was so hard but when we fought off
the<00:02:36.090> first<00:02:36.420> attack<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.379> again<00:02:37.829> it's<00:02:38.160> pretty

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
the first attack and again it's pretty

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.699 
the first attack and again it's pretty
scary<00:02:38.610> here<00:02:38.819> lost<00:02:39.120> some<00:02:39.840> more<00:02:40.049> some<00:02:40.680> more

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
scary here lost some more some more

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.250 
scary here lost some more some more
units<00:02:41.099> but<00:02:41.220> kept<00:02:41.430> my<00:02:41.549> spawning<00:02:41.849> pool<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.329> in

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
units but kept my spawning pool and in

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.690 
units but kept my spawning pool and in
fact<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.620> enough<00:02:43.829> to<00:02:43.980> start<00:02:44.040> tacking<00:02:44.549> up<00:02:44.579> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
fact have enough to start tacking up the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.369 
fact have enough to start tacking up the
hatchery<00:02:45.060> at<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.390> point<00:02:45.660> feeling<00:02:46.260> pretty

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
hatchery at this point feeling pretty

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.930 
hatchery at this point feeling pretty
confident<00:02:46.860> about<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.160> game<00:02:47.310> because<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
confident about the game because the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.640 
confident about the game because the
early<00:02:48.180> pressure<00:02:48.360> got<00:02:48.629> pushed<00:02:48.840> off<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.230> i'm

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
early pressure got pushed off and i'm

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.990 
early pressure got pushed off and i'm
not<00:02:49.890> sure<00:02:49.950> what<00:02:50.280> they<00:02:50.400> could<00:02:50.549> do<00:02:50.790> about<00:02:50.879> it

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
not sure what they could do about it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.520 
not sure what they could do about it
I've<00:02:51.239> got<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.510> good<00:02:51.660> amount<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.959> spine<00:02:52.140> crawlers

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
I've got a good amount of spine crawlers

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.640 
I've got a good amount of spine crawlers
here<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.010> i<00:02:54.000> am<00:02:55.549> trying<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.730> rebuild<00:02:57.030> my<00:02:57.650> yeah

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
here and i am trying to rebuild my yeah

here and i am trying to rebuild my yeah
building<00:02:58.980> some<00:02:59.340> drones<00:02:59.670> yeah<00:02:59.940> popping<00:03:00.329> that

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
building some drones yeah popping that

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.390 
building some drones yeah popping that
getting<00:03:00.989> another<00:03:01.140> hatchery<00:03:01.590> my<00:03:01.950> plan<00:03:02.220> for

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
getting another hatchery my plan for

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.500 
getting another hatchery my plan for
this<00:03:02.489> game<00:03:02.670> right<00:03:02.910> from<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.150> beginning<00:03:03.239> was

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
this game right from the beginning was

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.599 
this game right from the beginning was
to<00:03:03.540> mass<00:03:03.900> hydrants<00:03:04.440> because<00:03:04.709> hydras<00:03:05.310> are<00:03:05.459> good

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
to mass hydrants because hydras are good

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.520 
to mass hydrants because hydras are good
against<00:03:05.819> pretty<00:03:06.060> much<00:03:06.209> anything<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.959> Zerg

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
against pretty much anything the Zerg

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.410 
against pretty much anything the Zerg
can<00:03:07.799> put<00:03:07.950> up<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.549> know<00:03:08.639> if<00:03:08.730> there's<00:03:08.910> Protoss

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
can put up you know if there's Protoss

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.750 
can put up you know if there's Protoss
then<00:03:09.660> you've<00:03:09.780> got<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.019> worry<00:03:10.139> about<00:03:10.760> Colossus

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
then you've got to worry about Colossus

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.039 
then you've got to worry about Colossus
if<00:03:11.880> there's<00:03:12.060> turns<00:03:12.359> you've<00:03:12.630> got<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.900> worry

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
if there's turns you've got to worry

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.379 
if there's turns you've got to worry
about<00:03:13.430> siege<00:03:14.430> tanks<00:03:14.790> but<00:03:14.910> when<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.150> surg

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
about siege tanks but when it's surg

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.629 
about siege tanks but when it's surg
really<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.170> can<00:03:16.440> just<00:03:16.709> go<00:03:16.829> straight<00:03:17.130> up<00:03:17.250> Hydra

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
really you can just go straight up Hydra

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.210 
really you can just go straight up Hydra
and<00:03:17.849> it's<00:03:18.510> quite<00:03:18.959> strong<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.440> mean<00:03:19.650> math

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
and it's quite strong I mean math

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.589 
and it's quite strong I mean math
circlings<00:03:20.819> are<00:03:20.940> pretty<00:03:21.180> good<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.419> be<00:03:21.510> on

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
circlings are pretty good to be on

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.670 
circlings are pretty good to be on
hydros<00:03:22.019> but<00:03:22.169> I<00:03:22.200> figure<00:03:22.410> about<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
hydros but I figure about the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.409 
hydros but I figure about the
composition<00:03:23.220> we're<00:03:23.519> going<00:03:23.639> to<00:03:23.730> have<00:03:23.849> we'd

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
composition we're going to have we'd

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.140 
composition we're going to have we'd
probably<00:03:24.840> be<00:03:25.200> okay<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:26.430> I'm<00:03:26.579> taking<00:03:26.760> up<00:03:27.000> to

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
probably be okay so I'm taking up to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.650 
probably be okay so I'm taking up to
that<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:29.930> what<00:03:30.930> else<00:03:31.639> so<00:03:32.639> look<00:03:33.060> at<00:03:33.180> my<00:03:33.299> allies

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
that and what else so look at my allies

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.229 
that and what else so look at my allies
we've<00:03:33.840> got<00:03:34.340> Jays<00:03:35.340> awesome<00:03:35.639> Terran<00:03:35.970> here<00:03:36.120> was

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
we've got Jays awesome Terran here was

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.720 
we've got Jays awesome Terran here was
planning<00:03:36.569> going<00:03:36.720> mmm<00:03:37.500> which<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.099> medic<00:03:38.459> marine

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
planning going mmm which is medic marine

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.909 
planning going mmm which is medic marine
and<00:03:38.970> medevac<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.690> i'm<00:03:40.349> not<00:03:40.440> sure<00:03:40.680> what<00:03:40.769> my

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
and medevac and i'm not sure what my

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.610 
and medevac and i'm not sure what my
Protoss<00:03:41.459> buddy<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.970> going<00:03:42.389> out<00:03:43.139> he's<00:03:43.319> got<00:03:43.470> some

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
Protoss buddy is going out he's got some

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.710 
Protoss buddy is going out he's got some
stargates<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.340> think<00:03:44.849> he<00:03:44.940> ends<00:03:45.120> up<00:03:45.180> going<00:03:45.329> void

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
stargates I think he ends up going void

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.690 
stargates I think he ends up going void
rays<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.700> I've<00:03:48.000> recovered<00:03:48.419> pretty<00:03:49.049> well<00:03:49.700> now

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
rays so I've recovered pretty well now

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.339 
rays so I've recovered pretty well now
the<00:03:50.790> other<00:03:51.000> user<00:03:51.419> have<00:03:51.720> started<00:03:52.049> building<00:03:52.290> up

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
the other user have started building up

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.559 
the other user have started building up
their<00:03:52.560> drones<00:03:52.859> a<00:03:53.099> little<00:03:53.459> bit<00:03:53.579> here<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.940> should

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
their drones a little bit here I should

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.789 
their drones a little bit here I should
be<00:03:54.660> saturating<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.079> little<00:03:55.230> bit<00:03:55.319> more<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.500> look

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
be saturating a little bit more and look

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:56.900 
be saturating a little bit more and look
at<00:03:55.950> this<00:03:56.069> time<00:03:56.280> here's<00:03:56.579> what's<00:03:56.760> gonna<00:03:56.819> happen

these erk have just moved in over here

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.780 
these erk have just moved in over here
and<00:03:59.540> I<00:04:00.540> actually<00:04:01.410> could<00:04:01.889> have<00:04:02.010> seen<00:04:02.340> them<00:04:02.549> if<00:04:02.700> I

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
and I actually could have seen them if I

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.970 
and I actually could have seen them if I
was<00:04:02.819> paying<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.180> little<00:04:03.299> more<00:04:03.419> attention<00:04:03.799> but<00:04:04.799> I

move my spine crawlers I literally move

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:12.670 
move my spine crawlers I literally move
them<00:04:12.060> just<00:04:12.299> as

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
them just as

take 10 seconds to dig up again so what
a<00:04:15.170> terrible<00:04:15.590> freaking<00:04:15.980> error<00:04:16.160> again<00:04:16.820> I'm

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
a terrible freaking error again I'm

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.590 
a terrible freaking error again I'm
worried<00:04:17.150> i<00:04:17.209> lose<00:04:17.389> my<00:04:17.570> queen<00:04:17.840> again<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:19.389> lose<00:04:20.389> I

think<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:20.930> couple<00:04:20.959> of<00:04:21.259> drones<00:04:21.500> maybe<00:04:21.769> I<00:04:21.919> lose

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220

all my attacking units I lose my
spawning<00:04:24.740> pool<00:04:24.889> which<00:04:25.039> is<00:04:25.160> pretty

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
spawning pool which is pretty

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.749 
spawning pool which is pretty
devastating<00:04:25.910> my<00:04:26.389> allies<00:04:26.690> now<00:04:26.960> have<00:04:27.199> arrived

my spine crawlers have finally started

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.560 
my spine crawlers have finally started
to<00:04:30.229> get<00:04:30.590> back<00:04:30.800> in<00:04:30.979> here<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:34.120> gonna<00:04:35.120> be<00:04:35.240> okay<00:04:35.539> I

did lose my spawning pool but I'm gonna

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.560 
did lose my spawning pool but I'm gonna
rebuild<00:04:37.789> it<00:04:37.970> here<00:04:38.180> I<00:04:38.330> still<00:04:38.780> my<00:04:38.930> hydrogen<00:04:39.380> and

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
rebuild it here I still my hydrogen and

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.120 
rebuild it here I still my hydrogen and
again<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.780> know<00:04:41.870> Mike<00:04:42.080> well<00:04:42.500> purple<00:04:42.949> still

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
again you know Mike well purple still

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.510 
again you know Mike well purple still
have<00:04:43.250> snow<00:04:43.430> economy<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:45.169> other<00:04:45.440> guys<00:04:45.800> are

doing<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.150> little<00:04:47.300> bit<00:04:47.449> better<00:04:47.740> but<00:04:48.740> still

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
doing a little bit better but still

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.230 
doing a little bit better but still
putting<00:04:49.190> a<00:04:49.220> lot<00:04:49.340> of<00:04:49.370> pressure<00:04:49.610> so<00:04:49.880> this<00:04:50.060> guy's

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
putting a lot of pressure so this guy's

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.360 
putting a lot of pressure so this guy's
going<00:04:50.539> for<00:04:50.810> roaches<00:04:51.050> this<00:04:51.680> guy's<00:04:51.860> got<00:04:52.039> a<00:04:52.070> nidus

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
going for roaches this guy's got a nidus

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.260 
going for roaches this guy's got a nidus
network<00:04:52.880> I'm<00:04:53.060> not<00:04:53.210> sure<00:04:54.099> say<00:04:55.099> I<00:04:55.250> I<00:04:55.310> right<00:04:56.000> here

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
network I'm not sure say I I right here

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.600 
network I'm not sure say I I right here
I<00:04:56.300> build<00:04:56.780> some<00:04:57.169> hydros<00:04:57.560> and<00:04:57.770> I<00:04:57.860> take<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.430> look

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
I build some hydros and I take a look

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.360 
I build some hydros and I take a look
around<00:04:58.729> for<00:04:59.599> overlords<00:05:00.470> just<00:05:00.860> on<00:05:01.009> the<00:05:01.070> idea

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
around for overlords just on the idea

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.070 
around for overlords just on the idea
that<00:05:01.460> they<00:05:01.669> might<00:05:01.880> be<00:05:02.120> trying<00:05:02.330> they<00:05:02.720> might<00:05:02.900> try

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
that they might be trying they might try

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.870 
that they might be trying they might try
2nite<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.440> swarm<00:05:03.740> us<00:05:03.919> so<00:05:04.430> I<00:05:04.460> think<00:05:04.550> it's<00:05:04.759> a

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
2nite a swarm us so I think it's a

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.540 
2nite a swarm us so I think it's a
really<00:05:05.030> good<00:05:05.120> thing<00:05:05.240> I<00:05:05.449> put<00:05:05.630> that<00:05:05.810> up<00:05:06.550> because

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
really good thing I put that up because

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.740 
really good thing I put that up because
otherwise<00:05:07.970> I<00:05:08.090> think<00:05:08.360> I<00:05:08.419> would<00:05:08.539> have<00:05:08.599> gotten

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
otherwise I think I would have gotten

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.540 
otherwise I think I would have gotten
the<00:05:08.840> nydus<00:05:09.080> worm<00:05:09.229> right<00:05:09.620> here<00:05:09.949> that<00:05:10.400> would

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
the nydus worm right here that would

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.980 
the nydus worm right here that would
have<00:05:10.639> been<00:05:10.699> pretty<00:05:11.030> hard<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.419> defend<00:05:11.599> against

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
have been pretty hard to defend against

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.379 
have been pretty hard to defend against
you<00:05:12.410> had<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:12.560> pretty<00:05:12.770> big<00:05:12.949> trip<00:05:13.240> yellow<00:05:14.240> is

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
you had a pretty big trip yellow is

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.300 
you had a pretty big trip yellow is
mostly<00:05:15.050> just<00:05:15.229> putting<00:05:15.470> up<00:05:15.530> defenses<00:05:15.650> he's<00:05:16.130> got

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
mostly just putting up defenses he's got

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.310 
mostly just putting up defenses he's got
lots<00:05:16.580> of<00:05:16.760> anti<00:05:17.090> air<00:05:17.240> set<00:05:17.479> up<00:05:17.599> and<00:05:18.080> has<00:05:18.169> got<00:05:18.289> a

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
lots of anti air set up and has got a

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.870 
lots of anti air set up and has got a
good<00:05:18.500> number<00:05:18.650> of<00:05:18.800> spine<00:05:19.070> crawlers<00:05:19.490> defending

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
good number of spine crawlers defending

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.750 
good number of spine crawlers defending
its<00:05:20.000> gate<00:05:20.180> as<00:05:20.360> ramp<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.500> a<00:05:21.949> lot<00:05:22.340> of<00:05:22.370> zerglings

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
its gate as ramp and a lot of zerglings

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.399 
its gate as ramp and a lot of zerglings
as<00:05:23.030> well<00:05:23.180> at<00:05:23.690> this<00:05:23.780> point<00:05:23.870> we've<00:05:24.139> decided

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
as well at this point we've decided

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:25.990 
as well at this point we've decided
we're<00:05:24.560> going<00:05:24.650> to<00:05:24.740> start<00:05:24.979> making<00:05:25.070> move<00:05:25.639> more<00:05:25.909> on

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
we're going to start making move more on

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.779 
we're going to start making move more on
the<00:05:26.120> offensive<00:05:27.130> two<00:05:28.130> of<00:05:28.220> us<00:05:28.280> have<00:05:28.340> fairly

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
the offensive two of us have fairly

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.350 
the offensive two of us have fairly
saturated<00:05:29.419> drone<00:05:29.659> lines<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:31.220> our<00:05:31.940> opponents

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
saturated drone lines the our opponents

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.300 
saturated drone lines the our opponents
are<00:05:32.449> still<00:05:32.659> a<00:05:32.690> little<00:05:32.900> bit<00:05:33.080> low<00:05:33.260> and<00:05:33.530> in<00:05:34.039> terms

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
are still a little bit low and in terms

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.700 
are still a little bit low and in terms
of<00:05:34.490> pure<00:05:34.820> units<00:05:35.780> while<00:05:35.990> it's<00:05:36.229> hard<00:05:36.440> to<00:05:36.530> see<00:05:36.680> I

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
of pure units while it's hard to see I

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.560 
of pure units while it's hard to see I
guess<00:05:37.030> so<00:05:38.560> take<00:05:39.560> a<00:05:39.590> look<00:05:39.740> at<00:05:39.860> APM<00:05:40.220> you<00:05:41.210> can<00:05:41.360> see

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
guess so take a look at APM you can see

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.930 
guess so take a look at APM you can see
that<00:05:41.599> red<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:42.590> blue<00:05:42.889> that's<00:05:43.159> me<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:43.699> Jay<00:05:43.909> is

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
that red and blue that's me and Jay is

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.990 
that red and blue that's me and Jay is
awesome<00:05:44.389> have<00:05:44.599> quite<00:05:44.870> high<00:05:45.050> APM<00:05:45.880> compared<00:05:46.880> to

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
awesome have quite high APM compared to

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.100 
awesome have quite high APM compared to
some<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.240> others<00:05:47.419> not<00:05:47.570> that<00:05:47.780> necessarily

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
some of the others not that necessarily

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.779 
some of the others not that necessarily
means<00:05:48.229> much<00:05:48.710> but<00:05:48.979> we<00:05:49.070> got<00:05:49.220> a<00:05:49.250> little<00:05:49.490> bit<00:05:49.669> more

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
means much but we got a little bit more

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.839 
means much but we got a little bit more
fine<00:05:50.030> control<00:05:50.419> and<00:05:51.159> we<00:05:52.159> learn<00:05:52.550> very<00:05:52.789> quickly

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
fine control and we learn very quickly

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:54.909 
fine control and we learn very quickly
we<00:05:53.210> realized<00:05:53.360> we<00:05:53.659> can't<00:05:53.870> really<00:05:54.139> make<00:05:54.590> a<00:05:54.650> move

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
we realized we can't really make a move

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.320 
we realized we can't really make a move
on<00:05:55.130> yellow<00:05:55.400> here<00:05:55.639> he's<00:05:55.789> way<00:05:56.030> too<00:05:56.060> well

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
on yellow here he's way too well

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.570 
on yellow here he's way too well
defended<00:05:56.449> and<00:05:56.990> so<00:05:57.740> we<00:05:57.860> come<00:05:57.949> in<00:05:58.070> on<00:05:58.190> purple<00:05:58.460> and

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
defended and so we come in on purple and

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.219 
defended and so we come in on purple and
of<00:05:58.639> course<00:05:58.789> purple<00:05:59.240> has<00:05:59.389> had<00:06:00.080> the

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
of course purple has had the

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:01.990 
of course purple has had the
disadvantage<00:06:00.500> of<00:06:01.009> actually<00:06:01.699> he<00:06:01.820> may<00:06:01.940> have

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
disadvantage of actually he may have

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.659 
disadvantage of actually he may have
lost<00:06:02.180> a<00:06:02.300> bunch<00:06:02.449> units<00:06:02.750> in<00:06:02.840> that<00:06:02.870> nice<00:06:03.110> now<00:06:03.669> yeah

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
lost a bunch units in that nice now yeah

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.040 
lost a bunch units in that nice now yeah
and<00:06:04.940> then<00:06:05.060> he<00:06:05.090> freaks<00:06:05.479> out<00:06:05.630> because<00:06:05.690> he's<00:06:05.990> a

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
and then he freaks out because he's a

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.200 
and then he freaks out because he's a
day

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
day

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.440 
day
retard<00:06:08.210> that<00:06:08.810> is<00:06:09.050> going<00:06:09.200> to<00:06:09.290> get<00:06:09.380> reported<00:06:10.150> um

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.210 

yeah<00:06:14.450> so<00:06:15.080> I<00:06:15.350> don't<00:06:15.590> even<00:06:15.680> know<00:06:15.830> how<00:06:15.920> to<00:06:15.950> report

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
yeah so I don't even know how to report

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.390 
yeah so I don't even know how to report
people<00:06:16.370> may<00:06:16.610> have<00:06:16.640> to<00:06:16.820> figure<00:06:16.940> that<00:06:17.090> out<00:06:17.150> um

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
people may have to figure that out um

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.440 
people may have to figure that out um
yeah<00:06:19.400> so<00:06:19.430> we<00:06:19.700> take<00:06:19.850> him<00:06:19.970> out<00:06:20.030> no<00:06:20.300> problem

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
yeah so we take him out no problem

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.380 
yeah so we take him out no problem
because<00:06:20.870> I<00:06:21.110> am<00:06:21.710> again<00:06:21.860> him<00:06:22.130> and<00:06:22.310> orange<00:06:22.760> went

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
because I am again him and orange went

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.570 
because I am again him and orange went
very<00:06:23.720> very<00:06:23.870> early<00:06:24.290> rushes<00:06:24.830> their<00:06:25.040> economy

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
very very early rushes their economy

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.430 
very very early rushes their economy
their<00:06:25.760> build<00:06:25.970> suffered<00:06:26.450> orange<00:06:27.170> actually

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
their build suffered orange actually

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.870 
their build suffered orange actually
doesn't<00:06:27.710> have<00:06:27.800> any<00:06:28.040> units<00:06:28.370> at<00:06:28.490> all<00:06:28.610> it's<00:06:28.790> what

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
doesn't have any units at all it's what

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.510 
doesn't have any units at all it's what
it<00:06:28.970> looks<00:06:29.120> like<00:06:29.270> he's<00:06:29.930> got<00:06:30.110> 12<00:06:30.530> 0<00:06:30.920> 10<00:06:31.220> muta

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
it looks like he's got 12 0 10 muta

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.100 
it looks like he's got 12 0 10 muta
lists<00:06:31.760> he<00:06:32.090> built<00:06:32.270> some<00:06:32.390> util<00:06:32.660> assess<00:06:32.930> what's

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
lists he built some util assess what's

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.630 
lists he built some util assess what's
going<00:06:33.290> on<00:06:33.410> and<00:06:33.590> he's<00:06:34.070> using<00:06:34.280> that<00:06:34.460> to

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
going on and he's using that to

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.520 
going on and he's using that to
harassment<00:06:34.910> expansions<00:06:35.600> but<00:06:36.200> we're<00:06:36.410> like

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
harassment expansions but we're like

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.230 
harassment expansions but we're like
okay<00:06:36.890> that's<00:06:37.100> fine<00:06:37.400> then<00:06:37.730> we're<00:06:38.000> just<00:06:38.060> going

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
okay that's fine then we're just going

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.340 
okay that's fine then we're just going
to<00:06:38.300> go<00:06:38.420> and<00:06:38.510> kill<00:06:38.660> your<00:06:38.750> base<00:06:38.900> how<00:06:39.080> do<00:06:39.140> you<00:06:39.230> like

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
to go and kill your base how do you like

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.530 
to go and kill your base how do you like
them<00:06:39.470> apples<00:06:39.820> well<00:06:40.820> then<00:06:40.940> now<00:06:41.120> the<00:06:41.180> game<00:06:41.510> is

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
them apples well then now the game is

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.720 
them apples well then now the game is
definitely<00:06:41.960> in<00:06:42.470> our<00:06:42.890> hands<00:06:43.280> will<00:06:43.430> take<00:06:43.610> this
