00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.289
 more and more often we see on TV and 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.060
 hear around what is being attacked 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.130
 with a knife 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:25.439
 the knife is the most easily available weapon 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.240
 and easy to hide to protect against shock 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.240
 a knife about this we'll talk 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.950
 Consider a typical situation in general. 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.740
 for the street 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:49.010
 as a rule, it looks like this 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:55.040
 a man who is still 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:58.970
 wished you get it he usually gets 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:04.089
 hides him fits closer pulls on 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:07.700
 yourself and immediately sticks it in 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.650
 this method of killing let's say he 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.840
 practically guaranteed because 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.330
 here you can see nothing 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.220
 sees a person does not know our task 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.600
 our task with you is the following 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.520
 the first thing we are from what we are always 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.729
 start from what they danced first 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.860
 This distance does not allow anyone 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.350
 stranger or aggressive 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.290
 tuned to you even a friend on 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.470
 a distance closer than the outstretched hand here 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.520
 this is the intimate zone closer which 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.920
 only allowed people close all 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.200
 further svoj-someone else scanned include 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.450
 the brain will scan your stranger I'm not 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.810
 I know a person is aggressive that is immediately 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.200
 psyck signal beacon red light not ndnd 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.209
 should play here that is alarm 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.090
 anxiety anxiety anxiety and we should here 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.130
 somewhere on this moment hold 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.539
 man certainly fits you aggressively 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.399
 no need to think that nothing is wrong 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.870
 happen and that's all why so 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:14.360
 came up in what so grabbed the hand hidden 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.190
 need to learn to immediately suspect everyone and 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.430
 all around when that's it 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.849
 happens out of context common 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.190
 and so at this moment to us all the same 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.680
 quickly moving reached for you and 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.360
 starts to pull at you the first thing 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.890
 we must immediately lower the case and remove 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.610
 put your hand down again remove 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.920
 body and put your hands down and go right away 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.360
 on him we go on him 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.630
 it all depends on what action 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.160
 happen duran went to him that is 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.710
 we can hit the head if close 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.280
 head to do this is desirable because 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.830
 this is the shortest distance and the most 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.200
 effective way of it 1 at some point 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:10.030
 turn off bam hit the goal further 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:11.590
 we transfer the blow to the groin either with the knee or into 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.600
 this moment when i hit 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.980
 and he has leverage longer I can not 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.830
 I do not need to reach the knee 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.270
 reach for the knee or beat the shin in the groin 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.920
 further after that they are nothing about 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.670
 no longer hesitate to finish us what 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.890
 main switch off danger danger 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.370
 it's there in the knife 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:37.420
 what we do with that is we them in the morning 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:42.160
 peace break the arm go further means 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.620
 Now a little bit of the law means what it says 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.590
 self defense law 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.500
 that we have the right to protect our lives 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.590
 by any means and means outside 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.380
 dependence on physical fitness 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.330
 special training and social 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.180
 position and does not depend on whether 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.580
 what time do we have to call for help 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.239
 or tell the morgan to pass that is 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.580
 this is article 37 of the criminal code if 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.340
 and this is not an excess bypass 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.390
 defense means now the moment 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.950
 when we are killed because stabbed 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.109
 the belly is very dangerous because the tank 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.450
 affects all and internal organs and guts 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.479
 where everything gets and shins rendered 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.250
 help she will come to death 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.380
 the more likely it will be a blow 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.530
 and most often not one more often hitting on 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.610
 the course is applied in such a way why beat 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.510
 a lot of me that people 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.919
 Do they enjoy these blows? 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.650
 just because while a person is standing 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:46.270
 move the one who with a knife he will kill 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.940
 to keep this in mind and you need to know 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.789
 man captures and beats sharply and here 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.990
 we took this movement here 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.340
 belly and thrown out in restructuring why 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.379
 because even if he even captured 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.660
 the sleeve we have from hand top is loose therefore 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.819
 as if we strengthen the protection we are not going from him 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.009
 we just take our belly away from him 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.509
 expose the side wedging it 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.419
 action is blocking but our movement 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:09.479
 must be on him otherwise if we will 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.669
 go back 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:15.220
 continuing continues that is we like us 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.870
 if we do not have time to be on it to put in 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.240
 same place for example there are four 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.729
 five quick hits in a row 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.889
 there is anyway 2 3 4 strokes he 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.819
 surely will pass therefore here it is impossible 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:29.440
 move away so here you need determination 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.060
 necessarily determination to do something 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:37.000
 determination desire to survive 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:39.099
 the desire to escape from my decided 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.330
 farther now head in the place that i 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.009
 can't hit well nothing scary i 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.669
 Immediately strike as I charged 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:49.139
 forward immediately our punch in the groin he's lost 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.139
 and now what we talked about 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:59.240
 immediately forward ra-el right there before hitting 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:03.099
 belly husband and then forward 2 punch in the stomach 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:07.900
 neck forward the same forward and do not give a 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:10.250
 remember here as far as we will 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.000
 aggressive at this moment in the fight for 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.009
 your life so we both live and be and 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.139
 so with you was revealed hooks from with to 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.560
 transfer protect yourself take care of yourself 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.560
 gentlemen
