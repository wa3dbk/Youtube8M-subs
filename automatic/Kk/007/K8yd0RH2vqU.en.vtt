mentioned<00:06:20.590> that<00:06:21.009> the<00:06:21.159> advantage<00:06:21.520> of

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
mentioned that the advantage of

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.459 
mentioned that the advantage of
squatting<00:06:21.969> with<00:06:22.270> super<00:06:22.690> squats<00:06:22.960> hip<00:06:23.139> belt<00:06:23.349> is

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:23.469 
squatting with super squats hip belt is

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:25.110 
squatting with super squats hip belt is
that<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.800> weight<00:06:23.919> is<00:06:24.099> always<00:06:24.280> underneath<00:06:24.909> you

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
that the weight is always underneath you

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.790 
that the weight is always underneath you
so<00:06:25.330> it's<00:06:25.449> very<00:06:25.690> safe<00:06:25.990> perfect<00:06:26.560> if<00:06:26.680> you're

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
so it's very safe perfect if you're

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.860 
so it's very safe perfect if you're
squatting<00:06:27.099> alone<00:06:27.490> get<00:06:28.060> used<00:06:28.240> to<00:06:28.360> the<00:06:28.479> movement

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
squatting alone get used to the movement

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.480 
squatting alone get used to the movement
before<00:06:28.960> you<00:06:29.229> add<00:06:29.409> weight<00:06:29.590> and<00:06:29.830> then<00:06:30.099> work<00:06:30.310> up

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
before you add weight and then work up

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.270 
before you add weight and then work up
slowly<00:06:31.320> you<00:06:32.320> can<00:06:32.469> also<00:06:32.620> hang<00:06:32.949> the<00:06:33.099> weight<00:06:33.250> just

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
slowly you can also hang the weight just

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.129 
slowly you can also hang the weight just
in<00:06:33.669> front<00:06:33.909> which<00:06:34.270> gives<00:06:34.479> you<00:06:34.599> more<00:06:34.630> of<00:06:34.810> a<00:06:34.930> back

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
in front which gives you more of a back

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:37.200 
in front which gives you more of a back
squat<00:06:35.409> groove<00:06:35.800> it's<00:06:36.370> easier<00:06:36.759> for<00:06:36.820> most<00:06:37.060> people

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
squat groove it's easier for most people
