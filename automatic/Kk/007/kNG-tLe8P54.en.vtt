down and they already have it on this is
a<00:00:53.600> wires<00:00:54.600> turtle<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> wires<00:00:56.760> mine

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
a wires turtle and this is a wires mine

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.689 
a wires turtle and this is a wires mine
turtle<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.320> tutorial<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:59.250> own<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.579> can

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
turtle in this tutorial I'm own you can

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.410 
turtle in this tutorial I'm own you can
be<00:00:59.760> using<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:01.160> wireless<00:01:02.160> turtle<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
be using the wireless turtle but the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.880 
be using the wireless turtle but the
same<00:01:03.660> will<00:01:03.780> apply<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.260> wireless<00:01:04.530> mining

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
same will apply to the wireless mining

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.969 
same will apply to the wireless mining
turtle<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:08.270> first<00:01:09.270> thing<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.409> need<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
turtle so first thing you will need to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.050 
turtle so first thing you will need to
turn<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.729> Wi-Fi<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.750> both<00:01:13.439> machines<00:01:14.280> so

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
turn the Wi-Fi on on both machines so

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.240

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.200 
put three variables but this is only the
second<00:02:29.530> variable<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.430> take<00:02:30.670> it's<00:02:31.000> kinda

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
second variable you take it's kinda

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.810 
second variable you take it's kinda
confusing<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.650> can<00:02:32.860> put<00:02:33.040> three<00:02:33.430> letters

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
confusing so you can put three letters

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.170 
confusing so you can put three letters
or<00:02:34.090> names<00:02:34.420> or<00:02:34.690> whatever<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:35.740> I'll<00:02:35.830> do<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.220> b<00:02:37.210> c<00:02:38.160> is

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
or names or whatever so I'll do a b c is

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.890 
or names or whatever so I'll do a b c is
equal<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.450> red<00:02:41.880> net<00:02:42.880> dot<00:02:43.530> receive<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.630> can

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
equal to red net dot receive and you can

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.750 
equal to red net dot receive and you can
put<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.110> duration<00:02:47.710> here<00:02:47.920> like<00:02:48.190> say<00:02:48.490> five

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
put a duration here like say five

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.210 
put a duration here like say five
seconds<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:50.410> if<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:50.680> do<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:50.890> like<00:02:51.190> that

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
seconds but if you just do it like that

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.460 
seconds but if you just do it like that
and<00:02:51.400> then<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.760> will<00:02:51.820> do<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.270> until<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:53.200> gets

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
and then it will do it until it gets

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.979 
and then it will do it until it gets
answer<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:56.220> that's<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> variable<00:02:57.989> three

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
answer so that's the variable three

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.260 
answer so that's the variable three
variables<00:02:59.440> i<00:02:59.560> guess<00:02:59.860> i'm<00:03:00.489> not<00:03:00.670> quite<00:03:00.790> sure

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.220 

okay<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.480> now<00:03:04.570> you're<00:03:04.720> gonna<00:03:04.840> put<00:03:05.080> in<00:03:05.170> a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
okay and now you're gonna put in a

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.960 
okay and now you're gonna put in a
statement<00:03:05.470> if<00:03:06.150> b<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:08.020> that<00:03:08.290> says<00:03:08.500> whatever<00:03:08.709> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
statement if b so that says whatever the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.610 
statement if b so that says whatever the
second<00:03:09.970> or<00:03:10.090> middle<00:03:11.580> name<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.790> if<00:03:13.120> B<00:03:13.750> is<00:03:14.050> equals

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
second or middle name is if B is equals

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.140 
second or middle name is if B is equals
double<00:03:15.130> equals<00:03:15.370> because<00:03:15.580> you're<00:03:15.760> comparing

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
double equals because you're comparing

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.840 
double equals because you're comparing
it<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.980> string<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:19.120> let's<00:03:20.050> say<00:03:20.290> go<00:03:21.870> then

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
it to a string of let's say go then

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.640 
it to a string of let's say go then
we'll<00:03:24.850> just<00:03:25.060> give<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.420> command<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.930> show<00:03:26.320> that

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
we'll just give a command to show that

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.280 
we'll just give a command to show that
it's<00:03:27.989> received<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.700> could<00:03:30.700> do<00:03:30.820> anything<00:03:32.220> and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
it's received it could do anything and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.040 
it's received it could do anything and
so<00:03:35.290> yeah<00:03:35.830> that's<00:03:36.340> basically<00:03:36.580> it<00:03:37.050> pretty

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
so yeah that's basically it pretty

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.030 
so yeah that's basically it pretty
simple<00:03:39.630> that's<00:03:40.630> in<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.870> turtle<00:03:41.290> then<00:03:41.680> after

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
simple that's in the turtle then after

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.820 
simple that's in the turtle then after
you<00:03:42.190> put<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.459> on<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.640> turtle<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:44.350> will<00:03:44.560> need

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
you put it on the turtle you will need

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.490 
you put it on the turtle you will need
to<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.790> how<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.120> trigger<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.630> on<00:03:46.959> this<00:03:47.290> in

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
to is how you trigger it on this in

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.350 
to is how you trigger it on this in
lower<00:03:47.769> menu<00:03:48.040> but<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.400> could<00:03:48.670> make<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:48.880> program

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
lower menu but you could make a program

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.870 
lower menu but you could make a program
and<00:03:49.570> do<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.110> like<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.260> it's<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.160> same<00:03:51.400> just

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
and do it like that it's the same just

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.729 
and do it like that it's the same just
typing<00:03:52.420> different<00:03:52.690> things<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:54.450> red<00:03:55.450> net<00:03:55.780> dark

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
typing different things so red net dark

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.350 
typing different things so red net dark
now<00:03:57.310> there's<00:03:57.489> two<00:03:57.640> things<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:57.940> can<00:03:58.090> do<00:03:58.209> you

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
now there's two things you can do you

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.059 
now there's two things you can do you
can<00:03:58.480> do<00:03:58.570> broad<00:03:58.930> cast

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.550 

and<00:04:02.310> then<00:04:03.300> a<00:04:03.330> message<00:04:04.069> go<00:04:05.069> I<00:04:05.099> think<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.790> was

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
and then a message go I think it was

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.770 
and then a message go I think it was
I'm<00:04:07.560> impressed<00:04:07.709> yet<00:04:08.330> because<00:04:09.330> I'll<00:04:09.480> need<00:04:09.690> to

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
I'm impressed yet because I'll need to

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.880 
I'm impressed yet because I'll need to
start<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.440> on<00:04:10.530> here<00:04:10.800> so<00:04:11.310> start<00:04:12.410> so<00:04:13.410> now<00:04:13.560> it

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
start it on here so start so now it

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.589 
start it on here so start so now it
stopped<00:04:14.190> flickering<00:04:14.730> showing<00:04:15.360> that<00:04:15.480> it's

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
stopped flickering showing that it's

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.020 
stopped flickering showing that it's
waiting<00:04:15.989> it's<00:04:16.350> still<00:04:16.590> running<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.040> command

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
waiting it's still running the command

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.879 
waiting it's still running the command
and<00:04:18.299> waiting<00:04:18.630> for<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.810> response<00:04:19.700> so<00:04:20.700> go<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:21.889> oh

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
and waiting for a response so go and oh

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.570 
and waiting for a response so go and oh
so<00:04:23.130> moved<00:04:23.520> forwards<00:04:23.910> one<00:04:24.889> now<00:04:25.889> what<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.370> can

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
so moved forwards one now what you can

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.290 
so moved forwards one now what you can
do<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:27.000> ID<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:28.139> this<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.730> computer<00:04:29.730> ID<00:04:30.110> 28

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
do is you ID and this is computer ID 28

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.300 
do is you ID and this is computer ID 28
so<00:04:33.300> yeah<00:04:33.570> ID<00:04:33.900> on<00:04:34.139> the<00:04:34.229> turtle<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:34.830> could<00:04:35.010> do

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
so yeah ID on the turtle you could do

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:44.900 
so yeah ID on the turtle you could do
that<00:04:35.460> turtle<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:37.110> can<00:04:37.350> do<00:04:37.530> red<00:04:38.100> net<00:04:38.820> dot<00:04:43.910> send

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
that turtle you can do red net dot send

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.050 
that turtle you can do red net dot send
and<00:04:45.830> then<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:47.070> can<00:04:47.340> do

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
and then you can do

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:58.460 
and then you can do
or<00:04:48.540> was<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:49.520> 28<00:04:53.000> and<00:04:54.000> then<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:55.410> message<00:04:55.940> go<00:04:57.470> I'm

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
or was it 28 and then the message go I'm

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.140 
or was it 28 and then the message go I'm
not<00:04:58.860> gonna<00:04:59.010> present<00:04:59.160> it<00:04:59.430> yet<00:04:59.639> because<00:04:59.850> I<00:05:00.000> need

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
not gonna present it yet because I need

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.920 
not gonna present it yet because I need
to<00:05:00.350> win<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.470> command<00:05:04.640> and<00:05:05.640> as<00:05:06.419> you<00:05:06.539> just<00:05:06.570> saw

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
to win the command and as you just saw

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.560 
to win the command and as you just saw
it<00:05:07.229> moved<00:05:07.500> so<00:05:08.490> that's<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.789> first<00:05:09.000> message<00:05:09.419> and

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
it moved so that's the first message and

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.230 
it moved so that's the first message and
then<00:05:09.660> it<00:05:09.810> moved<00:05:09.960> again<00:05:10.430> so<00:05:11.430> it<00:05:11.610> received<00:05:12.060> it

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
then it moved again so it received it

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.420 
then it moved again so it received it
and<00:05:12.360> that<00:05:12.630> will<00:05:13.020> stop<00:05:13.350> confusion<00:05:13.950> on<00:05:14.070> like

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
and that will stop confusion on like

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.310 
and that will stop confusion on like
with<00:05:14.789> all<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.060> turtles<00:05:15.270> aren't<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:15.930> servers

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
with all the turtles aren't the servers

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.640 
with all the turtles aren't the servers
and<00:05:16.440> stuff<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:17.430> if<00:05:17.550> you<00:05:17.700> home<00:05:17.910> into<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.650> tofu

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
and stuff so if you home into the tofu

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.890 
and stuff so if you home into the tofu
directly<00:05:20.070> I<00:05:20.250> mean<00:05:20.789> it's<00:05:21.000> not<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.539> safest

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
directly I mean it's not the safest

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.300 
directly I mean it's not the safest
thing<00:05:22.020> ever<00:05:22.260> so<00:05:22.530> I'm<00:05:22.620> good<00:05:22.770> still<00:05:22.979> hack<00:05:23.160> your

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
thing ever so I'm good still hack your

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.990 
thing ever so I'm good still hack your
turtle<00:05:23.990> by<00:05:24.990> just<00:05:25.350> picking<00:05:25.590> on<00:05:25.830> it<00:05:25.950> I<00:05:25.979> guess

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.490 

another<00:05:30.000> thing<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.419> might<00:05:30.539> want<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.750> do<00:05:30.900> is<00:05:31.110> if

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
another thing you might want to do is if

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.460 
another thing you might want to do is if
you<00:05:31.620> do<00:05:31.770> programs<00:05:34.580> shell<00:05:35.930> that<00:05:36.930> runs<00:05:37.260> another

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
you do programs shell that runs another

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.730 
you do programs shell that runs another
program<00:05:38.039> inside<00:05:38.610> a

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.650 

so<00:05:43.490> inside<00:05:43.820> a<00:05:43.850> program<00:05:44.240> you<00:05:44.390> can<00:05:44.540> actually

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
so inside a program you can actually

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.080 
so inside a program you can actually
another<00:05:45.020> program<00:05:45.430> so<00:05:46.430> you<00:05:46.550> might<00:05:46.850> want<00:05:47.030> to

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
another program so you might want to

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.970 
another program so you might want to
make<00:05:47.300> it<00:05:47.450> so<00:05:47.630> soon<00:05:47.930> as<00:05:48.050> it<00:05:48.110> runs<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.650> Start

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
make it so soon as it runs the Start

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.250 
make it so soon as it runs the Start
program<00:05:49.240> it<00:05:50.240> would<00:05:50.420> run<00:05:50.720> it<00:05:50.810> again

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
program it would run it again

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.710 
program it would run it again
I<00:05:51.290> guess<00:05:51.730> you've<00:05:52.730> heard<00:05:52.850> just<00:05:53.030> do<00:05:53.150> a<00:05:53.180> wild<00:05:53.480> loop

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
I guess you've heard just do a wild loop

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.360 
I guess you've heard just do a wild loop
you<00:05:53.810> serve<00:05:53.990> if<00:05:54.260> something<00:05:54.920> like<00:05:55.010> that

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
you serve if something like that

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.610 
you serve if something like that
just<00:05:56.330> so<00:05:56.450> you<00:05:56.510> have<00:05:56.660> to<00:05:56.840> go<00:05:56.960> to<00:05:57.020> the<00:05:57.170> turtle<00:05:57.530> and

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
just so you have to go to the turtle and

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.160 
just so you have to go to the turtle and
Link<00:05:57.830> reactivate<00:05:58.610> it<00:05:58.760> so<00:05:59.750> you<00:05:59.810> can<00:06:00.050> play

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
Link reactivate it so you can play

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.350 
Link reactivate it so you can play
around<00:06:00.260> with<00:06:00.410> that<00:06:00.560> so<00:06:01.550> that's<00:06:01.760> it<00:06:02.000> then<00:06:02.240> it's

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
around with that so that's it then it's

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.380 
around with that so that's it then it's
watching<00:06:02.630> please<00:06:02.840> like<00:06:03.020> comment<00:06:03.260> subscribe
