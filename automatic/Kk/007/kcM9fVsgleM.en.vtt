00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
thing is like massive I mean this could

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.470 
thing is like massive I mean this could
you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.430> take<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.610> most<00:01:35.760> of<00:01:35.940> Rhode<00:01:36.090> Island

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
you know take up most of Rhode Island

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.930 
you know take up most of Rhode Island
but<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:38.010> so<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.460> doing<00:01:38.640> really

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
but you know so if you're doing really

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.210 
but you know so if you're doing really
really<00:01:39.240> high<00:01:39.390> stuff<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.020> don't<00:01:40.800> know<00:01:40.980> it's

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
really high stuff I don't know it's

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.770 
really high stuff I don't know it's
definitely<00:01:41.430> there<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.970> definitely<00:01:42.300> takes<00:01:42.630> up

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
definitely there it definitely takes up

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.600 
definitely there it definitely takes up
a<00:01:42.840> lot<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:42.990> space<00:01:43.260> in<00:01:43.290> your<00:01:43.530> hand<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.010> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
a lot of space in your hand but the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.130 
a lot of space in your hand but the
cutaway<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.060> big<00:01:45.360> enough<00:01:45.540> where<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> fret

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
cutaway is big enough where the fret

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.960 
cutaway is big enough where the fret
axis<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.950> actually<00:01:47.190> really<00:01:47.520> good

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
axis is is actually really good

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.340 
axis is is actually really good
so<00:01:48.409> as<00:01:49.409> far<00:01:49.650> as<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.890> neck<00:01:50.100> profile<00:01:50.580> it's<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
so as far as the neck profile it's you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.840 
so as far as the neck profile it's you
know<00:01:52.440> it's<00:01:52.620> like<00:01:52.770> thicker<00:01:53.070> than<00:01:53.310> an<00:01:53.430> Ibanez

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
know it's like thicker than an Ibanez

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.600 
know it's like thicker than an Ibanez
but<00:01:54.180> not<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.510> thick<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.870> a<00:01:54.900> Schecter<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.190> if

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
but not as thick as a Schecter so if

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.380 
but not as thick as a Schecter so if
that<00:01:56.790> gives<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.150> an<00:01:57.240> idea<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:59.120> these<00:02:00.120> were<00:02:00.270> of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that gives you an idea and these were of

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.600 
that gives you an idea and these were of
course<00:02:00.540> made<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.960> China<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.830> yeah<00:02:02.340> that's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
course made in China and yeah that's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.790 
course made in China and yeah that's
