00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
pretty cool indeed but I think it'll be

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.330 
pretty cool indeed but I think it'll be
a<00:01:38.960> little<00:01:39.229> bit<00:01:39.350> more<00:01:39.530> practical<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.160> be

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
a little bit more practical to be

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.219

playing that on a bigger screen for some

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.779 
playing that on a bigger screen for some
reason<00:01:42.560> this<00:01:42.710> totally<00:01:43.160> reminds<00:01:43.460> me<00:01:43.580> of<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
reason this totally reminds me of the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.520 
reason this totally reminds me of the
scene<00:01:44.030> in<00:01:44.270> Billy<00:01:44.479> Madison<00:01:44.899> where<00:01:45.229> Adam

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
Sandler was like I disagree I think

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.639
