of any honeycomb tablet that we checked
out<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.309> rightfully<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.390> could<00:01:06.659> tell

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
out and rightfully so you could tell

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600 
out and rightfully so you could tell
that<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.470> kind<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.860> lagging<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:08.430> its

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that it is kind of lagging with its

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.850 
that it is kind of lagging with its
movement<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> little<00:01:10.020> bit<00:01:10.140> more<00:01:10.320> profits

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
movement so a little bit more profits

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
you know some of its sluggishness but

usable so let's quickly run the first

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.580 
usable so let's quickly run the first
test<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.150> which<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:24.960> quadrant

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
test here which is going to be quadrant

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.999 
test here which is going to be quadrant
let's<00:01:26.009> load<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.290> in<00:01:28.290> our<00:01:28.500> testing

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
let's load it up and in our testing

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.399 
let's load it up and in our testing
we've<00:01:29.220> run<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.670> several<00:01:30.150> times<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:31.200> looks

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
we've run it several times now looks

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.929 
we've run it several times now looks
like<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.710> managed<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.250> roughly<00:01:32.729> around

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
like we managed to get roughly around

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.870 
like we managed to get roughly around
the<00:01:34.610> 1500<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> 1900<00:01:36.659> mark<00:01:37.130> with<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.340> test<00:01:38.700> so

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the 1500 to 1900 mark with the test so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.520 
the 1500 to 1900 mark with the test so
you<00:01:38.939> could<00:01:39.090> tell<00:01:39.270> where<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.810> compared<00:01:40.350> to
