00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
and the scariest part is is that there

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.050 
and the scariest part is is that there
were<00:02:59.480> USDA<00:03:00.170> inspectors<00:03:00.920> at<00:03:01.190> this<00:03:01.520> facility

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.310 
and yet these things were going on and
they<00:03:04.760> were<00:03:04.820> not<00:03:05.060> being<00:03:05.090> stopped<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.050> in<00:03:06.140> many

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
they were not being stopped and in many

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.260 
they were not being stopped and in many
cases<00:03:06.560> USDA<00:03:07.220> inspectors<00:03:07.730> have<00:03:07.880> said<00:03:08.090> that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
cases USDA inspectors have said that

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.479 
cases USDA inspectors have said that
even<00:03:08.840> when<00:03:09.020> they<00:03:09.170> speak<00:03:09.500> out<00:03:09.709> all<00:03:10.190> that

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
even when they speak out all that

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.030 
even when they speak out all that
happens<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.060> they<00:03:11.209> get<00:03:11.420> reprimanded<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.800> sent

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
happens is they get reprimanded and sent

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.310 
happens is they get reprimanded and sent
to<00:03:13.160> another<00:03:13.340> facility<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:14.510> really<00:03:14.930> there<00:03:15.140> are

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
to another facility so really there are

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.250 
to another facility so really there are
no<00:03:16.000> meaningful<00:03:17.000> watchdogs<00:03:17.780> at<00:03:18.049> these

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
no meaningful watchdogs at these

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.289 
no meaningful watchdogs at these
facilities<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.459> it's<00:03:19.610> vital<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.120> the

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
facilities and so it's vital that the

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.520 
facilities and so it's vital that the
way<00:03:20.420> we're<00:03:20.810> able<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:21.110> conduct<00:03:21.440> these

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
way we're able to conduct these

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.680 
way we're able to conduct these
undercover<00:03:21.830> investigations<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.000> expose
