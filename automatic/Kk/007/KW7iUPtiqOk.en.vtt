inspiration series headphones these are

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.870 
inspiration series headphones these are
what<00:00:09.540> i<00:00:09.570> would<00:00:09.780> say<00:00:09.929> comparable<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.880> beats

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
what i would say comparable to the beats

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.820 
what i would say comparable to the beats
by<00:00:12.090> dre<00:00:12.300> studio<00:00:12.360> headphones<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.410> mean<00:00:13.559> they<00:00:13.679> are

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
by dre studio headphones I mean they are

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.470 
by dre studio headphones I mean they are
made<00:00:14.009> by<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.219> same<00:00:14.309> manufacturer<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.360> you're

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
made by the same manufacturer so you're

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.689 
made by the same manufacturer so you're
pretty<00:00:15.809> well<00:00:16.020> getting<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.289> same<00:00:16.500> product<00:00:17.070> as

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
pretty well getting the same product as

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.710 
pretty well getting the same product as
far<00:00:18.420> as<00:00:18.859> insides<00:00:19.859> go<00:00:20.180> let's<00:00:21.180> go<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.420> open<00:00:21.510> this

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
far as insides go let's go and open this

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.240 
far as insides go let's go and open this
pair<00:00:21.960> up<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.740> with<00:00:22.859> active

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
pair up this is the one with active

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.009 
pair up this is the one with active
noise<00:00:23.430> cancellation<00:00:23.939> which<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.660> comparable

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
noise cancellation which is comparable

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
noise cancellation which is comparable
to<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.470> studio<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.670> also<00:00:26.820> get<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to the studio but you can also get the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.019 
to the studio but you can also get the
ones<00:00:27.359> with<00:00:27.510> non<00:00:27.900> active<00:00:28.740> noise<00:00:29.580> cancellation

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
ones with non active noise cancellation

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.250 
ones with non active noise cancellation
we<00:00:30.269> means<00:00:30.480> they<00:00:30.630> don't<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.960> any<00:00:31.109> batteries

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
we means they don't have any batteries

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.840 
we means they don't have any batteries
and<00:00:31.710> those<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.369> would<00:00:32.489> say<00:00:32.610> would<00:00:32.730> be

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
and those I would say would be

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.209 
and those I would say would be
comparable<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> solo<00:00:33.899> HD<00:00:34.290> s<00:00:34.350> except<00:00:35.190> for

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
comparable to the solo HD s except for

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.590 
comparable to the solo HD s except for
the<00:00:35.370> fact<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.670> these<00:00:35.820> are<00:00:36.030> over<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> ear

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the fact that these are over the ear

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.630 
the fact that these are over the ear

to<00:01:26.130> actually<00:01:26.820> put<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> batteries<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:27.960> these

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to actually put the batteries in these

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.140 
to actually put the batteries in these
ones<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> bit<00:01:29.549> different<00:01:29.729> than<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
ones this is a bit different than the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.719 
ones this is a bit different than the
than<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.810> beats<00:01:31.560> by<00:01:31.740> dre<00:01:31.979> ones<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.490> pop

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
than the beats by dre ones you just pop

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.760 
than the beats by dre ones you just pop
this<00:01:32.909> off<00:01:33.060> magnetic<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.590> see<00:01:34.740> right

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
this off magnetic you can see right

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.179 
this off magnetic you can see right
there<00:01:35.220> where<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.520> batteries<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:36.409> on<00:01:37.409> another

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
there where the batteries go on another

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.490 
there where the batteries go on another
tidbit<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.090> information<00:01:39.329> about<00:01:39.780> these<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.170> you

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
tidbit of information about these is you

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.649 
tidbit of information about these is you
can<00:01:40.710> actually<00:01:40.740> turn<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.640> off<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.030> noise

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
can actually turn on and off the noise

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.690 
can actually turn on and off the noise
cancellation<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.380> these<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.520> work

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
cancellation on these so they can work

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.190 
cancellation on these so they can work
without<00:01:44.939> batteries<00:01:45.479> or<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:45.780> your<00:01:45.899> batteries

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
without batteries or if your batteries

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.859 
without batteries or if your batteries
die<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.680> still<00:01:46.890> use<00:01:46.920> them<00:01:47.600> right<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:48.659> is

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
die you can still use them right here is

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
die you can still use them right here is
the<00:01:48.899> band<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> change<00:01:49.770> out<00:01:50.040> there's

pretty well the same as well it comes

with<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.320> studio<00:02:20.320> beats<00:02:20.560> except<00:02:20.980> for<00:02:21.130> these

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
with the studio beats except for these

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.900

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
as far as the sound goes I think the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.750 
as far as the sound goes I think the
sound<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.770> actually<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.070> little<00:02:27.130> bit<00:02:27.340> better<00:02:27.580> on

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
sound is actually a little bit better on

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.090 
sound is actually a little bit better on
these<00:02:27.970> than<00:02:28.210> my<00:02:28.300> studio<00:02:28.660> beats<00:02:28.870> i<00:02:29.140> actually

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
these than my studio beats i actually

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.890 
these than my studio beats i actually
prefer<00:02:30.310> these<00:02:30.700> i<00:02:30.910> prefer<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.210> design<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.600> lot

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
prefer these i prefer the design a lot

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.510 
prefer these i prefer the design a lot
better<00:02:32.080> i<00:02:32.320> think<00:02:32.560> they<00:02:32.860> feel<00:02:33.070> like<00:02:33.130> they're<00:02:33.490> a

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
better i think they feel like they're a

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.730 
better i think they feel like they're a
lot<00:02:33.670> stronger<00:02:34.060> due<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.140> being<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.410> metal

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
lot stronger due to it being a metal

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.100 
lot stronger due to it being a metal
metal<00:02:36.520> band<00:02:36.700> on<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.210> stuff<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.660> think<00:02:38.020> they

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
metal band on it and stuff I think they

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.630 
metal band on it and stuff I think they
look<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.440> lot<00:02:38.560> cleaner<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.280> like<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.520> way

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
look a lot cleaner and I like the way

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.100 
look a lot cleaner and I like the way
they<00:02:39.730> feel<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:40.060> my<00:02:40.150> head<00:02:40.300> better<00:02:40.510> they<00:02:41.020> are

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
they feel in my head better they are

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.840 
they feel in my head better they are
quite<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.380> bit<00:02:41.530> heavier<00:02:41.860> though<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.310> be<00:02:42.460> honest

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850
