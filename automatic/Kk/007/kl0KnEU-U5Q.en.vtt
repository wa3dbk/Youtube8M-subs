00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
there are 12 of these massive scissors

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.149 
there are 12 of these massive scissors
underneath<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:06.370> tables<00:04:06.760> here<00:04:07.379> each<00:04:08.379> one<00:04:08.860> has

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
underneath the tables here each one has

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.839 
underneath the tables here each one has
two<00:04:09.489> very<00:04:09.819> important<00:04:10.360> jobs<00:04:10.659> the<00:04:11.379> first<00:04:11.409> is<00:04:12.069> to

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
two very important jobs the first is to

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.960 
two very important jobs the first is to
guide<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.480> table<00:04:13.900> up<00:04:14.049> and<00:04:14.230> down<00:04:14.409> as<00:04:14.769> it<00:04:15.670> comes

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
guide the table up and down as it comes

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.319 
guide the table up and down as it comes
from<00:04:16.229> storage<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.680> show<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.910> second

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
from storage to show the second

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.629 
from storage to show the second
important<00:04:19.780> job<00:04:20.049> has<00:04:21.039> to<00:04:21.190> do<00:04:21.280> with<00:04:21.400> these

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
important job has to do with these

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.719 
important job has to do with these
hydraulic<00:04:22.330> cylinders<00:04:22.810> over<00:04:23.110> here<00:04:23.699> they're<00:04:24.699> a

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
hydraulic cylinders over here they're a

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.700 
hydraulic cylinders over here they're a
blocking<00:04:25.270> cylinder<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:25.900> when<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.320> table

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
blocking cylinder and when the table

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.189 
blocking cylinder and when the table
gets<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:27.039> show<00:04:27.250> height<00:04:27.520> this<00:04:28.000> cylinder<00:04:28.449> locks

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
gets to show height this cylinder locks

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.710 
gets to show height this cylinder locks
the<00:04:29.500> table<00:04:29.860> in<00:04:29.949> place<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.520> keeps<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.330> fixed

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
the table in place and keeps it fixed

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.200 
the table in place and keeps it fixed
there<00:04:31.930> we<00:04:32.470> then<00:04:32.710> add<00:04:33.009> a<00:04:33.039> little<00:04:33.340> more<00:04:33.610> buoyancy

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
there we then add a little more buoyancy

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.210 
there we then add a little more buoyancy
into<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.020> active<00:04:35.350> floatation<00:04:35.889> to<00:04:35.979> give<00:04:36.130> us

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
into the active floatation to give us

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.520 
into the active floatation to give us
some<00:04:36.400> up<00:04:36.550> force<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:37.060> we're<00:04:38.050> ready<00:04:38.229> to<00:04:38.320> do<00:04:38.500> a

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
some up force and we're ready to do a

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:59.700 
some up force and we're ready to do a
show

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.770
