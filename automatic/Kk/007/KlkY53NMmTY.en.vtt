00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.540
 0 is close, so let's go 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.520
 start with the tweets I hope they are 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.200
 spending an excellent Wednesday and let's see 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.270

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.390

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.730
 here cactus and so on you now have 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.199
 austria dose of shadows' is I'm not 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.179
 evil would be more or less like shadows more 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.710
 soft or better I do not really have 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.000
 an image now to show them but 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.559
 I put here yesterday's image a 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.660
 little bit about to see the change 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.460
 you judge ok he loves the news 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.170
 the chips are and again and there is a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.890
 huge memory consumption two boys 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.719
 and I'm not bad 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.670
 public tommaso also answering that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.320
 there was a ram memory consumption very 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.789
 brutal because he said also that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.949
 there was one megabyte per second that you 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.839
 consumed one megabyte per second which 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.060
 is brutal and therefore clearly with that 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.860
 thing on your device would explode and you 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.659
 I'll get out of the game then it seems 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.490
 boys, what do I know, they repair it today 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.920
 these problems that have 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.340
 if the memory thing possibly tomorrow 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.140
 let's have minecraft and 0.9 101 in place 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.820
 bull key and if not though I think that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.470
 our morning more or less I think that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.450
 would be for Friday or the end of 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.890
 week then do not remember anything 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.930

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.130

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.509

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.580
 or less report bugs that are in the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.630
 game to them then I think this 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.670

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.060

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.340
