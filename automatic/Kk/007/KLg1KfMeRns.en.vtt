00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.869
 whole chicken with everything and skin you have to 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.240
 work on that you have to remove the skin 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.910
 remove the excess fat to put it to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.190
 boil 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.700
 and these are the other ingredients that 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.700
 we will use is the husked corn 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.690
 ketchup 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:42.630

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:48.330

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:51.930
 It is half a tablespoon of lemon and pepper and 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:56.870
 this is a quarter of a tablespoon of cumin 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.870
 two tablespoons of chicken aenor 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.339
 and a clove of garlic ground or made 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:08.570
 ok bits these are the ingredients 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:12.760
 that we are going to use to make our 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.760
 chicken stew with pumpkin 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.120
 let's cut the zucchini 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.940
 we cut the pieces in half again 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.490
 they have to be a little little bones and 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.000
 they do not have to go very thin because 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.680
 then they fall apart as long as it's going to be 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.990
 very hot then it's going to 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 pick up and it's going to do 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.680
 all 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.960
 as puree that what we do not want we have 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.960
 that the vegetables are whole 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.460
 ok now we are going to add a 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.460
 teaspoon of salt 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.740
 yes 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.590
 because our list is ready 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:18.569
 zucchini with onion now 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.569
 let's add the tomato 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
 we add 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.440
 in the north 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.700
 and we mix them 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.850
 where they are very well mixed 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.720
 ah 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.359
 now what follows from the same broth that 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.880
 we had saved where we got the chicken 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.710
 let's grab 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.830
 Y 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.210
 we put it on 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.210
 to our vegetables 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.420
 is one of the reasons why you 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.470
 we remove the skin to the chicken and all the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.470
 excess fat 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.110
 to be able to use the juice 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.110
 we have 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.510
 we add the no 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.110
 nor tomato 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.450
 lemon and pepper 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.970
 the cumin 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.190
 and the garlic 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.960
 we also put you 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.819
 ketchup to give it a bit of 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.819
 color that does not remain so colorless 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.989
 But let's move should not boiling 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.200
 take a long time because the broth of 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.650
 chicken is very hot let's wait 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.650
 a while 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.520
 ok now that we have everything ready nothing 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.710
 plus 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.710
 we add the chick again 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.170
 adding what 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.170
 we left nothing else 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.040
 5 minutes to boil to mix 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.040
 the flavors 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:40.069
 and it's ready to be enjoyed 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.509
 I hope you liked it and I did not 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:44.830
 judge very hard because it is the first 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.830
 Once I do this
