00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.880
 the immensity of the hunter valley in 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.590
 australia it's on the 1500 hectares of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.660
 vallauris todd one of the five greatest 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.070
 country stud like my boy charli a 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.020
 morny prize winner makes the ride 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.090
 during the spring of the southern hemisphere 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.040
 he who had a great popular success 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.200
 for his first French season houara 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.830
 mezeray with 135 mares bred in 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.050
 2012 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.150
 my boy charli continued his work at 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.280
 australian spring with 170 mares 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.930
 protrusions before even having a single 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.490
 product to run but the noises 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.560
 stable conditions were sufficient to 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.090
 create the buzz and besides he won 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.980
 from the start with his first starter 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.520
 two year old charlie boy on saturday 17 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.860
 November 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.540
 water the guard at melbourne my boy 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.189
 Charlie was an excellent horse 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.630
 race in France he comes from a family 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.040
 which worked as well in France 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.040
 also very alive here in australia 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.420
 so it was a logical continuation of the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.860
 to come to France in spring 2010 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.960
 and it appears that breeders or 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.780
 many supported the horse it was a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.760
 good opportunity for him actually judged 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.350
 on the first generation of yearlings 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.710
 presented to sales here at the end of the year 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.560
 latest 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.180
 we can see that the horse has been 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.440
 as well supported at home during 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.880
 his first three seasons of riding 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.960
 with quality mayors and he is 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.520
 clear that they sign a lot these 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.409
 products physically he transmits his 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240
 model and her dress the very points 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.560
 athletic 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.240
 considering these strengths and considering that 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.580
 not expensive at 8800 dollars is about 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.409
 6000 euros the breeders thought they 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.510
 were good value for money 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.619
 and at the same time the buyers were able 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.409
 find foals from Bodmer 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.150
 with pleasure models my boy 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.700
 charlie is part of a 17 ha yard 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.040
 long whose American star died between 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.360
 10 to 100 thousand euros a justified rate 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.830
 by the fact that he managed to give 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.720
 in australia two winners of the golden 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.730

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.870
 richer in the world and the united states 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.870
 two winners the breeders' cup 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.470
 line of todd is almost as old 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.209
 that the news country since this 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.220
 this young's valley saw you his 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.220
 first settlers landed 200 years ago 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.110
 this was one of the first 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.530
 farms established in the country at the time 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.530
 pioneers 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.420
 there is a large community in 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.610
 this aisle with a hospital a town hall has 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.140
 police service on a domain of ten 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.060
 thousand hectares of many immigrants 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.370
 were sent here all thanks to the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.900
 quality of the land is since 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:01.519
 always the best breeding terroir 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:03.079
 cattle throughout the sydney region the 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.940
 quality of loans has been tested 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.349
 scientifically since we find 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.239
 a lot of minerals and a very strong 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.650
 limestone content this is excellent 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.370
 to breed racehorses and 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.780
 all types of animals from elsewhere 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.980
 so for his soil that interval and 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.989
 attracts the biggest breeders in 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.430
 australia in addition to the sun that allows 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.319
 horses almost never 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.790
 go back to the box my boy charlie goes so 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.250
 have a small thermal shock 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.250
