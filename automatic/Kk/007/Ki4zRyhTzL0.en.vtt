00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the sea flight we were just spawn

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.590 
the sea flight we were just spawn
trapping<00:01:20.400> them<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.270> really

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
trapping them here and this is a really

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080 
trapping them here and this is a really
good<00:01:21.750> trap<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.290> carbon<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.640> really<00:01:23.880> really

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.390 
and then players that were a bit better
joined<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.590> made<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.129> bit<00:02:59.280> difficult

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
joined so that made it a bit difficult

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.339 
joined so that made it a bit difficult
as<00:02:59.819> well<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.659> I<00:03:00.720> wasn't<00:03:00.900> able<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.260> get
