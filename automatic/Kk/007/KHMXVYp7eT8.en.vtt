00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:15.150
 hello hello what are you looking for and well 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:17.740
 should versatility jump dressage 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.830
 ok so then we just look 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.830
 I've come along sometimes 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.679
 OK 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.419
 then you can go in now 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.980
 two years ago heidi rackl got the 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.980
 saddle chamber opened in pouch world 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:50.420
 then we wanted the soja here 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.089
 he looks neat 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.860
 then we put the same time on the 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.379
 concept of the saddlery by heidi rackl 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.679
 She is unique in her opinion 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.300
 has a large assortment of horse saddles 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:05.420
 western saddle stock saddle spanish 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.190
 saddle and more of the 30 is a saddle 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.750
 to compare with a car 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.130
 there are some for a few 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.899
 one hundred euros others for a few thousand 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.550
 heidi rackl has a horse and himself 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.670
 therefore knows the problems from own 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.350
 experience the biggest problem is the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.869
 choosing the right saddle 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.360
 Although there are cheap settel on the internet 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.369
 but of those rarely really fits 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.200
 one that was one reason why heidi 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.990
 rackl yourself for your own shop 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.079
 the demand has been determined 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.630
 All the cases there are also customers outside 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.119
 from frank everyone thinks the drive 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.189
 people prefer something further and 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.860
 then take that for sure 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.920
 matching saddle with the title I would 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.930
 recommend now 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.540
 again to change again 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.360
 otherwise upholstered in length 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.670
 would be ok to make room 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.530
 so I would say you can to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.020
 should now just sit and see if you 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.940
 you can handle it too well 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.280
 and if that will be good for you then 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.830
 then you can just do it again to 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.989
 if his and discuss it again 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.690
 in addition to the saddlebox offers hold 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.380
 still horses and supplements and 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.849
 trailer for loan 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.769
 and, as I said, the only thing that affects us 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.900
 just possible that the focus 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.709
 resign 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.409
 that can be solved quite easily 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.349
 how do you feel Kathrin well 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.569
 okay wonderful then you can do the pony 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.900
 dismissed ok then for that lock 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.900
 have to
