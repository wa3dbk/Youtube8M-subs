can kind of see one on my mini-map right

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.050 
can kind of see one on my mini-map right
now<00:00:53.989> when<00:00:54.770> it<00:00:54.860> comes<00:00:55.010> back<00:00:55.220> up<00:00:55.460> but<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:55.910> always

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
now when it comes back up but you always

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.229 
now when it comes back up but you always
find<00:00:56.270> them<00:00:56.450> at<00:00:56.540> outposts<00:00:57.550> so<00:00:58.550> I<00:00:58.579> think

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
find them at outposts so I think

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.600 
find them at outposts so I think
everybody<00:01:00.050> except<00:01:00.500> for<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:00.770> one<00:01:01.070> douchebag

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
everybody except for that one douchebag

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.289 
everybody except for that one douchebag
over<00:01:01.880> there<00:01:02.210> is<00:01:02.450> tagged<00:01:03.460> all<00:01:04.460> right<00:01:04.640> now

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
over there is tagged all right now

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.249 
over there is tagged all right now
obviously<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:07.280> stealth<00:01:07.729> of<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.909> silencer<00:01:08.450> is

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
obviously the stealth of the silencer is

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.609 
obviously the stealth of the silencer is
not<00:01:10.189> really<00:01:10.520> comparable<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.329> bow<00:01:11.619> so

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
not really comparable to the bow so

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.529 
not really comparable to the bow so
we're<00:01:12.770> gonna<00:01:12.860> have<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.100> be<00:01:13.359> totally<00:01:14.359> ninja

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
we're gonna have to be totally ninja

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.879 
we're gonna have to be totally ninja
about<00:01:14.929> this<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:16.490> pull<00:01:16.670> off<00:01:16.789> a<00:01:16.819> no<00:01:17.060> detection

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:17.889 
about this to pull off a no detection

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:22.389 
about this to pull off a no detection
one<00:01:18.889> of<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.069> things<00:01:19.280> we're<00:01:19.520> gonna<00:01:19.609> do<00:01:19.939> is<00:01:21.399> go

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
one of the things we're gonna do is go

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.879 
one of the things we're gonna do is go
ahead<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:22.700> shut<00:01:22.999> off<00:01:23.119> this<00:01:23.299> alarm<00:01:23.889> just

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:24.889 
ahead and shut off this alarm just

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:26.469 
ahead and shut off this alarm just
because<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:25.219> last<00:01:25.490> thing<00:01:25.819> I<00:01:25.939> want<00:01:26.209> is<00:01:26.420> that

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
because the last thing I want is that

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.279 
because the last thing I want is that
alarm<00:01:27.079> going<00:01:27.289> off<00:01:27.499> and<00:01:28.810> like<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.929> said<00:01:29.990> it<00:01:30.200> you

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
alarm going off and like I said it you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.139 
alarm going off and like I said it you
don't<00:01:30.469> have<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.889> same<00:01:31.130> level<00:01:31.399> of<00:01:31.459> stealth<00:01:31.759> as

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
don't have the same level of stealth as

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.349 
don't have the same level of stealth as
you<00:01:32.569> do<00:01:32.689> with<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.929> bow<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:33.969> you<00:01:34.969> want<00:01:35.149> to<00:01:35.209> do<00:01:35.329> a

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
you do with the bow so you want to do a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.749 
you do with the bow so you want to do a
lot<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.719> like<00:01:36.170> shoot<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:36.829> move<00:01:36.920> type<00:01:37.249> tactics

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
lot of like shoot and move type tactics

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.489 
lot of like shoot and move type tactics
that<00:01:37.819> way<00:01:38.090> in<00:01:38.420> case<00:01:38.659> they<00:01:38.810> do<00:01:38.869> see<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.229> body

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:39.499 
that way in case they do see a body

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.120 
that way in case they do see a body
you're<00:01:40.340> already<00:01:40.639> in<00:01:40.789> a<00:01:40.850> new<00:01:40.969> location<00:01:41.509> and

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
you're already in a new location and

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.830 
you're already in a new location and
they<00:01:43.130> most<00:01:43.369> likely<00:01:43.549> won't<00:01:43.729> find<00:01:43.969> you<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.659> let's

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
they most likely won't find you so let's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.359 
they most likely won't find you so let's
go<00:01:45.020> ahead<00:01:45.139> and<00:01:46.060> see<00:01:47.060> if<00:01:47.179> we<00:01:47.329> can<00:01:47.569> get<00:01:48.369> three
