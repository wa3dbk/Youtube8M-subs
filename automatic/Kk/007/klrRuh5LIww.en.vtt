don't have to cover that up later with
another<00:01:08.939> layer<00:01:10.100> then<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.490> biggest<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
another layer then the biggest the

biggest thing of the biggest defining

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.340 
biggest thing of the biggest defining
feature<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.390> guess<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.750> Sonic<00:01:16.049> would<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.259> his

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
feature I guess of Sonic would be his

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.740 
feature I guess of Sonic would be his
nose<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.790> hardest<00:01:18.090> thing<00:01:18.210> about<00:01:18.270> them<00:01:18.630> is

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
nose now the hardest thing about them is

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.950 
nose now the hardest thing about them is
is<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.590> there<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.920> literally<00:01:20.310> no<00:01:20.810> there<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
is that there is literally no there is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.359 
is that there is literally no there is
no<00:01:22.610> if<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.720> look<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.770> there's

only<00:01:37.799> thing<00:01:37.979> would<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> pickle<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.390> if

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
only thing would be the pickle but if

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.240 
only thing would be the pickle but if
you<00:01:39.570> look<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> pickle<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> has<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
you look at the pickle it has it's not a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.310 
you look at the pickle it has it's not a
solid<00:01:41.759> object<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.600> need<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> solid<00:01:43.079> object

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
solid object and you need a solid object

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990 
solid object and you need a solid object
these<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.829> don't<00:01:43.950> want<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.880> don't

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
these you don't want to see you don't

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.149 
these you don't want to see you don't
want<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> see<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> under<00:01:45.720> layers<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:47.040> only

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
want to see the under layers you only

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.550 
want to see the under layers you only
want<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.369> see<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> top<00:01:47.700> section

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
want to see the top section

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.649

so<00:01:48.680> literally<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.579> only<00:01:49.729> thing<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:50.240> can<00:01:50.420> use

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
so literally the only thing you can use

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.940 
so literally the only thing you can use
is<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.259> beret<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.860> can<00:01:52.220> find<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:55.329> where<00:01:56.329> is<00:01:56.450> it

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
is the beret I can find it where is it

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.010 
is the beret I can find it where is it
there's<00:01:57.950> all<00:01:58.939> right<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.270> see<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.840> have<00:01:59.930> the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
there's all right I see you have the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.870 
there's all right I see you have the
beret<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.500> thing<00:02:00.680> about<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.979> burrito<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.490> if

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
beret the thing about the burrito is if

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.639 
beret the thing about the burrito is if
you<00:02:02.060> turn<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.539> upside<00:02:02.810> down<00:02:02.840> it's<00:02:03.229> facing<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
you turn it upside down it's facing the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.710 
you turn it upside down it's facing the
wrong<00:02:03.860> direction<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:05.030> if<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.179> flip<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.539> over

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
wrong direction so if you flip it over

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.350 
wrong direction so if you flip it over
and<00:02:05.990> make<00:02:06.110> sure<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:06.439> change<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:07.360> now

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
and make sure you change it to now

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.500 
and make sure you change it to now
there's<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.959> oranges<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:09.860> think<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.280> best<00:02:10.510> the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
there's the oranges I think the best the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.589 
there's the oranges I think the best the
best<00:02:11.540> flesh<00:02:12.080> color<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:13.250> probably<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:14.090> third

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
best flesh color is probably this third

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.420 
best flesh color is probably this third
from<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.900> white<00:02:15.200> there<00:02:15.709> from<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.010> right<00:02:16.220> on

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
from the white there from the right on

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.430 
from the white there from the right on
the<00:02:16.580> white<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.569> off<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.019> white<00:02:18.200> that's

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
the white and off the white that's

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.780 
the white and off the white that's
probably<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.830> best<00:02:18.980> color<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.400> want<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.610> pick

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
probably the best color you want to pick

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.360 
probably the best color you want to pick
for<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.750> could<00:02:21.110> go<00:02:21.290> with<00:02:21.319> this<00:02:21.860> color

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
for this you could go with this color

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.000 
for this you could go with this color
it's<00:02:23.060> more<00:02:23.269> of<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.390> peaches<00:02:23.840> though<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:24.769> my

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
it's more of a peaches though it's my

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.309 
it's more of a peaches though it's my
thing<00:02:25.250> its<00:02:25.370> flesh<00:02:25.640> colored<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.780> I'd<00:02:26.870> stick

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
thing its flesh colored so I'd stick

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.660 
thing its flesh colored so I'd stick
with<00:02:27.350> put<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.100> one<00:02:28.250> right<00:02:28.280> here<00:02:28.400> it's<00:02:28.640> a

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
with put this one right here it's a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.550 
with put this one right here it's a
little<00:02:28.819> bit<00:02:28.910> more<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.480> little<00:02:29.569> bit<00:02:29.750> more<00:02:29.930> pinky

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
little bit more a little bit more pinky

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.860 
little bit more a little bit more pinky
I<00:02:30.739> guess<00:02:31.489> you<00:02:31.640> could<00:02:31.670> say<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.660> want<00:02:32.810> to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
I guess you could say and you want to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.660 
I guess you could say and you want to
minimize<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.440> angle<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.040> down<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.430> little

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
minimize this and angle it down a little

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.750 
minimize this and angle it down a little
bit<00:02:35.049> so<00:02:36.049> that<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.290> fits<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.950> want<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.670> make

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
bit so that it fits you want to make

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.509 
bit so that it fits you want to make
sure<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.030> overlaps<00:02:38.660> all<00:02:38.989> of<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.440> blue<00:02:39.620> so

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
sure that overlaps all of the blue so

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.979 
sure that overlaps all of the blue so
it's<00:02:40.700> off<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.940> little<00:02:41.180> bit<00:02:41.360> see<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.810> don't

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
it's off a little bit see you don't

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.150 
it's off a little bit see you don't
match<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.319> up<00:02:42.380> directly<00:02:42.560> with<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.920> blue

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
match it up directly with the blue

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.100 
match it up directly with the blue
because<00:02:43.549> then<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.330> top<00:02:44.540> section<00:02:44.930> doesn't

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
because then the top section doesn't

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.960 
because then the top section doesn't
match<00:02:45.319> up<00:02:45.349> you<00:02:46.280> want<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.459> make<00:02:46.549> sure<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.819> goes

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
match up you want to make sure it goes

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.759 
match up you want to make sure it goes
down<00:02:47.420> below<00:02:47.780> just<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.470> edge<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.709> that

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
pull it right up so it's in between both

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.400 
thing and what you want to do is you
want<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.740> flip<00:05:11.919> it<00:05:12.099> over<00:05:12.250> right<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.410> then

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
want to flip it over right and then

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.620 
want to flip it over right and then
right<00:05:14.740> trigger<00:05:15.370> or<00:05:15.699> left<00:05:16.090> trigger<00:05:16.240> whatever

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
right trigger or left trigger whatever

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.080 
right trigger or left trigger whatever
until<00:05:17.080> you<00:05:17.199> get<00:05:17.380> it<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:17.650> where<00:05:17.830> it's<00:05:18.789> right

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
until you get it to where it's right

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.969 
until you get it to where it's right
about<00:05:19.360> here<00:05:19.419> now<00:05:19.990> you<00:05:20.050> see<00:05:20.229> it<00:05:20.380> doesn't<00:05:20.650> fit<00:05:20.830> in

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
about here now you see it doesn't fit in

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.200 
about here now you see it doesn't fit in
there<00:05:21.070> almost<00:05:21.190> sections<00:05:21.639> you<00:05:21.759> want<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:21.970> try<00:05:22.150> to

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
there almost sections you want to try to

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.810 
there almost sections you want to try to
blow<00:05:22.479> it<00:05:22.509> up<00:05:22.720> a<00:05:22.810> little<00:05:22.960> bit<00:05:23.169> and<00:05:23.400> move<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.610> to

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
blow it up a little bit and move it to

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.900 
blow it up a little bit and move it to
where<00:05:25.660> this<00:05:26.169> bottom<00:05:26.889> right<00:05:27.130> or<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.430> top<00:05:27.639> I

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
where this bottom right or the top I

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.029 
where this bottom right or the top I
guess<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:28.210> middle<00:05:28.479> right<00:05:28.660> a<00:05:28.960> little<00:05:29.470> tip<00:05:29.680> or

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
guess the middle right a little tip or

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.860 
guess the middle right a little tip or
you<00:05:30.130> see<00:05:30.280> on<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.400> right<00:05:30.610> side<00:05:30.789> of<00:05:30.910> his<00:05:31.000> eye<00:05:31.150> you

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
you see on the right side of his eye you

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.270 
you see on the right side of his eye you
want<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.080> make<00:05:32.139> sure<00:05:32.199> that<00:05:32.470> lines<00:05:32.770> up<00:05:32.949> directly

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
want to make sure that lines up directly

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.640 
want to make sure that lines up directly
with<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.030> part<00:05:34.690> so<00:05:34.870> it<00:05:34.930> looks<00:05:35.139> like<00:05:35.470> it's

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
with the part so it looks like it's

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.730 
with the part so it looks like it's
supposed<00:05:35.919> to<00:05:36.070> be<00:05:36.250> and<00:05:37.050> you<00:05:38.050> want<00:05:38.199> to<00:05:38.259> cover<00:05:38.470> up

top of it but not to wear the white of

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.260 
top of it but not to wear the white of
the<00:05:47.409> science<00:05:47.919> so<00:05:48.760> you're<00:05:48.880> gonna<00:05:48.970> have<00:05:49.060> some

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
the science so you're gonna have some

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.939 
the science so you're gonna have some
white<00:05:49.479> speckles<00:05:50.050> up<00:05:50.199> on<00:05:50.349> the<00:05:50.470> top<00:05:50.650> of<00:05:50.680> his<00:05:50.919> head

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
white speckles up on the top of his head

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:51.999 
white speckles up on the top of his head
I'm<00:05:51.400> gonna<00:05:51.610> change

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
I'm gonna change

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:59.220 
I'm gonna change
the<00:05:52.309> correct<00:05:52.610> color<00:05:56.830> there<00:05:57.830> you<00:05:57.979> go

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
the correct color there you go

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.530 
the correct color there you go
now<00:05:59.830> you<00:05:59.890> see<00:06:00.100> how<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.340> makes<00:06:00.490> his<00:06:00.730> actually

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
now you see how it makes his actually

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.750 
now you see how it makes his actually
pull<00:06:01.720> this<00:06:01.810> up<00:06:01.990> a<00:06:02.140> little<00:06:02.230> bit<00:06:02.490> now<00:06:03.490> it<00:06:03.610> makes

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
pull this up a little bit now it makes

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.970 
pull this up a little bit now it makes
his<00:06:04.030> right<00:06:04.420> eye<00:06:04.450> or<00:06:05.320> his<00:06:05.470> left<00:06:05.710> eye<00:06:05.830> actually

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980 
his right eye or his left eye actually

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.310 
his right eye or his left eye actually
looks<00:06:06.400> a<00:06:06.460> little<00:06:06.580> bit<00:06:06.730> more<00:06:06.850> oval<00:06:09.900> you<00:06:10.900> see<00:06:11.080> and

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
looks a little bit more oval you see and

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.100 
looks a little bit more oval you see and
his<00:06:11.860> left<00:06:12.070> eye<00:06:12.220> looks<00:06:12.460> like<00:06:12.580> it's<00:06:12.840> behind<00:06:13.840> like

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
his left eye looks like it's behind like

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.940 
his left eye looks like it's behind like
the<00:06:14.380> whatever<00:06:15.370> you<00:06:15.460> call<00:06:15.640> them<00:06:16.590> and<00:06:17.590> then<00:06:17.740> we

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
the whatever you call them and then we

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.900 
the whatever you call them and then we
have<00:06:19.410> this<00:06:20.410> Arrowhead<00:06:20.860> is<00:06:21.310> gonna<00:06:21.550> you're

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
have this Arrowhead is gonna you're

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.520 
have this Arrowhead is gonna you're
going<00:06:22.060> to<00:06:22.120> take<00:06:22.270> the<00:06:22.300> try<00:06:23.140> to<00:06:23.200> find<00:06:23.410> the

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
going to take the try to find the

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.290 
going to take the try to find the
Arrowhead<00:06:23.890> and<00:06:24.130> you're<00:06:24.790> going<00:06:24.940> to<00:06:25.000> make<00:06:25.090> it

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
Arrowhead and you're going to make it

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.020 
Arrowhead and you're going to make it
right<00:06:25.960> about<00:06:26.290> this<00:06:26.560> put<00:06:26.980> in<00:06:27.070> that<00:06:27.190> corner<00:06:27.610> and

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
right about this put in that corner and

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.180 
right about this put in that corner and
then<00:06:28.870> take<00:06:29.020> another<00:06:29.050> of<00:06:29.620> the<00:06:29.740> exact<00:06:30.010> same

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
then take another of the exact same

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.190 
then take another of the exact same
Arrowhead<00:06:30.870> make<00:06:31.870> sure<00:06:32.050> they're

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.200 
Arrowhead make sure they're

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.020 
Arrowhead make sure they're
perpendicular<00:06:32.560> and<00:06:33.550> you're<00:06:33.820> trying<00:06:33.940> to

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
perpendicular and you're trying to

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.830 
perpendicular and you're trying to
outline<00:06:34.450> it<00:06:34.510> like<00:06:35.170> that<00:06:35.320> and<00:06:35.970> then<00:06:36.970> since<00:06:37.690> we

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
outline it like that and then since we

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.440 
outline it like that and then since we
have<00:06:38.020> the<00:06:38.200> fang<00:06:38.500> and<00:06:38.880> so<00:06:39.880> we<00:06:39.940> have<00:06:40.060> the<00:06:40.180> thing

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.450 
have the fang and so we have the thing

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.470 
have the fang and so we have the thing
up<00:06:40.720> on<00:06:40.960> the<00:06:41.170> up<00:06:42.130> there<00:06:42.520> with<00:06:42.700> all<00:06:42.850> the<00:06:43.030> holes<00:06:43.240> in

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
up on the up there with all the holes in

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.830 
up on the up there with all the holes in
it<00:06:43.570> you<00:06:43.810> had<00:06:43.960> to<00:06:44.080> get<00:06:44.200> another<00:06:44.290> Arrowhead

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
it you had to get another Arrowhead

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.770 
it you had to get another Arrowhead
change<00:06:46.840> it<00:06:46.930> to<00:06:47.050> blue<00:06:47.290> and<00:06:47.530> then<00:06:47.860> just<00:06:48.070> just

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
change it to blue and then just just

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.970 
change it to blue and then just just
configure<00:06:49.780> it<00:06:49.900> until<00:06:50.110> it<00:06:50.230> fits<00:06:50.470> and<00:06:50.830> just

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
configure it until it fits and just

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.180 
configure it until it fits and just
cover<00:06:51.160> love<00:06:51.430> everything<00:06:52.680> so<00:06:53.680> I<00:06:53.740> guess<00:06:53.920> he's<00:06:53.950> uh

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
cover love everything so I guess he's uh

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.920 
cover love everything so I guess he's uh
he's<00:06:54.610> mohawk<00:06:55.060> the<00:06:55.300> sonic<00:06:55.920> mohawk
