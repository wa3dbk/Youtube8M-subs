00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.820 
trinket box out of these two empty tins
they<00:00:07.710> came<00:00:07.950> from<00:00:08.210> Chinese<00:00:09.210> roast<00:00:09.540> eels<00:00:09.900> which

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
they came from Chinese roast eels which

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.140 
they came from Chinese roast eels which
sounds<00:00:11.220> horrible<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:11.640> in<00:00:11.850> fact<00:00:11.970> they're

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
sounds horrible but in fact they're

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.330

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
quite delicious the thing that attracted

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.009 
quite delicious the thing that attracted
me<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.640> these<00:00:14.790> tins<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.390> first<00:00:15.600> place<00:00:15.840> is

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:16.019 
me to these tins in the first place is

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.079 
me to these tins in the first place is
just<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> way<00:00:16.500> they<00:00:16.699> decorate<00:00:17.699> them<00:00:17.849> I<00:00:17.910> think

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:18.089 
just the way they decorate them I think

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.029 
just the way they decorate them I think
they're<00:00:18.240> really<00:00:18.359> rather<00:00:18.630> nice<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.650> tins<00:00:19.859> have

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
they're really rather nice the tins have

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.819 
they're really rather nice the tins have
a<00:00:20.070> pull-tab<00:00:20.339> opening<00:00:21.029> which<00:00:21.539> leaves<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.199> sharp

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:22.829 
a pull-tab opening which leaves a sharp

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.310 
a pull-tab opening which leaves a sharp
lip<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> edge<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> tin<00:00:24.509> so<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.050> actually

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
lip on the edge of the tin so I actually

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.429 
lip on the edge of the tin so I actually
used<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.970> an<00:00:26.970> ordinary<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.749> opener<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.199> take

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
used a an ordinary can opener to take

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.220 
used a an ordinary can opener to take
mine<00:00:28.650> off<00:00:28.679> on<00:00:29.039> its<00:00:29.159> left<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.519> nice<00:00:29.669> flush<00:00:30.050> in<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
mine off on its left a nice flush in a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.229 
mine off on its left a nice flush in a
surface<00:00:31.499> there<00:00:31.919> which<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.460> bit<00:00:32.940> better<00:00:33.090> for

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
surface there which is a bit better for

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.150 
surface there which is a bit better for
what<00:00:33.390> we're<00:00:33.540> trying<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:33.990> the<00:00:34.770> first<00:00:35.010> thing

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
what we're trying to do the first thing

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.210 
what we're trying to do the first thing
to<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.400> is<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.420> decide<00:00:36.780> how<00:00:37.110> they're<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
to do is to decide how they're going to

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.860 
to do is to decide how they're going to
fit<00:00:38.400> together<00:00:39.680> now<00:00:40.680> they're<00:00:40.770> not<00:00:40.920> exactly

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
fit together now they're not exactly

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.950 
fit together now they're not exactly
perfect<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.400> it's<00:00:44.400> just<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.670> case<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.960> working

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
perfect so it's just a case of working

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.270 
perfect so it's just a case of working
out<00:00:46.140> which<00:00:46.290> way<00:00:46.440> around<00:00:46.680> they<00:00:46.860> fit<00:00:47.070> best

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
out which way around they fit best

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.500 
out which way around they fit best
together<00:00:47.580> I<00:00:47.640> think<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.060> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
together I think it's like that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.170 
together I think it's like that
to<00:00:48.600> hold<00:00:48.750> everything<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.230> place<00:00:49.290> while<00:00:50.040> I<00:00:50.180> fix

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
to hold everything in place while I fix

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.130 
to hold everything in place while I fix
the<00:00:51.420> hinges<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.020> catches<00:00:53.060> and<00:00:54.060> I<00:00:54.150> use<00:00:54.360> good

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the hinges and catches and I use good

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:10.680 
the hinges and catches and I use good
old<00:00:55.200> duct<00:00:55.470> tape

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.930 

okay<00:01:11.690> I've<00:01:12.590> duct-taped<00:01:13.070> three<00:01:13.400> three<00:01:13.820> other

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
okay I've duct-taped three three other

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.640 
okay I've duct-taped three three other
sides<00:01:14.240> together<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.870> that<00:01:15.110> just<00:01:15.320> holds<00:01:15.620> it

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
sides together and that just holds it

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.530 
sides together and that just holds it
all<00:01:15.770> nice<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.250> tight<00:01:16.430> together<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.450> it

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
all nice and tight together so it

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.500 
all nice and tight together so it
doesn't<00:01:17.780> slip<00:01:18.020> or<00:01:18.410> move<00:01:18.680> while<00:01:19.070> I<00:01:19.360> fix<00:01:20.360> the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
doesn't slip or move while I fix the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.690 
doesn't slip or move while I fix the
hinges<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.650> hinge<00:01:21.920> is<00:01:22.130> going<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.340> be<00:01:22.460> one<00:01:22.610> of

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
hinges the hinge is going to be one of

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.980 
hinges the hinge is going to be one of
these<00:01:22.760> butterfly<00:01:23.300> hinges<00:01:23.720> it's<00:01:23.900> a

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
these butterfly hinges it's a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.960 
these butterfly hinges it's a
chrome-plated<00:01:24.260> butterfly<00:01:25.040> hinge<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:25.790> that's

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
chrome-plated butterfly hinge and that's

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.900 
chrome-plated butterfly hinge and that's
just<00:01:26.180> gonna<00:01:26.330> go<00:01:26.479> on<00:01:26.660> there<00:01:26.840> like<00:01:26.990> that<00:01:27.790> as<00:01:28.790> you

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
just gonna go on there like that as you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.400 
just gonna go on there like that as you
can<00:01:29.030> see<00:01:29.180> that's<00:01:29.300> really<00:01:29.630> sliding<00:01:29.900> about<00:01:30.229> on

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
can see that's really sliding about on

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.820 
can see that's really sliding about on
top<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.680> this<00:01:33.400> to<00:01:34.400> hold<00:01:34.580> that<00:01:34.790> hinge<00:01:34.970> in<00:01:35.180> place

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
top of this to hold that hinge in place

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.890 
top of this to hold that hinge in place
perfectly<00:01:36.830> in<00:01:37.160> place<00:01:37.570> while<00:01:38.570> I<00:01:38.630> make<00:01:38.869> the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
perfectly in place while I make the

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.779 
perfectly in place while I make the
holes<00:01:44.649> okay<00:01:45.649> I'm<00:01:45.830> happy<00:01:46.039> now<00:01:46.280> that<00:01:46.310> that's<00:01:46.610> in

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
holes okay I'm happy now that that's in

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.290 
holes okay I'm happy now that that's in
the<00:01:46.910> right<00:01:47.090> place<00:01:47.390> I<00:01:48.009> can<00:01:49.009> see<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.399> line<00:01:50.270> of

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
the right place I can see the line of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.109 
the right place I can see the line of
the<00:01:50.539> join<00:01:50.780> there<00:01:51.280> he's<00:01:52.990> good<00:01:53.990> enough<00:01:54.020> in<00:01:54.470> line

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
the join there he's good enough in line

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.540 
the join there he's good enough in line
with<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.240> angle<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.660> hinge<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.860> I'm<00:01:58.310> just

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
with the angle of the hinge so I'm just

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.730 
with the angle of the hinge so I'm just
gonna<00:01:58.670> make<00:01:58.850> some<00:01:58.910> holes<00:01:59.270> through<00:01:59.690> using<00:02:00.530> a

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
gonna make some holes through using a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.690 
gonna make some holes through using a
sharp<00:02:01.009> Brattle<00:02:02.740> through<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.950> holes<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.670> the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
sharp Brattle through the holes of the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.419 
sharp Brattle through the holes of the
hinge<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:06.380> straight<00:02:06.710> through<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.039> metal<00:02:07.310> of

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
hinge and straight through the metal of

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:14.199 
hinge and straight through the metal of
the<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:10.390> okay<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:13.400> I'm<00:02:13.459> eventually<00:02:13.670> gonna<00:02:13.940> fix

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
the can okay so I'm eventually gonna fix

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.030 
the can okay so I'm eventually gonna fix
this<00:02:14.360> together<00:02:14.690> with<00:02:14.870> aluminium<00:02:15.140> pop<00:02:15.650> rivets

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
this together with aluminium pop rivets

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.259 
this together with aluminium pop rivets
so<00:02:16.250> I'm<00:02:16.610> just<00:02:16.730> going<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:16.940> make<00:02:17.060> sure<00:02:17.239> that

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269

so I'm just going to make sure that
those<00:02:17.540> go<00:02:17.750> through<00:02:18.130> yeah<00:02:19.130> they're<00:02:19.370> good

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730
