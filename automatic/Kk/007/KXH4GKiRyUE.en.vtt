00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:51.960
 we're there we'll start making a 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.539
 circle on cardboard I 'm going to leave if 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.160
 To make a mold, then you can 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.930
 be bigger or smaller than you 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.960
 I wish and if for me it was the size 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.820
 Ideal, I could use whatever you want. 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.619
 to make the mold then just cut 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.930
 That this will be our base. 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.270
 I will not get a paper card too 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.060
 cardboard for making various scones 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.760
 Let's use four strips depending on the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.650
 size you want but sock 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.240
 thin little boy an inch to a centimeter 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.130
 and a half at the most 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.130
 are four shots 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.960
 after we cut we will reserve and 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.780
 let's use another color of paper 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.420
 or paper card to make a bird 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.869
 I draw so I look more or less 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.700
 What I do not get so good then chokes 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.140
 but you can search the internet for the template well 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.909
 cool I'll try to put it there in the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.539
 blog for you although it is not so 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.990
 cute but we only know how to do it 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.990
 yea 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.319
 and I just caught a nylon cord making a 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.720
 Well in the middle I used a stiletto 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:27.870
 Prick accuracy and we spend the end of 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:29.849
 May the rosette be very easy hence the people 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.489
 reserve the bird and come back 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.780
 good mold we go with this little strips 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.720
 meanwhile he had left his tail 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.140
 warm up and just pass a 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.040
 them with hot glue on each dot and 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.250
 paste from one side to another of the cage 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.709
 or better of the base is to form it 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.489
 see another comic strip will cross there 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.049
 behind 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.060
 until in front of it that way people 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.180
 also puts a tip of glue 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.310
 hot a well center to put a 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.329
 bottom of the other that way not 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.540
 get loose 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.790
 Okay, and we're crossing all the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.940
 until you are done until you close the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.459
 line always remembering to put a 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.040
 Hot glue sticks right in the center in 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.040
 Up to lock another here. 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.610
 the next step is to make a well 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.680
 in the center of the cage for us to pass 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.600
 Marlon's son who was passing 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.760
 Remember, we can go inside. 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.640
 the cage down little before passing 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.130
 in the drill there passes the cold and the other 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.130
 hand it underneath the top ok 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.770
 I also used a decision not mine 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.020
 the end of nylon to make the 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.670
 yes it is wrong for us to celebrate that is 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.739
 a cool tip is also good and the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.690
 third color paper cardboard paper 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.310
 I chose this blue and I'll stick with 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.560
 hot glue a piece if more or less 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.780
 of 12 days of the width around the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.910
 chicken to do the finishing 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.480
 that way, just get around and close 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.480
 other side 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.709
 good people to do the finishing by 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.740
 have one more piece of blue paper card 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.960
 and I picked up the chicken I had not 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.180
 done that before but i repaired optics 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.870
 for finishing with paper 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.610
 blue 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.730
 so I cut the same mold I used 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.610
 I had given the cardboard I cut and embedded it 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.840
 leading to nelinha ni collection collection 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.490
 It's really easy too. 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.490
 You can do it first, okay? 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.800
 It's very easy is not and is ready to 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.610
 Our chicken looks beautiful to 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.919
 to decorate people I found super cute and I 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.919
 I loved asking the questions thrown to the father. 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.379

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.569
