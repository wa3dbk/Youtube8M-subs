00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.810 

so<00:00:08.420> here<00:00:08.719> I've<00:00:08.960> got<00:00:08.990> the<00:00:09.620> exoteric<00:00:10.099> version

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
so here I've got the exoteric version

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.789 
so here I've got the exoteric version
out<00:00:11.000> of<00:00:11.150> the<00:00:11.299> digital<00:00:11.420> thermometer<00:00:11.719> this<00:00:12.590> one

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
out of the digital thermometer this one

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.379 
out of the digital thermometer this one
is<00:00:12.920> one<00:00:13.070> of<00:00:13.100> my<00:00:13.250> favorites<00:00:13.639> just<00:00:13.789> because<00:00:13.910> it

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
is one of my favorites just because it

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.730 
is one of my favorites just because it
has<00:00:14.570> the<00:00:14.780> option<00:00:14.930> for<00:00:15.320> a<00:00:15.349> mini<00:00:15.620> Battle<00:00:15.950> City

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
has the option for a mini Battle City

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.950 
has the option for a mini Battle City
that<00:00:17.460> means<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.300> leave<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> probe

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
that means that you can leave the probe

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.630 
that means that you can leave the probe
anywhere<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.650> cage<00:00:19.950> and<00:00:20.189> also<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.610> just

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
anywhere in the cage and also you just

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.779 
anywhere in the cage and also you just
have<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.210> hottest<00:00:22.369> temperature<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.730> I

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
have the hottest temperature that I

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.300 
have the hottest temperature that I
guess<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.450> that<00:00:24.720> particular<00:00:25.230> area<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:26.160> what<00:00:26.279> I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
guess in that particular area so what I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.980 
guess in that particular area so what I
often<00:00:26.669> do<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:27.029> stuff<00:00:27.270> like<00:00:27.300> best<00:00:27.480> friends

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
often do for stuff like best friends

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.760 
often do for stuff like best friends
saying<00:00:28.290> I<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.550> customer<00:00:29.550> variant<00:00:29.939> prefer<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
saying I the customer variant prefer a

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.549 
saying I the customer variant prefer a
very<00:00:32.510> low<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> videos<00:00:34.379> you

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
very low as if you see the videos you

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.100 
very low as if you see the videos you
know<00:00:34.650> that<00:00:34.920> I've<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.129> some<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.489> stuff<00:00:35.960> all<00:00:36.960> of

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
know that I've got some of stuff all of

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.259 
know that I've got some of stuff all of
them<00:00:37.290> know<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.129> exact<00:00:38.610> temperatures<00:00:39.090> that

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
them know the exact temperatures that

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.270 
them know the exact temperatures that
they're<00:00:39.420> reaching<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.930> their<00:00:40.050> enclosure<00:00:40.320> but

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
they're reaching in their enclosure but

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.770 
they're reaching in their enclosure but
this<00:00:41.460> point<00:00:41.730> gets<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.180> while<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:42.750> i

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
this point gets in there while so what i

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.390 
this point gets in there while so what i
do<00:00:42.900> is<00:00:43.050> i<00:00:43.230> smooth<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.589> throw<00:00:43.920> throughout<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
do is i smooth the throw throughout the

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.869 
do is i smooth the throw throughout the
cage<00:00:44.640> I'll<00:00:44.940> leave<00:00:45.199> for<00:00:46.199> one<00:00:46.500> day<00:00:46.680> I'll<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:46.890> I

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
cage I'll leave for one day I'll be I

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.479 
cage I'll leave for one day I'll be I
won't<00:00:48.089> be<00:00:48.239> under<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> fasten<00:00:49.559> spot<00:00:49.830> just

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
won't be under the fasten spot just

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.189 
won't be under the fasten spot just
because<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> basking<00:00:51.239> spot<00:00:51.269> does<00:00:51.839> heat<00:00:52.080> up

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
because the basking spot does heat up

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.450 
because the basking spot does heat up
and<00:00:52.409> it<00:00:52.500> will<00:00:52.650> heat<00:00:52.890> up<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.129> little<00:00:53.309> plastic

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and it will heat up the little plastic

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
and it will heat up the little plastic
probe<00:00:53.970> and<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.360> will<00:00:54.449> give<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.720> false<00:00:55.049> high

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
probe and it will give you a false high

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.740 
probe and it will give you a false high
reading<00:00:55.820> but<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.000> will<00:00:57.180> leave<00:00:57.269> it<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> warm

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
reading but I will leave it on the warm

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.780 
reading but I will leave it on the warm
side<00:00:57.839> just<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.290> check<00:00:58.470> just<00:00:58.710> how<00:00:58.830> hot<00:00:59.100> they<00:00:59.580> get

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
side just to check just how hot they get

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.490 
side just to check just how hot they get
and<00:01:00.089> just<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.629> lowest<00:01:00.900> point<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and just what the lowest point of the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.649 
and just what the lowest point of the
hot<00:01:01.739> side<00:01:01.920> does<00:01:02.339> reach<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.150> also<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
hot side does reach and then also do the

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:11.870 
hot side does reach and then also do the
same<00:01:03.809> thing<00:01:08.659> at<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.260> wrong<00:01:10.530> area<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.670> one

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
same thing at the wrong area this one

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880 
same thing at the wrong area this one
like<00:01:12.390> other<00:01:12.600> digital<00:01:13.170> thermometers<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> does

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
like other digital thermometers it does

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.380 
like other digital thermometers it does
have<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> digital<00:01:14.490> readout<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.970> does<00:01:15.180> go

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
have a digital readout it does go

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.940 
have a digital readout it does go
Celsius<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.229> Fahrenheit

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
Celsius and Fahrenheit

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.429 
Celsius and Fahrenheit
and<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.420> other<00:01:18.720> cool<00:01:18.900> thing<00:01:19.020> about<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.260> is

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
and the other cool thing about it is

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.630 
and the other cool thing about it is
that<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.740> keep<00:01:19.890> all<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.100> wires<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
that you keep all your wires and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.459 
that you keep all your wires and
everything<00:01:20.729> neat<00:01:21.149> and<00:01:21.299> tidy<00:01:21.450> I've<00:01:22.109> got<00:01:22.350> this

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
everything neat and tidy I've got this

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.840 
everything neat and tidy I've got this
little<00:01:22.679> of

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.240 

Ridge<00:01:26.720> on<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.050> bottom<00:01:27.440> that<00:01:27.590> slides<00:01:27.860> into<00:01:28.159> the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
Ridge on the bottom that slides into the

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.300 
Ridge on the bottom that slides into the
top<00:01:28.340> of<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.760> exoteric<00:01:29.090> compact<00:01:29.960> variances<00:01:30.530> so

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
top of the exoteric compact variances so

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.950 
top of the exoteric compact variances so
basically<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:31.790> can<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.120> slide<00:01:32.330> this<00:01:32.570> along

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
basically you can just slide this along

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.650 
basically you can just slide this along
with<00:01:32.990> your<00:01:33.260> hydrometer<00:01:34.510> basically<00:01:35.510> all<00:01:35.630> of

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
with your hydrometer basically all of

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.010 
with your hydrometer basically all of
your<00:01:35.810> cage<00:01:36.770> condition<00:01:37.550> readers<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.150> don't

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
your cage condition readers I don't

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.440 
your cage condition readers I don't
think

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
think

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.760 
think
but<00:01:41.450> anyway<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:41.810> can<00:01:41.930> split<00:01:42.260> them<00:01:42.350> all<00:01:42.500> along

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
but anyway you can split them all along

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.920 
but anyway you can split them all along
the<00:01:42.890> top<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.190> that<00:01:43.250> ranarium<00:01:43.670> hood<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.810> keep

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
the top of that ranarium hood and keep

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.510 
the top of that ranarium hood and keep
them<00:01:45.050> all<00:01:45.200> neat<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.410> tidy<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.860> easily<00:01:46.370> wait

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
them all neat and tidy and easily wait

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.970 
them all neat and tidy and easily wait
to<00:01:46.730> see<00:01:46.970> them<00:01:47.150> so<00:01:47.930> if<00:01:48.140> your<00:01:48.320> should<00:01:48.500> order<00:01:48.800> this

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
to see them so if your should order this

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.590 
to see them so if your should order this
or<00:01:49.220> if<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.400> want<00:01:49.550> to<00:01:49.580> see<00:01:49.700> before<00:01:49.850> new<00:01:50.150> options

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
or if you want to see before new options

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.880 
or if you want to see before new options
that<00:01:50.690> we<00:01:50.810> cross<00:01:51.050> for<00:01:51.530> checking<00:01:51.800> the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
that we cross for checking the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.650 
that we cross for checking the
temperature<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.880> everything<00:01:52.940> in<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.390> area

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
temperature and everything in the area
