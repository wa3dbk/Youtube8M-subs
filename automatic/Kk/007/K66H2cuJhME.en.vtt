don't think we're ever going to get
downloadable<00:02:03.630> content<00:02:03.869> unless<00:02:04.229> our<00:02:04.890> sales

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
downloadable content unless our sales

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.130 
downloadable content unless our sales
numbers<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.969> dramatically<00:02:06.509> increased<00:02:06.930> by

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
numbers just dramatically increased by

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.410 
numbers just dramatically increased by
like<00:02:07.409> two<00:02:07.950> thousand<00:02:08.399> percent<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.910> know

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
like two thousand percent you know

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.260 
like two thousand percent you know
um<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.250> obviously<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.490> sales<00:02:11.700> numbers<00:02:12.090> were

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
um but obviously the sales numbers were

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.150 
um but obviously the sales numbers were
an<00:02:12.390> ideal<00:02:12.690> for<00:02:12.959> both<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.680> all<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.830> companies

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
an ideal for both for all the companies

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.510 
an ideal for both for all the companies
involved<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.330> think<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.520> unfortunately

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
involved and I think that unfortunately

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.339 
involved and I think that unfortunately
as<00:02:17.550> we<00:02:17.910> head<00:02:18.150> towards<00:02:18.510> these<00:02:18.630> newer<00:02:18.989> call<00:02:19.260> of

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
as we head towards these newer call of

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.140 
as we head towards these newer call of
duties<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.650> come<00:02:19.800> out<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.730> know<00:02:20.849> modern

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
duties that come out you know modern

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.910 
duties that come out you know modern
warfare<00:02:21.330> 4<00:02:21.510> or<00:02:21.989> call<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.530> duty<00:02:22.739> ghosts

whatever<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:23.370> going<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.550> be<00:02:23.670> called<00:02:23.880> are<00:02:24.180> we

whatever it's going to be called are we

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.880 
whatever it's going to be called are we
going<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.750> see<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.020> same<00:02:25.200> amount<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.590> support

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
going to see the same amount of support

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.380 
going to see the same amount of support
are<00:02:26.069> we<00:02:26.160> going<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.400> see<00:02:26.550> more<00:02:26.790> are<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.270> gonna

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
are we going to see more are we gonna

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.330 
are we going to see more are we gonna
see<00:02:27.600> less<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.470> think<00:02:28.709> that's<00:02:28.920> gonna<00:02:29.010> be

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
see less and I think that's gonna be

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.550 
see less and I think that's gonna be
interesting<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:30.300> see<00:02:30.510> how<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.840> plays<00:02:30.989> out<00:02:31.260> in

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
interesting to see how that plays out in

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.220 
interesting to see how that plays out in
in<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.100> near<00:02:32.280> future<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.670> guess<00:02:32.790> because<00:02:33.660> with

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
in the near future I guess because with

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.930 
in the near future I guess because with
the<00:02:34.350> new<00:02:34.470> consoles<00:02:34.920> coming<00:02:35.220> out<00:02:35.340> obviously

the new consoles coming out obviously
right<00:02:36.209> now<00:02:36.390> even<00:02:36.720> even<00:02:37.500> though<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.709> Wii<00:02:37.860> U<00:02:38.069> is

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
right now even even though the Wii U is

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.339 
right now even even though the Wii U is
the<00:02:38.340> newest<00:02:38.849> most<00:02:39.090> recent<00:02:39.540> console<00:02:39.900> obviously

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
the newest most recent console obviously

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.410 
the newest most recent console obviously
it's<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> first<00:02:40.890> next<00:02:41.519> gen<00:02:41.640> console<00:02:42.269> out

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
it's the first next gen console out

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.140 
it's the first next gen console out
right<00:02:42.870> now<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:44.310> know<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.550> still<00:02:44.819> doesn't

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
right now you know it still doesn't

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.630 
right now you know it still doesn't
receive<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:46.290> biggest<00:02:46.769> amount<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.370> support

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
receive the biggest amount of support

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.860 
receive the biggest amount of support
when<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:47.910> comes<00:02:48.030> down<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.239> games<00:02:48.510> like<00:02:48.569> Call<00:02:48.840> of

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
when it comes down to games like Call of

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.780 
when it comes down to games like Call of
Duty<00:02:49.140> obviously<00:02:49.620> because<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.190> sales<00:02:50.430> numbers

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
Duty obviously because the sales numbers

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.970 
Duty obviously because the sales numbers
are<00:02:51.000> significantly<00:02:51.600> less<00:02:51.840> but<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.769> should

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
are significantly less but we should

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.620 
are significantly less but we should
still<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.700> my<00:02:53.819> opinion<00:02:54.060> receiving

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
still be in my opinion receiving

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.300 
still be in my opinion receiving
downloadable<00:02:55.140> content<00:02:55.319> we<00:02:55.709> should<00:02:55.890> still<00:02:56.190> be

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
downloadable content we should still be

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.830 
downloadable content we should still be
receiving<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.880> same<00:02:57.000> amount<00:02:57.299> of<00:02:57.330> support<00:02:57.630> as

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
receiving the same amount of support as

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.570 
receiving the same amount of support as
the<00:02:58.019> other<00:02:58.170> consoles<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.830> they're<00:02:59.370> not<00:02:59.519> even

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
the other consoles and they're not even

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.059 
the other consoles and they're not even
technically<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.720> same<00:03:00.930> generation<00:03:01.470> console

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
technically the same generation console

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.340 
technically the same generation console
as<00:03:02.190> us<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:02.640> kind<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:02.880> worries<00:03:03.090> me

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
as us and that kind of worries me

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.930 
as us and that kind of worries me
because<00:03:04.350> when<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.130> new<00:03:05.280> consoles<00:03:05.670> come<00:03:05.819> out

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
because when the new consoles come out

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.610 
because when the new consoles come out
like<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.180> said<00:03:06.390> when<00:03:06.630> we<00:03:06.660> see<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.019> wii<00:03:07.170> u<00:03:07.350> take<00:03:07.560> a

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
like I said when we see the wii u take a

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.009 
like I said when we see the wii u take a
back<00:03:07.920> seat<00:03:07.950> again<00:03:08.519> kind<00:03:09.299> of<00:03:09.390> like<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.660> we<00:03:09.810> did

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
back seat again kind of like the we did

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.110 
back seat again kind of like the we did
when<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.230> comes<00:03:10.440> down<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.620> call<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:10.950> duty<00:03:11.220> you

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
when it comes down to call of duty you

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.000 
when it comes down to call of duty you
know<00:03:12.239> will<00:03:12.480> we<00:03:12.630> not<00:03:12.780> receive<00:03:13.170> patches<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.799> time

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
know will we not receive patches on time

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.099 
know will we not receive patches on time
where<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.370> kind<00:03:14.579> of<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:14.940> slowly<00:03:15.180> drop<00:03:15.930> off

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
where we kind of just slowly drop off

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.780 
where we kind of just slowly drop off
the<00:03:16.260> radar<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.829> that's<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.370> thing<00:03:17.519> like<00:03:17.670> i

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
the radar and that's the thing like i

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.849 
the radar and that's the thing like i
said<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.000> worries<00:03:18.329> me<00:03:18.359> and<00:03:18.739> even<00:03:19.739> the

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
said that worries me and even the

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.590 
said that worries me and even the
biggest<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.609> biggest<00:03:20.760> question<00:03:21.359> in<00:03:21.480> my<00:03:21.570> mind

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
biggest the biggest question in my mind

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.569 
biggest the biggest question in my mind
is<00:03:22.049> if<00:03:22.320> they<00:03:22.620> are<00:03:22.799> even<00:03:23.100> going<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.340> make

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
is if they are even going to make

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.580 
is if they are even going to make
another<00:03:24.090> call<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.480> duty<00:03:24.750> for<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.109> wii<00:03:25.230> u<00:03:25.410> and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
another call of duty for the wii u and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.979 
another call of duty for the wii u and
at<00:03:26.040> first<00:03:26.190> i<00:03:26.400> might<00:03:26.609> seem<00:03:26.850> like<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> stupid<00:03:27.720> idea

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
at first i might seem like a stupid idea

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.170 
at first i might seem like a stupid idea
or<00:03:28.410> whatever<00:03:28.680> but<00:03:28.920> i<00:03:29.130> think<00:03:29.609> in<00:03:29.730> my<00:03:29.850> opinion<00:03:29.880> is

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
or whatever but i think in my opinion is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.880 
or whatever but i think in my opinion is
definitely<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.630> possibility<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.380> they<00:03:31.709> will

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
definitely a possibility that they will

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.009 
definitely a possibility that they will
not<00:03:32.250> make<00:03:32.489> another<00:03:32.850> call<00:03:33.299> of<00:03:33.390> duty<00:03:33.570> title<00:03:33.930> on

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
not make another call of duty title on

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.530 
not make another call of duty title on
the<00:03:34.109> wii<00:03:34.230> u<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.820> it<00:03:35.820> might<00:03:35.970> be<00:03:36.120> for<00:03:36.359> a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the wii u and it might be for a

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.270 
the wii u and it might be for a
different<00:03:36.989> amount<00:03:37.320> of<00:03:37.500> reasons<00:03:37.829> but<00:03:37.890> i<00:03:38.040> think

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
different amount of reasons but i think

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.099 
different amount of reasons but i think
it<00:03:38.370> all<00:03:38.489> comes<00:03:38.609> down<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.910> sales<00:03:39.299> numbers<00:03:39.660> they

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
it all comes down to sales numbers they

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.800 
it all comes down to sales numbers they
might<00:03:40.410> kind<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.100> see<00:03:41.579> where<00:03:41.850> black<00:03:42.060> ops<00:03:42.269> 2<00:03:42.480> ends

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
might kind of see where black ops 2 ends

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.110 
might kind of see where black ops 2 ends
up<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.109> terms<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.470> sales<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:44.340> know<00:03:44.370> if<00:03:44.609> they

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
up in terms of sales you know if they

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.479 
up in terms of sales you know if they
even<00:03:45.150> be<00:03:45.630> more<00:03:45.690> worthy<00:03:46.109> enough<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.410> even<00:03:46.709> start

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
even be more worthy enough to even start

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.130 
even be more worthy enough to even start
making<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.150> other<00:03:48.359> game<00:03:48.570> for<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.840> Wii<00:03:48.959> U<00:03:49.109> or

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
making the other game for the Wii U or

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.620 
making the other game for the Wii U or
porting<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.739> whatever<00:03:50.010> they<00:03:50.160> do<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:51.180> what

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
porting it whatever they do and what

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.780 
porting it whatever they do and what
kind<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:53.010> know<00:03:53.040> just<00:03:53.280> have<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.549> play<00:03:53.760> it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
kind of you know just have to play it

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.509 
kind of you know just have to play it
out<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.030> mean<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.390> hope<00:03:54.780> we<00:03:54.989> do<00:03:55.140> get<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.680> new<00:03:55.920> you

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
out I mean I hope we do get a new you

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.270 
out I mean I hope we do get a new you
know<00:03:56.640> call<00:03:56.850> duty<00:03:57.060> obviously<00:03:57.780> but<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:59.040> know<00:03:59.160> if

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
know call duty obviously but you know if

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.190 
know call duty obviously but you know if
the<00:03:59.459> sales<00:03:59.819> numbers<00:04:00.180> continue<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:00.810> they<00:04:00.989> are

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
the sales numbers continue like they are

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.220 
the sales numbers continue like they are
they<00:04:01.590> probably<00:04:01.980> won't<00:04:02.690> be<00:04:03.690> in<00:04:03.959> that

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
they probably won't be in that

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.229 
they probably won't be in that
interested<00:04:04.829> in<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.040> wii<00:04:05.190> u<00:04:05.340> version<00:04:05.579> so<00:04:06.000> we

interested in the wii u version so we

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.780 
interested in the wii u version so we
might<00:04:06.480> receive<00:04:06.810> kind<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.920> crappy<00:04:08.370> port<00:04:08.609> we

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
might receive kind of a crappy port we

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.610 
might receive kind of a crappy port we
might<00:04:08.970> not<00:04:09.150> receive<00:04:09.450> one<00:04:09.660> at<00:04:09.780> all<00:04:09.930> or<00:04:10.470> we<00:04:10.590> might

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
might not receive one at all or we might

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.710 
might not receive one at all or we might
receive<00:04:11.280> one<00:04:11.670> like<00:04:11.819> black<00:04:12.030> ops<00:04:12.239> 2<00:04:12.420> where<00:04:12.569> is

and all that kind of stuff but later on

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.740 
and all that kind of stuff but later on
this<00:04:20.820> year<00:04:20.880> when<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.209> new<00:04:21.299> Call<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.539> Duty

this year when the new Call of Duty
comes<00:04:21.930> out<00:04:22.109> i<00:04:22.140> think<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.530> other

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
comes out i think the other

comes out i think the other
consoles<00:04:23.189> will<00:04:23.370> be<00:04:23.520> coming<00:04:23.729> out<00:04:23.939> as<00:04:24.120> well

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.179 
consoles will be coming out as well
around<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.870> same<00:04:25.050> time<00:04:25.080> kind<00:04:25.560> of<00:04:25.620> like<00:04:25.680> black

00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:26.189 
around the same time kind of like black

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:27.950 
around the same time kind of like black
ops<00:04:26.370> 2<00:04:26.550> did<00:04:26.729> with<00:04:26.879> the<00:04:26.969> wii<00:04:27.120> u<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.479> with<00:04:27.870> the
