I'm<00:01:29.729> taking<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.090> gather<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:31.470> build<00:01:31.680> up<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> size

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
I'm taking a gather to build up the size

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.460 
I'm taking a gather to build up the size
of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> piece<00:01:32.720> okay<00:01:33.720> after<00:01:33.869> I've<00:01:34.110> taken<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
of the piece okay after I've taken a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.649 
of the piece okay after I've taken a
couple<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.770> gathers<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.549> blown<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.150> I'm

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
couple of gathers and blown it out I'm

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.109 
couple of gathers and blown it out I'm
gonna<00:01:36.810> elongate<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.829> then<00:01:38.040> I'll<00:01:38.159> push<00:01:39.090> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
gonna elongate it and then I'll push it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.810 
gonna elongate it and then I'll push it
into<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.659> an<00:01:40.409> optic<00:01:40.799> mold<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.340> blow<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.700> out

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
into a an optic mold and blow it out

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.990 
into a an optic mold and blow it out
it's<00:01:42.270> made<00:01:42.570> out<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.890> steel<00:01:43.890> straps<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.939> are

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
it's made out of steel straps that are

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.429 
it's made out of steel straps that are
welded<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> base<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.399> looks<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
welded to a base and it looks like a

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.639 
welded to a base and it looks like a
organic<00:01:49.439> pumpkin<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.659> blow<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.869> piece<00:01:52.079> into<00:01:52.500> it

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
organic pumpkin I blow the piece into it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.730 
organic pumpkin I blow the piece into it
as<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.250> piece<00:01:53.399> blows<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.180> makes<00:01:54.899> these<00:01:55.110> ridges

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
as the piece blows it makes these ridges

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.030 
as the piece blows it makes these ridges
and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.310> I'm<00:01:56.610> gonna<00:01:56.820> twist<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.509> turn<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.320> make

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and then I'm gonna twist it turn it make

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.280 
and then I'm gonna twist it turn it make
patterns<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.790> capture<00:02:00.540> bubbles<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
patterns in it capture bubbles in it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.010 
patterns in it capture bubbles in it
which<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:02.640> responsible<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.780> final

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
which are responsible for the final

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.590 
which are responsible for the final
patterns<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> piece<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.670> vortex

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
patterns and the piece in the vortex

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.050 
patterns and the piece in the vortex
piece<00:02:07.079> I'm<00:02:07.320> going<00:02:07.649> back<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.890> forth<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.879> piece

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
piece I'm going back and forth the piece

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.620 
piece I'm going back and forth the piece
needs<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.539> stay

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
needs to stay

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.870 
needs to stay
above<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.290> thousand<00:02:11.710> degrees<00:02:12.010> otherwise<00:02:12.550> it's

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
above a thousand degrees otherwise it's

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.060 
above a thousand degrees otherwise it's
gonna<00:02:13.000> break<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.540> me<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.900> force<00:02:14.500> all<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.890> air

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
gonna break on me and force all the air

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.280 
gonna break on me and force all the air
out<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.520> I'm<00:02:15.730> constantly<00:02:16.360> reheating<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.170> in

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
out of it I'm constantly reheating it in

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.370 
out of it I'm constantly reheating it in

once I've got that pretty much in shape

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.740 
once I've got that pretty much in shape
flatten<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.640> bottom<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.240> then<00:03:07.450> I'm<00:03:07.570> ready

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
flatten the bottom and then I'm ready

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.460 
flatten the bottom and then I'm ready
for<00:03:08.080> what<00:03:08.260> they<00:03:08.380> call<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.740> punty<00:03:09.130> Bundy<00:03:09.610> is<00:03:09.820> a

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.650 

and<00:03:20.390> break<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:21.320> off<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:21.860> that<00:03:21.890> I<00:03:22.070> can<00:03:22.400> now<00:03:23.270> form

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
and break it off so that I can now form

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.170

the lip of the piece this is the part

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.870 
the lip of the piece this is the part
that<00:03:32.680> probably<00:03:33.680> paid<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.070> most<00:03:34.280> attention<00:03:34.850> to

is getting the shape exactly right I
like<00:03:37.670> that

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
like that

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.350 
like that

closer to the end shaping the lip

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.950 
closer to the end shaping the lip
working<00:04:55.010> it<00:04:55.220> making<00:04:55.760> it<00:04:55.880> larger<00:04:56.120> than

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
working it making it larger than

working it making it larger than
alternately<00:04:57.770> making<00:04:58.190> it<00:04:58.280> larger<00:04:58.460> and

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
alternately making it larger and

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.050 
alternately making it larger and
squeezing<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.110> down<00:05:00.370> getting<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.670> just<00:05:01.910> the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
squeezing it down getting it to just the

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.910 
squeezing it down getting it to just the
right<00:05:02.240> size<00:05:02.540> getting<00:05:03.200> all<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.560> proportions

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
right size getting all the proportions

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.950 
right size getting all the proportions
just<00:05:04.310> right

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.890 

and<00:05:10.710> then<00:05:11.250> right<00:05:11.610> at<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:11.850> end<00:05:12.030> I've<00:05:12.270> got<00:05:12.300> the

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
and then right at the end I've got the

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:21.129 
and then right at the end I've got the
finished<00:05:13.229> piece

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.959 

the<00:05:22.139> piece<00:05:22.319> then<00:05:22.589> has<00:05:22.829> to<00:05:23.069> go<00:05:23.099> into<00:05:23.639> an<00:05:23.789> oven

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969 
the piece then has to go into an oven

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.779 
the piece then has to go into an oven
that's<00:05:24.149> heated<00:05:24.839> up<00:05:24.989> to<00:05:25.110> 960<00:05:25.769> degrees<00:05:26.429> and

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
that's heated up to 960 degrees and

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.659 
that's heated up to 960 degrees and
it'll<00:05:26.939> stay<00:05:27.269> there<00:05:27.569> coming<00:05:28.469> down<00:05:28.709> slowly<00:05:29.219> over

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
it'll stay there coming down slowly over

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:37.780 
it'll stay there coming down slowly over
the<00:05:29.759> next<00:05:29.939> 24<00:05:30.479> hours

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
I will end up with another addition to

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.830 
I will end up with another addition to
the<00:05:42.250> series<00:05:43.250> that<00:05:43.760> I<00:05:43.790> call<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.360> vortex

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
the series that I call the vortex

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:53.879 
the series that I call the vortex
