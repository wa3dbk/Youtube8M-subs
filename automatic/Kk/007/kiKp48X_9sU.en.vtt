about<00:00:43.140> distance<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.600> rotation<00:00:46.070> if<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:48.030> stand

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
about distance and rotation if I stand

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.819 
about distance and rotation if I stand
here<00:00:49.070> this<00:00:50.070> far<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.579> target<00:00:51.649> this<00:00:52.649> is

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
here this far from that target this is

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.189 
here this far from that target this is
what<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> call<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.640> harp<00:00:54.270> toss<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.930> harp

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
what I call a harp toss the harp

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.740 
what I call a harp toss the harp
rotation<00:00:55.890> that's<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.520> half<00:00:56.730> rotation<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.570> only

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
rotation that's a half rotation it only

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.410 
rotation that's a half rotation it only
turned<00:00:58.350> half<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.890> time<00:00:59.870> now<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.079> go<00:01:01.320> back<00:01:01.350> here

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
turned half a time now I go back here

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.960 
turned half a time now I go back here
now<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.690> my<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:04.769> my<00:01:04.949> height<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.760> like

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
now in my for my height and this like

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
now in my for my height and this like
the<00:01:06.150> knife<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.659> good<00:01:07.200> distance<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:07.799> this

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the knife a good distance from this

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.230 
the knife a good distance from this
target<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:09.000> three<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> my<00:01:09.659> steps<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.380> two

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
target here is three of my steps one two

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.320 
target here is three of my steps one two
three<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.860> foot<00:01:14.159> that's<00:01:14.640> that's<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
three and one more foot that's that's a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.960 
three and one more foot that's that's a
workout<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:17.130> i'm<00:01:17.549> at<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
workout so then you now i'm at the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.539 
workout so then you now i'm at the
distance<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> complete<00:01:19.140> rotation<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
distance for a complete rotation and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.200 
distance for a complete rotation and
this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.909> how<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.180> goes<00:01:22.700> one<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:26.060> it's<00:01:27.060> not

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
this is how it goes one this it's not

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.770 
this is how it goes one this it's not
bad<00:01:27.420> grouping<00:01:27.869> yes<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:29.240> now<00:01:30.240> let's<00:01:30.420> do<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> bit

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
bad grouping yes so now let's do a bit

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.410 
bad grouping yes so now let's do a bit
of<00:01:30.810> speed<00:01:31.619> tossing<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.670> let's<00:01:32.850> make<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.030> five

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
of speed tossing so let's make it five

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.130 
of speed tossing so let's make it five
of<00:01:33.689> them<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.619> here<00:01:34.890> faster<00:01:35.490> than<00:01:35.520> throw<00:01:36.140> I've

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
of them and here faster than throw I've

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.410 
of them and here faster than throw I've
got<00:01:37.409> my<00:01:37.590> five<00:01:37.860> knives<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.670> hold<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.119> bunch

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
got my five knives here you hold a bunch

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.109 
got my five knives here you hold a bunch
in<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.780> hand<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.970> idea

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
in one hand like that and then the idea

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.469 
in one hand like that and then the idea
is<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> balance<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:45.270> here

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
is to have a bit of balance going here

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.230 
is to have a bit of balance going here
put<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.899> leg<00:01:46.140> forward<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.799> then<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
put that leg forward and then it's a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
put that leg forward and then it's a
toss<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.649> releasing<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
toss like this and you're releasing the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.609 
toss like this and you're releasing the
knife<00:01:50.810> actually<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.170> shouldn't<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.590> called

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
knife actually it shouldn't be called

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.859 
knife actually it shouldn't be called
knife<00:01:53.070> throwing<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.970> should<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.329> called<00:01:54.540> knife

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
knife throwing it should be called knife

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.080 
knife throwing it should be called knife
releasing<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.369> sounds<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> bit<00:01:56.850> lame

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
releasing but that sounds a bit lame

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:09.370 
releasing but that sounds a bit lame
doesn't<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.719> throwing<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.829> key

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.210 

don't<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:10.530> love<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.800> sound<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:14.040> might

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
don't you love that sound you might

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.180 
don't you love that sound you might
notice<00:02:14.490> with<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:16.380> was<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> good<00:02:16.890> toss

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
notice with this that was a good toss

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.420 
notice with this that was a good toss
because<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.180> ran<00:02:18.570> true<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.860> wasn't<00:02:20.220> too<00:02:20.400> bad

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
because it ran true that wasn't too bad

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.550 
because it ran true that wasn't too bad

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
just a half handle like that now if you

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.640
