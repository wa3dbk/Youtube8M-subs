might be thinking that I'm absolutely

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
might be thinking that I'm absolutely
out<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.760> mind<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> makes<00:01:09.450> no<00:01:09.659> sense<00:01:09.930> at

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
out of my mind and it makes no sense at

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.620 
out of my mind and it makes no sense at
all<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.220> truly<00:01:11.520> feel<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.180> sound<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
all but I truly feel that the sound that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
all but I truly feel that the sound that
the<00:01:12.840> hitmarker<00:01:13.409> makes<00:01:13.710> when<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.220> get<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> hit

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the hitmarker makes when you get a hit

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.679 
the hitmarker makes when you get a hit
actually<00:01:15.979> helps<00:01:16.979> helps<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.150> release<00:01:18.540> of

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
actually helps helps with the release of

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.840 
actually helps helps with the release of
adrenaline<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.350> helps<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.280> feel<00:01:20.580> more

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
adrenaline and helps you feel more

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.960 
adrenaline and helps you feel more
satisfied<00:01:21.330> when<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.320> kill<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
satisfied when you get that kill and

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.010 
satisfied when you get that kill and
yeah<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.330> lot<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.570> people<00:01:24.659> are<00:01:24.900> probably

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
yeah I know a lot of people are probably

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.499 
yeah I know a lot of people are probably
gonna<00:01:25.259> say<00:01:25.470> I'm<00:01:25.560> crazy<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.400> feel<00:01:27.299> that's

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
gonna say I'm crazy but I feel that's

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.289 
gonna say I'm crazy but I feel that's
the<00:01:27.720> case<00:01:27.920> with<00:01:28.920> Infinity<00:01:29.880> Ward<00:01:30.060> games

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the case with Infinity Ward games

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.210 
the case with Infinity Ward games
specifically<00:01:31.079> ghost<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:31.740> I'm<00:01:31.829> thinking

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
specifically ghost is what I'm thinking

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.609 
specifically ghost is what I'm thinking
of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:33.329> hit<00:01:33.479> marker<00:01:33.750> sound<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> pretty

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
of the hit marker sound is pretty

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.410 
of the hit marker sound is pretty
underwhelming<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.310> barely<00:01:35.520> even<00:01:35.759> notice<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
underwhelming you barely even notice it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.660 
underwhelming you barely even notice it

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
very pronounced it doesn't stand out at

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.700 
very pronounced it doesn't stand out at
all<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.340> feel<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.810> when<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.840> get<00:01:43.110> hit<00:01:43.380> it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
all and I feel like when you get hit it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.990 
all and I feel like when you get hit it
doesn't<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.189> don't<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.520> feel<00:01:44.759> anything

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000

doesn't you don't really feel anything
there's<00:01:45.329> no<00:01:45.390> adrenaline<00:01:46.020> release<00:01:46.170> whereas<00:01:47.130> in

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
there's no adrenaline release whereas in

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.219 
there's no adrenaline release whereas in
black<00:01:47.460> ops<00:01:47.670> 2<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.360> kind<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.869> thud

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
black ops 2 it's kind of like a thud

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.469 
black ops 2 it's kind of like a thud
sound<00:01:49.530> when<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> hitmarker<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.759> every

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
sound when you get a hitmarker and every

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.030 
sound when you get a hitmarker and every
time<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.110> those<00:01:52.229> hit<00:01:52.470> markers<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
time I get one of those hit markers I

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.219 
time I get one of those hit markers I
get<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.820> little<00:01:54.000> adrenaline<00:01:54.420> rush<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.079> me

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
get that little adrenaline rush in me

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.749 
get that little adrenaline rush in me
and<00:01:55.380> then<00:01:55.530> when<00:01:55.710> i<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.159> five<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.729> row

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
and then when i get like five in a row

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.149 
and then when i get like five in a row
to<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> kill<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.990> feels<00:01:58.380> great<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.009> feels

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
to get a kill that feels great it feels

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.520 
to get a kill that feels great it feels
awesome<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.659> advanced<00:02:01.020> warfare<00:02:01.350> I'd

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
awesome so in advanced warfare I'd

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.679 
awesome so in advanced warfare I'd
really<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.549> new<00:02:02.909> hitmarker<00:02:03.450> sound

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
really like to see a new hitmarker sound

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.910 
really like to see a new hitmarker sound
which<00:02:03.869> I'm<00:02:03.990> sure<00:02:04.200> there<00:02:04.380> will<00:02:04.409> be<00:02:04.560> because

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
which I'm sure there will be because

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770 
which I'm sure there will be because
they<00:02:05.040> are<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> whole<00:02:05.549> new<00:02:05.729> studio<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.420> they<00:02:06.719> do

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
they are a whole new studio and they do

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.809 
they are a whole new studio and they do
have<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.110> new<00:02:07.380> sound<00:02:07.979> design<00:02:08.310> team<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
have that new sound design team and

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.940 
have that new sound design team and
they're<00:02:09.629> probably<00:02:09.780> working<00:02:10.200> everything<00:02:10.619> from

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
they're probably working everything from

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.979 
they're probably working everything from
scratch<00:02:11.160> as<00:02:11.430> far<00:02:11.580> as<00:02:11.670> sound<00:02:11.849> design<00:02:12.209> goes<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
scratch as far as sound design goes so

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.850 
scratch as far as sound design goes so
I'm<00:02:13.110> confident

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I'm confident

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.260 
I'm confident
we'll<00:02:14.040> have<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> new<00:02:14.460> hitmarker<00:02:14.910> sound<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.240> I

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
we'll have a new hitmarker sound but I

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.510 
we'll have a new hitmarker sound but I
hope<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.690> something<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.590> really

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
hope it's something that is really

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.850 
hope it's something that is really
pronounced<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.360> easy<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.870> hear<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.380> also

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
pronounced and easy to hear and also

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.260 
pronounced and easy to hear and also
helps<00:02:20.310> with<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.490> release<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.180> adrenaline

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
helps with that release of adrenaline

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.470 
helps with that release of adrenaline
and<00:02:21.780> again<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.770> could<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.100> completely<00:02:23.460> off<00:02:24.060> on

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
and again I could be completely off on

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.510 
and again I could be completely off on
this<00:02:24.660> one<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.350> feel<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:25.890> I'm<00:02:26.130> correct

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
this one but I feel like I'm correct

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.790 
this one but I feel like I'm correct

hitmarker<00:02:35.640> sound<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.090> ghosts<00:02:36.480> maybe<00:02:36.720> I'll

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
hitmarker sound and ghosts maybe I'll

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.240 
hitmarker sound and ghosts maybe I'll
even<00:02:36.900> throw<00:02:37.080> black<00:02:37.410> ops<00:02:37.620> 1<00:02:37.710> in<00:02:37.920> there<00:02:38.040> I'm<00:02:38.130> not
