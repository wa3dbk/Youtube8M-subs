00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.970
 first we will access the search engine 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.850
 and we will put the page that we are going to 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.850
 access that is the following 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:02.750
 the open cycle dot org 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.750
 we click and link to the page 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.890
 that in this is one of the pages that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.580
 contain some resources and programs 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.440
 that teachers can apply in their 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.960
 classes according to different 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.720
 subjects for example we have 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.900
 math spanish sciences 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.760
 sincÃ© social culture and learn more 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.760
 we click on resources 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.820
 here has the two levels in primary and 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.330
 secondary we will give you in 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.330
 primary 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.939
 It will already give us the selection of 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.439
 primary education and we're going towards 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.439
 down to page 2 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.619
 on this page we will find the 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.820
 next title cycles of nature 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.820
 we click there 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.940
 now down in april 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.210
 in this tool shows us the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.300
 cycles of nature both the cycle 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.920
 of water as the carbon cycle 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.920
 let's see the introduction 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.480
 on our planet earth there are substances 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.750
 like water and carbon that allow 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.390
 life these substances we find them 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.520
 in the air the earth and the sea 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.510
 three quarters of the surface of 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.020
 the earth are covered by water 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.570
 in almost all parts of the planet earth 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.030
 water and carbon are changing 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.650
 permanently both in form and 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.510
 place 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.180
 these changes constitute a cycle 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.790
 because they leave in a way and return to 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.099
 it 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.260
 it is important that we know the cycle 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.730
 of water and the carbon cycle because 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.730
 they are necessary for life 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.459
 part of cycles 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.769
 nature carefully observes the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.840
 scenario identifies what is part 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.000
 of the water cycle and what is part 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.560
 of the carbon cycle and drag their 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.629
 chips to the areas that they 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.519
 correspond remember that there may be 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.880
 different numbers of chips for each 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.810
 cycle 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.940
 now we give in continue 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.690
 as we will see in this resource 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.750
 we will use the audio the video and the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.840
 images in addition to the interaction by 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.930
 course in this game consists by 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.569
 example of relating these components 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.680
 towards whether they correspond to the water cycle 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.680
 or the carbon cycle 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.260
 now we will review it 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.260
 we are here to review 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.560
 you have correctly identified what 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.110
 part of the water cycle and what 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.210
 part of the carbon beam cycle 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.269
 click on the browse button returns to 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:21.410
 Start to perform another activity 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:24.500
 we can return to start 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.480
 and perform the next game explore 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.060
 the next shields from the cycle of 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.400
 water now practice your knowledge in 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.250
 this game pay attention to what happens 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.020
 in the landscape and responds correctly to 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.550
 the questions with the options that you 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.550
 will present below the stage 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.610
 what happened in heaven what 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.450
 transformation suffer the water for 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.450
 form clouds 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.380
 very well evaporation is the process 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.610
 whereby the water changes to 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.610
 gaseous liquid state 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.690
 now let's go the carbon cycle 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:12.129
 the carbon cycle consists of 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:12.849
 forms and processes the carbon is 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.419
 found in nature 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:19.089
 mainly in four dioxide forms 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.150
 carbon animal plants and 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:23.820
 fossil fuels 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.190
 the processes are the transformations of 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.130
 state-to-state and they can be grouped into 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.680
 three those that produce carbon dioxide 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.440
 as breathing decomposition and 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.540
 combustion those that use dioxide 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.940
 of carbon such as photosynthesis and 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.340
 oil formation if you want to know 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.350
 more about the carbon beam cycle 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.350
 click on the different forms and processes 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.939
 breathing 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:58.939
 here comes a brief explanation of 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:01.089
 all the processes let's go to start another 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:01.089
 time 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.700
 finally when they access all the 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.000
 games 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.460
 comes this that says solve the mystery 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.610
 solve the mystery you know the cycle 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.919
 of water and the carbon cycle 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.469
 now have fun solving the mystery 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.659
 place the labels of the shapes and 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:23.150
 processes of both the water cycle and 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:26.349
 of the carbon cycle in its place what 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.349
 so fast you can do it 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.280
 here 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.050
 finally they are going to link the 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.540
 learnings from both the cycle of 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.140
 carbon as the water cycle and this 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.140
 it would be everything
