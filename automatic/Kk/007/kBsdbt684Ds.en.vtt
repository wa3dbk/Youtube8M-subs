polishes i am choosing to new phone nail

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.460 
polishes i am choosing to new phone nail
polishes<00:01:44.189> because<00:01:44.670> i<00:01:45.060> can't<00:01:45.840> find<00:01:46.110> anything

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470

like<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.270> drugstore<00:01:48.649> period<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
like this in the drugstore period and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.050 
like this in the drugstore period and
the<00:01:50.460> two<00:01:50.670> colors<00:01:50.970> i'm<00:01:51.329> choosing<00:01:51.810> our<00:01:52.700> 52<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the two colors i'm choosing our 52 and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.310 
the two colors i'm choosing our 52 and
51<00:01:54.720> i<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:55.200> both<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.470> these<00:01:55.829> are<00:01:56.100> fabulous

51 i think both of these are fabulous
this<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.829> Clarence<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.729> it's

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
this is just like Clarence I think it's

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.429 
this is just like Clarence I think it's
two-thirty<00:02:01.250> except<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.930> flakies<00:02:03.930> are<00:02:04.200> bigger

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
two-thirty except the flakies are bigger

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.200 
two-thirty except the flakies are bigger
in<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> own<00:02:05.729> both<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.409> love<00:02:07.409> both

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
in this one I own both I love both

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.500 
in this one I own both I love both
there's<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.960> one<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.320> this<00:02:10.920> next<00:02:11.220> one<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.550> 52

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
there's that one and this next one is 52
