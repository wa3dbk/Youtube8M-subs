00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
a hanging breaking ball is definitely

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.480 
a hanging breaking ball is definitely
not<00:04:30.820> not<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:32.080> good<00:04:32.560> thing<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.130> do<00:04:35.160> that<00:04:36.160> change

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
not not a good thing to do that change

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.540 
not not a good thing to do that change
it<00:04:36.640> was<00:04:36.760> just<00:04:36.970> so<00:04:37.180> nasty<00:04:37.450> a<00:04:37.720> circle<00:04:38.050> change<00:04:38.230> is

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.680 
it was just so nasty a circle change is
definitely<00:04:39.550> one<00:04:39.670> of<00:04:39.700> my<00:04:39.790> favorite<00:04:40.180> change<00:04:40.420> ups

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
definitely one of my favorite change ups

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.240 
definitely one of my favorite change ups
to<00:04:41.320> throw<00:04:43.350> because<00:04:44.350> it<00:04:44.500> runs<00:04:44.740> away<00:04:44.860> from<00:04:44.980> a

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
to throw because it runs away from a

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.940 
to throw because it runs away from a
lefty<00:04:45.669> and<00:04:45.940> it<00:04:46.390> comes<00:04:46.600> in<00:04:46.780> on<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:46.960> righty<00:04:47.290> I<00:04:47.620> mean

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
lefty and it comes in on a righty I mean

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.330 
lefty and it comes in on a righty I mean
an<00:04:48.340> 85<00:04:48.820> mile<00:04:49.090> an<00:04:49.180> hour<00:04:49.240> screwball<00:04:49.870> is<00:04:50.340> pretty

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
an 85 mile an hour screwball is pretty

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.780 
an 85 mile an hour screwball is pretty
difficult<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.820> hit<00:04:53.250> there<00:04:54.250> we<00:04:54.340> go<00:04:54.520> with<00:04:54.669> the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
difficult to hit there we go with the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.690 
difficult to hit there we go with the
heater<00:04:55.030> -<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:58.200> with<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.290> high<00:04:59.500> heat<00:04:59.950> very

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
heater - and with a high heat very

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.850 
heater - and with a high heat very
difficult<00:05:01.300> to<00:05:01.390> get<00:05:01.540> on<00:05:01.690> top<00:05:01.960> of<00:05:02.020> a<00:05:02.290> pitch<00:05:02.560> when

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
difficult to get on top of a pitch when

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.890 
difficult to get on top of a pitch when
it's<00:05:03.040> coming<00:05:03.370> in<00:05:03.490> that<00:05:03.669> high<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:04.270> think<00:05:04.690> we

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
it's coming in that high I think we

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.340 
it's coming in that high I think we
should<00:05:05.050> go<00:05:05.140> back<00:05:05.410> with<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.710> high<00:05:07.080> you<00:05:08.080> just

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
should go back with the high you just

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.140 
should go back with the high you just
can't<00:05:08.680> get<00:05:08.890> your<00:05:09.070> hands<00:05:09.550> up<00:05:09.669> there<00:05:09.820> fast

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
can't get your hands up there fast

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.170 
can't get your hands up there fast
enough<00:05:10.390> to<00:05:10.690> stay<00:05:10.960> on<00:05:10.990> top<00:05:11.440> ball<00:05:12.130> three<00:05:12.669> here<00:05:13.000> is

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
enough to stay on top ball three here is

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.210 
enough to stay on top ball three here is
that<00:05:13.360> yeah<00:05:13.630> we<00:05:13.780> ran<00:05:13.930> it<00:05:14.110> fool

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
that yeah we ran it fool

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.770 
that yeah we ran it fool
one<00:05:15.430> out<00:05:15.610> let's<00:05:15.880> see<00:05:16.060> if<00:05:16.120> they're<00:05:16.540> not<00:05:16.690> gonna

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
one out let's see if they're not gonna

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.590 
one out let's see if they're not gonna
send<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.110> runner<00:05:17.290> it's<00:05:17.470> got<00:05:17.620> 33<00:05:18.280> speed<00:05:18.610> one

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
send the runner it's got 33 speed one

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.760 
send the runner it's got 33 speed one
stealing<00:05:22.020> he's<00:05:23.020> a<00:05:23.050> little<00:05:23.350> late<00:05:23.440> on<00:05:23.620> that

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
stealing he's a little late on that

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:32.550 
stealing he's a little late on that
pitch<00:05:28.050> let's<00:05:29.050> try<00:05:29.260> with<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.440> curve<00:05:31.560> could

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
pitch let's try with the curve could

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.540 
pitch let's try with the curve could
this<00:05:32.710> be<00:05:32.950> a<00:05:32.979> BB<00:05:33.580> -<00:05:33.960> there<00:05:34.960> we<00:05:35.169> go

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
this be a BB - there we go

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.910 
this be a BB - there we go
in<00:05:36.640> time<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.540> just<00:05:37.810> like<00:05:38.050> that<00:05:38.350> this<00:05:38.590> side<00:05:38.890> is

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
in time and just like that this side is

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.020 
in time and just like that this side is
4-6-3<00:05:39.930> DPX<00:05:40.930> what<00:05:41.440> I'd<00:05:41.530> like<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:41.650> see<00:05:41.920> get<00:05:42.910> out

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
4-6-3 DPX what I'd like to see get out

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.860 
4-6-3 DPX what I'd like to see get out
of<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:43.300> jam<00:05:43.600> the<00:05:44.290> three<00:05:44.560> of<00:05:44.680> us<00:05:44.770> are<00:05:44.980> back<00:05:47.790> and

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
of the jam the three of us are back and

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.840 
of the jam the three of us are back and
that<00:05:49.870> is<00:05:50.080> the<00:05:50.110> game<00:05:50.530> we<00:05:50.920> pitched<00:05:51.220> one<00:05:51.610> inning

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
that is the game we pitched one inning

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.080 
that is the game we pitched one inning
we<00:05:52.240> have<00:05:52.360> one<00:05:52.600> strikeout<00:05:54.150> one<00:05:55.150> hit<00:05:55.450> so<00:05:55.930> I<00:05:57.090> think

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
we have one strikeout one hit so I think

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.370 
we have one strikeout one hit so I think
that<00:05:58.330> was<00:05:58.420> pretty<00:05:58.630> successful<00:05:58.840> I<00:05:59.140> think<00:05:59.170> we

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
that was pretty successful I think we

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.910 
that was pretty successful I think we
should<00:05:59.530> offer<00:05:59.680> displayed<00:06:00.430> our<00:06:00.580> talents<00:06:01.920> with

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
should offer displayed our talents with

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.280 
should offer displayed our talents with
