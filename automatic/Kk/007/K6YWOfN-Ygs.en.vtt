screws<00:01:43.790> that<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.090> can<00:01:44.240> take<00:01:44.420> out<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.780> do<00:01:44.869> the

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
screws that you can take out to do the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.210 
screws that you can take out to do the
alignments<00:01:45.560> of<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.710> replacement<00:01:46.369> panels

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
panels look to be pretty close they are

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.350 
panels look to be pretty close they are
physically<00:01:51.369> just<00:01:52.369> a<00:01:52.490> little<00:01:52.700> bit<00:01:52.820> smaller<00:01:53.149> in

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
physically just a little bit smaller in

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.840 
physically just a little bit smaller in
size<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:54.740> can<00:01:54.860> pick<00:01:55.040> that<00:01:55.070> up<00:01:55.220> on<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.549> video

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
size you can pick that up on the video

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.310 
size you can pick that up on the video
here<00:01:56.119> or<00:01:56.240> not<00:01:56.390> but<00:01:57.040> physically<00:01:58.040> they<00:01:58.189> are<00:01:58.219> just

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
here or not but physically they are just

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
here or not but physically they are just
ever<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:00.590> slightly<00:02:00.619> smaller<00:02:01.430> in<00:02:01.700> size<00:02:02.890> but<00:02:03.890> if

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
ever so slightly smaller in size but if

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.740 
ever so slightly smaller in size but if
you<00:02:04.460> ever<00:02:04.549> had<00:02:04.729> one<00:02:04.939> of<00:02:05.030> these<00:02:05.149> that<00:02:05.570> was

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.480 
you ever had one of these that was
defective<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.619> only<00:02:06.799> hopes<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:07.189> could<00:02:07.340> ever

have would be to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.410 
have would be to

relatively<00:02:13.250> good<00:02:13.400> shape<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:14.570> go<00:02:14.750> ahead

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
relatively good shape and just go ahead

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.760 
relatively good shape and just go ahead
and<00:02:16.180> purchase<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.450> if<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.960> could<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.440> repair

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
and purchase that if you could to repair

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.620 
and purchase that if you could to repair
these<00:02:18.980> TVs<00:02:21.610> these<00:02:22.610> are<00:02:22.760> even<00:02:22.970> held<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.330> much

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
these TVs these are even held in much

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.960 
these TVs these are even held in much
differently<00:02:24.260> there<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:25.370> got<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.640> four

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
differently there it's got the four

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.710 
differently there it's got the four
screws<00:02:26.360> at<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.660> bottom<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.880> optic

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
block assembly that hold these and so a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.470 
block assembly that hold these and so a
little<00:02:34.250> bit<00:02:34.490> more<00:02:34.670> difficult<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.210> get<00:02:35.390> them

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
little bit more difficult to get them

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.910 
little bit more difficult to get them
disassembled<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:36.290> let<00:02:36.410> me<00:02:36.500> show<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.710> what<00:02:36.890> I

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
disassembled but let me show you what I

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.610 
disassembled but let me show you what I
believe<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.520> main<00:02:37.700> cause<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.960> this<00:02:39.140> LCD

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
believe is the main cause that this LCD

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.660 
believe is the main cause that this LCD
polarizer<00:02:40.250> here<00:02:41.590> actually<00:02:42.590> failed<00:02:45.520> just<00:02:46.520> in

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
polarizer here actually failed just in

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.060 
polarizer here actually failed just in
case<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:46.940> were<00:02:47.030> curious<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:48.320> LCD<00:02:48.710> panels

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
case you were curious the LCD panels

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.340 
case you were curious the LCD panels
between<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.640> older<00:02:50.510> series<00:02:50.750> sets<00:02:51.080> that<00:02:51.200> use

the newer series that this one
particularly<00:02:56.060> uses<00:02:56.450> an<00:02:56.600> XL<00:02:56.960> 2400<00:02:57.710> lamp<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.070> a

particularly uses an XL 2400 lamp the a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
series they are not compatible between

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.070 
series they are not compatible between
the<00:03:00.950> two<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.220> can<00:03:01.370> see<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.670> physical<00:03:02.080> size

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
the two you can see the physical size

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.130 
the two you can see the physical size
difference<00:03:03.620> between<00:03:03.710> the<00:03:04.190> two<00:03:04.450> LCD<00:03:05.450> panels

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
difference between the two LCD panels

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.210 
difference between the two LCD panels
here<00:03:06.230> there's<00:03:06.500> quite<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.710> difference<00:03:06.800> between

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
here there's quite a difference between

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.820 
here there's quite a difference between
them<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:08.660> mounting<00:03:09.020> is<00:03:09.050> much<00:03:09.320> different

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
them and the mounting is much different

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.310 
them and the mounting is much different
as<00:03:09.890> well<00:03:10.100> so<00:03:10.370> there's<00:03:10.750> unfortunately<00:03:11.750> no<00:03:12.170> way

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
as well so there's unfortunately no way

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.060 
as well so there's unfortunately no way
that<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.620> could<00:03:12.860> try<00:03:13.490> to<00:03:13.550> put<00:03:13.820> an<00:03:13.970> old<00:03:15.070> LCD

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
that you could try to put an old LCD

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.100 
that you could try to put an old LCD
panel<00:03:17.830> into<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:18.860> new<00:03:19.130> set

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.020 

it<00:03:24.110> it<00:03:24.740> just<00:03:24.800> doesn't<00:03:25.280> line<00:03:25.430> up<00:03:25.460> correctly<00:03:25.970> I

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
it it just doesn't line up correctly I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.370 
it it just doesn't line up correctly I
don't<00:03:26.450> know<00:03:26.510> if<00:03:26.570> you<00:03:26.630> can<00:03:26.750> see<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.080> or<00:03:27.260> not

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
don't know if you can see that or not

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.710 
don't know if you can see that or not
but<00:03:27.590> it's<00:03:27.740> it<00:03:27.950> sets<00:03:28.610> much<00:03:28.820> lower<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.360> needs<00:03:29.540> to

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
but it's it sets much lower it needs to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.650 
but it's it sets much lower it needs to
set<00:03:29.960> up<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.380> little<00:03:31.370> bit<00:03:31.520> higher<00:03:31.760> here<00:03:32.090> but<00:03:32.390> I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
set up a little bit higher here but I

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.900 
set up a little bit higher here but I
just<00:03:33.470> thought<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.280> would<00:03:34.460> show<00:03:34.610> you<00:03:34.670> that

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
just thought that I would show you that

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.330 
just thought that I would show you that
I<00:03:34.940> have<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.210> cold<00:03:36.110> blue<00:03:36.410> polarizer<00:03:36.890> here<00:03:37.190> that

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
I have a cold blue polarizer here that

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.100 
I have a cold blue polarizer here that
I've<00:03:37.460> changed<00:03:38.000> as<00:03:38.210> well<00:03:38.390> as<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.660> new<00:03:38.810> blue

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
I've changed as well as the new blue

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.810 
I've changed as well as the new blue
polarizer<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.860> was<00:03:39.980> out<00:03:40.130> of<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.280> defective

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
polarizer that was out of the defective

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.450 
polarizer that was out of the defective
TV<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:42.410> just<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.770> show<00:03:43.070> you<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.280> actual

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
TV and just to show you the actual

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.910 
TV and just to show you the actual
difference<00:03:44.090> between<00:03:44.150> them<00:03:44.600> here<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:48.680> here's

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
difference between them here so here's

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.010 
difference between them here so here's
the<00:03:49.100> engine<00:03:50.140> what<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:52.390> polarizer<00:03:53.390> taken<00:03:53.870> out

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
the engine what the polarizer taken out

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.190 
the engine what the polarizer taken out
it<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.350> mounts<00:03:55.100> right<00:03:55.160> here<00:03:55.930> so<00:03:56.930> I've<00:03:57.050> removed

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
it it mounts right here so I've removed

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.130 
it it mounts right here so I've removed
the<00:03:57.560> polarizer<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.220> show<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.870> it<00:03:59.960> was

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
the polarizer to show you that it was

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.550 
the polarizer to show you that it was
defective<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.690> as<00:04:02.690> you<00:04:02.810> look<00:04:02.960> at<00:04:03.080> this<00:04:03.170> engine

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
defective and as you look at this engine

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.640 
defective and as you look at this engine
it's<00:04:03.710> got<00:04:03.860> a<00:04:04.000> air<00:04:05.000> filter<00:04:05.480> over<00:04:05.750> here<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.530> keep

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
it's got a air filter over here to keep

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.520 
it's got a air filter over here to keep
those<00:04:06.890> particles<00:04:07.370> from<00:04:07.460> settling<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:09.350> see<00:04:09.440> if

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
those particles from settling and see if

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.990 
those particles from settling and see if
I<00:04:09.590> get<00:04:09.740> a<00:04:09.770> close-up<00:04:10.040> of<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.490> here<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.580> just

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
I get a close-up of it here it is just

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.580 
I get a close-up of it here it is just
really<00:04:14.420> packed<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:14.870> should<00:04:15.050> be<00:04:15.140> bright<00:04:15.350> white

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
really packed it should be bright white

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.330 
really packed it should be bright white
you<00:04:15.920> can<00:04:16.070> see<00:04:16.100> how<00:04:16.370> much<00:04:16.520> dirt<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.180> dust<00:04:18.340> has

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
you can see how much dirt and dust has

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.120 
you can see how much dirt and dust has
accumulated<00:04:19.700> on<00:04:20.060> this<00:04:20.270> filter<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:21.410> I<00:04:21.859> do

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
accumulated on this filter and I do

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.980 
accumulated on this filter and I do
believe<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:22.550> that<00:04:23.000> is<00:04:23.240> probably<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.690> major

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
believe that that is probably a major

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.160 
believe that that is probably a major
contributing<00:04:24.650> factor<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.480> overheating
