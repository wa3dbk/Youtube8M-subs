00:00:09.983 --> 00:00:12.065
 Hello and welcome to the dynamic game 

00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:13.265
 action packed 

00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:14.889
 and Blizzard Entertainment: 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.265
 Heroes of the Storm. 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.365
 Let's talk about competitiveness. 

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:21.365
 In high-level teams, 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.465
 one of the highest priorities 

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:26.165
 is the synergy created among the heroes. 

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:28.865
 Team building should be strategic 

00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:30.665
 and balance the four roles 

00:00:30.712 --> 00:00:33.365
 in order to favor their style of play: 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.966
 wants warriors to force the initiative, 

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.866
 assassins to bring down advanced enemies, 

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:44.766
 brackets to control the battlefield 

00:00:45.493 --> 00:00:47.466
 or specialists 

00:00:47.517 --> 00:00:50.766
 to spread chaos across the battlefield? 

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:53.765
 Understanding the battlefield 

00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:56.766
 is key to forming a good team. 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.566
 The goal is always the same: 

00:00:58.603 --> 00:01:00.966
 destroy the core of the enemy team 

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.665
 but the unique objectives of each phase 

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.766
 will change strategies to win. 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.266
 For example: 

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:08.766
 in Dragon County, 

00:01:08.822 --> 00:01:11.466
 the goal is to spread and take two shrines 

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:13.266
 to free a Dragon Rider. 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.134
 In the Cursed Glade, 

00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:19.266
 the group struggles and the collection of taxes 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.366
 forces the enemies to become defensive, 

00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:24.066
 cursed by the curse of the Lord of the Ravens. 

00:01:24.723 --> 00:01:26.220
 But, as much as they are 

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:27.965
 strong, map objects 

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:29.466
 they are no guarantee of victory. 

00:01:29.517 --> 00:01:33.665
 The team may choose to strategically override certain aspect of the phase 

00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:35.766
 and seek advantages elsewhere. 

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.166
 Ignore a tribute in the Cursed Glade 

00:01:38.204 --> 00:01:40.566
 and gain troop experience on all tracks 

00:01:40.603 --> 00:01:42.966
 can result in a major level advantage 

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:45.665
 and make a difference in the next confrontation. 

00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:47.766
 At the peak of competitiveness, 

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:50.765
 the details become even more subtle 

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:53.866
 such as the selection of opposing team talents 

00:01:53.892 --> 00:01:56.265
 and which talents to choose to fight it. 

00:01:56.355 --> 00:02:00.165
 Talents are variations of skill and advantages 

00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:02.866
 released as the hero climbs. 

00:02:02.874 --> 00:02:05.867
 For example, your team faces another 

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.666
 with a heavy training 

00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:10.366
 equipped with the Judgment of Tyrael and the Sonya Jumping. 

00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:13.666
 The two skills were created to undermine 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.466
 robust targets in group fights. 

00:02:16.222 --> 00:02:17.242
 At the same time, 

00:02:17.298 --> 00:02:20.866
 your Asaluz can choose the heroic skill Emerald Wind 

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:23.274
 and divide the opposing attackers 

00:02:23.306 --> 00:02:25.066
 sending them each in one direction. 

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:28.666
 Thus, Asaluz and his defensive team 

00:02:28.697 --> 00:02:31.665
 are in a solid position and can turn the fight 

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:33.166
 in a 5 x 2 match. 

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:35.866
 Consciousness is everything: 

00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:38.266
 a talented team will seek to understand 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.566
 the framework formed by the combination of their talents 

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:43.966
 and how they come together to nullify the opponent. 

00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:46.066
 At the highest level, 

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:50.265
 Heroes of the Storm is a very complex and nuanced game, 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.265
 but there is one element that can leverage 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.265
 or sink your team: communication. 

00:02:56.306 --> 00:02:59.566
 Understand what your colleagues are doing at any given moment 

00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:02.265
 and the potential that their joint actions have 

00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:04.665
 can amplify team goals 

00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:07.366
 and this is what separates the good from the excellent. 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.366
 There is no me in Heroes of the Storm. 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.008
 Plan in team, think team 

00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:14.566
 and the victory shall be yours. 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.242
 Together.
