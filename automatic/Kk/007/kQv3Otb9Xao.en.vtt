in<00:00:52.559> line<00:00:52.800> maybe<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.219> good<00:00:53.489> idea<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.270> know<00:00:54.449> why

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
in line maybe a good idea you know why

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.660 
in line maybe a good idea you know why
in<00:00:56.640> those<00:00:57.000> days<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:58.620> wood<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.100> they<00:00:59.250> used<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
in those days the wood that they used to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.270 
in those days the wood that they used to
use<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.210> make<00:01:00.420> Reed<00:01:00.750> rocks<00:01:01.079> use<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.219> warp<00:01:03.080> this

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
use to make Reed rocks use the warp this

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.510 
use to make Reed rocks use the warp this
prevents<00:01:05.280> any<00:01:05.689> warpage<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:08.100> could<00:01:08.310> happen

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
prevents any warpage that could happen

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.520 
prevents any warpage that could happen
because<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.420> such<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> short<00:01:09.750> span<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
