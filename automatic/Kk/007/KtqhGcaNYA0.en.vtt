00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 so my dear and thus the income 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.390
 to this little demo video re 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.280
 the gamescom 2014 in cologne and of course 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.099
 most of you know 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.630
 that the fair from 13 august to 17 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.610
 August will take place and I think he 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.590
 It's also worthy of me to be at the start 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.180
 is my first time on the gamescom and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.830
 I'm really big in anticipation 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.060
 really curious what me there everything 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.230
 expects and just wants to go in now 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.939
 the upcoming one two three four five 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.550
 minutes with you a bit over it 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.019
 talk what I do I am if it 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.640
 an abo meet and so on and so on 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.080
 so on and before we get started I would 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.250
 In any case, at least so 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.930
 I do not want to kill everyone that sounds like now 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.239
 But it should not be an application 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.770
 but to all who come to gamescom 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.879
 I would recommend below in 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.590
 the video description on mine 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.360
 facebook link to click because it pleases 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.010
 to push me then he really misses 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.539
 nothing i will then during the gamescom 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.860
 Time and again post where I am 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.690
 where you could meet me and so on 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.430
 and so on who is talking at gamescom 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.410
 he should definitely do that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.570
 nothing to miss that will be numero one 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.949
 number two, which is very important 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.550
 is and what I am very happy about 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.840
 would 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.129

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.989

 Then he will come to one 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.439
 event that I have created too 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.510
 of course regarding the gamescom subscription 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.400

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.229

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.470
 background so a little graphic 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.640
 as you do the whole thing 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.350

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 small survey on the topic at which 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.650

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 also like to participate tan just so I can 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.229
 get such a small overview 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.090
 whereupon I can adjust 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.979
 how many people you come and so on 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.880
 and so on and so you tell yourself you 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.979

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.100
 the main topic comes to the gamescom 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.110

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.190

 and anyway that too 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.180
 generally speaking so if you like me 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.620
 outside the apo meeting times somewhere 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.090

 and then that suits you 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.570
 Do not worry or somehow 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.460
 then I'm not talking to you yet 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.140
 honestly easy later 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.870
 is not a topic that comes to 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.550
 one to another to the right abo 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.230
 I have such a meeting times 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.850
 little thought I can ever 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.200
 Now it may be good that I am there 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.790
 what else does it change is my said 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.380

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.050
 she can not look at me yet 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.790
 really introduce and so on and so on 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.680
 but at least I have one at least 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.390
 made some small notes as I did 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.820

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.070

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.690
 should there be a change i will 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.130
 which then of course post with security 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.780
 so that he knows everyone but it 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.540

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.380
 playmates gamescom stage is the the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.840
 already built up last year 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.760
 was greater wrestling where just the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.680
 partner of gamestar and on and media 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.060
 pulse so my network is occurring 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.580
 but now it is mine 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.780
 I do not plan anything on the side 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.070
 a little bit closer to that 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.390
 land when it is finally time 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.100
 when I am directly at gamescom 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.330
 So there will be the abo 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.739
 The hall plan is like 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.120
 said in the video description there 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.380

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.700
 you ever so a bit the 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.560
 to give a small impression like that 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.570
 whole looks abo then meet on 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.519

 at 2 pm I have extra 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.030
 written in the event like that 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.290
 long until all are supplied so ever 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.120
 after how many do I know it 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.100
 We will not be able to do anything 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.120
 do not eat what is food 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.739
 there is everything for possibilities 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.019
 happy says it is the very first time 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.120
 I have no idea what to expect 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.590
 I do not know everyone will be too 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.480
 maybe a few more abo meet 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.739
 together with other youtube this 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.180
 I could possibly give it then 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.520
 also post everything on facebook so 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.170
 now actually best served if 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.250
 he just likes me on facebook 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.470
 then you really do not miss anything 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.940
 Everything else I will post there then 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.490
 but that's the rough plan 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.350
 that is now thought first seen 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.850
 made it a every day at 14:00 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.910
 abo do not hit anything before this let's play 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.650
 will give gamescom stage in hall 10.1 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.730
 that as a small info in advance I would 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.470
 say you can also like in the 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.910

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.380
 he publicized this at the event 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.850
 made announcements and then just click 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.560
 in the poll still votes on which 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.150
 you are there so that I am one of the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.770
 get a smaller overview and with it 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.910
 I would say that was it 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.070
 with the info video I'm glad 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.140

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.610
 am really hot I'm curious how it 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.140
 looks like I'm not only 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.160
 Of course you can meet that anyway 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.200
 That's why I'm friends too 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.580
 But I'm also very happy about that 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.180
 make contact with other youtube 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.250
 to be able to 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.180
 with the network and so on 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.740
 So, I think one will go on 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.670
 gigantic that awaits us there and from 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.950

 thirteenth eighth is coming soon 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.630
 It will be days before we meet 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.070

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.480
