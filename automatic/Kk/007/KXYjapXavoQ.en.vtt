00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.720
 ground by teams 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.150
 that we are winning welcome to all 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.800
 one more time to my channel I'm marco ox this 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.660
 new here with all of you for 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.460
 bring you and present my first 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.700
 first very first first game 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.989
 online in this map of xpress playing 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.670
 with the scorpion evo and well I was 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:38.079
 accompanied in this departure of the lord 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.489
 elias 360 of angel and josemi so 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.750
 Well, let's see what it is that 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.250
 the truth is that to be the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.370
 first game I must say that the 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.230
 final result was not too good 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.840
 but well I imagine that as to the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.390
 most of you will have passed the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.470
 connection I personally must say 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.000
 that you notice a lot very much 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.160
 very much 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.059
 because although it appears that we are going with three 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.060
 bars and wash all the time between three 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.600
 bars and two 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.880
 just happened to yellow let's go the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.610
 The truth is that the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 connection difference is something in which 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.320
 surely you will all agree 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.560
 with me imagine that they will have to touch and 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.530
 touch up that topic a lot since it's something 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.170
 that is quite out of tune otherwise 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.179
 more good then get used to it during 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.840
 all this last year to play modern 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:37.140
 warfare 3 what good do you lower them or 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.569
 less will be quick because if it gets complicated 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.450
 quite at the time of casualties you have to 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.060
 give enough shots to the rivals so 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.020
 except I 've noticed it like that I do not know about you 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.179
 what you will say to me saying in the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.590
 comments or what will you leave me 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.500
 reflected in the comments of 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.780
 surprising could help me quite 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.860
 so yes, well, nothing like you are 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.020
 watching is a team duel in this 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.110
 map of xpress and to me personally is a 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.740
 map that I'm really liking has 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.509
 quite a few options and well then we'll see 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.060
 to see if it is finally incorporated to 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.790
 competitive or not I think that excited 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.360
 the laser could be that maybe it 's 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.430
 a tad broad but we'll see we'll see 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.670
 see what is what is done to 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.860
 final , I will speak in another video of the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.020
 issues of competitive standards and 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.730
 the things that are incorporated but 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.310
 well I mainly wanted to bring you this 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.260
 video because it's my first Christmas and I 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.530
 I felt like you did not want me 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.550
 upload it and you see how good that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.250
 It is never easy to start a new game 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.470
 and that for everyone is complicated so 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.080
 those who have started and are giving us 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.030
 very well you overwhelm us too much 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.300
 bogged down too much because then things 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.680
 they change so calm is worth more 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.030
 little things I want to talk about good 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.220
 the version that I'm playing in 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.450
 concrete is playstation 3 is worth as 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.420
 you know, I have both 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.239
 both platforms both play 3 and xbox 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.870
 360 this time is a game in 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.239
 play 3 as I say and well I can 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.280
 comment then look that he was 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.019
 playing these games that I played like me 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.500
 was dictated with the days 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.550
 josemi and angel but later 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.670
 then later and a little more 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.069
 late 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.730
 I started trying to play and I do not know what happened 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.760
 that already began to leave not to leave pardon 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.970
 to restrict the online games not 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.280
 let me play I do not understand why 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.810
 I was not looking for a game, I logged out 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.380
 next I could not try 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.500
 if I let myself play but nevertheless at 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.780
 rest of classmates did not let them play 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.920
 I tried to search for myself by group 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.370
 it left the truth quite frustrating 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.870
 everyone on xbox playing smash 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.840
 both platforms between to play in 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.260
 team 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.760
 but nevertheless play 3 that you could not 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.190
 play there were people that we are when 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.850
 they alone the people had to unite and 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.829
 things like this but good and then 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.690
 finally I stayed with a friend we played 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:26.510
 5 games that you make 5 games and another 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.400
 once again did not let us not leave us 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.669
 play so we did not play 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.220
 with competitive since the 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.950
 competitive as my good friend would say 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.690
 idrac are threw there we were giving a 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.610
 little knowing the maps a little bit 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.229
 seeing a little the maps that to me 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.479
 personally he had to say that there 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.220
 enough that I have been prescribed enough 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.950
 just like there are others that I did not like 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.840
 or anything I do not remember this one that has the 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.080
 plane well in the middle that is very elongated 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.550
 with three aisles if I do not like anything not 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.080
 I remember exactly what it's called 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.940
 map but surely you know which one is 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.689
 because the horrible map at least 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.330
 for my taste 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:07.470
 and well, what I was saying 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.780
 finally last night almost there 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.360
 late on about four o'clock and 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.550
 half five began to let play online 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.990
 again I hope that today it is working 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.570
 also because I wish I could be 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.360
 some games finally online is 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.960
 really good up to where not up 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.990
 where ages and this game try several 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.240
 several of the advantages and little things of this 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.760
 new type especially for for then 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.090
 to go see more things personally 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.730
 this when right now with the 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.400
 hi pwd I think it's called forgive me 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.260
 that is very informed of the names of 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.000
 the weapons and why is that because 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.510
 I have not had much time for 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.460
 play but well I can pretty much say 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.850
 which is the second one is a rifle that 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.010
 unlocks and they do not go they do not go badly but 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.580
 but I want to try it with 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:02.460
 certain with certain accessories and good 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.639
 Well, above all try to adjust it to what 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.260
 best possible to my needs the mp7 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.350
 yeah it 's going pretty well so I have 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.479
 tasted to taste goes pretty well but 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.419
 I think they're going to have to touch and touch up 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.040
 also the damage to the weapons I do not know 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.860
 you what will you think is 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:24.660
 looking to look here a little a vector 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.820
 if I remember correctly that I did not dislike 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.919
 for nothing I use a good cadence a 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.320
 good damage the only thing that has very little 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.780
 reach and that limits it limits 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.420
 quite 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.760
 On the other hand, well, I'm playing 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:41.240
 Zombie games that you already will go 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.180
 seeing that I will go up more things 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.830
 in the night of yesterday as I tell you this 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.199
 game already I tell you that it is my first 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.139
 departure is the night of the 13th day after 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:53.770
 of that presentation of black ops 2 that 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:57.289
 of course of course extra and hence 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.330
 one or two exclusive videos to the channel on 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.490
 rest then you can see it through the 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.880
 channel the fame gaming that I have several 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:07.730
 several little things recorded as well as 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.760
 I will put you I will go up surely 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:13.490
 here to my channel and 266 watching the low 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.110
 definitive coincidences of life I went 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.970
 I 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.130
 the one that appears in the death chamber 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:22.010
 there you have the final score quite 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:25.040
 sad, sad, but not good 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.870
 I took it very badly because as I say 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.240
 it's the first game I wanted to share 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.800
 with you and well then making a 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.690
 little more of emphasis and already to puntito 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.700
 to say goodbye for not only telling you 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.920
