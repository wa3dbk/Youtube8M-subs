00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
worked ahead of a lot on that so in a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.479 
worked ahead of a lot on that so in a
sense<00:02:56.020> we<00:02:56.650> kind<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:56.920> did<00:02:57.070> for<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.310> what<00:02:57.459> we

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489

as you'll see in a minute you can also
dive<00:03:08.170> dive<00:03:08.800> boost<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.430> use<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:10.209> kind<00:03:10.810> of

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
dive dive boost and use that to kind of

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.970 
dive dive boost and use that to kind of
build<00:03:11.380> your<00:03:11.680> momentum<00:03:12.040> move<00:03:12.670> around
