hey guys what's up how y'all doing so
quick<00:00:03.899> little<00:00:04.170> story<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:05.339> few<00:00:06.299> nights<00:00:06.509> ago

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
quick little story a few nights ago

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.350 
quick little story a few nights ago
before<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:06.990> went<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.290> bed<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.680> saw<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.940> little

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
before I went to bed I saw a little

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.560 
before I went to bed I saw a little
video<00:00:09.830> that<00:00:10.830> had<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.460> visual<00:00:11.790> proof<00:00:12.269> for

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
video that had a visual proof for

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.970 
video that had a visual proof for
finding<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.019> sum<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.799> first<00:00:14.070> n<00:00:14.340> squares

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
the first n squares being you know 1

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.720 
the first n squares being you know 1
squared<00:00:19.289> plus<00:00:19.500> 2<00:00:19.710> squared<00:00:20.039> plus<00:00:20.250> 3<00:00:20.460> squared

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
squared plus 2 squared plus 3 squared

squared plus 2 squared plus 3 squared
plus<00:00:20.970> 4<00:00:21.180> squared<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.199> forth<00:00:22.470> all

the<00:00:22.949> way<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.369> N<00:00:23.609> squared<00:00:26.000> and<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.779> got<00:00:27.960> me

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the way up to N squared and that got me

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.420 
the way up to N squared and that got me
thinking<00:00:28.320> because<00:00:30.830> what<00:00:31.830> occurred<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.099> me

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
thinking because what occurred to me

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.030 
thinking because what occurred to me
while<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> was<00:00:33.440> kind<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.530> fall<00:00:34.649> asleep<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
while I was kind of fall asleep that

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.510 
while I was kind of fall asleep that
night<00:00:35.239> was<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.540> similar<00:00:37.290> equation<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.280> for

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
night was a similar equation but for

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.000 
night was a similar equation but for
finding<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> sums<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.110> squares<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.590> the

of odd numbers up to n instead of just
all<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> numbers<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:46.579> have<00:00:47.579> lots<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.879> little

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
all the numbers I have lots of little

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.880 
all the numbers I have lots of little
math<00:00:48.239> ideas<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.410> usually<00:00:49.649> don't

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
math ideas like this but I usually don't

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.270 
math ideas like this but I usually don't
share<00:00:50.219> them<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:51.890> kind<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.980> relates

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
share them but this one kind of relates

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.369 
share them but this one kind of relates
to<00:00:53.460> Minecraft<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.120> using<00:00:54.300> beacons<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:55.140> an

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
to Minecraft I'm using beacons as an

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.939 
to Minecraft I'm using beacons as an
excuse<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.039> show<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.640> guys

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
excuse here to show this with you guys

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
excuse here to show this with you guys
anyways<00:00:59.059> figuring<00:01:00.059> out<00:01:00.180> how<00:01:00.329> many<00:01:00.390> blocks<00:01:00.899> are

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
anyways figuring out how many blocks are

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.100 
anyways figuring out how many blocks are
in<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.379> beacon<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.789> problem<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.719> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
in a beacon is this problem because you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.340 
in a beacon is this problem because you
know<00:01:04.580> we<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.670> 3<00:01:06.090> by<00:01:06.240> 3<00:01:06.510> 5<00:01:07.229> by<00:01:07.470> 5<00:01:07.680> 7<00:01:08.100> by<00:01:08.250> 7<00:01:08.310> 9<00:01:08.820> by<00:01:09.000> 9

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
know we have 3 by 3 5 by 5 7 by 7 9 by 9

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.310 
know we have 3 by 3 5 by 5 7 by 7 9 by 9
the<00:01:10.350> number<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.680> blocks<00:01:10.970> in<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.150> beacon<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the number of blocks in a beacon are the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.580 
the number of blocks in a beacon are the
some<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.970> squares<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.869> whatever<00:01:16.350> layer

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
some of the squares up to whatever layer

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.120 
some of the squares up to whatever layer
you're<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:18.420> odd<00:01:18.780> numbers<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.770> know<00:01:19.890> 3

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
you're on of odd numbers so you know 3

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.460 
you're on of odd numbers so you know 3
squared<00:01:20.400> plus<00:01:20.549> 5<00:01:20.700> squared<00:01:21.000> plus<00:01:21.409> 7<00:01:22.409> squared

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
squared plus 5 squared plus 7 squared

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.999 
squared plus 5 squared plus 7 squared
plus<00:01:22.740> 9<00:01:22.920> squared<00:01:24.259> not<00:01:25.259> 1<00:01:25.439> squared<00:01:25.740> because

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
plus 9 squared not 1 squared because

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.760 
plus 9 squared not 1 squared because
that<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.280> course<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> beacon<00:01:26.970> head<00:01:27.119> itself

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
that of course is the beacon head itself

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.039 
that of course is the beacon head itself
so<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> want<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> ask<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.820> guys<00:01:29.880> before<00:01:30.810> I

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
so what I want to ask you guys before I

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.649 
so what I want to ask you guys before I
get<00:01:31.229> into<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.189> little<00:01:32.360> visualizations<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
get into the little visualizations I

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.490 
get into the little visualizations I
have<00:01:33.810> set<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.640> is<00:01:35.640> how<00:01:36.240> many<00:01:36.450> blocks<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.259> iron

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
have set up is how many blocks of iron

the base is 25 by 25 that's all you guys
get<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.290> know<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.520> policy<00:01:44.790> or

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
get to know I know you can policy or

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.730 
get to know I know you can policy or
figure<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.329> whatever<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.380> guys<00:01:46.470> want<00:01:46.680> to

whatever I can find for official proof
of<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> sum<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.780> squares<00:01:58.759> but<00:01:59.759> I'll<00:01:59.909> be

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
of the sum of squares but I'll be

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.420 
of the sum of squares but I'll be
quickly<00:02:00.840> over<00:02:01.049> viewing<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> here<00:02:01.710> which<00:02:02.280> is

quickly over viewing it here which is
you<00:02:02.549> know<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.930> sum<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.350> first<00:02:04.439> n<00:02:04.619> squares

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you know the sum of the first n squares

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.910 
you know the sum of the first n squares

this case nine blocks wide
and<00:02:23.290> what<00:02:24.290> we<00:02:24.410> can<00:02:24.560> do<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:25.489> we<00:02:25.640> can<00:02:25.730> take<00:02:25.910> six<00:02:26.209> of

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
and what we can do is we can take six of

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.620 
and what we can do is we can take six of
these<00:02:26.410> put<00:02:27.410> them<00:02:27.560> together<00:02:27.739> you<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:29.450> to

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
these put them together you have to

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.990 
these put them together you have to
rotate<00:02:30.260> them<00:02:30.530> around<00:02:30.590> switch<00:02:31.340> them<00:02:31.489> up<00:02:31.550> a<00:02:31.670> bit

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
rotate them around switch them up a bit

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.300 
rotate them around switch them up a bit
but<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.540> fit<00:02:32.690> them<00:02:32.810> all<00:02:32.840> together<00:02:33.050> into<00:02:33.709> a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
but you can fit them all together into a

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.240 
but you can fit them all together into a
pyramid<00:02:34.910> or<00:02:35.269> a<00:02:35.510> pyramid<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.019> rectangular<00:02:36.709> shape

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
pyramid or a pyramid a rectangular shape

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.509 
pyramid or a pyramid a rectangular shape
and<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:39.050> dimensions<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.650> this<00:02:39.830> thing<00:02:40.130> are<00:02:40.900> n

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
and the dimensions of this thing are n

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.470 
and the dimensions of this thing are n
across<00:02:43.930> n<00:02:44.930> plus<00:02:45.410> 1<00:02:45.830> up<00:02:46.069> I<00:02:46.250> think<00:02:46.519> into<00:02:46.910> n<00:02:47.090> plus<00:02:47.269> 1

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
across n plus 1 up I think into n plus 1

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.740 
across n plus 1 up I think into n plus 1
long<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.920> then<00:02:49.549> there's<00:02:49.700> six<00:02:49.940> inside<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.600> it

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
long and then there's six inside of it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.030 
long and then there's six inside of it
so<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:52.400> equation<00:02:52.940> for<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:54.500> value<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:54.920> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
so the equation for the value of the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.949 
so the equation for the value of the
first<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.410> school<00:02:58.569> I'm<00:02:59.569> gonna<00:02:59.780> get

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
first and of the school I'm gonna get

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.410 
first and of the school I'm gonna get
tongue-tied<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:00.620> much<00:03:00.799> in<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.040> video<00:03:01.420> the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
tongue-tied so much in this video the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.110 
tongue-tied so much in this video the
value<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.019> sum<00:03:03.260> of<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.530> first<00:03:03.970> squares<00:03:04.970> of

the<00:03:05.180> first<00:03:05.390> n<00:03:05.540> numbers<00:03:05.930> okay<00:03:06.830> that's<00:03:07.010> good

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
the first n numbers okay that's good

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.940 
the first n numbers okay that's good
enough<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:08.989> equation<00:03:09.290> right<00:03:09.560> here<00:03:09.620> and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
enough is this equation right here and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.710 
enough is this equation right here and
times<00:03:10.250> n<00:03:10.370> plus<00:03:10.549> 1<00:03:10.700> times<00:03:10.819> 2n<00:03:11.150> plus<00:03:11.329> 1<00:03:11.420> all

divided<00:03:12.019> by<00:03:12.200> 6<00:03:13.180> now<00:03:14.180> what<00:03:14.359> I<00:03:14.390> wanted<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.780> do<00:03:14.930> was

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
divided by 6 now what I wanted to do was

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.410 
divided by 6 now what I wanted to do was
do<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.769> similar<00:03:16.160> see<00:03:16.700> if<00:03:16.820> I<00:03:16.880> could<00:03:17.030> do<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.150> similar

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
do a similar see if I could do a similar

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.150 
do a similar see if I could do a similar
thing<00:03:17.890> for<00:03:19.390> Beacons<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.690> guess<00:03:21.170> for<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.950> sum<00:03:22.130> of

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
thing for Beacons I guess for the sum of

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.660 
thing for Beacons I guess for the sum of
odd<00:03:22.430> squares<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:25.160> numbers<00:03:25.459> here<00:03:25.609> are

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
odd squares so the numbers here are

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
odd squares so the numbers here are
still<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:25.940> same<00:03:26.090> white<00:03:26.390> is<00:03:26.540> 1<00:03:27.250> green<00:03:28.250> is<00:03:28.400> 3<00:03:28.730> 5

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
still the same white is 1 green is 3 5

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.490 
still the same white is 1 green is 3 5
is<00:03:29.720> orange<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.170> know<00:03:33.200> kind<00:03:33.470> of

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
is orange so this is you know kind of

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.280 
is orange so this is you know kind of
like<00:03:33.650> our<00:03:33.799> beacon<00:03:34.100> here<00:03:34.370> now<00:03:35.269> what<00:03:35.600> I<00:03:35.630> tried<00:03:36.260> to

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
like our beacon here now what I tried to

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.770 
like our beacon here now what I tried to
do<00:03:36.470> is<00:03:36.620> fit<00:03:36.920> this<00:03:37.790> pyramid<00:03:38.239> together<00:03:38.540> in<00:03:38.690> the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
do is fit this pyramid together in the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.150 
do is fit this pyramid together in the
same<00:03:38.959> way<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.230> these<00:03:39.440> were<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.829> see<00:03:39.980> if<00:03:40.070> I

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
same way that these were and see if I

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.250 
same way that these were and see if I
could<00:03:40.370> get<00:03:40.519> a<00:03:40.549> cube<00:03:41.150> shape<00:03:41.570> that<00:03:41.810> we<00:03:41.900> already

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
could get a cube shape that we already

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.310 
could get a cube shape that we already
knew<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.709> volume<00:03:43.130> of<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:44.299> I<00:03:44.720> fit<00:03:45.230> them

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
knew the volume of and so I fit them

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.990 
knew the volume of and so I fit them
together<00:03:45.470> like<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.100> take<00:03:46.250> 4<00:03:46.519> of<00:03:46.549> them

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
together like this you take 4 of them

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.670 
together like this you take 4 of them
squeeze<00:03:47.600> them<00:03:47.720> together<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.410> can<00:03:48.560> get

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
squeeze them together and you can get

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.729 
squeeze them together and you can get
this<00:03:48.890> shape<00:03:49.540> close<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.750> a<00:03:50.780> cube<00:03:51.140> but<00:03:51.260> not<00:03:51.500> quite

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
this shape close to a cube but not quite

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.349 
this shape close to a cube but not quite
there<00:03:51.980> yet<00:03:52.040> because<00:03:52.280> we<00:03:52.489> have<00:03:52.670> this<00:03:52.819> void<00:03:53.180> in

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
there yet because we have this void in

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.470 
there yet because we have this void in
the<00:03:53.480> center<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:54.950> void<00:03:55.280> has<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.359> be

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
the center and this void has to be

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.640 
the center and this void has to be
filled<00:03:56.750> by<00:03:57.049> an<00:03:57.380> even<00:03:58.340> pyramid<00:03:59.350> even<00:04:00.350> squares

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
filled by an even pyramid even squares

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.260 
filled by an even pyramid even squares
so<00:04:01.269> for<00:04:02.269> 2<00:04:02.569> squared

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
so for 2 squared

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.700 
so for 2 squared
16-4<00:04:05.270> squared<00:04:05.600> 36<00:04:06.230> 6<00:04:06.470> squared<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:08.320> by<00:04:09.320> taking

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
16-4 squared 36 6 squared and by taking

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.010 
16-4 squared 36 6 squared and by taking
two<00:04:09.890> of<00:04:10.010> those<00:04:10.160> even<00:04:10.550> pyramids<00:04:10.940> filling<00:04:11.930> in

two of those even pyramids filling in
the<00:04:12.110> void<00:04:12.320> there<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.680> can<00:04:12.860> get<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.450> solid<00:04:14.450> cube

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
the void there you can get a solid cube

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.630 
the void there you can get a solid cube
not<00:04:16.459> exactly<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.329> cube<00:04:17.750> though<00:04:17.959> because<00:04:18.109> it's

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
not exactly a cube though because it's

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.450 
not exactly a cube though because it's
it's<00:04:19.640> dimensions<00:04:20.180> are<00:04:20.299> n<00:04:20.570> by<00:04:20.840> n<00:04:21.530> plus<00:04:21.890> 1<00:04:22.160> by<00:04:22.310> n

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
it's dimensions are n by n plus 1 by n

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.530 
it's dimensions are n by n plus 1 by n
plus<00:04:22.490> 1<00:04:24.100> all<00:04:25.100> right<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:25.430> this<00:04:25.640> is<00:04:25.700> this<00:04:26.210> is<00:04:26.270> the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
plus 1 all right so this is this is the

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.270 
plus 1 all right so this is this is the
first<00:04:26.750> step<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.080> got<00:04:27.670> we<00:04:28.670> know<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:29.060> n<00:04:29.950> times<00:04:30.950> n

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
first step I got we know that n times n

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.670 
first step I got we know that n times n
plus<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:32.300> quantity<00:04:32.480> n<00:04:32.780> plus<00:04:32.990> 1<00:04:33.140> squared<00:04:33.470> is

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
plus the quantity n plus 1 squared is

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.310 
plus the quantity n plus 1 squared is
equal<00:04:34.640> to<00:04:34.910> 2<00:04:35.290> times<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.710> sum<00:04:37.430> of<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.850> first

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
equal to 2 times the sum of the first

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.890 
equal to 2 times the sum of the first
even<00:04:39.320> squares<00:04:39.680> up<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:40.040> n<00:04:40.160> plus<00:04:40.910> 4<00:04:41.240> times<00:04:41.690> the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
even squares up to n plus 4 times the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.680 
even squares up to n plus 4 times the

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
sum of the first odd squares up to n or

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.420 
sum of the first odd squares up to n or
rather<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.160> minus<00:04:46.160> 1/4<00:04:46.820> even<00:04:48.220> since<00:04:49.220> the

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
rather and minus 1/4 even since the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.550 
rather and minus 1/4 even since the
bottom<00:04:49.669> even<00:04:50.150> number<00:04:50.570> would<00:04:50.690> be<00:04:50.750> 1<00:04:51.080> less<00:04:51.110> than

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
bottom even number would be 1 less than

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.150 
bottom even number would be 1 less than
the<00:04:51.740> outer<00:04:52.340> odd<00:04:52.669> number<00:04:53.410> anyway<00:04:54.410> so<00:04:54.650> that's<00:04:55.010> a

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
the outer odd number anyway so that's a

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.610 
the outer odd number anyway so that's a
visualize<00:04:55.550> here<00:04:55.820> so<00:04:56.060> these<00:04:56.780> two<00:04:56.840> shapes<00:04:57.380> are

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
visualize here so these two shapes are

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.020 
visualize here so these two shapes are
equal<00:04:57.950> and<00:04:58.040> how<00:04:58.160> many<00:04:58.340> blocks<00:04:58.610> are<00:04:58.730> inside<00:04:59.000> of

pyramids and one cube the next thing I

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.240 
pyramids and one cube the next thing I
did<00:05:04.340> is<00:05:04.430> I<00:05:04.520> realized<00:05:04.910> that<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:06.650> roadblock<00:05:07.040> was

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
did is I realized that the roadblock was

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.450 
did is I realized that the roadblock was
I<00:05:07.550> don't<00:05:07.610> know<00:05:07.880> I<00:05:08.680> don't<00:05:09.680> have<00:05:09.830> any<00:05:10.010> equation

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
I don't know I don't have any equation

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.969 
I don't know I don't have any equation
for<00:05:10.669> finding<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:12.050> volume<00:05:12.200> of<00:05:12.500> an<00:05:12.650> even

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
for finding the volume of an even

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.060 
for finding the volume of an even
pyramid<00:05:13.340> here<00:05:13.630> but<00:05:14.630> we<00:05:15.110> can<00:05:15.290> combine<00:05:15.470> an<00:05:15.770> even

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
pyramid here but we can combine an even

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.700 
pyramid here but we can combine an even
pyramid<00:05:16.520> with<00:05:16.760> an<00:05:16.910> odd<00:05:17.120> pyramid<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:18.260> get<00:05:18.410> the

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
pyramid with an odd pyramid to get the

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.440 
pyramid with an odd pyramid to get the
original<00:05:19.190> square<00:05:19.460> pyramid<00:05:19.970> that<00:05:20.090> I<00:05:20.150> showed

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
original square pyramid that I showed

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.040 
original square pyramid that I showed
back<00:05:20.660> there<00:05:21.580> so<00:05:22.580> now<00:05:22.729> we<00:05:22.790> know<00:05:23.060> that<00:05:23.300> this<00:05:23.630> cube

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
back there so now we know that this cube

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.440 
back there so now we know that this cube
over<00:05:24.320> here<00:05:24.530> pseudo<00:05:25.040> cube<00:05:25.310> it's<00:05:25.450> rectangular

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
over here pseudo cube it's rectangular

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.290 
over here pseudo cube it's rectangular
prism<00:05:28.000> its<00:05:29.000> volume<00:05:29.540> is<00:05:29.660> equal<00:05:29.930> to<00:05:30.729> 2<00:05:31.729> square

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
prism its volume is equal to 2 square

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.630 
prism its volume is equal to 2 square
pyramids<00:05:32.870> and<00:05:33.250> two<00:05:34.250> odd<00:05:34.520> square<00:05:34.970> pyramids

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.680 

sorry<00:05:39.640> I've<00:05:39.700> had<00:05:39.850> to<00:05:39.940> cut<00:05:40.090> my<00:05:40.240> dishwasher

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
sorry I've had to cut my dishwasher

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.210 
sorry I've had to cut my dishwasher
turned<00:05:40.900> on<00:05:41.040> anyways

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
turned on anyways

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.660 
turned on anyways
so<00:05:42.460> after<00:05:43.390> knowing<00:05:43.720> that<00:05:43.900> we<00:05:44.650> know<00:05:45.070> that<00:05:45.280> n

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
so after knowing that we know that n

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.880 
so after knowing that we know that n
times<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.510> quantity<00:05:46.690> n<00:05:46.990> plus<00:05:47.170> 1<00:05:47.380> squared<00:05:47.680> so

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
times the quantity n plus 1 squared so

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.150 
times the quantity n plus 1 squared so
that's<00:05:47.980> that<00:05:48.190> cube<00:05:48.460> it's<00:05:49.180> equal<00:05:49.450> to<00:05:49.480> 2<00:05:49.990> n<00:05:50.740> times

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
that's that cube it's equal to 2 n times

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.550 
that's that cube it's equal to 2 n times
n<00:05:51.310> plus<00:05:51.340> 1<00:05:51.670> times<00:05:51.820> 2n<00:05:52.090> plus<00:05:52.270> 1<00:05:52.390> all<00:05:52.750> over<00:05:52.780> 6<00:05:52.990> or

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
n plus 1 times 2n plus 1 all over 6 or

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.580 
n plus 1 times 2n plus 1 all over 6 or
just<00:05:54.010> the<00:05:54.580> top<00:05:54.730> part<00:05:54.790> all<00:05:55.270> over<00:05:55.600> 3<00:05:55.840> if<00:05:56.260> you<00:05:56.320> care

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
just the top part all over 3 if you care

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.480 
just the top part all over 3 if you care
to<00:05:56.680> simplify<00:05:57.100> it<00:05:57.450> plus<00:05:58.450> 2<00:05:58.750> times<00:05:59.320> the<00:05:59.770> sum<00:06:00.430> of

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
to simplify it plus 2 times the sum of

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.690 
to simplify it plus 2 times the sum of
the<00:06:00.700> first<00:06:00.970> odd<00:06:01.270> squares<00:06:02.160> squares<00:06:03.160> of<00:06:03.280> odds<00:06:03.430> up

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
the first odd squares squares of odds up

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.350 
the first odd squares squares of odds up
to<00:06:04.000> n<00:06:04.120> so<00:06:05.070> now<00:06:06.070> the<00:06:06.670> sum<00:06:06.910> of<00:06:06.940> the<00:06:07.210> first<00:06:09.360> squares

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
to n so now the sum of the first squares

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.240 
to n so now the sum of the first squares
of<00:06:10.480> odd<00:06:10.630> numbers<00:06:10.900> up<00:06:11.050> to<00:06:11.080> n<00:06:11.290> is<00:06:11.500> the<00:06:11.620> only<00:06:11.800> term

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
of odd numbers up to n is the only term

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.030 
of odd numbers up to n is the only term
here<00:06:12.550> that<00:06:12.580> we<00:06:12.820> don't<00:06:12.970> know<00:06:13.180> the<00:06:13.300> rest<00:06:13.480> of<00:06:13.630> here

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
here that we don't know the rest of here

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.300 
here that we don't know the rest of here
we<00:06:15.040> know<00:06:15.190> which<00:06:15.460> and<00:06:15.850> so<00:06:16.800> by<00:06:17.800> doing<00:06:18.040> some

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
we know which and so by doing some

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.150 
we know which and so by doing some
algebraic<00:06:18.880> manipulation<00:06:19.600> you<00:06:20.560> can<00:06:20.590> finally

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
algebraic manipulation you can finally

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.440 
algebraic manipulation you can finally
get<00:06:21.340> that<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:22.420> sum<00:06:22.750> of<00:06:23.100> the<00:06:24.240> squares<00:06:25.240> of<00:06:25.330> the

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
get that the sum of the squares of the

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.890 
get that the sum of the squares of the
first<00:06:25.840> odd<00:06:26.140> numbers<00:06:26.620> up<00:06:26.800> to<00:06:26.980> n<00:06:27.160> is<00:06:28.120> equal<00:06:28.180> to<00:06:28.600> n

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
first odd numbers up to n is equal to n

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.180 
first odd numbers up to n is equal to n
times<00:06:29.350> n<00:06:29.530> plus<00:06:29.560> 1<00:06:29.980> times<00:06:30.700> n<00:06:30.880> plus<00:06:30.910> 2<00:06:31.270> all<00:06:31.540> over<00:06:31.870> 6

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
times n plus 1 times n plus 2 all over 6

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.270 
times n plus 1 times n plus 2 all over 6
so<00:06:33.190> and<00:06:33.550> then<00:06:34.150> there<00:06:34.810> it<00:06:34.930> is<00:06:35.020> again<00:06:35.170> just<00:06:35.440> as<00:06:36.010> I

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
so and then there it is again just as I

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.710 
so and then there it is again just as I
originally<00:06:36.610> was<00:06:36.760> so<00:06:36.910> 1<00:06:37.090> squared<00:06:37.360> plus<00:06:37.540> 3

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
originally was so 1 squared plus 3

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.570 
originally was so 1 squared plus 3
squared<00:06:37.990> plus<00:06:38.140> 5<00:06:38.320> squared<00:06:38.350> 7<00:06:38.980> squared<00:06:39.340> all<00:06:39.550> the

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
squared plus 5 squared 7 squared all the

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.240 
squared plus 5 squared 7 squared all the
way<00:06:39.700> up<00:06:39.850> to<00:06:40.000> n<00:06:40.240> minus<00:06:40.300> 2<00:06:41.170> squared<00:06:41.530> plus<00:06:41.950> M

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
way up to n minus 2 squared plus M

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.690 
way up to n minus 2 squared plus M
Squared<00:06:44.040> yeah<00:06:45.070> there<00:06:45.280> you<00:06:45.340> go

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
Squared yeah there you go

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.660 
Squared yeah there you go
all<00:06:46.300> right<00:06:46.510> the<00:06:46.690> final<00:06:46.990> beacon<00:06:48.300> so<00:06:49.560> the<00:06:50.670> kind

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670 
all right the final beacon so the kind

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.480 
all right the final beacon so the kind
of<00:06:51.850> they're<00:06:52.750> somewhat<00:06:53.590> practical<00:06:53.740> not<00:06:54.310> really

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
of they're somewhat practical not really

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.040 
of they're somewhat practical not really
practical<00:06:54.850> application<00:06:55.480> is<00:06:55.600> figuring<00:06:55.960> out

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
practical application is figuring out

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.360 
practical application is figuring out
how<00:06:56.260> many<00:06:56.320> blocks<00:06:56.680> are<00:06:56.830> in<00:06:56.890> beacons<00:06:57.280> or

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
how many blocks are in beacons or

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.890 
how many blocks are in beacons or
pyramids<00:06:57.970> that<00:06:58.150> you're<00:06:58.450> building<00:06:58.750> in<00:06:58.840> the

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
pyramids that you're building in the

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.840 
pyramids that you're building in the
game<00:07:00.030> so<00:07:01.030> you<00:07:01.090> take<00:07:01.570> the<00:07:02.530> base<00:07:02.740> and<00:07:03.520> you<00:07:03.700> do

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:03.850 
game so you take the base and you do

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.610 
game so you take the base and you do
that<00:07:04.060> number<00:07:04.360> times<00:07:04.570> the<00:07:04.780> next<00:07:05.080> number<00:07:05.440> times

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
that number times the next number times

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.190 
that number times the next number times
the<00:07:05.710> next<00:07:05.860> number<00:07:06.100> so<00:07:06.220> 25<00:07:06.670> times<00:07:06.820> 26<00:07:07.300> times<00:07:07.420> 27

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.200 
the next number so 25 times 26 times 27

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.010 
the next number so 25 times 26 times 27
for<00:07:08.440> this<00:07:08.530> example<00:07:08.860> all<00:07:09.400> over<00:07:09.730> 6<00:07:09.940> minus<00:07:10.690> 1

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
for this example all over 6 minus 1

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.640 
for this example all over 6 minus 1
because<00:07:11.410> we<00:07:11.770> have<00:07:11.800> the<00:07:12.130> beacon<00:07:12.430> block<00:07:12.640> on<00:07:12.820> top

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.650 
because we have the beacon block on top

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:20.090 
because we have the beacon block on top
equals<00:07:15.870> 2924<00:07:16.870> iron<00:07:17.800> blocks<00:07:18.070> in<00:07:18.460> this<00:07:18.820> pyramid

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.100 
equals 2924 iron blocks in this pyramid

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.360 
equals 2924 iron blocks in this pyramid
alright<00:07:21.100> so<00:07:21.370> there<00:07:21.520> you<00:07:21.550> go<00:07:21.790> I<00:07:22.920> mean<00:07:23.920> nothing

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
alright so there you go I mean nothing

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.920 
alright so there you go I mean nothing
in<00:07:24.490> here<00:07:24.640> is<00:07:24.670> new<00:07:24.910> all<00:07:25.060> these<00:07:25.240> formulas<00:07:25.810> and

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
in here is new all these formulas and

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.540 
in here is new all these formulas and
stuff<00:07:26.050> exists<00:07:26.560> in<00:07:26.680> the<00:07:26.770> real<00:07:26.890> world<00:07:27.100> already<00:07:27.400> I

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
stuff exists in the real world already I

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.270 
stuff exists in the real world already I
just<00:07:27.790> thought<00:07:28.750> the<00:07:28.900> visualizations<00:07:29.830> and

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 
just thought the visualizations and

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.180 
just thought the visualizations and
application<00:07:31.240> to<00:07:31.480> beacons<00:07:32.260> would<00:07:32.800> be<00:07:32.890> a<00:07:32.920> little

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.190 
application to beacons would be a little

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.220 
application to beacons would be a little
bit<00:07:33.310> cool<00:07:33.570> although<00:07:34.570> in<00:07:34.720> reality<00:07:34.870> it's

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:35.230 
bit cool although in reality it's

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.590 
bit cool although in reality it's
probably<00:07:35.590> easier<00:07:35.890> just<00:07:36.010> do<00:07:36.400> 9<00:07:36.880> squared<00:07:37.210> plus<00:07:37.360> 7

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:37.600 
probably easier just do 9 squared plus 7

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.360 
probably easier just do 9 squared plus 7
squared<00:07:37.840> plus<00:07:37.990> 5<00:07:38.200> squared<00:07:38.560> plus<00:07:38.740> 3<00:07:38.920> squared<00:07:39.220> on

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.370 
squared plus 5 squared plus 3 squared on

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.980 
squared plus 5 squared plus 3 squared on
a<00:07:39.400> calculator<00:07:39.940> if<00:07:40.180> you're<00:07:40.420> figuring<00:07:40.780> out<00:07:40.870> how

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
a calculator if you're figuring out how

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.130 
a calculator if you're figuring out how
many<00:07:41.170> blocks<00:07:41.380> you<00:07:41.590> need<00:07:42.270> well<00:07:43.270> although<00:07:43.840> I<00:07:43.990> got

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.140 
many blocks you need well although I got

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.540 
many blocks you need well although I got
for<00:07:44.290> you<00:07:44.350> guys<00:07:44.410> today<00:07:44.530> so<00:07:44.830> thank<00:07:45.400> you<00:07:45.520> very
