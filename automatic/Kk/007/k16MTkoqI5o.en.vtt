00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it's sort of fairly simple and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.080 
it's sort of fairly simple and
understated<00:00:32.009> compared<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.820> some<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.030> the

simply at the moment at least quite

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
simply at the moment at least quite
difficult<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.090> hold<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.629> only<00:00:39.809> place

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.630 
I found online that we're selling them
as<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.590> company<00:00:43.920> called<00:00:44.010> forbidden<00:00:44.280> planet

for<00:00:48.149> 19<00:00:48.570> pounds<00:00:48.840> ninety-nine<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
for 19 pounds ninety-nine I have a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.830 
for 19 pounds ninety-nine I have a
feeling<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.180> may<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.629> bit

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
feeling that it may be a little bit

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.470 
feeling that it may be a little bit
cheaper<00:00:52.289> when<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.129> got<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> proper<00:00:54.030> release<00:00:54.270> I

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
cheaper when it's got a proper release I

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.139 
cheaper when it's got a proper release I
think<00:00:54.690> which<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.840> early<00:00:55.140> next<00:00:55.320> year<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.120> but<00:00:57.120> I

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
think which is early next year and but I

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.590 
think which is early next year and but I
simply<00:00:57.629> had<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.109> get<00:00:58.260> hold<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.739> these

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
simply had to get hold of one of these

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.599 
simply had to get hold of one of these
so<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:01.559> I've<00:01:01.680> done<00:01:01.710> I've<00:01:02.010> actually<00:01:02.190> got<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
so what I've done I've actually got to

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.189 
so what I've done I've actually got to
this<00:01:02.820> one's<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.210> friend<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> mine<00:01:03.629> which
