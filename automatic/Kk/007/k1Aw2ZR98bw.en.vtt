 big some flour all use powder 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.170

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.590
 good quality vanilla extract 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.420
 I have 2 spoons and a spatula in this 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.060
 bowl I have a little more flour 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.309
 sifted and I have butter in the bowl 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.840
 I'm going to use a palette to mix and 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.329
 I'm lucky to have a bowl 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.820
 rotary today 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.620
 you need to preheat the oven and to 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.180
 this recipe need a tray for 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.400
 cookies with waxed paper 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.350
 they need a grid to cool a 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.000
 roll an angled spatula or a 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.220
 sharp knife that they can use to 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.530
 take off the cookies I have the 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.270
 recipe measured quantities and conversions 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.270
 in the descriptive space below 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.520
 The first thing we will do is add the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.680
 baking powder to sifted flour 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.060
 this is going to make the cookies go up 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.060
 a little but not too much 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.070
 now they are throwing refined sugar 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.960
 little by little inside the mixer and the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.720
 we light and beat until the mixture 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.820
 it is very very soft and creamy 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.980
 make sure to clean the sides of the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.110
 bowl using your spatula so that all 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.780
 butter and sugar are included 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.060
 look for the mixture to take this color 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.530
 whitish you see here is a lot color 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.010
 lighter than the yellow of the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.680
 lighter and creamier butter and now 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.210
 add the egg and again beat until 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.010
 that the egg has been incorporated 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.930
 completely and its mixture follow 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:08.000
 beautifully light and creamy perfect 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.070
 now we add the flour as a third 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.880
 of the flour for now he was throwing 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.880
 with the measure 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.030
 and turn on the mixer at low speed 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.220
 so do not forget 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.410
 once the third of the flour has been 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.840
 incorporated well adds in the second 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.420
 third as half of what is left and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.490
 mix again the last third of the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.610
 flour I will mix it by hand so as not to 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.920
 force my mixer and you can see that the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.020
 mixture is still quite foggy 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.240
 raise the mixer 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.670
 and they add a good teaspoon of 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.320
 Vanilla essence or any flavor 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.960
 that they have decided to use in their 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.090
 Sugar cookies and mix well can 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.500
 add the flavor at this point or also 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.420
 when they are beating the mixture of 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.040
 butter with sugar now throws in 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.200
 the remaining flour and I'm going to mix it 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.330
 with my spatula or spoon 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.060
 until they see that everything is 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.370
 very well combined that you do not see anything of 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.580
 the flour and now they pour the mixture of 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.560
 shark on the table still looks 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.590
 quite foggy and here his hands come in 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.510
 they will knead the mixture for 2 to 3 minutes 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.880
 they want to bring this flour mixture 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.650
 lumpy until it becomes a dough 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.480
 smooth and homogeneous 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.550
 once they feel happy to have 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.040
 achieved this consistency in its mass 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.690
 form a large ball the Havana wrap 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.390
 in plastic fabric so you do not get 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.760
 no air and take them to 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.620
 refrigerator like one or two hours to 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.620
 that settle before using it 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.739
 they can leave it in the refrigerator until 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.540
 three days and they can also freeze the 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.190
 when they take it out of the refrigerator 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.349
 they remove the wrapper I'm going to go 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.720
 working with a third of the mass to the 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.670
 time when they start kneading the van 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.129
 see that it gets lumps to again because 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.319
 is very firm this mixture has been in 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.120
 the refrigerator for 12 hours so if 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.040
 see that it gets creamy do not enter 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.470
 panic because it 's the warmth of his hands 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.450
 the to join again will be a bit 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.730
 cold so do not be tempted to 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.129
 about kneading it they just want me to recover 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.870
 its good consistency to work it the 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.670
 why I work with a third 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.799
 of my mass at once is because once 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.510
 this mass gets very hot they have to 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.430
 Take it back to the refrigerator with 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.590
 one or two hours for him to grab one 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.510
 cold consistency and being able to work with 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.960
 she when they work with a third of the 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.090
 dough 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.100
 she stays cold and can work it 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.780
 when they finish with the first made in 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.729
 a good amount of flour on the 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.820
 table and also about the dough and the 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.740
 stretch with the roller can see what 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.419
 well that stretches but I keep it in 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.600
 movement so that it does not stick to the 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.460
 table and to achieve a homogeneous thickness 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.550
 is the thickness that I look for my 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.620
 cookies and now with the cutter of the 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.600
 store are cut their figures can 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.550
 see that I move my cutter from the sides 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.009
 so that they have a clean cut in the 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.349
 borders 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.479
 the flour that they have put on the table is 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.909
 so that the shapes of your cookies are 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.219
 take off without problems want to fill 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.439
 your tray make sure to use all your 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:08.149
 available mass can see that I use 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.569
 each cutter bit with 

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:10.569
 cookies 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.700
 they take these to the oven and they are going to cook 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.010
 pretty fast like 7 to 10 minutes 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.630
 they will know that they are ready when they observe 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.580
 the edges like golden brown 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.530
 just be careful with them 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.090
 when they are transferred from the tray 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.680
 cookies to the cooling rack 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.630
 because they are quite fragile when 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.300
 they are freshly baked I will show them 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.550

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.230
