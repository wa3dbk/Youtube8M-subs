00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.480
 here I would ticks Kuljic here 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.199
 The chain exists this year, pulling Kung Fu for the Neckar 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.639
 everything is possible 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.639
 then vocally American Bulldog 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.239
 to 70 billion 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.419
 and the animal made Sonthofen knows the solution must be light or weirich 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:25.300
 Zurich Munich 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.599
 Tons on the seventh fatality 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.169
 actually belong 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.540
 It is to buy the marketplace to buy happiness 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.690
 and somewhere where it turns up 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.690
 So soft is the papers this ideal 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 Of course with sexuality you can quickly subside 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.260
 and 8 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
 from 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.680
 Procap 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.010
 Cologne and I are very proud 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.700
 I was 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.400
 have you got comfortable 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.610
 Coskun Sun Genscher 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.310
 and to have 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.680
 I have 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.680
 should still 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.020
 and that's right 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 she would have to visit one of them a picture that's right 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.170
 so come 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.390
 to go with it 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.690
 and this 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.400
 Bush can get 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.930
 personnel law so 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.930
 in Berlin war always had to scrubland 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.260
 and so a contribution to it and as well as they sought to copy so that's what you call 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.610
 the idea 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.900
 this offers 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.400
 which one so 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.060
 Kushtrim points no broken leg 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.300
 and that did not happen 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.330
 were important 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.580
 because all positions 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580
 Although should 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120
 even flies 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.100
 the legs and then 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.879
 that's how the emerging wants to be after that was really angry so what 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.209
 when the time comes 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.629
 I'm almost on schedule 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.629
 Paris SID gift make you that's not so much Seeber so "not 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.239
 acceptable" 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.779
 I want to go again 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.779
 preferably in her shoes or something 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.769
 however, are not yet available 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.929
 sometimes like that 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:35.999
 4 so 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.999
 Mode that often comes in the course that was so 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.090
 no matter how young you could make her clap has 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.849
 the country has 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.789
 it is enough 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.189
 Nkunda will agree 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.639
 and to give the Bernese hands in case of problems 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.669
 a bit more complicated thing so 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.849
 it is not difficult 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.299
 I can promise that will work 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.920
 the track operator 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.339
 it's nice Biggs succeeds 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:08.889
 that likes 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.369
 and so important is his arms together 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.449
 just as resignation stiffens to Pauli 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.149
 and it is also important to Seib 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:21.889
 and I would have two more options 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.979
 that's right 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:25.819
 inconveniences 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.439
 So above average there 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.629
 I have to go to Merck 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.399
 but I can take legal action ships 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.489
 SES wanted complete 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.219
 he does not say anything to myself again 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.219
 then such a dealer 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.059
 okay now maybe I have crew 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.059
 and says lot are locked 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.309
 nobody knew that 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:53.839
 as a processor 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.699
 something like that is important because 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.409
 if they do not care about it at all they do not do it 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:03.089
 I want 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.279
 gained the momentum 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.159
 and I'm still here 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.769
 it's not important 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.009
 Sven Schubert Person the schools should Zoellick 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:18.269
 it's really bad focus topics Tel if the two together and I up you 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.269
 Crisis you have to make me really tall 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.139
 at Lippi "Before I camp Publisher's weeks in Bali, it's not easy 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.930
 could tip over 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.930
 it looks a bit better 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.940
 moreover, Frankenthal really shows there
