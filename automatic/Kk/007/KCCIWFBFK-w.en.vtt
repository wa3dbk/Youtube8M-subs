00:00:10.278 --> 00:00:15.628
 Good, the recipe that will prepare today is a cold tuna cake 

00:00:15.628 --> 00:00:19.480
 you'll see it's very easy to do. It becomes immediately 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.980
 and to do this we will need 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.170
 bread, east, and I showed mold 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.399
 in another cake 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.378
 This is long. If you do not have, because you catch 

00:00:32.378 --> 00:00:36.119
 what these slices without crust, so if you want to take less and save you the edge 

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.518
 and you do the double 

00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:40.100
 after tuna 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.160
 tuna in oil or sunflower or olive oil, which ye 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.929
 or, I have this tin is great but if not 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.329
 are approximately 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.710
 four cans five as much 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.530
 fried tomato 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.899
 mayonnaise 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.000
 and boiled eggs. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 The first thing we will do is peel the boiled eggs 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 to do so will 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.210
 well, if we take 

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:08.250
 the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.819
 the shot in marble or table 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:13.729
 and then later we can 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.719
 we can remove the 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:22.719
 smooth shell 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.300
 we will take eggs 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:41.299
 and itch 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.659
 when you already have the will put chopped boiled eggs into the bowl where 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.599
 we will mix all 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.280
 We reserve two eggs for later, to decorate 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.299
 now will 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.218
 with eggs, will add 

00:02:13.218 --> 00:02:16.308
 the tuna 

00:02:16.308 --> 00:02:21.348
 it all depends on how much you want to do 

00:02:21.348 --> 00:02:27.068
 and a few tablespoons of tomato sauce 

00:02:27.068 --> 00:02:34.068
 mix it well 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:41.179
 and if we see that we need more, such as 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:46.868
 as we add more 

00:02:46.868 --> 00:02:53.868
 and once we have our way, then we set up our cake 

00:02:55.368 --> 00:02:59.489
 wrap the plate where we will mount the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.759
 tuna cake 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:03.828
 with foil so it does not stain us 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.439
 and we started putting the layer below 

00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:11.598
 to which we will add 

00:03:11.598 --> 00:03:18.598
 the mixture that we have done 

00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:20.929
 extend well 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:23.468
 and we add 

00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:24.829
 the other piece 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:30.329
 While we press 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.989
 and put back again 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.259
 more 

00:03:35.258 --> 00:03:39.118
 our mix 

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:41.829
 and so we placing 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:48.829
 all layers 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.618
 and once you have finished 

00:04:00.618 --> 00:04:02.188
 we put 

00:04:02.188 --> 00:04:06.519
 the last piece 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.179
 and now will add 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:13.639
 mayonnaise 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.228
 and will extend well 

00:04:16.228 --> 00:04:19.938
 above our cake 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:24.659
 nothing happens if we were going to the sides why 

00:04:24.658 --> 00:04:27.519
 It interest us 

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:30.318
 we have to 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:37.319
 which cover the entire cake 

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.549
 And once, you already have everything well 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.460
 While we have extended mayonnaise 

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:48.378
 because now the last thing left is the two eggs that have saved 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.430
 we are going to grate 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.538
 and let 

00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:58.579
 to put over decoration 

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:03.038
 especially not matter whether, if Spots 

00:05:03.038 --> 00:05:07.288
 what is around because as we will remove then 

00:05:07.288 --> 00:05:12.088
 silver paper, will not be perfect 

00:05:12.088 --> 00:05:15.769
 Well, now that we have left for a while in the fridge 

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:18.198
 to end 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:25.199
 making body, for now we can remove the protections put him 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:32.169
 and voila, we have the result of our cold tuna cake 

00:05:32.168 --> 00:05:35.698
 as you see it has not been a perfect presentation 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.210
 and you are ready to take. Above all, this type of 

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:40.799
 pastel recommend taking cold 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.999
 It is more good 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:45.709
