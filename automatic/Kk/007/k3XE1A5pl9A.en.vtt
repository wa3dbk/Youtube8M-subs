00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.259
 On the right side to the left ten thousand spectators played a beautiful night 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.509
 Serious in the evening 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.690
 These gates should 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.489
 for the 1 5 defeat 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:14.789
 Heinz Rummenigge 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.570
 surprise his opponent 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.300
 Sept Weichelt 28 year old 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.279
 Tone played against Tiraspol in the high heels against Peter Löhr 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.220
 that the distribution of tasks 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.119
 in the storm 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.279
 Remler 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.119
 on the defender's post could have 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.119
 Time to switch to midfield and to prey 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.090
 36 million 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.620
 Düsseldorf 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.770
 wolfgang 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.230
 Nachrodt Oval teams take care photo 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.199
 here are some 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.130
 Show deposits but his 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.460
 Defender on 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.550
 hold at the pole 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.550
 the defense of Dusseldorf quite keep up 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.320
 Rummenigge 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.649
 again and again these combinations in front of the penalty area 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.010
 Toenis and Homberger 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.010
 on the left attack side 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.720
 those were interesting duels 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.720
 Ludger may call the number 7 with a big reason 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.000
 and I wanted to prove that here 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.990
 he wrote a year ago 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.070
 a reinforced I ran through the rags 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.070
 they are pretty much the same 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.620
 Lohmann cart option 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.280
 the about to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.270
 not tested 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.320
 the Düsseldorfer still put a header far away from the goal and one 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.040
 Free kick by Denzel 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.440
 we want the first view 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.440
 Norbert Nachtweih very hard 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.320
 the FW is here on the flank over 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 but thanks the remaining company 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.700
 then after about 25 minutes 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.760
 and behind 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.540
 Enrichment here already 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.860
 with the hip the attacked Riesch referee perch 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.340
 many fliers not rich complains loudly 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580
 whether the characters are through 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.580
 no information about whether the bayern-captain 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.069
 brought down fair 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.719
 and how eco Bayern have promised 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.619
 Walter a bit high poker but promptly counterattack we should a lot 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.679
 understand 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:26.559
 no goal has fallen further 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:28.199
 Rummenigge 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.199
 this time from working 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:35.999
 further throw-in 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.479
 was he he could threaten the ride 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.769
 get into trouble 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.039
 Denkendorf a few meters 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.489
 but that one noticed the Belgian goalkeeper one 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.489
 certain Malvo 17 before this price level 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.719
 let alone 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:56.800
 the Dusseldorf 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.909
 always tried again 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.909
 slow down. "I never came to light 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.229
 the drive up 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.109
 for the first and only time in public 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.759
 So Murray creates 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:11.599
 and how feels 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.599
 at the same time, at worst, it seemed to lie 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.449
 Heinz Rummenigge 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.049
 next to the pretty animals there 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.829
 under phone the soul 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.710
 the Brocken had played his jokes he already had seven goals 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.710
 It can not be more at this Beijing 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.199
 against Brender 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.549
 karl-heinz Rummenigge 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:44.739
 Dumberger 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.739
 the attacking machine of Bayern continues 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.659
 but she did bring 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.659
 Koenigstein 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:59.929
 also something hinders the Bayern Mountain the title leads over we finally 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:02.929
 once to give a penalty but already 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.139
 the only opportunity 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.419
 karl-heinz Rummenigge 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.739
 not as effective as last in Bremen 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.900
 Unterberger 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.870
 you could already from 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.870
 Fate should give the Bavarian a joke 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.469
 should the affected 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.639
 from the Olympic Stadium in clubs 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.240
 kidnap 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.590
 following this scene 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.279
 Rummenigge 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.490
 Libro Augenthaler 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.490
 and 8 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.999
 Domberger 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.999
 again and again the duel against Burma 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.259
 Rummenigge usually second winner against Sepp Weikl only later he became 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.740
 stronger and Klaus Augenthaler 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.240
 who at the seven to zero 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.240
 Meeting in the last session two goals 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.279
 measure greater distance 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.529
 Rummenigge and Breitner 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.270
 from RightNow following the towering actor 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.039
 only in midfield 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.039
 but in the conclusion 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.919
 karl-heinz Rummenigge 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.620
 and now we will follow 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.809
 by karl-heinz Rummenigge 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:27.340
 Min see the captain 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.620
 Freigericht 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.819
 disagree with Rummenigge's decision though to shoot 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.870
 for the here 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.870
 a barrel 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:39.339
 make up 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.339
 Bardenitz can do that too 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.960
 how to give up pit Edwardson 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.419
 Breitner 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.249
 and karl-heinz 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.249
 again stands for Bayern, the goal did not want to fall 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.419
 65 min 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.119
 Aufbahrung the fault 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:02.279
 by Joseph Eifel 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.939
 Again, you would have to give penalties 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.939
 he jumped that 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.749
 Referee and belly 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.960
 continue on to 4 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.219
 the Dusseldorf 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:21.969
 they might almost come to suspect 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.009
 that you are here 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.919
 possibly a point win or a winter attracted from the composite 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.909
 Rummenigge 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:35.740
 in the last exercise 21 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.430
 Bertrand Fr 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.919
 Wife from and this time 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.339
 gives the referee 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:46.259
 the slow motion does not exist here either 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.229
 information 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:51.129
 in the beginning 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:54.499
 acted as the dice fall 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:58.649
 fall with his hip with his arm the seventh Bayern Munich striker 

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:02.309
 Anyway, there was a penalty Paul Breitner transformed in the last 

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:03.419
 Exercise 5 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.080
 Parrot 18 hits 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.740
 the 75 votes ple 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.740
 he has his nerves against Wolfgang Gräf 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:12.860
 he slipped 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.419
 the captain 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:16.309
 a bit 

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:17.689
 let announce 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.560
 Paul Breitner title to make enemy told the referee 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.070
 Year five of the best shape could give picture meter 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.649
 help now finally 

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:27.859
 Jörg Berger the coach of the Düsseldorf then brought two strikers 

00:07:27.859 --> 00:07:30.439
 with Rudy Boris 

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:33.759
 want to be unhurt and content many 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.619
 Bayern determined further the axis 

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:39.939
 Rummenigge 

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:41.960
 now stronger against SAP AG 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.960
 Dr slower but was a lot of power 

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:49.649
 and whom she 

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:52.309
 the defense of the pot 

00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:56.279
 Bayern APA more Pahl do not stylize themselves 

00:07:56.999 --> 00:08:00.229
 1 0 the final score and the gate to 3 4 

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:01.830
 you had to like some criticism
