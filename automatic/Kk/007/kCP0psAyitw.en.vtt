00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.890
 the days what pleasure gives me power 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.200
 accompany you as every occasion through 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.660
 of millennium television we throw a 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.280
 look quickly at the conditions in 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.080
 how much the satellite image is 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.699
 maintains an increase in cloudiness 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.150
 of part of the Mexican Republic 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.039
 during the last hours this is associated 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.079
 to one of the branches of the stream of 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.849
 jet and cloudiness is dragged 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.650
 from the Pacific to the country to 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.079
 be generating these conditions in 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.450
 sectors of the western center northeast 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.130
 also some northern parts of the 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.809
 republic are being affected with 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.969
 this new snet however despite 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.379
 this rain conditions have not been 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.750
 made present in a good part of the country 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.090
 during the last hours this the most 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.340
 relevant that I can comment on the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.230
 city ​​of mexico this day the 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.480
 temperature is reaching up to 21 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.489
 degrees centigrade the minimum value is of 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.649
 a grade only 6 degrees sorry 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.839
 keeps the sky half cloudy but 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.000
 pretty cold during the morning to 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.010
 this Monday and Tuesday a lot of attention is 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.320
 opens the probability of rain so 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.740
 occasional minimum temperatures between 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.390
 the 7 and 8 maximum of 20 at least up 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.860
 on Tuesday and then on Wednesday 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.660
 Sky conditions 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.450
 half bent with a minimum value of 8 and 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.310
 maximum of 23 degrees centigrade for the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.290
 City of Monterrey 10 with 20 sky 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.270
 half cloudy the next few days there 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.920
 changes this Monday I take advantage still not 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.020
 rain is expected the minimum temperature 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.000
 is 10 degrees again the maximum no 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.100
 Exceeds 20 Tuesdays and Wednesdays 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.900
 variable cloudiness the sky totally 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.150
 closed again lowered the temperature 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.490
 minimum between 11 and 13 maxims that do not 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.750
 exceed 15 or 17 and the probability of 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.820
 rain of course valid at least 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.590
 for these two days in the city of 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.540

 reaching up to 22 degrees cloudiness 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.350
 variable will be predominant in the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.630
 course of this day equal for 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.060

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.619
 the 24 degrees we talk quickly about 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.479

 sky totally sunny values ​​that go 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.830
 from 29 to 32 of course 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.209
 do not rule out any probability of 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.040
 Precipitation in Querétaro and Tlaxcala 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.620
