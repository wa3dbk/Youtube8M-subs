00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 good kids jon try we are here 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.640
 in a new video of gta 5 and today you 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.890
 I come to teach a character skin 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.170
 Well, this time it's trevor that 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.670
 let's turn into a zombie as you see 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.259
 let's get off the car as I told the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.299
 modeling 3d models and all that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.529
 they are not in the game yet but 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.600
 yes you can do something pretty cool 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.160
 As you can see here, he has the whole face and in 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.020
 stained zombie plan and such and the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.210
 T-shirt stained with blood and inside 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.039
 like how you see it in your guts 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.180
 it's not something weird, it's good that 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.859
 after all it's a drawing in the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.750
 T-shirt not that far from the truth 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.070
 it seems pretty pretty real pretty 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.950
 cool but good because it is if you approach 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.710
 the bitch is not that good 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.940
 it's so incredibly finished but 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.829
 Well the truth is that it's pretty cool 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.930
 and I just wanted to teach it so that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.760
 you can see it and whenever I'm cool 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.649
 teach everything all the progress that comes 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.510
 to see in the molds aspect almost everything 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.640
 this I always like to teach it like this 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.250
 that nothing like here you see trevor 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.379
 zombie like I said in a previous video that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.899
 as the batman then when finally 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.760
 get two hackers to master what 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.890
 it comes to be the aspect of 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.899
 of modeling 30 and all that is going to be 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.729
 much more handsome and much better that is going to 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.650
 be totally incredible but for now 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.320
 what can be done is basically 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.360
 paint paint his face do things 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.860
 in the shirt pretty cool paint it 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.090
 you see the pains that the arms have and 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.979
 all that the truth that looks is full 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.920
 of veins is really pretty good 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.570
 done because as you can see the body and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.820
 hands and all that is pretty cool 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.039
 but well, the only thing that would be enough or 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.330
 either is that they have gone too far 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.250
 by before the stomach rises and 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.869
 around here the spine is that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.030
 it's pretty amazing, I do not like 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.440
 here I am here with my car dgt had 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.330
 I teach you in a video does a lot 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.979
 time how all this was done and is not 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.080
 It's worth it, I just wanted to show you 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.149
 a new character a new a new 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.330
 modification that is this is worth he we have 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.860
 the zombie that is clover we are also 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.869
 seeing another one that is a little bit fake 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.399
 also and that's why I do not know whether to upload 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.110
 voices and that I will upload it to teach you 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.869
 even though you already know that I'm even though 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.490
 a little a little fake or even that 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.750
 it looks perfect because I like it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.979
 teach it so that at least what 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.140
 you can see and have someone who 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.000
 we teach everything new in mods 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.649
 and all this that I emulate this is a 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.420
 seen one of ironman that the truth is 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.000
 what 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.910
 for me in my favorite superhero and the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.410
 we really want the quite but that 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.930
 pass is a little fake a little bit 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.489
 more trash I believe but well I do not know 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.810
 it's pretty cool what makes it not 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.130
 wearing iron armor or anything like that 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.560
 just like it's painted 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.970
 Ironman and well, it's a little weird 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.790
 but it looks pretty cool and I think that 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.620
 it is not removed tomorrow the friends upload 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.930
 of the new flash this that I love be 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.370
 it's tremendous how I lost such a flying 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.500
 I already had this in a video but good 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.550
 simply the truth is that it amuses me 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.989
 very much I think I'm never going to 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.330
 uninstall or that is something quite 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.580
 cool how are you saying then nothing 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.709
 I just hope it's purple on 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.269
 iron man costume if I can I'll show it 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.700
 tomorrow because it's pretty cool that 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.410
 As I said, do not expect the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.940
 skin are super real for now until 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.650
 that we have the modeled 3d voucher 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.420
 well to nothing because I just already 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.670
 I will teach and nothing I think you fall in love 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.769
 kids to refer to with like if you 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.840
 cool all this kind of little things for 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.280
 true apart from the characters and the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.600
 cars that I am teaching tuned and 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.480
 all that good with their license 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.980
 decision tomorrow yes yes I can apart from 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.180
 all this what else you want to see in plan 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.989
 demos 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.750
 and all these things one thing to do 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.160
 we are going to 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:22.570
 Respond to the zombie to see the difference 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.880
 and we have it here we have the zombies 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.450
 normal like that and if they kneel before me 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.420
 I'm the zombie king, it does not slip very much 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.100
 there good it seems that it helps me 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.780
 shirt is better than yours the 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.150
 truth is that I do not know honestly if 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.670
 I would have been the creator of this that 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.990
 I know do not be I have no fucking idea 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.580
 I have put so much that on the shirt 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.320
 that you see through that it shows 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.820
 a bit fake if they had painted 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.440
 maybe as these treat here then what 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.650
 better even better than with the 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.330
 T-shirt that he wore to the simo but good 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.500
 it's pretty cool just what it is 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.120
 the skin and all that yes that's pretty 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.410
 okay so we 're not going to complain and 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.940
 some kids, I hope we are 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.850
 side that really is something where there is 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.010
 favorites and until the next video 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.010
 I am stronger and you know it 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.610
 why 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.039
 why
