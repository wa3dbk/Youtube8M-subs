00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.960
 and very good to all crazy people that such 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.880
 welcome once again to the channel and 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.560
 you are already seeing the location as 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.230
 you will have seen in the title I am going to 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.970
 teach how to get infinite money 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.480
 let's not say without using any kind of 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.910
 tricks 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.670
 or sÃ©ase without running out of our 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.320
 achievements and without the self saved as 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.320
 you have seen the location is there in the 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.020
 you have to look for it a little bit 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.060
 let's say the tissues I wanted to give a 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.760
 advice and is that when you get into the 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.010
 mall you are going to see as a stain that makes 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.920
 peak shape say inwardly 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.350
 sea â€‹â€‹then guide us on that march 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.719
 keep moving forward and in 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.920
 followed you will see it in front that 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.360
 we have to do after one time 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.640
 take the briefcase as you have seen 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.410
 as you have seen what I have done has 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.489
 been changing character 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.860
 the crosshead in xbox in play 3 then 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.620
 down we leave you pressed down 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.989
 we change character and when we return to 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.940
 character again original in this case 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.730
 from michael and I was changing with 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.540
 franklin say that when changing 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.750
 character the objects and let's say 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.220
 what it does is regenerate then you 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.830
 you take the briefcase you change to another 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.530
 character then by changing again to 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.720
 maikel what the game does is regenerate 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.710
 that briefcase and regenerate that scenario 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.229
 to put it somehow 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.619
 The truth is that it is a trick 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.420
 clichÃ© I do not know how to call it but what 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.619
 yes I tell you is to take advantage because 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.710
 surely they take it away 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.440
 next you are going to see another of the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.979
 areas where there are suitcases worth are I think 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.540
 which are about 5 or 6 zones but these two 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.790
 areas let's say they are the easiest and 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.009
 I advise you to try it try this trick 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.930
 in all of them because, for example, as you have 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.200
 seen in the first clip 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.510
 doing the trick gave me 25 thousand dollars 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.050
 but in this however he just took me 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.560
 at 7500 I thought it was some characters 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.870
 in plan that each location had 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.150
 a character and so on but the truth is 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.970
 I did not try with everyone and it just gave me 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.830
 7500 so apparently there's 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.230
 locations of less money and more 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.840
 money I've also seen 12 thousand like that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.910
 that what I recommend is that 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.680
 try all the zones to 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.690
 continuation at the end of the video and if not 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.700
 in the description I'll leave a couple of 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.830
 images where they look like they are taken 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.570
 of the guide and you can see all the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.850
 locations of the cases 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.310
 although you do not see it on video but not 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.620
 It finds it usually costs much I 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.590
 this videos to the briefcases I've 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.870
 got to figure out through that 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.090
 image of the guide and it was not very 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.470
 complicated so nothing guys I hope 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.010
 that has helped you I hope that I have 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.150
 liked I think it's the tricks and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.820
 most interesting things that are here 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.840
 in the gta take advantage to buy the 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.819
 ferraris to buy you the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.340
 the marijuana store like I did 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.129
 and others take this trick because 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.860
 surely I already tell you the rockstar 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.269
 the first update surely what 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.580
 remove so I would recommend you 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.470
 take advantage of that that has been all guys already
