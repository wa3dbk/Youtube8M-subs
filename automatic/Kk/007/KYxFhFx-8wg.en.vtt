made frame if you need to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.870 
made frame if you need to
use<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.860> as<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.010> get<00:02:43.250> closer<00:02:43.460> to<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.700> center

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
use it as you get closer to the center

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.120 
use it as you get closer to the center
pin<00:02:44.150> sometimes<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.750> got<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.990> support<00:02:45.110> black<00:02:46.100> a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
pin sometimes you got to support black a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.010 
pin sometimes you got to support black a
little<00:02:46.490> bit<00:02:46.640> then<00:02:47.090> we<00:02:47.180> have<00:02:47.300> our<00:02:47.420> circle<00:02:47.660> gauge

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
little bit then we have our circle gauge

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.220 
little bit then we have our circle gauge
which<00:02:48.320> is<00:02:48.560> our<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:50.060> our<00:02:50.300> degree<00:02:50.660> gauge<00:02:50.930> and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
which is our is our degree gauge and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.290 
which is our is our degree gauge and
that<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:52.100> claps<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.730> circle<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.180> the
