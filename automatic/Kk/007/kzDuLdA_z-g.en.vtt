00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.519
 a super greedy recipe for this 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.260
 autumn this is the pecan persona 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.090
 for this recipe you will need 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.370
 a shortbread dough either homemade or 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.839

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:24.510

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:26.939
 vanilla 250 g maple syrup more than 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:33.120
 50 g of butter here I choose denial 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:39.390

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.270
 that is, brown sugar once 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.059
 you have prepared all that rattles forward 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.670
 you will be able to dispose your dough to 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.969
 sanded pie in the mold provided for this 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.969
 effect 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.219
 if you feel uncomfortable, you can withdraw the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.109
 greaseproof paper is that it has a chisel 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.630
 simply with your finger 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.030
 as I do and you will be able to 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.500
 you prepare the pie so me 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.149
 I use my for one to do that 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.100
 to give you an acceptable form to 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.619
 the pie and the preparation all 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.720
 whole during that time forget 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.320
 not to put your oven to preheated to 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.580
 180 degrees and once the dough is 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.140
 arranged in the mold 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.810
 you'll be able to sting with a 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.509
 fork and arrange big weights if 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.220
 you have to bake it pretty much 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.899
 ten minutes to fifteen minutes to 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.000
 that she is just starting to cook but 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.640
 that it does not swell you will take 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.229
 175 grams of pecan and the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.549
 coarsely grind 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.429
 for that you can do it 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.709
 manually ie by crushing in 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:49.459
 small pieces the pecans or 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:51.170
 otherwise you take a firm utensil and 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.250
 you crush it until it has the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.250
 desired consistency 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.590
 you then pour all the ingredients 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.010
 liquids together so the melted butter 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.380
 the 3rd brown sugar 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.480
 of course maple syrup an element 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.030
 essential of this recipe and you go 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.380
 all hearing and together vigorously 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.110
 until there are no bigger 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.700
 eyes that it is well homogeneous and a 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.890
 Once this preparation is ready 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.800
 you will be able to add the walnuts 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:40.510
 pecan saw roughly and once 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:42.130
 more turned the preparation you go 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.300
 can add a tablespoon 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:50.410
 vanilla or vanilla truth if 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:54.150
 you have a little bit obviously 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.150
 mix the preparation one more time 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.260
 once the paw vote paw 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.630
 and prebaked a little bit not too much 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.850
 go pour the preparation in all 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.100
 the mold and unify a little the little 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.600
 preparation so that there is not everything 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:24.100
 and pecan in one side 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:26.710
 obviously with the rest of your nuts 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.990
 pecan you'll be able to decorate the top 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.220
 from the preparation of the after-late so 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.950
 that's what we'll be able to see like that 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.360
 will be cooked so it's up to you to create the pattern 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.690
 that you wish you can put in 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.090
