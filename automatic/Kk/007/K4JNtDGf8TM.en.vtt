00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:12.240
 June 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.390
 you still know this song from the beat 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.080
 all you need is love everything 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.150
 need is love right you have love 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.200
 is the bread of the soul 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.820
 and we need you to have children 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.090
 And yet I come across when I am with people 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.570
 often talk about a very divided 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.510
 echo happiness on the one hand 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.890
 a happy childhood accepted 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.670
 be the first love the first baby that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.359
 first grandchild in arm and carry on 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.210
 the other side the stark opposite 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.730
 rejection already from children's legs 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.750
 rejection in school refusal on 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.090
 workplace disappointed yearnings 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.969
 maybe even abuse some 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.460
 suffer from it in the old age and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.280
 Psychologists even claim the first 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.190
 three years are shaping our life totally 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.340
 oh dear , we are now 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.690
 set caught our own coinage 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.740
 We're on a train from when I'm 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.690
 come down again 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.700
 just because we have a bad childhood 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.920
 I certainly did not believe that 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.750
 on 8 march at zdf worship want 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.579
 we will deal with this topic 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.810
 and from a very specific 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.470
 Perspective from the perspective of 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.640
 love between parents and children 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.979
 By the way, Jesus uses this one 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.460
 also often in his eyes 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.320
 equals and that has its reason 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.579
 This love is not just one 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.939
 feeling but she is a decision 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.299
 stand together 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.719
 no matter who I am no matter where I come from 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.210
 no matter how i look no matter how i am currently 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.310
 I'm on it 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.520
 be curious and celebrate with us 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.399

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.880
