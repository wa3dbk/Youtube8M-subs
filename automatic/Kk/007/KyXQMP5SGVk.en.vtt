you a working real duplicator in tu14
BAM<00:00:16.080> alright<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:16.920> actually<00:00:17.369> already<00:00:17.550> have

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and I keep telling them that the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.460 
and I keep telling them that the
semi-auto<00:00:21.180> one<00:00:21.449> works<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.990> they<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.260> don't

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
semi-auto one works and they just don't

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.980 
semi-auto one works and they just don't
listen<00:00:22.619> keep<00:00:23.400> asking<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.869> know

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
listen keep asking for it so if you know

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.509 
listen keep asking for it so if you know
why<00:00:25.199> there's<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.560> rel<00:00:25.769> duplicator<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.430> was

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
why there's a rel duplicator that was

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.429 
why there's a rel duplicator that was
fully<00:00:26.789> automatic<00:00:27.359> except<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.900> doesn't<00:00:28.289> work

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
fully automatic except that doesn't work

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.679 
fully automatic except that doesn't work
anymore<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.119> have<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.269> do<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.539> go

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
anymore so what you have to do is go

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.120 
anymore so what you have to do is go
these<00:00:30.869> semi<00:00:31.170> auto<00:00:31.439> routes<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.920> we're<00:00:32.040> gonna

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
these semi auto routes so we're gonna

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.180 
these semi auto routes so we're gonna
build<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.640> rapid<00:00:33.000> pulsar<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.190> redstone

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
build a rapid pulsar like so redstone

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.490 
build a rapid pulsar like so redstone

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.520 
of course you probably do just throw a
lever<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:44.789> somewhere<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.440> asked<00:00:46.440> we're

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
lever in here somewhere I asked we're

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.450 
lever in here somewhere I asked we're
gonna<00:00:46.649> turn<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.829> off<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.250> throw<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
gonna turn it off and then throw a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.670 
gonna turn it off and then throw a
sticky<00:00:47.730> piston<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.390> we're<00:00:49.379> gonna<00:00:49.469> put

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
sticky piston here we're gonna put

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.860 
sticky piston here we're gonna put
redstone<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.489> mean<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> powered<00:00:51.420> rail<00:00:51.600> power

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
redstone I mean a powered rail power

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.350 
actually i'll say this i haven't tried
it<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.159> survival<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.729> should<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.150> rails

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
it in survival but it should the rails

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.480

shouldn't<00:01:27.780> push<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> block<00:01:28.259> if<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.130> didn't<00:01:29.310> put

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
shouldn't push a block if so didn't put

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.640 
shouldn't push a block if so didn't put
something<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.479> can't<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.810> moved<00:01:31.049> but

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
something like that can't be moved but

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.469 
something like that can't be moved but
then<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:33.090> spam<00:01:33.450> the

then all you do is that just spam the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.660 
then all you do is that just spam the
left<00:01:33.810> trigger<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.920> hold<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> down<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.549> think

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
left trigger or hold it down and think

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.880 
left trigger or hold it down and think
it's<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> while<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.450> hold<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.659> down

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
it's a while you can just hold it down

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.469 
it's a while you can just hold it down
but<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.369> Luke<00:01:38.670> liability

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
