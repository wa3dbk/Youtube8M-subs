00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
down just basically it's not really

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.160 
down just basically it's not really
swinging<00:00:48.059> enough<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.570> cans<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:49.020> anything

swinging enough but it cans or anything

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.959 
swinging enough but it cans or anything

it's<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.450> shorter<00:02:28.780> silencer

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
it's a shorter silencer

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
hardware and we just pretty much change

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.309 
hardware and we just pretty much change
the<00:02:46.329> bars<00:02:46.510> because<00:02:46.690> it's<00:02:46.930> personal

back<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.389> day<00:03:10.510> when<00:03:10.690> he<00:03:10.720> was<00:03:10.900> on<00:03:11.019> harmless

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
back in the day when he was on harmless

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.530 
back in the day when he was on harmless
so<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:12.370> best<00:03:12.579> bike<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.940> over<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.810> it's

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
so the best bike is over and it's

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.800 
so the best bike is over and it's
because<00:03:14.959> JC<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:15.530> built<00:03:15.829> it<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.450> it's<00:03:17.450> just<00:03:17.510> it's

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
because JC I built it and it's just it's

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.360 
because JC I built it and it's just it's
nice<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.170> have<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.290> brand<00:03:18.650> new<00:03:18.799> bike<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.280> they

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
nice to have a brand new bike and they

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.979 
nice to have a brand new bike and they
take<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.150> all<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.269> way<00:03:20.390> down<00:03:20.599> with<00:03:20.719> a<00:03:20.780> frame

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
take it all the way down with a frame

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.970 
take it all the way down with a frame
and<00:03:21.109> then<00:03:21.200> they<00:03:21.349> rebuild<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.859> so<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:23.090> rims<00:03:23.299> I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
and then they rebuild it so the rims I

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.380 
and then they rebuild it so the rims I
lace<00:03:24.980> up<00:03:25.219> their<00:03:26.200> D<00:03:27.200> IDs<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.269> they're<00:03:29.269> the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
lace up their D IDs and they're the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.539 
lace up their D IDs and they're the
stronger<00:03:29.780> ones<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.409> what<00:03:31.099> comes<00:03:31.310> on<00:03:31.459> the

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
stronger ones and what comes on the

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.030 
stronger ones and what comes on the
stock<00:03:31.819> I<00:03:32.090> think<00:03:32.989> all<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.170> Supercross<00:03:33.620> races

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
stock I think all the Supercross races

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.559 
stock I think all the Supercross races
and<00:03:34.220> run<00:03:34.370> div<00:03:34.790> than<00:03:34.939> these<00:03:35.090> ones<00:03:35.269> and

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
and run div than these ones and

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.229 
and run div than these ones and
highlight<00:03:36.379> some<00:03:36.409> up<00:03:36.650> on<00:03:36.769> stock<00:03:37.129> Honda<00:03:38.030> hubs

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
highlight some up on stock Honda hubs

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.660 
highlight some up on stock Honda hubs
because<00:03:38.450> again<00:03:39.379> I<00:03:39.409> think<00:03:39.530> on<00:03:39.859> this<00:03:40.010> stock

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
because again I think on this stock

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.770 
because again I think on this stock
stuff<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.180> awesome<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.709> do<00:03:43.040> use<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.430> 1.8<00:03:44.299> radiator

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
stuff is awesome I do use a 1.8 radiator

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.199 
stuff is awesome I do use a 1.8 radiator
cap<00:03:45.019> and<00:03:45.349> it<00:03:45.650> kind<00:03:45.829> of<00:03:45.889> keeps<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.310> pressure

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
cap and it kind of keeps the pressure

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.360 
cap and it kind of keeps the pressure
from<00:03:47.480> spilling<00:03:47.840> over<00:03:48.019> I<00:03:48.409> think<00:03:48.799> they<00:03:48.950> come

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
from spilling over I think they come

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.129 
from spilling over I think they come
with<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:49.549> one<00:03:50.239> more<00:03:50.329> than<00:03:50.420> one<00:03:50.599> so<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:50.870> just<00:03:51.019> have

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
with a one more than one so I just have

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:52.990 
with a one more than one so I just have
