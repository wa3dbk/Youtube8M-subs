00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
reliably get it to move off and then be

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.309 
reliably get it to move off and then be
safe<00:03:02.879> it's<00:03:03.060> essentially<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.720> talonflame

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
safe it's essentially the talonflame

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.990 
safe it's essentially the talonflame
strategy<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:04.920> talonflame<00:03:05.159> uses<00:03:05.579> tailwind

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
strategy that talonflame uses tailwind

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.610 
strategy that talonflame uses tailwind
to<00:03:06.180> boost<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.480> speed<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:06.959> now<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.500> have

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
to boost the speed and now you have

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.720 
to boost the speed and now you have
quick<00:03:07.859> guards<00:03:08.129> so<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.310> don't<00:03:08.459> get<00:03:08.549> knocked

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
quick guards so you don't get knocked

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.190 
quick guards so you don't get knocked
out<00:03:08.879> by<00:03:09.120> other<00:03:09.269> talent<00:03:09.629> flames<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:09.989> all<00:03:10.049> that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
out by other talent flames and all that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.930 
out by other talent flames and all that
it's<00:03:10.650> kind<00:03:10.799> of<00:03:10.890> same<00:03:11.040> idea<00:03:11.280> except<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.790> just

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
it's kind of same idea except it just

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.220 
it's kind of same idea except it just
grows<00:03:12.120> on<00:03:12.299> that<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> little<00:03:12.780> more<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.140> it's

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
grows on that a little more and it's

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.960 
grows on that a little more and it's
also<00:03:13.379> showing<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.890> diversity<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.459> supports

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
also showing the diversity of supports

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.879 
also showing the diversity of supports
that<00:03:15.480> support<00:03:15.810> Pokemon<00:03:16.169> aren't<00:03:16.620> just<00:03:16.769> out

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
that support Pokemon aren't just out

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.159 
that support Pokemon aren't just out
there<00:03:17.040> do<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.250> know<00:03:17.370> Throwdown<00:03:18.000> status<00:03:18.569> help

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
there do you know Throwdown status help

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.809 
there do you know Throwdown status help
the<00:03:19.319> out<00:03:19.440> like<00:03:19.889> maybe<00:03:20.190> just<00:03:20.519> help<00:03:20.669> you<00:03:20.790> out

the out like maybe just help you out
like<00:03:21.030> mildly<00:03:21.419> this<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.109> huge<00:03:22.530> strategy<00:03:23.010> it's

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
like mildly this is a huge strategy it's

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.589 
like mildly this is a huge strategy it's
pretty<00:03:23.310> much<00:03:23.459> like<00:03:23.639> I'm<00:03:23.849> not<00:03:24.150> going<00:03:24.389> to<00:03:24.480> do

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
pretty much like I'm not going to do

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.020 
pretty much like I'm not going to do
anything<00:03:24.989> except<00:03:25.799> make<00:03:25.919> sure<00:03:26.040> he<00:03:26.340> gets<00:03:26.549> fed<00:03:26.730> in

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
anything except make sure he gets fed in

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.150 
anything except make sure he gets fed in
heat<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.810> League<00:03:28.169> of<00:03:28.290> Legends<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.650> but<00:03:29.010> he

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
heat that League of Legends so but he

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.559 
heat that League of Legends so but he
gets<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.519> sweep<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.940> he<00:03:30.030> gets<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.239> knock<00:03:30.419> out

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
gets to sweep and he gets to knock out

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.199 
gets to sweep and he gets to knock out
as<00:03:30.660> many<00:03:30.840> Pokemon<00:03:31.410> as<00:03:31.470> possible<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.849> that's

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
as many Pokemon as possible so that's

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.030 
as many Pokemon as possible so that's
kind<00:03:33.419> of<00:03:33.480> how<00:03:33.599> this<00:03:33.959> one<00:03:34.200> works<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.919> hope

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
kind of how this one works and I hope

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.430
