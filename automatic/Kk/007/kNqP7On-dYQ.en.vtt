00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.910 
the big kind of spoolie brush the
bristles<00:03:56.090> are<00:03:56.240> longer<00:03:56.960> on<00:03:57.080> one<00:03:57.290> end<00:03:57.530> than<00:03:57.890> the

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
bristles are longer on one end than the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.850 
bristles are longer on one end than the
other<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.610> then<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:58.790> is<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.210> sponge<00:03:59.840> tip<00:04:00.230> at

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
other and then that is the sponge tip at

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.840 
other and then that is the sponge tip at
the<00:04:00.920> end<00:04:02.110> all<00:04:03.110> right<00:04:03.190> I'm<00:04:04.190> going<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.400> take<00:04:04.610> just

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
the end all right I'm going to take just

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.830 
the end all right I'm going to take just
that<00:04:05.150> little<00:04:05.420> bit<00:04:05.600> that's<00:04:05.810> off<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.170> tip<00:04:07.840> let's

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
that little bit that's off the tip let's

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.330 
that little bit that's off the tip let's
see<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.130> says<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:11.530> take<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.709> spoolie<00:04:13.100> and

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
see so it says to take the spoolie and

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.960 
see so it says to take the spoolie and
brush<00:04:13.850> it<00:04:14.739> against<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:16.070> direction<00:04:16.280> of<00:04:16.850> the

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
brush it against the direction of the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.599 
brush it against the direction of the
eyebrows<00:04:17.480> oh<00:04:18.370> okay

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
eyebrows oh okay

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.980 
eyebrows oh okay
be<00:04:20.030> careful<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.140> sponge<00:04:21.500> tip<00:04:21.859> and<00:04:22.570> then<00:04:23.570> to

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
be careful of the sponge tip and then to

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.370 
be careful of the sponge tip and then to
go<00:04:24.290> in<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.550> direction<00:04:25.730> of<00:04:27.490> them<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.900> then

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
go in the direction of them and then

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.640 
go in the direction of them and then
fill<00:04:31.310> in<00:04:33.190> any<00:04:34.190> sparse<00:04:34.820> areas<00:04:34.940> which<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:36.260> ends

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
fill in any sparse areas which the ends

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.120 
fill in any sparse areas which the ends
of<00:04:36.770> my<00:04:36.800> eyebrows<00:04:37.310> definitely<00:04:38.240> tend<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.630> be<00:04:38.810> a

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
of my eyebrows definitely tend to be a

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.370 
of my eyebrows definitely tend to be a
little<00:04:40.130> bit<00:04:40.490> more<00:04:40.760> sparse<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.600> I'm<00:04:41.720> sure<00:04:41.990> if<00:04:42.229> I

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
little bit more sparse and I'm sure if I

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:59.410 
little bit more sparse and I'm sure if I
just<00:04:42.410> kind<00:04:42.919> of<00:04:44.830> brush<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:46.340> through

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.100 

so<00:05:00.410> there<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.620> go<00:05:00.740> there<00:05:01.160> is<00:05:01.580> one<00:05:02.110> eyebrow

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
so there you go there is one eyebrow

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.740 
so there you go there is one eyebrow
done<00:05:03.680> this<00:05:04.130> is<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.460> one<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.790> has<00:05:04.940> not<00:05:05.540> been

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
done this is the one that has not been

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.460 
done this is the one that has not been
touched<00:05:06.350> yet<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:06.950> looking<00:05:07.820> at<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.600> two<00:05:08.960> in<00:05:09.290> my

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
touched yet and looking at the two in my

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.520 
touched yet and looking at the two in my
little<00:05:10.220> mirror<00:05:10.610> this<00:05:11.180> is<00:05:11.360> definitely<00:05:11.780> like

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
little mirror this is definitely like

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.040 
little mirror this is definitely like
defined<00:05:13.430> this<00:05:13.730> eyebrow<00:05:14.120> has<00:05:14.450> a<00:05:14.510> lot<00:05:14.810> more

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
defined this eyebrow has a lot more

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.230 
defined this eyebrow has a lot more
definition<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.400> it's<00:05:16.520> not<00:05:16.670> like<00:05:16.940> I<00:05:17.060> said

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
definition to it it's not like I said

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.530 
definition to it it's not like I said
it's<00:05:17.390> not<00:05:17.480> like<00:05:17.750> a<00:05:18.280> stick<00:05:19.280> painted<00:05:19.730> on<00:05:19.880> kind<00:05:20.450> of

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
it's not like a stick painted on kind of

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.090 
it's not like a stick painted on kind of
a<00:05:20.750> deal<00:05:21.560> it's<00:05:21.980> definitely<00:05:22.550> just<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.210> more

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
a deal it's definitely just a more

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.720 
a deal it's definitely just a more
natural<00:05:25.100> look

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
natural look

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.430 
natural look
I'm<00:05:25.850> gonna<00:05:25.970> do<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.210> other<00:05:26.270> one<00:05:26.540> and<00:05:26.720> then<00:05:27.230> we

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
I'm gonna do the other one and then we

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.520 
I'm gonna do the other one and then we
can<00:05:28.030> see<00:05:29.030> how<00:05:29.210> they<00:05:29.360> both<00:05:29.510> look<00:05:29.810> together<00:05:30.080> it

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
can see how they both look together it

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.290 
can see how they both look together it
definitely<00:05:30.920> picks<00:05:31.070> up<00:05:31.160> a<00:05:31.250> little<00:05:31.490> bit<00:05:31.670> more<00:05:31.970> on

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
definitely picks up a little bit more on

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.780 
definitely picks up a little bit more on
the<00:05:32.600> sponge<00:05:33.110> tip<00:05:33.500> than<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:33.740> think<00:05:33.800> you<00:05:34.040> need<00:05:34.310> so

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
the sponge tip than I think you need so

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.970 
the sponge tip than I think you need so
definitely<00:05:35.240> try<00:05:35.930> and<00:05:36.020> get<00:05:36.230> that<00:05:36.350> off<00:05:36.590> it's

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
definitely try and get that off it's

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.340 
definitely try and get that off it's
probably<00:05:37.730> gonna<00:05:37.850> make<00:05:38.060> it<00:05:38.300> a<00:05:38.630> little<00:05:39.140> bit

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
probably gonna make it a little bit

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.900 
probably gonna make it a little bit
messy<00:05:39.710> I'm<00:05:39.980> not<00:05:40.220> sure<00:05:40.310> how<00:05:40.430> this<00:05:40.520> container

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
messy I'm not sure how this container

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.250 
messy I'm not sure how this container
will<00:05:41.120> hold<00:05:41.330> up<00:05:41.540> and<00:05:42.730> but<00:05:43.730> yeah<00:05:43.850> all<00:05:44.570> right<00:05:44.810> I'm

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
will hold up and but yeah all right I'm

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.800 
will hold up and but yeah all right I'm
gonna<00:05:45.500> flip<00:05:46.040> it<00:05:46.070> so<00:05:46.400> I<00:05:46.430> think<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:47.420> way<00:05:47.600> that

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
gonna flip it so I think the way that

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.170 
gonna flip it so I think the way that
it's<00:05:47.930> angled<00:05:48.410> if<00:05:48.650> you<00:05:48.770> use<00:05:48.950> these<00:05:49.250> longer<00:05:50.030> ones

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
it's angled if you use these longer ones

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.020 
it's angled if you use these longer ones
on<00:05:50.450> the<00:05:50.930> bottom<00:05:51.490> it'll<00:05:52.490> prevent<00:05:52.790> it<00:05:52.970> from

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
on the bottom it'll prevent it from

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.060 
on the bottom it'll prevent it from
hitting<00:05:53.780> yourself<00:05:54.020> in<00:05:54.350> the<00:05:54.440> face<00:05:54.590> like<00:05:54.800> I<00:05:54.950> hit

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
hitting yourself in the face like I hit

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:05.830 
hitting yourself in the face like I hit
the<00:05:55.220> first<00:05:55.430> time<00:05:56.260> so<00:05:57.260> go<00:05:58.780> against<00:06:04.540> this<00:06:05.540> one<00:06:05.690> is

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
the first time so go against this one is

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.350 
the first time so go against this one is
definitely<00:06:06.800> more<00:06:07.310> sparse<00:06:08.030> and

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:30.879 

fill<00:06:13.360> that<00:06:13.390> in

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.890 

so<00:06:31.460> there<00:06:31.789> we<00:06:31.909> go<00:06:32.030> what<00:06:32.180> there's<00:06:32.389> both

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
so there we go what there's both

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.110 
so there we go what there's both
eyebrows<00:06:33.560> done<00:06:34.310> um<00:06:35.139> that<00:06:36.139> is<00:06:36.349> the<00:06:37.120> coverage

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
eyebrows done um that is the coverage

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.230 
eyebrows done um that is the coverage
and<00:06:38.389> the<00:06:38.590> look<00:06:39.590> that<00:06:39.830> you<00:06:40.159> get<00:06:40.340> with<00:06:40.490> that<00:06:40.520> all

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
and the look that you get with that all

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.480 
and the look that you get with that all
right<00:06:41.389> so<00:06:41.539> there<00:06:41.719> is<00:06:41.870> both<00:06:42.289> eyebrows<00:06:42.800> done<00:06:43.039> in

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
right so there is both eyebrows done in

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.149 
right so there is both eyebrows done in
better<00:06:44.449> focus<00:06:44.900> this<00:06:45.020> time<00:06:45.259> sorry<00:06:45.680> that<00:06:45.919> whole

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:46.159 
better focus this time sorry that whole

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.159 
better focus this time sorry that whole
last<00:06:46.370> clip<00:06:46.729> was<00:06:46.909> pretty<00:06:47.389> much<00:06:47.539> out<00:06:47.780> of<00:06:47.900> focus

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
last clip was pretty much out of focus

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.110 
last clip was pretty much out of focus
except<00:06:48.650> for<00:06:48.830> all<00:06:49.039> of<00:06:49.250> the<00:06:49.430> close-ups<00:06:49.969> that<00:06:50.090> I

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
except for all of the close-ups that I

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.839 
except for all of the close-ups that I
was<00:06:50.300> doing<00:06:50.629> but<00:06:51.259> this<00:06:51.469> is<00:06:51.650> what<00:06:52.099> they<00:06:52.430> look

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:52.849 
was doing but this is what they look

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:57.490 
was doing but this is what they look
like<00:06:52.879> they<00:06:53.210> are<00:06:53.240> all<00:06:53.509> set<00:06:54.289> in<00:06:54.590> dry<00:06:55.280> um<00:06:56.500> first

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
like they are all set in dry um first

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.499 
like they are all set in dry um first
when<00:06:57.740> it<00:06:57.830> was<00:06:57.919> drying<00:06:58.159> it<00:06:58.400> did<00:06:58.610> almost<00:06:58.849> feel

00:06:59.499 --> 00:06:59.509 
when it was drying it did almost feel

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:02.320 
when it was drying it did almost feel
back<00:07:00.319> see<00:07:00.590> but<00:07:00.770> now<00:07:00.919> they're<00:07:01.310> completely<00:07:01.849> soft

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
back see but now they're completely soft

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.209 
back see but now they're completely soft
they<00:07:02.599> don't<00:07:02.780> feel<00:07:03.169> like<00:07:03.439> they're<00:07:03.620> glued<00:07:03.979> into

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:04.219 
they don't feel like they're glued into

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:06.459 
they don't feel like they're glued into
place<00:07:04.400> or<00:07:04.909> anything<00:07:05.060> like<00:07:05.300> that<00:07:05.330> I<00:07:05.719> really

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:06.469 
place or anything like that I really

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:08.559 
place or anything like that I really
like<00:07:06.620> how<00:07:06.740> they<00:07:06.860> look<00:07:07.069> I<00:07:07.279> think<00:07:07.370> the<00:07:07.909> color

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:08.569 
like how they look I think the color

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:10.809 
like how they look I think the color
match<00:07:08.750> is<00:07:08.990> really<00:07:09.319> good<00:07:09.650> for<00:07:10.009> the<00:07:10.310> natural

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:10.819 
match is really good for the natural

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:13.570 
match is really good for the natural
color<00:07:11.029> of<00:07:11.120> my<00:07:11.509> eyebrows<00:07:11.949> whether<00:07:12.949> being<00:07:13.250> for

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
color of my eyebrows whether being for

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.969 
color of my eyebrows whether being for
colors<00:07:13.969> it<00:07:14.210> may<00:07:14.419> be<00:07:14.479> more<00:07:15.080> difficult<00:07:15.139> for

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:15.979 
colors it may be more difficult for

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:20.499 
colors it may be more difficult for
certain<00:07:17.050> skin<00:07:18.050> tones<00:07:18.349> or<00:07:18.889> eyebrow<00:07:19.490> colors<00:07:20.210> to

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:20.509 
certain skin tones or eyebrow colors to

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:22.480 
certain skin tones or eyebrow colors to
find<00:07:21.020> the<00:07:21.169> match<00:07:21.349> but<00:07:21.710> I<00:07:21.770> do<00:07:21.860> think<00:07:22.069> those<00:07:22.250> four

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 
find the match but I do think those four

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.490 
find the match but I do think those four
colors<00:07:22.729> will<00:07:23.150> match<00:07:23.360> a<00:07:23.569> lot<00:07:23.750> of<00:07:23.900> people<00:07:24.199> really

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
colors will match a lot of people really

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.320 
colors will match a lot of people really
easily<00:07:24.680> this<00:07:25.310> is<00:07:25.370> a<00:07:25.550> little<00:07:25.789> bit<00:07:25.879> more<00:07:26.120> of<00:07:26.210> an

easily this is a little bit more of an

easily this is a little bit more of an
expensive<00:07:26.840> product<00:07:27.259> it<00:07:27.560> was<00:07:27.650> $22<00:07:28.639> for<00:07:29.000> the

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
expensive product it was $22 for the
