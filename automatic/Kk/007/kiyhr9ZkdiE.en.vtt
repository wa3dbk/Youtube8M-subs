00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
to camp and that sort of thing so we

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
to camp and that sort of thing so we
wanted<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.319> clean<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:45.619> up<00:01:45.679> a<00:01:45.799> little<00:01:46.009> bit

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
the players all of our killstreaks have

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.479 
the players all of our killstreaks have
some<00:02:00.020> aspect<00:02:00.469> of<00:02:00.530> interactivity<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.340> them

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:01.489 
some aspect of interactivity to them

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.520 
some aspect of interactivity to them
whether<00:02:01.700> now<00:02:02.509> it's<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.810> attack<00:02:03.020> chopper

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
whether now it's the attack chopper

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.199 
whether now it's the attack chopper
picking<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.009> spot<00:02:04.159> in<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.459> map<00:02:04.670> where<00:02:04.939> it<00:02:05.090> goes

picking a spot in the map where it goes

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.270 
picking a spot in the map where it goes
and<00:02:05.270> hovers<00:02:05.750> rather<00:02:06.619> than<00:02:06.739> just<00:02:06.890> letting<00:02:07.159> it

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
and hovers rather than just letting it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.430 
and hovers rather than just letting it
go<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.459> circle<00:02:08.239> around<00:02:08.329> them<00:02:08.599> out<00:02:08.720> with<00:02:09.319> the

go and circle around them out with the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.779 
go and circle around them out with the
mortar<00:02:09.679> team<00:02:09.860> for<00:02:10.069> example<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.519> can<00:02:10.640> pick

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
mortar team for example you can pick

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.309 
mortar team for example you can pick
three<00:02:11.030> locations<00:02:11.540> on<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.690> map<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.170> get<00:02:12.260> a

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
three locations on the map and get a

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.990 
three locations on the map and get a
really<00:02:12.620> fast<00:02:12.980> targeted<00:02:13.459> strike<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.880> those

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
really fast targeted strike to those

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.870 
really fast targeted strike to those
places<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.980> with<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.220> perk<00:02:16.430> design

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
places so with the perk design

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.520 
places so with the perk design
philosophy<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.540> we<00:02:17.720> weren't<00:02:17.930> every<00:02:18.139> perk<00:02:18.380> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
philosophy is we weren't every perk to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.259 
philosophy is we weren't every perk to
feel<00:02:18.739> like<00:02:18.859> it<00:02:19.010> supports<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.549> gate<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.790> specific

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
feel like it supports a gate a specific

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.059 
feel like it supports a gate a specific
