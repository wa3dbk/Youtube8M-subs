00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.700
 yes hello harmonic evening here with me 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.080
 in the kitchen i have wanderer and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.020
 I do not know who it is 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.699
 better there you are here today because 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.890
 I want to show you something nice because 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.340
 who would have thought it after the grandiose 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.180
 Success of the extract something new from the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.520
 Home giga and the incredible 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.469
 by simon by mister 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.960
 That's why we want to go here today 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.379
 together this ultimate ingenious 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.480
 start to enjoy and enjoy 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.430
 from the shark people pancakes and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.289
 for the holy people catching a bell 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.649
 come naturally to the tender 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.829
 the one whose good old as our 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.180
 gets white flour with new nice fill 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.300
 of course, good backdrop to sugar 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.100
 So you can do it with it above all else 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.909
 sorted but now there are 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.700
 also a few toads then delicious 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.380
 beautiful and that must not be missing 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.689
 and also a little vanilla sugar and yes 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.750
 of course all the right men 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:30.750
 There are only minced meat to top it off 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:32.070
 and there we start already 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.350
 then it will float a bit more colorful 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.600
 it should be popular in any case 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.520
 which means nothing else as hot 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.909
 do 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.240
 so get 80 grams and we get 250 grams 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.100
 butter 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.100
 if we take a bit of mathematics 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:57.380
 that just a bit of butter in japan 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.380
 was nice 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:07.120
 there can be a boat now because of the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.850
 about 500 grams I have one 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.800
 profi and apparently the flour in one 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.460
 corresponding relationship 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.460
 measuring cup the camera as the name it 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:30.400
 to be precise is 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.480
 four milliliters wanted a bit 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.520
 generous already with success because 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.980
 I would like to do it more fluidly 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.980
 to give two eggs for the first time 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.690
 2 pretty crazy 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.010
 next we want a bit 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.010
 to have vanilla 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.210
 the resolution must and finally 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:38.830
 now sugar and to be exact 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:40.540
 its 50 grams aspect had been so now 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.720
 we still have the butter manufacturing 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.450
 flow before then how they still with the 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:53.560
 Last milk has good all day 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:59.620
 Let's go add that now 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:01.170
 Girl, that 's a nice one 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:10.300
 Thing 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:18.750
 and now comes the typical 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:18.750
 Brother about 400 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.219
 so and after a marathon of about 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.849
 days we have five crucial to the 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:50.259
 especially nice and creamy 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:53.099
 cuddly and now of course that comes 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.099
 hottest of all 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:13.640
 and that my dear children is one 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.730
 almost perfect heathen humans drove only 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.590
 almost perfect is not about that 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.010
 original hunger like that and that was it 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.310
 beautiful 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.310
 so I just know to say when 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.220
 super recipe super easy to do and 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.350
 it tastes if you do it right 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.180
 So terrific say 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:50.710
 For that I give for one man 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.710
 Frankish 1 2 3 and what all around it 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.940
 There's only one thing left to do with this 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.940
 senses
