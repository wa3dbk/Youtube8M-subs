weapons though I've noticed

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.390 
weapons though I've noticed
I<00:01:11.369> know<00:01:11.820> Dawnbreaker<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.780> example<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.439> tried

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
I know Dawnbreaker for example I tried

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.740 
I know Dawnbreaker for example I tried
placing<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.360> hill<00:01:15.570> was

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
placing it in there and the hill was

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.530 
placing it in there and the hill was
kind<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.110> outside<00:01:16.680> there<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:18.509> I

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
kind of like outside there and but I

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.120 
kind of like outside there and but I
think<00:01:18.990> that's<00:01:19.170> actually<00:01:19.320> an<00:01:19.590> issue<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
think that's actually an issue with the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.679 
think that's actually an issue with the
sword<00:01:20.400> itself<00:01:20.759> because<00:01:21.000> when<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> place<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> on

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
sword itself because when I place it on

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.679 
sword itself because when I place it on
a<00:01:22.159> weapon<00:01:23.159> rack<00:01:25.850> yeah<00:01:26.850> okay<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.420> working

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
a weapon rack yeah okay it's working

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.660 
a weapon rack yeah okay it's working
this<00:01:27.810> time<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.229> occasionally<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:29.310> ends<00:01:29.579> up

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this time but occasionally it ends up

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.270 
this time but occasionally it ends up
like<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:30.090> there<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.259> no<00:01:31.680> idea<00:01:32.040> why<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
like up there and I have no idea why a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.760 
like up there and I have no idea why a
couple<00:01:32.640> weapons<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> game<00:01:33.770> so

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
couple weapons do that in the game so

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
couple weapons do that in the game so
yeah<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.420> has<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> history<00:01:36.960> of

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
yeah that one just has a history of

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
yeah that one just has a history of
being<00:01:37.200> stupid<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.280> everything<00:01:38.640> else<00:01:38.790> that

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
being stupid but everything else that

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.480 
being stupid but everything else that
tribe<00:01:39.180> works<00:01:39.450> fine<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:39.750> now<00:01:40.079> or<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.979> seems<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
tribe works fine for now or it seems to

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.990 
tribe works fine for now or it seems to
at<00:01:41.610> least<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.890> basically<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.460> happens<00:01:44.850> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
at least so basically what happens is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.539 
at least so basically what happens is
the<00:01:45.060> mod<00:01:45.390> edits<00:01:45.810> all<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.140> stuff<00:01:46.439> now<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.399> only

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the mod edits all that stuff now it only

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.550 
the mod edits all that stuff now it only
takes<00:01:47.850> effect<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.360> Lake<00:01:48.810> View<00:01:49.020> Manor<00:01:49.259> right

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
takes effect in Lake View Manor right

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.289 
takes effect in Lake View Manor right
now<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.740> mater<00:01:50.189> has<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.490> make<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> separate<00:01:51.090> mod

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
now the mater has to make a separate mod

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.289 
now the mater has to make a separate mod
file<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:53.250> other<00:01:53.399> houses<00:01:53.640> because<00:01:54.180> they

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
file for the other houses because they

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.200 
file for the other houses because they
are<00:01:54.420> all<00:01:54.540> different<00:01:54.570> ESPs<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:57.000> what

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
are all different ESPs and so what

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.550 
are all different ESPs and so what
happens<00:01:57.540> here<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.899> I've<00:01:58.170> already<00:01:58.439> done

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
happens here is that I've already done

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.620 
happens here is that I've already done
it<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.950> one<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.030> already<00:02:00.270> have

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
it for this one but if you already have

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.389 
it for this one but if you already have
your<00:02:00.810> display<00:02:01.110> cases<00:02:01.290> made<00:02:01.740> before<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.100> get

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
your display cases made before you get

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.399 
your display cases made before you get
the<00:02:02.549> mod<00:02:02.790> then<00:02:03.420> what<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.020> do<00:02:04.170> is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the mod then what you have to do is

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.709 
the mod then what you have to do is
disable<00:02:05.219> them<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.610> re-enable<00:02:06.060> though

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
do is you click on it after you've

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.180 
do is you click on it after you've
opened<00:02:10.709> up<00:02:10.950> your<00:02:11.009> console<00:02:11.459> type<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.060> disable

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
opened up your console type in disable

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.390 
opened up your console type in disable
and<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.490> gone<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:15.570> do<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.290> then<00:02:16.620> open<00:02:17.370> up

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
a console enable and magically back and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.270 
a console enable and magically back and
then<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.060> should<00:02:21.450> work<00:02:21.630> perfectly<00:02:22.140> fine<00:02:22.500> now

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
then it should work perfectly fine now

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.220 
then it should work perfectly fine now
I've<00:02:23.400> had<00:02:23.550> trouble<00:02:23.910> making<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.300> work<00:02:24.600> for<00:02:24.960> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
I've had trouble making it work for the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.490 
I've had trouble making it work for the
smaller<00:02:26.360> display<00:02:27.360> cases<00:02:27.630> I'm<00:02:27.900> not<00:02:28.050> sure<00:02:28.260> why

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
smaller display cases I'm not sure why

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.210 
smaller display cases I'm not sure why
that<00:02:28.530> is

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.190 

yeah<00:02:32.220> weapon<00:02:32.580> track<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.480> hell<00:02:33.780> happened

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
yeah weapon track the hell happened

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.880 
yeah weapon track the hell happened
there<00:02:35.480> whatever<00:02:36.480> it's<00:02:36.720> kind<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.170> glitchy<00:02:37.410> it's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
there whatever it's kind of glitchy it's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.350 
there whatever it's kind of glitchy it's
kind<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.100> glitchy<00:02:38.310> still<00:02:38.610> I'm<00:02:38.760> sure<00:02:39.000> it'll<00:02:39.180> be

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
kind of glitchy still I'm sure it'll be

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.400 
kind of glitchy still I'm sure it'll be
fixed<00:02:39.959> there<00:02:40.709> we<00:02:40.920> go<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.280> one<00:02:41.459> worked<00:02:41.670> fine

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
fixed there we go that one worked fine

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.750 
fixed there we go that one worked fine
yeah<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.800> little<00:02:43.980> hit<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.220> miss<00:02:44.459> but

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
yeah so it is a little hit and miss but

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.880 
yeah so it is a little hit and miss but
it<00:02:44.880> does<00:02:45.060> work<00:02:45.300> pretty<00:02:45.630> well<00:02:46.380> for<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.740> most

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
it does work pretty well for the most

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.160 
it does work pretty well for the most
part<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.310> yeah<00:02:47.670> again<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.510> smaller<00:02:48.810> display

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
part but yeah again the smaller display

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.530 
part but yeah again the smaller display
cases<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.560> had<00:02:49.650> kind<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.280> bit<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.540> trouble

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
cases have had kind of a bit of trouble

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.160 
cases have had kind of a bit of trouble
with<00:02:51.570> because<00:02:52.200> if<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.070> go<00:02:53.220> disabled<00:02:53.959> they<00:02:54.959> don't

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
with because if I go disabled they don't

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.880 
with because if I go disabled they don't
disabled<00:02:56.150> no<00:02:57.150> idea<00:02:57.690> why<00:02:57.870> I<00:03:00.800> don't<00:03:01.800> know<00:03:01.860> I

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
disabled no idea why I don't know I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.830 
disabled no idea why I don't know I
guess<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.190> games<00:03:02.400> saying<00:03:03.180> they're<00:03:03.390> disabled

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
guess the games saying they're disabled

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.650 
guess the games saying they're disabled
but<00:03:03.989> they're<00:03:04.140> not<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:05.070> yeah<00:03:05.970> there's<00:03:06.239> no<00:03:06.420> kind

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
but they're not so yeah there's no kind

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.380 
but they're not so yeah there's no kind
of<00:03:06.810> option<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.890> put<00:03:08.160> anything<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.580> them<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.239> if

of option to put anything in them so if

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.270

kinda low mod it's a major bug fix for
the<00:03:26.880> game<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.269> can't<00:03:27.480> believe<00:03:27.660> hasn't

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
the game that I can't believe hasn't

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.750 
the game that I can't believe hasn't
been<00:03:28.049> fixed<00:03:28.260> up<00:03:28.410> till<00:03:28.620> now<00:03:28.769> it's<00:03:29.459> something

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
been fixed up till now it's something

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.780 
been fixed up till now it's something
that<00:03:29.880> I've<00:03:30.000> really<00:03:30.530> wanted<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.860> mod<00:03:32.280> for<00:03:32.310> for<00:03:32.760> a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
that I've really wanted a mod for for a

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.100 
that I've really wanted a mod for for a
long<00:03:33.180> past<00:03:33.690> time<00:03:34.730> because<00:03:35.730> obviously<00:03:36.239> it

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
long past time because obviously it

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.900 
long past time because obviously it
makes<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:37.739> things<00:03:38.010> stay<00:03:38.310> where<00:03:38.519> they're

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
makes it so things stay where they're

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.330 
makes it so things stay where they're
supposed<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.360> stay<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.799> believe<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.190> mod

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
supposed to stay and I believe the mod
