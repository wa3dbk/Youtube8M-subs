what<00:03:41.180> makes<00:03:41.390> this<00:03:41.510> charge<00:03:41.810> unique<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.350> that<00:03:42.380> it

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
what makes this charge unique is that it

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.320 
what makes this charge unique is that it
has<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.709> built-in<00:03:43.160> plug<00:03:43.489> into<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:44.239> you

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
has a built-in plug into it so you

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.880 
has a built-in plug into it so you
actually<00:03:44.390> can<00:03:44.720> plug<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.050> right<00:03:45.290> into<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.680> wall

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
actually can plug it right into the wall

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.280 
actually can plug it right into the wall
and<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:46.400> charges<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:46.970> directly<00:03:47.390> now<00:03:47.930> once<00:03:48.140> it's

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
and it charges it directly now once it's

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.810 
and it charges it directly now once it's
done<00:03:48.470> charging<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:49.100> actually<00:03:49.370> turns<00:03:49.610> off

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
done charging it actually turns off

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.520 
done charging it actually turns off
automatically<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:51.020> you<00:03:51.110> could<00:03:51.230> plug<00:03:51.410> your

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
automatically that you could plug your

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.620 
automatically that you could plug your
device<00:03:51.800> right<00:03:51.830> into<00:03:52.489> it<00:03:52.700> now<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:53.300> like<00:03:53.450> all

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
device right into it now just like all

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.300 
device right into it now just like all
the<00:03:53.840> other<00:03:53.989> tilt<00:03:54.320> products<00:03:54.770> it<00:03:54.890> comes<00:03:55.130> in<00:03:55.250> a

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
the other tilt products it comes in a

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.220 
the other tilt products it comes in a
variety<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.700> different<00:03:55.880> colors<00:03:56.180> now<00:03:56.900> this<00:03:57.080> is

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
variety of different colors now this is

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.840 
variety of different colors now this is
only<00:03:57.380> twenty-two<00:03:57.920> hundred<00:03:58.040> milliamps<00:03:58.430> and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
only twenty-two hundred milliamps and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.520 
only twenty-two hundred milliamps and
it's<00:03:58.970> designed<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.450> give<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.870> bump<00:04:00.260> charge

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
it's designed to give you a bump charge

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.740 
it's designed to give you a bump charge
so<00:04:01.100> if<00:04:01.160> you're<00:04:01.250> down<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.550> 20%<00:04:02.209> you<00:04:02.300> can<00:04:02.420> plug<00:04:02.630> it

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
so if you're down to 20% you can plug it

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.960 
so if you're down to 20% you can plug it
in<00:04:02.870> and<00:04:03.110> on<00:04:03.709> some<00:04:03.980> devices<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:04.520> end<00:04:04.700> up<00:04:04.850> at

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
in and on some devices you end up at

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.000 
in and on some devices you end up at
around<00:04:05.060> 80%<00:04:05.540> which<00:04:06.440> should<00:04:06.650> last<00:04:06.770> you<00:04:06.980> the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
around 80% which should last you the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.830 
around 80% which should last you the
rest<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.459> day<00:04:07.640> or<00:04:07.940> until<00:04:08.390> you<00:04:08.450> get<00:04:08.540> back<00:04:08.690> to

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
rest of the day or until you get back to

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.080 
rest of the day or until you get back to
a<00:04:08.870> charger<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:10.040> auto<00:04:10.220> off<00:04:10.370> feature<00:04:10.400> is<00:04:10.850> great

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
a charger the auto off feature is great

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.330 
a charger the auto off feature is great
and<00:04:11.300> it<00:04:11.390> actually<00:04:11.540> works<00:04:12.020> with<00:04:12.290> no<00:04:12.470> issues<00:04:12.830> it

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340
