00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.099
 Hello 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.900
 it's been a long time since we saw each other today 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.300
 I bring a video that is about books 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.699
 that I bought in the months of May and June 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.590
 this is the first loop and then let's start 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.320
 one of the first books that good not 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.090
 I bought it but this study is one of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.620
 those books that I was beginning to read 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.930
 this month is the ray of the is of my 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.700
 sister but she called me a lot 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.100
 attention and then I decided to start 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.950
 read it also because on twitter I do not know 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.289
 if they have noticed that I know that there 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.840
 many hopscotch phrases that appear in 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.660
 my twitter because I like them a lot and 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.870
 are worth almost everything that comes in the part of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.180
 back says 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.600
 full literary and vital ambition 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 renovator of the tools 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.890
 narratives of structure of what 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.840
 established and seeker of the root of the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.940
 poetry during all these decades 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.890
 hopscotch continued to be read with 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.810
 curiosity astonishment interest or devotion 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.050
 it reaches the readers I am is 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.630
 university number 50 accompanied by a 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.220
 appendix of cortÃ¡zar same account the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.250
 history the book that I look for in beyond 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.080
 of all the borders because in itself the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.890
 back it tells me a lot but it 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.870
 basically what led to having read 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.800
 this book is about two 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.060
 protagonists 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.000
 and then it takes a little 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.250
 I put phrases like bunting 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.050
 that have been 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.580
 and if this books I really want 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.580
 I hope already ending 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.210
 the books good 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.780
 you could say book I think is the one of the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.300
 mafalda strips is super nice I saw it 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.290
 in the store and it was like I have to 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.260
 to buy is to look just redraw if 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.690
 It's so pretty I like it a lot and the skirt 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.530
 it's like he has a lot of personality 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.660
 I do not know I like it very much I did not wear 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.910
 every day to the faculty to read it 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.660
 and then we finish me taste 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.660
 recommend 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.710
 good for here 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:29.670
 the other book that I bought was the one from 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:32.090
 firewall that is like a book to fall 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.340
 he sees them like that on the cover 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.030
 I do not think it looks but I bought it in 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.760
 amazon and I have it here in electronic me 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.700
 It got a lot of attention because it says that 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.430
 makes a society where good you 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.170
 they know that in iphones and in some 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.120
 phones appears an application that 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.950
 call city and this application helps you 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.200
 I think there are some phones that 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.709
 you can talk and it's like your assistant 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.680
 good staff in this book there is like a 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.060
 assistant like this but this assistant well 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.510
 mind that I had her help you decide 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:16.519
 and then what the problems of this 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.560
 book is fine as if it is a 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.680
 application decide for you instead of that 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.750
 you decide your own decisions and I 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.459
 It got a lot of attention but I'm 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.400
 starting to read but when I finish it 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.989
 for sure they will bring that 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.620
 the other book they buy goes back to nick 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.120
 by lauren oliver you already know that 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.629
 I love the books of Lauren Oliver 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.489
 so I'm a super fan of delirium and so the 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.189
 another day I went to gandhi and was watching 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:50.480
 all the books and suddenly I saw lauren 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:53.780
 oliver and even more I saw panic then I read 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.689
 the small part of the back and the truth is not me 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.980
 He did not tell me much or it's like that 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:04.099
 have sentences and then check on the page 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.870
 from youtube that I know about him and I thought 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.790
 very interesting to realize that for 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.530
 nick is about a village where 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.769
 they make this game called a panic 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.169
 good panic in English and they get all 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.609
 high school students or 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.400
 most 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:28.569
 I give light to beat the truth not 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:31.899
 I see many books and works go here 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.969
 and I already like many phrases that lauren 

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:35.589
 oliver and I do not know how I like it 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:39.309
 much what he writes is very 

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:41.199
 interesting and it confused me a bit 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:44.080
 in weeds I said it looks like the 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.789
 hunger games and that year was 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.699
 father who leave oliver would have done 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:51.759
 well, but it is not true or it has a 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:55.110
 thematic of games and true is but not 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.110
 it's the same is not the same story 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.340
 for example here is not they are not 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.410
 waiting for people to die 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.960
 nothing just a game to distract yourself 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.270
 because the people are very bored and do not 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.310
 They know what to do on vacation then 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.880
 there with the feint they do not know with everything 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.880
 what it says 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.970
 and well, yes, I have been a long time 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.600
 absent brings them to surprise the 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.670
 next month that is July I already have 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.000
 determined what is going to be my how 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.280
 will follow my month's purpose yes and my 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.610
 purpose of the month is going to be the name of the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.780
 patrick rothfuss wind I think if 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:40.420
 it is said and why he chose this book 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.280
 Well, because in my good comments 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.890
 comments that many times leave me 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.720
 they say they are from TV or girl's books and 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.750
 well what has a little logic 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.640
 because I'm a girl but I think 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.890
 who would also be a father who could see 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.940
 my point of view of books that do not 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:06:00.540
 were like this nor so feminine yes 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.240
 of girl 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.370
 and then I have already been told many 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.990
 sometimes write this book but finally 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.850
 convinced me because a friend told me that 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.280
 He was very good and he does not have to 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.220
 to lend again then I decided to give 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.440
 an opportunity and then in July I 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.600
 I think like at the end of July out there 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.170
 I 'll tell you my opinion about this place 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.560
 so interesting to all of you and 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:28.020
 for these were how many will be the 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.110
 four books that I bought in the months of 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.480
 May and July and I hope that they have 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.370
 liked the video do not forget to subscribe 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.150

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.480
 read them and like it makes me happy to see 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.480
 that
