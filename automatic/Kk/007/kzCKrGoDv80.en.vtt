 one 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.309
 I have and computer science is part of our day to day 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:19.289
 thanks to her we have improved not only the quality of our work but also 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.060
 also our quality of life

 thanks to her companies and institutions 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.759
 They have modernized all their processes, achieving an optimization of their 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.280
 unthinkable economic resources just a few decades ago 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.989
 also the democratization of new technologies 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.119
 that is bringing with it the democratization of information 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 somehow technology makes us more free 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.240
 we want the technology to reach all the Castilian-La Mancha 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.620
 that's why the community council of Castilla-La Mancha 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.540
 has decided to launch an initiative aimed at eliminating 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.810
 barriers in access to information technologies and information technologies 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.650
 the free distribution of software is leader 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.750
 With this initiative we want to take a decisive step for the implementation of the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.440
 society of Information 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.880
