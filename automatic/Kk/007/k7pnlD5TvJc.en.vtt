00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.530 
mountain and it's a wrap you can't
really<00:04:25.860> see<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.040> far<00:04:26.460> but<00:04:27.120> since<00:04:27.330> we're<00:04:27.480> at

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
really see that far but since we're at

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.480 
really see that far but since we're at
that<00:04:27.690> top<00:04:27.930> of<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.170> top<00:04:28.380> when<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:29.100> tallest

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
that top of the top when the tallest

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.280 
that top of the top when the tallest
mountains<00:04:29.820> region<00:04:30.180> obviously<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.600> way<00:04:31.140> in

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
mountains region obviously the way in

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.050 
mountains region obviously the way in
the<00:04:31.350> distance<00:04:31.470> that's<00:04:31.770> hauler<00:04:32.010> but<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.910> get

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
the distance that's hauler but you get

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.100 
the distance that's hauler but you get
my<00:04:33.240> eat<00:04:34.230> what<00:04:34.350> I'm<00:04:34.440> saying<00:04:34.740> what<00:04:35.900> there's<00:04:36.900> a

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
my eat what I'm saying what there's a

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.870 
my eat what I'm saying what there's a
mountain<00:04:37.470> right<00:04:37.650> there<00:04:37.980> and<00:04:38.250> then<00:04:38.460> behind<00:04:38.580> it

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
mountain right there and then behind it

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.730 
mountain right there and then behind it
there's<00:04:39.060> no<00:04:39.150> mountains<00:04:39.660> it's<00:04:40.440> just<00:04:40.560> all

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
there's no mountains it's just all

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.440 
there's no mountains it's just all
clouds<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.520> then<00:04:41.610> there's<00:04:41.730> a<00:04:41.790> real<00:04:42.030> distant

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
clouds and then there's a real distant

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.780 
clouds and then there's a real distant
neuron<00:04:42.660> over<00:04:42.780> there<00:04:43.020> I'm<00:04:43.860> not<00:04:44.040> sure<00:04:44.100> how<00:04:44.610> good

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
neuron over there I'm not sure how good

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.090 
neuron over there I'm not sure how good
the<00:04:44.940> GoPro<00:04:45.270> can<00:04:45.450> catch<00:04:45.630> stuff<00:04:45.900> this<00:04:46.740> I<00:04:46.920> might

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
the GoPro can catch stuff this I might

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.430 
the GoPro can catch stuff this I might
see<00:04:47.340> if<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.520> can<00:04:47.670> zoom<00:04:47.880> in<00:04:48.150> once<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.050> edit<00:04:49.320> this

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
see if I can zoom in once I edit this

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.310 
see if I can zoom in once I edit this
out<00:04:49.650> but<00:04:50.720> then<00:04:51.720> there's<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:51.960> mountain<00:04:52.260> that

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
out but then there's a mountain that

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.450 
out but then there's a mountain that
there's<00:04:52.560> more<00:04:52.770> clouds<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.280> there's<00:04:53.400> a

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
there's more clouds and there's a

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.460 
there's more clouds and there's a

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
mountain and this is my own way way back

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.720 
mountain and this is my own way way back
there<00:04:55.530> which<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:55.860> probably<00:04:56.040> can't<00:04:56.190> see<00:04:56.370> but
