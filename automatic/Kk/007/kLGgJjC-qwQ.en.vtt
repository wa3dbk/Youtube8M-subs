00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.190 
hey guys it's John oh here I got a
little<00:00:02.310> base<00:00:02.520> design<00:00:02.850> video<00:00:03.179> for<00:00:03.449> you<00:00:03.629> on<00:00:03.840> my

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
little base design video for you on my

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.889 
little base design video for you on my
level<00:00:04.620> 3<00:00:04.950> base<00:00:05.190> this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.819> my<00:00:06.180> base<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.690> I'm

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
level 3 base this is my base that I'm

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.650 
level 3 base this is my base that I'm
using<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.710> come<00:00:08.069> up<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.490> level<00:00:08.820> 8<00:00:09.000> Town<00:00:09.240> Hall<00:00:09.450> so

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
using to come up to level 8 Town Hall so

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.089 
using to come up to level 8 Town Hall so
I'm<00:00:09.780> going<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:09.960> take<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.349> base<00:00:10.620> all<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.920> way

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
I'm going to take this base all the way

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.980 
I'm going to take this base all the way
up<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.309> level<00:00:11.550> 8<00:00:11.759> I'm<00:00:12.000> going<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.240> max<00:00:12.420> out<00:00:12.570> every

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
up to level 8 I'm going to max out every

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.600 
up to level 8 I'm going to max out every
level<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.650> way<00:00:13.769> there<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.190> then<00:00:14.280> I'm<00:00:14.580> just

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
level on the way there and then I'm just

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.010 
level on the way there and then I'm just
going<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.969> leave<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.299> there<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:15.900> do

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
going to leave it there so I can do

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.870 
going to leave it there so I can do
level<00:00:16.410> 8<00:00:16.529> Town<00:00:16.800> Hall<00:00:17.010> based<00:00:17.250> designs<00:00:17.609> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
level 8 Town Hall based designs and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.700 
level 8 Town Hall based designs and
continue<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.359> have<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.660> other<00:00:18.810> good<00:00:19.109> base<00:00:19.289> so

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
continue to have my other good base so

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.859 
continue to have my other good base so
this<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.310> going<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:20.760> maxed<00:00:21.240> out<00:00:21.359> bases

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
this is just going to be maxed out bases

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:22.640 
this is just going to be maxed out bases
all<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.289> time

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
all the time

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.279 
all the time
okay<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> maxed<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:24.060> level<00:00:24.600> 3<00:00:24.960> you

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
okay so this is a maxed out level 3 you

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.960 
okay so this is a maxed out level 3 you
can<00:00:25.439> see<00:00:25.470> I've<00:00:26.070> got<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> point<00:00:26.760> where<00:00:26.880> I'm

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
can see I've got to the point where I'm

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.790 
can see I've got to the point where I'm
starting<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.330> max<00:00:27.510> out<00:00:27.660> my<00:00:27.720> gold<00:00:28.109> quite<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> bit

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
starting to max out my gold quite a bit

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.200 
starting to max out my gold quite a bit
and<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.400> builders<00:00:29.760> doing<00:00:30.000> other<00:00:30.150> things

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and I have builders doing other things

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.930 
and I have builders doing other things
so<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.170> some<00:00:31.320> rocks<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.679> clear<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.460> I'm<00:00:32.610> not

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
so I have some rocks to clear so I'm not

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.030 
so I have some rocks to clear so I'm not
like<00:00:33.149> totally<00:00:33.809> maxed<00:00:34.079> out<00:00:34.320> yet<00:00:34.500> I'm<00:00:34.680> really

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
like totally maxed out yet I'm really

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.709 
like totally maxed out yet I'm really
close<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.309> maxed<00:00:35.790> out<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:36.690> I

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
close to maxed out but you know I

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.209 
close to maxed out but you know I
haven't<00:00:37.020> got<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> couple<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.739> these<00:00:37.829> big<00:00:38.040> rocks

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
haven't got a couple of these big rocks

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.889 
haven't got a couple of these big rocks
cleared<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.059> need<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.629> cleared

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
cleared that I need to just get cleared

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.060 
cleared that I need to just get cleared
obviously<00:00:40.290> I've<00:00:40.350> got<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> money<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:40.980> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
obviously I've got the money for it I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.229 
obviously I've got the money for it I
just<00:00:41.129> need<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.520> some<00:00:41.670> builders<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
just need to have some builders and

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.970 
just need to have some builders and
things<00:00:42.780> popping<00:00:43.200> up<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.559> weren't<00:00:43.829> there

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
things popping up that weren't there

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.619 
things popping up that weren't there
before<00:00:44.129> obviously<00:00:44.940> logs<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.360> things<00:00:45.420> like

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
before obviously logs and things like

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.540 
before obviously logs and things like
that<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:46.530> my<00:00:46.739> buildings<00:00:47.039> are

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that but then all my buildings are

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.430 
that but then all my buildings are
mostly<00:00:47.969> maxed<00:00:48.390> out<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> haven't<00:00:48.989> maxed<00:00:49.289> out<00:00:49.410> my

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
mostly maxed out I haven't maxed out my

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.869 
mostly maxed out I haven't maxed out my
collectors<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.100> still<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> couple<00:00:50.579> more<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
collectors I still have a couple more to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.700 
collectors I still have a couple more to
do<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.390> then<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.539> do<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.989> some<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.320> them<00:00:52.469> done

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
do but then I do have some of them done

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.520 
do but then I do have some of them done
so<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.520> see<00:00:53.730> varying<00:00:54.210> degrees<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.629> maxed

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
so you can see varying degrees of maxed

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.619 
so you can see varying degrees of maxed
out<00:00:55.680> NIST's<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.699> collectors<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.480> that's

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
out NIST's on the collectors but that's

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.810 
out NIST's on the collectors but that's
pretty<00:00:57.809> much<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.230> everything<00:00:58.710> else<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.219> maxed

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
pretty much it everything else is maxed

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.760 
pretty much it everything else is maxed
out<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.180> can't<00:01:00.480> get<00:01:00.629> my<00:01:00.840> defenses<00:01:01.350> any<00:01:01.590> further

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
out I can't get my defenses any further

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.529 
out I can't get my defenses any further
for<00:01:02.100> example<00:01:02.160> they<00:01:02.640> only<00:01:02.760> give<00:01:02.940> me<00:01:03.059> level<00:01:03.390> 1

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
for example they only give me level 1

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.539 
for example they only give me level 1
mortar<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.379> Town<00:01:04.619> Hall<00:01:04.860> level<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.430> only

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
mortar on this Town Hall level they only

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.670 
mortar on this Town Hall level they only
give<00:01:05.729> me<00:01:05.850> level<00:01:06.150> 4<00:01:06.450> cannons<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.470> Town

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
give me level 4 cannons on this Town

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.950 
give me level 4 cannons on this Town
Hall<00:01:07.890> level<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.720> have

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
Hall level so you can see I do have

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.270 
Hall level so you can see I do have
everything<00:01:10.439> else<00:01:10.560> though<00:01:10.740> pretty<00:01:10.890> much<00:01:11.070> maxed

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
everything else though pretty much maxed

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.890 
everything else though pretty much maxed
out<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.700> that's<00:01:11.850> interesting<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.720> I'm<00:01:12.780> gonna

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
out so that's interesting and I'm gonna

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.450 
out so that's interesting and I'm gonna
have<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.409> finish<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.950> couple<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.310> things

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
have to finish up a couple of things

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.730 
have to finish up a couple of things
before<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.210> move<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> next<00:01:16.229> Town<00:01:16.500> Hall

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
before I move on to the next Town Hall

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.190 
before I move on to the next Town Hall
level<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.610> I'm<00:01:17.880> almost<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:19.049> want

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
level but I'm almost there I just want

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.450 
level but I'm almost there I just want
to<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> couple<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.650> base<00:01:19.799> design<00:01:20.100> videos

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
to do a couple of base design videos

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.980 
to do a couple of base design videos
before<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:21.030> there<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.659> my<00:01:21.840> first

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
before I get there so this is my first

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.840 
before I get there so this is my first
base<00:01:22.290> design<00:01:22.619> video<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.100> don't<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
base design video I don't really have a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.460 
base design video I don't really have a
name<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.630> haven't<00:01:24.780> thought<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.170> doesn't

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
name for it I haven't thought it doesn't

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.990 
name for it I haven't thought it doesn't
you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.799> doesn't<00:01:26.100> strike<00:01:26.280> me<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.490> looking

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you know it doesn't strike me as looking

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520 
you know it doesn't strike me as looking
like<00:01:27.060> anything<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.840> particular<00:01:27.960> maybe

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
like anything in particular maybe

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.929 
like anything in particular maybe

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it looks like and I'll name it that

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.870 
it looks like and I'll name it that
basically<00:01:31.500> what<00:01:31.829> I'm<00:01:31.920> doing<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.430> I'm

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
basically what I'm doing is I'm

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.060 
basically what I'm doing is I'm
protecting<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.540> Town<00:01:33.750> Hall<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.380> protecting

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
protecting my Town Hall and protecting

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.679 
protecting my Town Hall and protecting
my<00:01:35.610> defenses

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
my defenses

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.999 
my defenses
I<00:01:36.720> really<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.290> protecting<00:01:37.680> Town<00:01:37.829> Hall

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
I really just protecting Town Hall

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.270 
I really just protecting Town Hall
defences<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.479> my<00:01:39.780> my<00:01:40.710> storages

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
defences you can see that my my storages

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.399 
defences you can see that my my storages
are<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> little<00:01:41.790> bit<00:01:42.030> exposed<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:43.020> one's<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
are a little bit exposed this one's the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.080 
are a little bit exposed this one's the
only<00:01:43.560> one<00:01:43.710> that's<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:43.950> properly<00:01:44.579> buried

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
only one that's really properly buried

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.420 
only one that's really properly buried
but<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.689> rest<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.990> them<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:47.340> bit

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
but the rest of them have a little bit

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.010 
but the rest of them have a little bit
of<00:01:47.549> exposure<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.720> trapped

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
of exposure this one I have trapped

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.359 
of exposure this one I have trapped
obviously<00:01:49.470> my<00:01:49.560> traps<00:01:49.799> aren't<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.189> high<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
obviously my traps aren't that high I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.800 
obviously my traps aren't that high I
need<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> upgrade<00:01:50.909> those<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.390> well

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
need to upgrade those as well

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.600 
need to upgrade those as well
but<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> can't<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.799> they<00:01:53.130> won't<00:01:53.340> let<00:01:53.460> me<00:01:53.549> I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
but I can't because they won't let me I

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.030 
but I can't because they won't let me I
just<00:01:53.820> got<00:01:54.000> traps<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:54.450> Town<00:01:54.600> Hall<00:01:54.780> level<00:01:55.049> 3<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.590> I

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
just got traps on Town Hall level 3 so I

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.800 
just got traps on Town Hall level 3 so I
do<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.520> these<00:01:56.700> open<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.270> little<00:01:57.420> bit<00:01:57.540> there

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
do have these open a little bit there

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.300 
do have these open a little bit there
could<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.110> better<00:01:58.229> protection<00:01:58.799> there<00:01:59.009> most

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
could be a better protection there most

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.499 
could be a better protection there most
of<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.460> time<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> don't<00:01:59.820> roll<00:02:00.090> around<00:02:00.240> with

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
of the time I don't roll around with

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.929 
of the time I don't roll around with
maxed<00:02:00.930> out<00:02:01.079> storages<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.490> would<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.729> spend

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
maxed out storages so I would just spend

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.880 
maxed out storages so I would just spend
that<00:02:03.240> down<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:03.899> I'm<00:02:04.079> pretty<00:02:04.259> close<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.590> maxed

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that down but I'm pretty close to maxed

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.069 
that down but I'm pretty close to maxed
out<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.280> base<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.090> are<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.899> Town

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
out on this base so I are on this Town

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.229 
out on this base so I are on this Town
Hall<00:02:07.290> level<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.670> kind<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.119> that

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
Hall level so it's it's kind of to that

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.999 
Hall level so it's it's kind of to that
point<00:02:09.509> where<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> lot<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.709> loot

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
point where I just have a lot of loot

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.110 
point where I just have a lot of loot
and<00:02:11.160> if<00:02:11.280> somebody<00:02:11.550> gets<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.879> don't<00:02:12.060> care

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and if somebody gets it I don't care

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.640 
and if somebody gets it I don't care
because<00:02:12.510> I'll<00:02:12.599> just<00:02:12.750> get<00:02:12.930> some<00:02:13.080> more<00:02:13.260> okay

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
because I'll just get some more okay

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.500 
because I'll just get some more okay
so<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:14.220> only<00:02:14.430> thing<00:02:14.580> I've<00:02:14.730> got<00:02:14.760> really<00:02:15.330> going

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
so the only thing I've got really going

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.270 
so the only thing I've got really going
here<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.900> I'm<00:02:16.049> protecting<00:02:16.560> my<00:02:16.680> defenses<00:02:17.190> I

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
here is I'm protecting my defenses I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.009 
here is I'm protecting my defenses I
said<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.610> already<00:02:17.909> so<00:02:18.150> I've<00:02:18.269> got<00:02:18.540> some<00:02:18.810> high

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
said that already so I've got some high

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.350 
said that already so I've got some high
hit<00:02:19.319> point<00:02:19.590> buildings<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.220> storages<00:02:21.000> and

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
hit point buildings like storages and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.990 
hit point buildings like storages and
the<00:02:22.140> army<00:02:22.530> camp<00:02:22.739> sitting<00:02:23.310> around<00:02:23.430> here<00:02:23.819> at

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
the army camp sitting around here at

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.420 
the army camp sitting around here at
this<00:02:24.420> town<00:02:24.810> hall<00:02:24.870> level<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> army<00:02:25.890> camps<00:02:26.250> have

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
this town hall level the army camps have

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.729 
this town hall level the army camps have
about<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.879> same<00:02:27.060> hit<00:02:27.390> points<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:28.019> a<00:02:28.080> collector

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
about the same hit points as a collector

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.470 
about the same hit points as a collector
so<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.159> kind<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.400> doesn't<00:02:29.580> matter<00:02:29.909> it<00:02:30.209> just

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
so it kind of doesn't matter it just

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.720 
so it kind of doesn't matter it just
holds<00:02:30.750> more<00:02:30.930> space<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:31.980> went<00:02:32.340> ahead<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.610> put

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
holds more space so I went ahead and put

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.069 
holds more space so I went ahead and put
them<00:02:32.819> on<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.090> edges<00:02:33.239> here<00:02:33.569> because<00:02:33.720> they<00:02:33.870> hold

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
them on the edges here because they hold

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.600 
them on the edges here because they hold
this<00:02:34.260> base<00:02:34.500> pretty<00:02:34.799> nicely<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.280> then<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.400> just

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
this base pretty nicely and then I just

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.009 
this base pretty nicely and then I just
have<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.849> fill<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.120> corners<00:02:36.540> with<00:02:36.810> these

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
have to fill the corners with these

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.119 
have to fill the corners with these
buildings<00:02:37.500> okay

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
buildings okay

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.619 
buildings okay
and<00:02:38.370> these<00:02:38.489> have<00:02:38.670> pretty<00:02:38.819> high<00:02:39.000> hit<00:02:39.209> points<00:02:39.239> so

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
and these have pretty high hit points so

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.660 
and these have pretty high hit points so
I<00:02:39.659> like<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.930> protect<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.890> corners<00:02:41.159> with<00:02:41.519> those

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
I like to protect the corners with those

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.430 
I like to protect the corners with those
high<00:02:41.819> hit<00:02:42.030> point<00:02:42.239> buildings<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.019> it's<00:02:43.230> pretty

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
high hit point buildings and it's pretty

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.289 
high hit point buildings and it's pretty
easy<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.739> get<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.099> here<00:02:44.519> but<00:02:44.610> then<00:02:45.060> they<00:02:45.180> have

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
easy to get in here but then they have

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.789 
easy to get in here but then they have
another<00:02:45.510> layer<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.930> wall<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.170> get<00:02:46.410> through<00:02:46.650> so

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
another layer of wall to get through so

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.470 
another layer of wall to get through so
that's<00:02:46.980> fine<00:02:47.190> too<00:02:47.489> so<00:02:47.670> I've<00:02:48.209> got<00:02:48.450> good

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
that's fine too so I've got good

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.289 
that's fine too so I've got good
coverage<00:02:49.349> with<00:02:49.379> all<00:02:49.709> my<00:02:49.859> defenses<00:02:50.069> got<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> nice

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
coverage with all my defenses got a nice

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.849 
coverage with all my defenses got a nice
big<00:02:51.599> ring<00:02:51.840> around<00:02:51.959> there<00:02:52.349> I<00:02:52.379> got<00:02:52.680> my<00:02:52.799> two

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
big ring around there I got my two

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.789 
big ring around there I got my two
important<00:02:53.519> defenses<00:02:54.060> covered<00:02:54.720> now<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.049> this<00:02:55.590> is

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
important defenses covered now I this is

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.589 
important defenses covered now I this is
basically<00:02:56.190> my<00:02:56.340> anti-air<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.060> don't<00:02:57.420> have

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
basically my anti-air I don't have

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.910 
basically my anti-air I don't have
anything<00:02:57.930> they<00:02:58.049> can<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.260> anti-air<00:02:58.590> except

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
anything they can do anti-air except

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.830 
anything they can do anti-air except
archer<00:02:59.670> tower<00:02:59.879> so<00:03:00.180> that's<00:03:00.359> why<00:03:00.480> I've<00:03:00.569> got<00:03:00.629> it

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
archer tower so that's why I've got it

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.000 
archer tower so that's why I've got it
defended<00:03:01.290> that's<00:03:01.440> pretty<00:03:01.650> much<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.980> only

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
defended that's pretty much the only

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.190 
defended that's pretty much the only
logic<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.819> put<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.299> in<00:03:03.510> there<00:03:03.720> instead<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.140> a

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
logic to put that in there instead of a

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.559 
logic to put that in there instead of a
cannon<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:04.859> have<00:03:05.400> four<00:03:05.640> towers<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.150> have<00:03:06.299> two

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
cannon but I have four towers I have two

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.750 
cannon but I have four towers I have two
enclosures<00:03:07.379> so<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.920> went<00:03:08.280> ahead<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.549> put<00:03:08.670> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
enclosures so I went ahead and put the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.130 
enclosures so I went ahead and put the
two<00:03:08.909> most<00:03:09.180> important<00:03:09.629> powers<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.049> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
two most important powers in the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.690 
two most important powers in the
enclosures<00:03:10.560> all<00:03:10.739> right<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.190> there's<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.459> really

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
enclosures all right so there's a really

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.220 
enclosures all right so there's a really
simple<00:03:11.940> base<00:03:12.120> design<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.659> guys<00:03:12.810> hit<00:03:13.079> me<00:03:13.170> up

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
simple base design you guys hit me up

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.119 
simple base design you guys hit me up
with<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.379> comment<00:03:13.709> tell<00:03:13.859> me<00:03:13.950> what<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.099> should
