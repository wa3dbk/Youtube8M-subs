00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:06.819
 hi dynasty decided to do 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.709
 Cosmetic video for a very long time not 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.350
 It was on my channel and I decided to do 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:13.840
 their format of what kind of cosmetics I take with 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.330
 myself traveling now because i don't 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.519
 I can only comment 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.660
 cosmetics but if you give a couple of tips 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:24.519
 how to take more with you to volume 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.609
 it was smaller and so for a start I 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.189
 fly to greece i fly fly there cheap 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.720
 airlines mellow casters and you probably 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.310
 you know that usually their ticket is not included 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.530
 baggage that you can take that is 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.900
 it is possible to take only a small bag with 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.620
 on board the plane here's a backpack bag 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.760
 which I take now when I was looking for how 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.700
 would maximize the volume with you taken 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.410
 I found this cyber site likes 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.480
 on the internet they release bags backpacks and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.830
 suitcases that are already of that format 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.350
 that allow 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.140
 these airlines i.e. they repel each other 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.390
 on what size you can and send by 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.630
 that size I have this bag 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.520
 which will suit visa easyjet exactly 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.429
 what I need is the most brewed 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.450
 very difficult to find in the store 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.579
 the maximum permissible option is to 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.499
 take as much as possible with you though 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.299
 see this is not so big places from except 

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:20.799
 the fact that instead of not so much is also necessary 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.229
 remember that she can not board with you 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.259
 bring more liquid than 1 liter per 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.329
 man that is, we fly together and part 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.569
 I'm flying with a boy so both bags 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.610
 Made my my products are two 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.860
 plastic sachets as it should 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.960
 After all, and in the correspondent that is, they are ready 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.330
 liter size and in each of them not 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.250
 there may be more than 1 products 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.810
 liter and every single product cannot 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.670
 to be more than 100 videos we probably 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.140
 we all know you 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.350
 by the way i'm not taking with me absolutely everything 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.979
 big things like shower gel and shampoo 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.660
 and funds from the sun means after 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.940
 the sun I'll buy it because we 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.100
 use the whole bank for four weeks 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.930
 no sense to drive and it is impossible with 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.940
 a 200 meter long 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.979
 packaging something so big 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.320
 things for buying something so let's our 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.570
 makeup cosmetics giving it a beta pit 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.520
 micellar water is green 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.350
 there is it for the clinical form very 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.330
 convenient format 100 milliliters just 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.670
 how much can i buy it for 3 euro i 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.100
 use her at home big bottle because 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.310
 that it perfectly removes and cleanses the skin 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.900
 removes makeup is very cool that there is 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.820
 such a format that I can take with 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.520
 myself and also I take these three 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.350
 small face washes samplers from 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.090
 reception 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.790
 because I will buy more in place 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.850
 I will need these first. 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.380
 the week of the petty before I flew on 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.320
 my places where I will buy in normal 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.660
 size i by the way calculate what i have 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.390
 such a philosophy not to buy one 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.820
 product and getting probes along with 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.190
 him for maxim why because such 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.680
 things are very very very useful when 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.410
 travel and when you give away 50 60 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.090
 and 100 euros for some products you have 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.130
 there should be no restraint 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.980
 go and ask for these samplers 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.590
 many how much I can not know the pieces 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.260
 eight out of every 100 euros have them i 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.470
 I go to the store and where I know that Charles 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.959
 lian do not give a lot of probes 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.810
 and for me it is very important because 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.170
 then when i see i have 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.819
 than the face and the liquid is one area 60 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.590
 milliliters again a handy jar 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.170

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.819

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.950
 this is thermal from thermal water from 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.870
 firms 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.720
 for a clinical skin, I used it 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.110
 last year she forgets me my skin 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.000
 It seems to cause acne but it could not 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.060
 do about it and I need something used 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.739
 need to protect the skin from the sun but how 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.040
 alternative this year I bought here 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.230

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.600
 and tsyren which is also from its 3 cm but 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.970
 first of all it is acne gel and i 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.440
 I hope that I will have this one for me 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.319
 want something more just in case 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.900

 much loved rn is a cream for acne and but 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.640

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.739
 forget that if you have this window 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.139
 need to moisturize the skin just like 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.600
 check dry skin even if oily 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.250

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.780
 helps how she used there 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.640
 in the evening it's such a super 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.660
 antibiotic gels dalatsin prescribed it to me 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.070

 recipe so I will not tell you 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.740
 recommend and two point remedies 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.479
 I am delighted with rashes 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.950
 I have already told both about this 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.350
 clinics acne gel 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.910
 and now my second favorite if this 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.190
 i use on more such superficial 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.900
 pimples comedones that are great their 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.930
 dry you only and the day they are terrified 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.000
 lively then this one is interesting 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.530
 which found for hormonal window 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.190
 which are some on face 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.800
 it's from the body shop and it's tea oil 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.410
 wood, moreover, here it is not one hundred percent 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.940
 well, 15 percent the rest is here 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.310
 castor oil which is also very good 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.250
 for acne skin i use it 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.460
 dimples on what it is like dripping yakopo 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.190
 it on a cotton swab and pressed about the box and so 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.680
 here I hold for about 15 minutes no one can 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.699
 while watching a video or something and it 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.860
 really helps with such subcutaneous 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.139
 I do not know hormonal calculate 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.180
 other means that worked for them 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.860
 so 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.110
 really look series nose 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.039
 because it seems to me 10 packs I bought 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.190
 they were at a discount 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:43.110
 and I donâ€™t know what 5 spent 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.820
 excellent means of the 1st row of the side to 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.680
 build beyond using natural 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.419
 organic on the sides without aluminum about 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.160
 that they clog pores special 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.490
 will spend cracow bergur de la la 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.800
 la 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.680
 In general, the problem with organic 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.690
 guarantors they do not always do their job 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.500
 but here this blow firm him very 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.449
 I really recommend no smell and 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.880
 huge selection and unusual tastes of the field 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.430
 body shop only natural therefore 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.770
 class remedies for rhinitis never 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.780
 know when traveling is more wind 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.479
 useful thing is true every year I take 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.889
 every year I need it achieves it 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:21.900
 I need a perfume and I do not use much 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.000
 perfume every day but here on four 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.419
 I just take four weeks for myself 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.940
 sampler jo malone and again i am you 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.569
 I say always take it probes your 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.879
 right i know i'm unnecessarily russian 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.960
 feel shy or feel they don't want 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:38.179
 give field 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.189
 want don't want you pay huge 

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:41.029
 money so you need to try to take 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.610
 many probes 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:45.379
 not because you live on them what is 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.029
 the fact that when you fly you can't 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:47.809
 take a whole bottle of perfume you can 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:50.270
 take this 

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:53.360
 it is more convenient and the last things are nursing 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.009
 this this hair spray is known 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.809
 hair removal agent 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:00.169
 arrow that shampoo and conditioner buy 

00:06:56.809 --> 00:07:02.270
 there is no styling and I will not deal 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:05.240

 sea salt spray from spoon again 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:12.139
 spray and I don't use it in the city 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.209
 because although the first day it looks 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:16.219
 perfectly makes such a beach hairstyle 

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:18.499
 if you dedicate with him and then on 

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:21.020
 The next day, hair is very much like

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.039
 I do every time the city as opposed to the 

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:26.689

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.969

 this is a hair mask and this level 

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:53.029
