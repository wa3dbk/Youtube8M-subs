okay<00:06:16.320> but<00:06:16.560> heard<00:06:16.980> my<00:06:17.130> ATX<00:06:17.580> they<00:06:17.910> just<00:06:18.180> kind<00:06:18.510> of

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
okay but heard my ATX they just kind of

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.740 
okay but heard my ATX they just kind of
weak<00:06:18.930> and<00:06:20.030> wasn't<00:06:21.030> playing<00:06:21.210> the<00:06:21.330> Loomis<00:06:21.600> as

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
weak and wasn't playing the Loomis as

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.530 
weak and wasn't playing the Loomis as
much<00:06:21.990> but<00:06:22.200> now<00:06:22.410> I<00:06:23.040> don't<00:06:23.790> think<00:06:23.910> it's<00:06:24.090> quite<00:06:24.270> my

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
much but now I don't think it's quite my

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.730 
much but now I don't think it's quite my
favorite<00:06:24.750> thing<00:06:25.080> I<00:06:25.170> still<00:06:25.380> prefer<00:06:25.500> the

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
blackjack ATX but i think i will

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.500 
blackjack ATX but i think i will
definitely<00:06:29.880> give<00:06:30.090> this<00:06:30.120> a<00:06:30.270> lot<00:06:30.480> more

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
definitely give this a lot more

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.450 
definitely give this a lot more
