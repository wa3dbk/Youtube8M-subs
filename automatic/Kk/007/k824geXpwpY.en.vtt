 Mero so 20 Sa 19 sixth evening even the 1000 subscribers have cracked yes it 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
 is really the absurd madness to ask the question again 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.170
 yes, I never thought that half the big ones would be painted off 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.820
 would 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.070
 we may not all but know that it out of absurd boredom 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.720
 arose 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.240
 on the 25th of October last year 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.590
 Madness that's a bit over half a year 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.830

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.490

 stay tuned in the next few days and do not miss it 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.430

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.140

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.030

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.829
 and instead of indirectly from really bad for the upcoming week 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.840

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.520
 one is played in red 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.750
 from the Palais Cayenne PGA or NPD 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.920
 he escapes 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.500
 thank you very much for your troops my strong very cool idea very well 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.530
 Thanks a lot for that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.320
 yes, but now, nonetheless, it is also possible and that is the whole lot 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.130
 this week 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.200
 most of their titles are those that you might not have experienced that way 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.210
 Let's start with Wednesday the 22nd sixth 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.210
 cellos comes out there often 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.460

 Andrei twentieth sixth of the purchase of the Donnas day 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.500
 December the day after logically took somehow twentieth 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.310
 come out at the Magic Heroes 6 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.900
 for all common consoles 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.649
 then on 24 they put Transformers 3 Dark of the Moon 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.489
 and Super Street Fighter 4 the critical 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.920
 really very accommodating probably so small fawn fat while sweet 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:16.969
 Knowledge 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.290
 and of course JuLis we all wait for and actually stupid this 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.989
 Week 4 3 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.620
 yes Alba Respect the horror-shooter goes into the third round "Many of you 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.119
 surely have to wait 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.959
 and thank you Friday and the weekend have fun with 4 3 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.430
 lately i have some fun funny talking about 4 4 like 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.620
 sees that after wanting to do and want to call that 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.009
 now you have made the first time at the 0 4 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:42.419
 Let's see what's coming 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.649
 Definitely fun for all who buy the game with 4 3 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.760
 He has to go through there with the release of it directly to the news 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.360
 and there I have the SAP - if you like the sad news right on 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.450
 Start for all of you on the pc and the ps3 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.419
 still hard-working online continues to grow well 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.799
 Today I have to say unfortunately that the online service is now turned off 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.069
 writing was on the weekend 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.140
 only on the Xbox it is possible to play Westerberg World Online 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.480
 This has to do with the fact that Codemasters the contracts with the third-party suppliers 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.580
 Server for that in the run did not extend or which the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.290
 Publishers wanted so on the PC or ps3 unfortunately no longer online 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.979
 play 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.129
 at the ISH what already there are the servers yet 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.739
 Yes, analogously, one of these is the game you want to buy through an Xbox Live and 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:26.789
 west 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.249
 or that this year because then you should appear 2 Â» 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.289
 FC Zurich maintained the online mode for all consoles 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:34.369
 logically 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:36.159
 there is something new to the skarn 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.879
 by making them sure to become ever larger and larger 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.390
 History now you have broken the record again last year 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.010
 it's all 550 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.050
 which celebrated over 2,000 mÂ² in Cologne 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.280
 This year, there are already over 500 at the moment 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.230
 that means you will crack the record at exhibitors it will probably be this 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.880
 Year again set a new attendance record last year were 240 000 euros 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.650
 if I did not seek to escape the diet 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.319
 This year will be a bit more with 260 00 Euro 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.319
 yes it is getting closer to over 2,000 square meters 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.489
 when you are still group cuddling or you can in the crowd legs 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.849
 raise and thereby do not amount to wrong 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.649
 Thank you that it is quite funny to some bloggers 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:17.930
 And although the game is now forty percent already fortunately since one 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.759
 a few weeks 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.129
 yes every game in itself is about it can be argued now is a video 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.319
 shown that a photo appeared 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:28.509
 by an American who already imagined the game in 2001 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.630
 yes, I have a lot of patience ten years, he has to wait for the game 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.090
 the box of that is I'm not the target of the game ten years ago 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.220
 already introduced and he has sent a huge package 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.730
 Han Guo the Sun reports that he wins among other hundreds of t-shirts and 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.460
 Keyboards from Logitech 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.800
 and all sorts of things came to that SUT teenagers saw keyboard 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.210
 a diplomacy 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.189
 So that YouTube can do such a thing 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:55.849
 Drawing if you like 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.210
 where the whole development has prescribed extreme escape 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.430
 For me, Isa is reserved from the box the rides for sure 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.699
 bit in the player himself 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.340
 yes very cool story Pepping times she will stay unique in the 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.510
 Video Game History 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.360
 the human test has received will be happy he has also long enough 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.400
 when game is waiting 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.290
 and then, alas, when we arrived again at the end of the year 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.970
 not great kilos this week 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.330
 and 2 this comes back from Nintendo because now you have again Deuce the 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.220
 President of Nintendo Satoru Iwata has now issued a new statement 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.540
 after saying last week that the Buga has a DVD and blu-ray 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.770
 Now he has said that on this free-to-play 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.040
 Wave which meanwhile sloshed through the countryside 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.800
 that you do not mind with hour 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.260
 yes the Zermatter that manufacturers their titles 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.320
 Percent restricted way to provide free that one 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.990
 if you want to pay for level 50 known then or for special weapons 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.460
 in the game extra with proper pay 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.919
 that the message will not give it to parents and not one is the one 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:52.599
 Opinion that threatened by the weather games 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.840
 because, according to Nintendo, only a small percentage is Deloitte 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.310
 the existence then really spend money on it 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.150
 So he has the system use as it was then al-gaddafi and 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.960
 was invented 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.980
 that you make neck hot for free and then it will stop 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.379
 Japan has to believe that after the weather games probably cleaned that 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:10.139
 uphold 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.619
 and there will be no free-to-play titles from Nintendo in the future 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:15.550
 that's my word of power from apano 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.699
 I do not necessarily synonymous for wrong 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.300
 and thus directly at the question of the week 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.990
 and then I want to know about you this time 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.979
 what do you think of all this free-to-play stuff? 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.490
 I think he's what you play what's going on at the Battlefield's also Reto 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.020
 KlÃ¤y 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.660
 Both discounters Cannes play Weidmann stagnation and if you stop 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.520
 really quiet will, so to speak, and piece of new class wants to have new weapons 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.680
 you pay some money for it 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.000
 what do you think of who that is a concept that is sustainable or said 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.690
 Wiegard a duo that does not make sense that breaks the silence next 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.150
