literally it went straight down like

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.919 
literally it went straight down like
this<00:00:28.650> which<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.130> worst<00:00:29.400> wait<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.119> also<00:00:30.449> if

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
this which is the worst wait and also if

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
this which is the worst wait and also if
the<00:00:31.080> conch<00:00:31.349> my<00:00:31.679> concrete<00:00:32.070> there<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.489> kind<00:00:32.669> of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the conch my concrete there it's kind of

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.760 
the conch my concrete there it's kind of
rough<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.930> you're<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.350> bunch<00:00:34.620> of

rough so you're going to have a bunch of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.130 
rough so you're going to have a bunch of
these<00:00:34.950> points<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
these points it's just going to be and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.490 
these points it's just going to be and
your<00:00:37.739> screens<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.399> gonna<00:00:38.610> crack<00:00:39.120> um<00:00:39.500> that's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
indoors it's going to be flat surface so

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.770 
indoors it's going to be flat surface so
it's<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.000> weight<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.690> be

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it's the weight is going to be

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.540 
it's the weight is going to be
distributed<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.520> on

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
distributed but if you do that on
