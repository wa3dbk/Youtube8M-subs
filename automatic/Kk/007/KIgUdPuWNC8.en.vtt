only thing we got going there's he

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.210 
only thing we got going there's he
hasn't<00:03:43.959> ran<00:03:44.080> that<00:03:44.230> truck<00:03:44.500> with<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.890> speed

hasn't ran that truck with that to speed
in<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.519> so<00:03:45.760> maybe<00:03:46.299> he'll<00:03:46.570> shift<00:03:46.870> backwards<00:03:47.140> or

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
in it so maybe he'll shift backwards or

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.370 
in it so maybe he'll shift backwards or
some<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.950> give<00:03:48.040> us<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.280> chance<00:03:49.110> then<00:03:50.110> he<00:03:50.230> got

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
some and give us a chance then he got

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.340 
some and give us a chance then he got
Shawn<00:03:51.130> out<00:03:51.400> there<00:03:51.580> he's<00:03:51.730> been<00:03:51.940> hot<00:03:52.150> all<00:03:52.180> year<00:03:52.390> I

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
Shawn out there he's been hot all year I

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.470 
Shawn out there he's been hot all year I
tried<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.310> get<00:03:54.459> in<00:03:54.610> their<00:03:54.760> heads<00:03:54.970> on<00:03:55.269> that

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
tried to get in their heads on that

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.810 
tried to get in their heads on that
interview<00:03:56.110> earlier<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.799> it<00:03:57.280> seems<00:03:57.519> like<00:03:57.610> I

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
interview earlier and it seems like I

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.100 
interview earlier and it seems like I
got<00:03:58.030> them<00:03:58.180> working<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.600> little<00:03:58.750> bit<00:03:58.870> because

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
got them working a little bit because

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.270 
got them working a little bit because
they<00:03:59.290> didn't<00:03:59.500> know<00:03:59.560> what<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.830> say<00:04:00.010> in<00:04:00.160> their

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
they didn't know what to say in their

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.729 
they didn't know what to say in their
interview<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.060> maybe<00:04:01.900> we<00:04:02.080> can<00:04:02.290> get<00:04:02.410> in<00:04:02.560> their

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
interview so maybe we can get in their

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.010 
interview so maybe we can get in their
heads<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.280> we<00:04:03.400> can<00:04:03.580> have<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:03.760> good<00:04:04.000> weekend<00:04:04.840> and

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
heads and we can have a good weekend and

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.970 
heads and we can have a good weekend and
if<00:04:05.110> we<00:04:05.260> do<00:04:05.470> in<00:04:05.680> this<00:04:05.860> old<00:04:06.099> truck<00:04:06.340> right<00:04:06.550> here

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
if we do in this old truck right here

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.920
