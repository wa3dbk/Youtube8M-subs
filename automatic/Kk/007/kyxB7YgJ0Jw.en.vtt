this and then going to go in with my 240
grit<00:01:25.380> young<00:01:25.799> nails<00:01:26.130> buffer<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.240> then<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.960> just

grit young nails buffer and then I just

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.910 
grit young nails buffer and then I just
go<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.890> reshape<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.540> free<00:01:31.439> edge<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
go in and reshape the free edge of the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.530 
go in and reshape the free edge of the
nails<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.340> make<00:01:32.490> sure<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.970> there's<00:01:33.180> still<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
nails to make sure that there's still a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.539 
nails to make sure that there's still a
nice<00:01:33.840> shape<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.380> then<00:01:34.829> i'll<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.250> ready<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
nice shape and then i'll be ready to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:49.730 
nice shape and then i'll be ready to
design

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.180 

so<00:01:50.740> these<00:01:51.070> nails<00:01:51.460> were<00:01:51.760> inspired<00:01:52.420> by<00:01:52.920> five<00:01:53.920> or

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
so these nails were inspired by five or

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.030 
so these nails were inspired by five or
six<00:01:54.520> designs<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.450> my<00:01:55.930> client<00:01:56.470> come<00:01:56.650> up<00:01:56.830> with

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
six designs that my client come up with

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.210 
six designs that my client come up with
so<00:01:58.030> I'm<00:01:58.420> just<00:01:58.570> going<00:01:58.720> to<00:01:58.810> go<00:01:59.020> in<00:01:59.050> and<00:01:59.440> pop<00:01:59.860> down

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
so I'm just going to go in and pop down

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.540 
so I'm just going to go in and pop down
the<00:02:00.670> base<00:02:00.910> colors<00:02:01.450> for<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.810> design<00:02:02.260> so<00:02:03.100> this

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
the base colors for the design so this

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.140 
the base colors for the design so this
screen<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.150> actually<00:02:04.300> from<00:02:04.840> noq<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.010> I'm<00:02:06.940> not

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
screen is actually from noq and I'm not

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.749 
screen is actually from noq and I'm not
sure<00:02:07.450> on<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:08.050> code<00:02:08.350> or<00:02:08.679> a<00:02:08.740> name<00:02:09.160> but<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.490> will

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
sure on the code or a name but I will

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.310 
sure on the code or a name but I will
have<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.030> look<00:02:10.240> for<00:02:10.570> you<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.110> leave

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
have a look for you and leave

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.160

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
go in and place a few layers down of the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.070 
go in and place a few layers down of the
gel<00:02:44.860> polishes<00:02:45.459> cure<00:02:45.820> in<00:02:46.030> each<00:02:46.270> layer<00:02:46.570> for<00:02:46.870> 30

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.520 
gel polishes cure in each layer for 30
seconds<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.120> then<00:02:49.120> once<00:02:49.870> I've<00:02:50.110> popped<00:02:50.350> this

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
camouflage army design I think I did all

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.310 
camouflage army design I think I did all
right<00:03:43.430> with<00:03:43.610> this<00:03:43.790> one<00:03:44.180> I'm<00:03:44.420> not<00:03:44.870> too<00:03:45.110> sure<00:03:45.290> if

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
right with this one I'm not too sure if

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.390 
right with this one I'm not too sure if
I<00:03:45.620> got<00:03:45.830> it<00:03:45.920> as<00:03:46.930> camouflage<00:03:47.930> as<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.680> should<00:03:49.130> be

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
I got it as camouflage as it should be

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.480 
I got it as camouflage as it should be
but<00:03:50.210> I'm<00:03:50.510> just<00:03:50.810> going<00:03:50.960> to<00:03:50.990> place<00:03:51.230> three<00:03:51.860> colors

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
but I'm just going to place three colors

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
down and just overlap them and make

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.010 
down and just overlap them and make
random<00:03:54.890> shapes<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:56.000> then<00:03:56.390> I'm<00:03:56.480> going<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.750> cure

random shapes and then I'm going to cure
each<00:03:58.120> color<00:03:59.120> for<00:03:59.630> 30<00:03:59.990> seconds<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.860> my<00:04:00.970> LED<00:04:01.970> lamp

then<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.450> next<00:04:39.630> finger<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.410> design<00:04:40.860> she

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
then the next finger to design she

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.640 
then the next finger to design she
wanted<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.640> yin-yang<00:04:44.000> design<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.570> i<00:04:45.960> went<00:04:46.350> in

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
wanted a yin-yang design so i went in

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.940 
wanted a yin-yang design so i went in
and<00:04:46.950> i<00:04:47.160> just<00:04:47.190> made<00:04:47.840> like<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:49.170> swirl<00:04:49.710> down<00:04:50.220> like

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
it's hard to describe like a swirly

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.300 
it's hard to describe like a swirly
motion<00:04:55.920> down<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.370> nail<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:57.900> separate<00:04:58.890> the
