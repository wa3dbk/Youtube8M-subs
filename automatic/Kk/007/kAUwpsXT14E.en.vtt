 today for a tag still intact 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.859
 yeah there will be plenty on my chain 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.389
 tech because I love tags and then 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.650
 good I wanted to make a video I 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.420
 I thought it was a bit early 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.490
 to make a reading point in half 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.949
 black because hey we're only the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.590
 11 so good here's eleven or twelve I 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.080
 no longer brief we do not care so I 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:28.349
 am here to do the tag my life in 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.570
 1 wave books I know that this act of 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.759
 very long time and for at least a year 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.200
 just like that after I have not seen them 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.399
 a lot in France actually I think I 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.710
 have never seen in France I do not know 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.940
 but we do not care about it I 'm not going 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.809
 you explain the principle in fact I 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.980
 go straight with them 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.820
 questions because I believe that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.360
 I would not even be able to 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.649
 explain principle in fact ie 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.600
 that I have several questions I had 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.120
 go and touch in the library of 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.100
 books related to these issues 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.129
 so the first one is too much 20 pounds 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.109
 for each of your initial then I'm 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.129
 go back to my life with that ok 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.909

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.260
 it's awesome awesome oh but it's serious 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.260
 and paper that starts with a m 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:17.340
 I found then that's not Miss Perry 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.350
 think especially for the m2 mallory 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.530
 and now I will try to find 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.810
 the d2 i will not tell you my family 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.140
 but hey it's d1 here ok it was 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.140
 easy 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:43.210
 cost and the d of down guns voila voila 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.630
 I did not do I did not look for them 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.229
 initials of my second prize have not been 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.049
 apparently not complicate life 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.569
 only then were his age your accounts 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.259
 in his library and bavois on which 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:02:01.539
 book his grave 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:03.490
 I get up again and that's it 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.310
 my age I fall under the hand 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.329
 mantha a path of the city of darkness 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.149
 my age for 24 euros 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:13.450
 if you listened with me here I am 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.450
 know i know i do not do them i know 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.579
 so then it's found a book that 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.519
 takes place in your city region or country 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.349
 so we'll try to find that 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.110
 already city I can already 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.790
 eliminate it because that's in my 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.349
 little lost village there is no 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.209
 risk it is written in progress Spread the word 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.620
 right now 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.180
 I have not found my region 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.299
 found only my country which is the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.269
 France this is this beautiful era of and 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:43.780
 from yves atrocious wars 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.810
 Well, here it was, it was done very quickly 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.609
 this tag makes it then choose a 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.040
 book that represents one of 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:58.049
 destinations that you would like to visit 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:03:00.069
 I have not prepared this tag at all 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.760
 which I do not know, so let me 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.760
 time to think two seconds 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.910
 I found I present you the color 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.910
 feelings of Kathryn Stockett 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.319
 this is good because the mississippi scene 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.639
 me it's more the louisiane that 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.319
 I would love to visit but hey 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:25.060
 will say that messi city hozjan that makes 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.410
 a little part of the same how to say of the 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.940
 same range of the landscape we say this thing 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.709
 like that 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.200
 so here it is really really 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.250
 really 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.550
 a place I would like to visit 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.800
 then where I was chosen a book of 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.599
 your favourite colour 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.050
 I do not officially have a color 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.150
 favorite 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.390
 so here is the question going to be quickly 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.370
 not in fact we will say that it is by 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.560
 moment by periods where by season that 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.400
 I have favorite colors 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:55.130
 so right now we'll say I'm 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.290
 enough in all that is pink salmon 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.120
 pale of that so I choose the summer of a 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.540
 second chance of morgane mattson 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.650
 a little the colors the colors that 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.870
 I do not let go me it looks good 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.390
 justice to the trick but then we do not care 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.920
 we need video beauty I like 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.360
 a lot of that color we'll say that 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.919
 that's how my favorite color is 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:23.960
 then hand a book which thou hast 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:25.280
 best memories wholesale i'm not going 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.810
 to do in the original I'm sorry 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.889
 but hey I'm obliged I'll 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:35.840
 to choose harry potter who is where there 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:37.910
 williams have my pot of charlot I 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.639
 wanted that kind because I leave 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.680
 imagine the heaviness of the thing but 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.320
 yeah I felt all the emotions 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.389
 with his books so my faith why 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.840
 why why why do you 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.470
 serious 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.050
 why choose me other yeah yeah 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.280
 it's really harry potter that chooses 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.539
 here I am not in the original I 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.120
 know but we can not always do 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.220
 in the original my faith then what 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.020
 book did you have more trouble reading and I 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.090
 am going to cheat for this question because 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.250
 that I will present you two in 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.780
 first i will introduce you fan girl 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.910
 I never finished 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.590
 I had a hard time saying no he's 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.160
 complicated reading no no that's for sure it 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.690
 loses simple to read but but in fact the 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.070
 problem is that I got bored and 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.860
 look, I left the mark page 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.930
 here I stopped at half bath 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.639
 of the book actually because I was bored 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.480
 terribly that I was at a 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.890
 week almost a week 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.020
 Well, I was only half and I 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.630
 could not I gave up so that's it 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.090
 maybe I want that I 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.380
 will start again since it is true that 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.460
 I have never seen in my life 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.560
 tell me but it's me who have a problem 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.670
 what is it that maybe I had to 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.670
 a bad time maybe that 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.190
 I should have said it in your 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.560
 I do not know to see I will try again 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.590
 maybe but do not blame I you in 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:59.010
 please pray I'm sorry but 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:06:01.140
 no what and and and a second to me I 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.630
 can you not present on a fatim that 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.100
 will match my phone 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.230
 well, it's the iron throne 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.140
 the integral 2 that's it I had a lot 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.910
 bad to read in fact you have to know that 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.160
 I gave them to him when I had my super long 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.140
 reading failure so that I have 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.550
 a month to read it here it was 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.680
 hyper no I put a month read I 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.160
 thought I never had to finish and 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.470
 last question for this c 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.010
 translation of the trick it's a little bit 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:32.580
 galley finally it's only roughly what book 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:34.770
 of your pale when you look them I know 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.360
 not even how do you say good at wholesale 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.650
 to make quick is that she delivers 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.050
 of tapas she will make you the most proud 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.460
 you read them roughly what book will be 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.470
 feel a sense of accomplishment 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.920
 welsh not ripped off how do you explain 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:49.530
 that basically we will say that there 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.690
 will make a stone that you had that then 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.130
 it's the same I cheat a little because 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.390
 that it will be more really part of my 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.830
 apart since I'm reading it 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.770
 I'm finishing it 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.600
 even you even stayed forty pages 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.860
 but if I had done this tag the weeks 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.990
 back I would have chosen this one 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.710
 it's all at the boys love ford 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:09.510
 general because actually it's the 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.060
 first book I read in vo without 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.530
 know the story at all it's not 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.970
 the brennus that I'm in but it's the 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.470
 first that I have had vincent 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.820
 history in French beforehand or 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.190
 without knowing a minimum history this is 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.080
 this one that here I am, which made me 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.300
 most trusting to lead 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.650
 finished because I have that left 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.669
 so I'm so sorry I'm cheating a 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:31.050
 sometimes mini tac that serves no purpose 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:33.629
 have consciousness but I absolutely 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.680
 did you make a video not wanted 

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:35.490
 do too much video because 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.219
 it's true that I do not have a lot of 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:41.219
 time what right now my boyfriend is 

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:43.050
 on vacation and I do not see myself at all 

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:44.310
 filmed when next I am I 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.419
 would be unable so there he left 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:49.500
 quickly and tells us we go 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:52.650
 and suddenly this tag was not at all 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.789
 prepared I was doing in 2 so good bah 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.099
 I hope you will not hold 

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:58.340
 rigor my faith and then anyway there 

00:07:56.099 --> 00:08:00.270
 we find ourselves in a few days finally 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.009
 way in a short week 

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.229
 yeah so we end up with 10 a 

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:07.080
 short week for the reading point of 

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:09.780
 early August and then here's bah 

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.460
 down I make you big kisses of 

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.500
 superman letter that you liked 

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.240

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.400
 kiss ciao
