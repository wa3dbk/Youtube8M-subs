00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 Hello, well, they have asked me so many 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.250
 times so they were all sides 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.860
 how good I make a video of the five 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.880
 most beautiful girls of alovera between 12 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.500
 and 14 years 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.820
 well this is going to be my last one is not going 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.680
 to be my last but it will be of the 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.790
 few videos of this type that I'm going to 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.330
 do because I seem so 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.540
 superficial what 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.000
 but I eat smart smart-ass 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.590
 because that fox that I will do this 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.240
 because as you have asked me so much not 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.850
 I want you to need to see for this 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.420
 well to see 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.420
 I've picked 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.920
 to a girl who did not have to point out that 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:54.010
 I did not find anything to look at 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.949
 two girls of 14 years one of 12 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.900
 12 of 12 years and one of 13 years or 12 is 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:03.250
 I do not know how much they estimate 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:07.060
 the first the prettiest girl 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.970
 prettier and that I remember maybe the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.980
 difficult field you know because it's my friend 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.080
 Spain looked like Garcia when 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.760
 you understand is that as a being placed then 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.950
 I think it's a very pretty girl 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.009
 true 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.719
 Then there is this fernandez sánchez 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.280
 dear esther fernandez and you are 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:28.100
 Sanchez and those cute girls 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.470
 it seems very cute to me yes then it is 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.909
 devours a girl first that does not have 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.420
 you in you 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.600
 and that girl is beautiful but some 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.100
 big eyes is that on top is very nice then 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.640
 statistic the tower 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.640
 what 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:54.569
 and if each tower and then I'm name 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.380
 then it is coming elena elena sofía that 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.380
 She is very attractive 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.909
 Well that and that's all I 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:08.280
 you asked me to do is that I do not 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.280
 It seems a normal theme for one 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.810
 I think something has broken something does not seem like a 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.290
 theme to make a whole video is more 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.790
 it seems to me that it is so superficial 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.719
 I do not like doing it because 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.719
 the table trembles 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.540
 is that I'm not so beautiful and so good 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.540
 dressed and all that 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.240
 I do not like to say it, that is if I like it 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.490
 my opinion 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.650
 but it does not mean it's really 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.690
 there may be a lot more handsome people 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.880
 but it seems to me more beautiful those five 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.530
 people or I seem better dressed 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.960
 those five people or four I do not know 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.510
 how many did I say but it seems wrong to say 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.820
 because fuck you can tell someone to the 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.410
 what and feel bad and everything is 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.830
 then I do not like to do these 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.810
 things because if this photo 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.410
 and that's all I had to say in 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:09.670
 a video I had to me that here is 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.850
 I paid and then an angel I did not ask 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.860
 let me talk about drawings but I'm just going to 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.620
 say hello drawing drawings because it is 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.930
 I do not know what to say about my drawings anymore 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.630
 draw once in a video that goes 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.150
 video shit and it does not occur to me that 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.850
 talk about my drawings are drawings points 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.890
 what happens to me at the moment or what 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.890
 they ask me or the inspiration they have 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.879
 and that's just my drawings what what 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.459
 it comes to my head I have to have a 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.910
 paper by hand to express what is not another 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.910
 thing else 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.280
 just as if I write I write what 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.090
 I feel does not speak what I feel 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.090
 everything I feel 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.180

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.840
 drawings is that here I am doing 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.980

 folders with my drawings but I do not 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.160

 very ugly and that's it and then here too 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.030
 I write what I think and everything I do 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.400
 It's not a newspaper, it 's a stade 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.410
 francais of reminders and all that and 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.139
