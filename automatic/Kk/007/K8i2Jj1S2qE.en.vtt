00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.719
 Nine people I'm getting reimbursed too 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:10.760
 a new video marginal today too 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.840
 another weapons guide and to 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.639
 mb 4 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.320
 Now we jump over what the weapon 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.900
 Actually the damage is 25 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.240
 until 18 this is a normal hurt it 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.740
 also gives lgs the catch at 34 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.080
 harm to finally usually a bit 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.960
 slower and in the model need 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.180
 we have two to three hits in the head 46 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.619
 hit the chest and five to seven 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.899
 hit the legs 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.399
 Jobs did is at eight meters that is 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.539
 We can do a damage to eight meters 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.670
 from 25 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.769
 then it drops to 60 meters and 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.819
 Although then we have the minimum damage 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.589
 from 18 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:43.879
 the fire rate is relatively high and thus 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.729
 800 apn 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.800
 So 800 shot per minute can do the thing 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.019
 quite a few balls raushauen and thus 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.299
 an enemy really under continuous fire 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.760
 Keep the cure speed is 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:57.829
 620 meters per second that's a very 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.449
 high value that gives us the advantage that 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.429
 the moving targets a little easier 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.739
 can meet and the range of 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.750
 130 m is a value we rarely 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.850
 but worth a mention 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.570
 but very interesting is the capacity 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.120
 is 200 shot always two cars so 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.650
 that is not without us so we can 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.200
 shoot enough balls out and we 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.570
 really can make the opponents easy 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.310
 but they have to shoot down like that 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.130
 ball can be recharged for a very long time 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.570
 namely 62 seconds is long time that 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.350
 there you should go in cover 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.060
 and this time 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.060
 unfortunately you need that 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.840
 Now it goes on with the recoil 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.969
 Germany upwards is 0.4 of 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.159
 conclusion to the right 04 lessons 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.439
 to the left 02 how to use his weapon 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.110
 but very strong upward right 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.979
 beats with saying minimal 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.350
 swings to the left though 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.179
 mainly to the right advantage is still 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.860
 the multiplier in the first shot is 1 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.750
 that means we can go public 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.030
 the conclusion would not be higher 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.990
 become 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.330
 and the stock market boom also very 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.100
 interesting by just the spill this 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.510
 has in sight 03 if you are not 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.730
 moved and how to move when 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.100
 so far it's 20 that's very high 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.680
 means when he shoots and you at it one 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.720
 little moves you will almost nothing 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.950
 Meet the in the mind, you have the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.990
 absolutely avoid 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.490
 I should not need the tax 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.740
 you read immediately the values â€‹â€‹are 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.390
 very very high the thing is likely 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.910
 sprayed extremely 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.140
 But then you can go back to the good of the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.490
 The two-wheeler shot that can 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.290
 we still have enough to talk about 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.140
 balls which can therefore be like 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.230
 but always necessarily inspired 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.270
 that's a huge advantage 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.920
 if you shoot her mini 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.570
 burston soon multiplied by 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.120
 first shot he is only one we can 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.080
 Shoot the weapon with great accuracy 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.910
 really good 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.600
 now we need correct setup 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.070
 As a visor I would the cobra the trio 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.770
 I have the cobra here now 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.260
 because weapons with a higher backlog 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.340
 I personally think so in cobra 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.540
 easier to control the stretch 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.310
 so that helps somehow so much 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.030
 feel something with it 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.070
 That's why I would look minimal 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.970
 recommend more but wants to coordinate 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.070
 I can do that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.050
 Unfortunately, as something that is due to distance in the 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.610
 he fights the tactical light 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.590
 or the lamp what my 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.270
 dear market and on distance one can 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.120
 quietly grab the amplifier 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.650
 The laser is not like this time 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.300
 useful as it can not save much 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.840
 laser does not bring so much to every case 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.130
 me nice thing but here is not 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.320
 good enough the thing would still be 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.330
 will scatter enough can even run to 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.730
 this laser and tactical light 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.170
 combination grabbing first row 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.209
 I kept slipping the commentators 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.310
 to the left and right again something 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.260
 To reduce more is in my eyes 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.550
 always very important crazy then left 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.500
 and right is always such a problem 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.670
 sometimes because they always vary so much 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.410
 It may be difficult to do that 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.750
 check that the compensatory 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.600
 all the hard run which 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.680
 recoil too much and pull up 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.060
 the muffler it actually no 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.950
 problem with those who wants to can 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.450
 like to use there are situations where the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.130
 silencer is not so good either 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.200
 and then also the negative effect 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.269
 of the capacitor 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.750
 Dignity for round or short grip 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.820
 to grab 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.290
 i have to say i really like it a lot 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.880
 like the effect sometimes even 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.340
 not so 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.080
 strong but is to be compensated or too 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.550
 a muzzle brake you notice the already 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.500
 quite a bit you can do it a bit 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.180
 increase the precision a bit 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.430
 and then the weapon is actually 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.860
 overall, control it very well with the 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.420
 minibus made himself very well should 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.370
 each the next water-holding well 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.050
 do you want my recommendation I am yes 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.520
 not so the player type for two legs 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.860
 because I can only do it 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.640
 two as rum are either I make 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.370
 Never open the thing or I'll stand up 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.710
 So in the sense I use the mp4 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.950
 like to run all the way to one 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.840
 offensive variant with 200 shows 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.400
 aggressively use a front with ammunition 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.950
 to be able to 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.540
 yes that was one weapons money to mb 4 on 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.880
 the last push so about 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.830
 I usually do it on Mondays 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.840
 is the dc weapons could be synonymous something 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.820
 come earlier and but I also had 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.870
 to do a good job that became very tight though 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.980
 I hope so 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.870
 managed if you do now on 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.940
 monday see then I made it and 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.940
 the light video is purely skin had
