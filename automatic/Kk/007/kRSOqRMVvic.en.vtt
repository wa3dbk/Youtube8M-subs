compare<00:00:01.820> the<00:00:02.820> effectiveness<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:04.140> value<00:00:05.069> of

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
compare the effectiveness the value of

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.620 
compare the effectiveness the value of
fast<00:00:07.189> training<00:00:08.189> versus<00:00:08.730> slow<00:00:09.090> training

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
fast training versus slow training

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.020 
fast training versus slow training
well<00:00:12.630> now<00:00:12.830> what<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.950> your<00:00:14.099> definition<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.790> fast

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
well now what is your definition of fast

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.880 
well now what is your definition of fast
what<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.049> your<00:00:16.230> definition<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.890> slow<00:00:18.710> well<00:00:19.710> I'm

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
what is your definition of slow well I'm

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.980 
what is your definition of slow well I'm
gonna<00:00:20.039> give<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> demonstration<00:00:20.820> here<00:00:21.330> and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
gonna give you a demonstration here and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.540 
gonna give you a demonstration here and
then<00:00:22.109> I'm<00:00:22.230> gonna<00:00:22.350> ask<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.130> tell<00:00:23.340> me

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
then I'm gonna ask you to tell me

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.089 
then I'm gonna ask you to tell me
whether<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> fast<00:00:24.570> movement<00:00:24.990> or<00:00:25.619> slow

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
whether this is a fast movement or slow

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.160 
whether this is a fast movement or slow
movement<00:00:26.640> no<00:00:27.029> catch

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.550 

is<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.070> fast<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:35.579> slow

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.870 

it's<00:00:40.160> obviously<00:00:40.670> slow<00:00:41.590> that's<00:00:42.590> 150<00:00:43.310> degrees

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
it's obviously slow that's 150 degrees

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.590 
it's obviously slow that's 150 degrees
per<00:00:44.180> second<00:00:45.100> let's<00:00:46.100> prove<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:47.380> thousand<00:00:48.380> one

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
per second let's prove that thousand one

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.890 
per second let's prove that thousand one
thousand<00:00:50.600> two<00:00:51.489> thousand<00:00:52.489> three<00:00:52.700> so<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:53.720> might

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
thousand two thousand three so it might

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.689 
thousand two thousand three so it might
be<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:54.140> hundred<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:54.559> forty<00:00:54.860> five<00:00:55.070> degrees<00:00:55.520> or

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
be a hundred and forty five degrees or

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.970 
be a hundred and forty five degrees or
152<00:00:56.540> degrees<00:00:56.840> that's<00:00:57.230> approximately<00:00:57.949> a

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
152 degrees that's approximately a

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.950 
152 degrees that's approximately a
hundred<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:58.460> fifty<00:00:58.760> degrees<00:00:59.059> per<00:00:59.300> second<00:00:59.690> and

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
hundred and fifty degrees per second and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.100 
hundred and fifty degrees per second and
that's<00:01:00.739> slow

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
that's slow

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.590 
that's slow

he<00:01:24.320> wasn't<00:01:24.530> comparing<00:01:25.009> fast<00:01:25.399> to<00:01:25.670> slow<00:01:25.850> he<00:01:26.330> was

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
he wasn't comparing fast to slow he was

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.660 
he wasn't comparing fast to slow he was
being<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.869> comparing<00:01:27.380> very<00:01:27.710> slow<00:01:28.280> to

being the comparing very slow to
extremely<00:01:29.240> slow<00:01:31.330> but<00:01:32.330> he<00:01:32.479> labeled<00:01:32.960> him<00:01:33.050> fast

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
extremely slow but he labeled him fast

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.950 
extremely slow but he labeled him fast
and<00:01:33.649> slow<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:35.060> all<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.360> idiots<00:01:35.720> out<00:01:35.899> there

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
and slow so all the idiots out there

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.920 
and slow so all the idiots out there
dumb<00:01:36.410> enough<00:01:36.619> to<00:01:36.680> believe<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.630> look<00:01:38.630> at<00:01:38.810> it

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
dumb enough to believe this look at it

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.070 
dumb enough to believe this look at it
and<00:01:39.080> say<00:01:39.170> oh<00:01:39.200> yes<00:01:40.479> because<00:01:41.479> what<00:01:41.840> does<00:01:41.960> the

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
and say oh yes because what does the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.810 
and say oh yes because what does the
average<00:01:42.229> person<00:01:42.440> see<00:01:43.130> when<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:43.490> tell<00:01:43.700> him

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
average person see when you tell him

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.380 
average person see when you tell him
ninety<00:01:44.450> degrees<00:01:44.780> per<00:01:45.020> second<00:01:46.090> they<00:01:47.090> can<00:01:47.150> no

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
ninety degrees per second they can no

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.480 
ninety degrees per second they can no
more<00:01:47.570> relate<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:48.380> than<00:01:48.619> they<00:01:48.710> can<00:01:48.770> fly<00:01:49.130> by

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
more relate to that than they can fly by

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.359 
more relate to that than they can fly by
flapping<00:01:49.640> their<00:01:50.119> ears<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:50.659> what<00:01:50.900> do<00:01:50.990> they<00:01:51.140> do

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
flapping their ears so what do they do

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.859 
flapping their ears so what do they do
they<00:01:52.369> relate<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:53.090> only<00:01:53.420> thing<00:01:53.630> they've

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
they relate to the only thing they've

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.630 
they relate to the only thing they've
ever<00:01:54.020> seen<00:01:54.170> with<00:01:54.650> ninety<00:01:55.009> on<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.490> that's

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
ever seen with ninety on it and that's

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.999 
ever seen with ninety on it and that's
the<00:01:55.790> speedometer<00:01:56.119> on<00:01:56.479> their<00:01:56.659> car<00:01:56.960> oh<00:01:57.229> yes<00:01:57.650> 90

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
the speedometer on their car oh yes 90

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.679 
the speedometer on their car oh yes 90
miles<00:01:58.189> an<00:01:58.310> hour<00:01:58.400> let's<00:01:58.640> fast<00:01:58.909> right<00:01:59.210> now<00:01:59.240> yes

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
miles an hour let's fast right now yes

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.060 
miles an hour let's fast right now yes
therefore<00:01:59.960> at<00:02:00.200> ninety<00:02:00.409> degrees<00:02:00.619> per<00:02:00.770> second

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
therefore at ninety degrees per second

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.330 
therefore at ninety degrees per second
is<00:02:01.189> fast<00:02:02.170> do<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.200> exaggerate<00:02:03.979> no<00:02:04.159> I'm

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
is fast do I exaggerate no I'm

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.330 
is fast do I exaggerate no I'm
understating<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:06.350> besides<00:02:06.740> they've<00:02:07.159> been

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
understating and besides they've been

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.900 
understating and besides they've been
told<00:02:07.640> it's<00:02:08.060> fast

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
told it's fast

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.160 
told it's fast
now<00:02:10.910> they<00:02:11.180> compared<00:02:11.690> these<00:02:11.989> two<00:02:12.200> groups<00:02:14.170> they

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
now they compared these two groups they

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.990 
now they compared these two groups they
were<00:02:15.230> gonna<00:02:15.410> settle<00:02:15.739> this<00:02:15.860> sine<00:02:16.400> typically

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
were gonna settle this sine typically

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.729 
were gonna settle this sine typically
once<00:02:17.329> and<00:02:17.540> for<00:02:17.750> all<00:02:17.810> stop<00:02:18.290> all<00:02:18.530> this

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
once and for all stop all this

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.630 
once and for all stop all this
foolishness<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.610> argument<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:22.250> then<00:02:22.459> they

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
foolishness this argument and then they

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.690 
foolishness this argument and then they
announce<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.299> they're<00:02:23.510> equal<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:25.400> fast

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
announce that they're equal that fast

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.150 
announce that they're equal that fast
and<00:02:26.090> slow<00:02:26.690> no<00:02:27.350> difference<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:30.680> yet<00:02:30.890> from

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
and slow no difference and yet from

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.850 
and slow no difference and yet from
their<00:02:31.400> own<00:02:31.519> data<00:02:31.959> they're<00:02:32.959> slow<00:02:33.380> group

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
their own data they're slow group

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.880 
their own data they're slow group
therefore<00:02:34.640> they're<00:02:34.910> 60<00:02:35.329> degrees<00:02:36.290> per<00:02:36.530> second

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
therefore they're 60 degrees per second

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.650 
therefore they're 60 degrees per second
produced<00:02:37.280> fifty<00:02:37.970> four<00:02:38.209> units<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.959> improvement
