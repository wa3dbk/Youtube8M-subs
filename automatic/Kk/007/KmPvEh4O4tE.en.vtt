00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:06.615
My name is Chandni.

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:12.942
I am wearing nine bangles.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:17.632
Beloved, wait. I am helpless.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.291
The heart beats.

00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:22.098
Footsteps dance into a rhythm
and melody blooms.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.691
I won't listen so soon.

00:00:26.373 --> 00:00:29.091
Take back the palanquin.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.360
I won't go for a year or two.

00:00:33.907 --> 00:00:36.398
Take back the palanquin.

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:38.604
Have your ever fallen in love?

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:41.393
No. Then fall in love once.

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:45.915
I have fallen in love...
and he's crazy and passionate.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.765
Beloved!

00:00:49.193 --> 00:00:54.359
I had heard about Delhi
from all the cities.

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:59.920
In this Delhi city, I met a girl
called Chandni.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.350
In her alluring eyes,
my heart drowned.

00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:11.098
You never know, at what point,
who comes into your life.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.812
I don't know anything
about your life.

00:01:14.184 --> 00:01:16.644
Have you ever heard the music
of the rain fall?

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:21.283
The dark clouds collided
with the mountains.

00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:24.872
The water is smouldered.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.816
The dark clouds collided
with the mountains.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.737
The water is smouldered.

00:01:35.526 --> 00:01:37.183
It's smouldering.

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:43.442
Love is a gust of wind...
which takes away everything.

00:01:44.158 --> 00:01:45.965
You are a different person
in office...

00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:47.884
...and a different one at home.

00:01:48.853 --> 00:01:51.858
Chandni, one form is for the world...

00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:53.863
...and the other is for oneself.

00:01:54.422 --> 00:01:58.390
When your desires take the form
of words, time stands still.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:03.147
I will keep my desires
in your heart.

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:08.297
Come, my life.
I will give you my life.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.607
Come, my life.
I will give you my life.

00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:17.578
Have you ever heard
someone's heartbeats?

00:02:18.188 --> 00:02:23.441
It's the monsoon season again.

00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:31.377
It's the monsoon season again.

00:02:34.262 --> 00:02:39.183
My heart is suffering again!

00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:46.840
It's the monsoon season again.

00:02:47.397 --> 00:02:50.320
Have you ever seen the dew
falling on the flowers?

00:02:51.055 --> 00:02:57.674
There are sweet songs on
your lips and mine, beloved.

00:02:59.604 --> 00:03:06.091
I walk ahead and love
follows me, beloved.

00:03:08.253 --> 00:03:10.698
Have you ever seen two sides of love?

00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:17.851
You tell me, I will tell you
my love story!

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.919
Who is she? How does your
dream girl look like?

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:30.345
When someone is in love,
there's just one tune...

00:03:30.826 --> 00:03:33.046
...one sound and one name
on their lips.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.728
Chandni!

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:37.122
O my Chandni!

00:03:39.925 --> 00:03:42.203
With the colourful ambience.

00:03:42.664 --> 00:03:44.820
With the kohl of your eyes.

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:48.314
I have written your name
on my heart.

00:03:50.507 --> 00:03:51.451
Chandni!

00:03:52.587 --> 00:03:53.979
O my Chandni!
