00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
but the point is Rick is actually here

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.199 
but the point is Rick is actually here
he's<00:03:07.989> he's<00:03:08.680> looking<00:03:09.340> at<00:03:09.549> Elaine's<00:03:09.849> looking<00:03:10.120> at

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
he's he's looking at Elaine's looking at

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.000 
he's he's looking at Elaine's looking at
this<00:03:10.360> building<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.840> little<00:03:10.989> side-by-side<00:03:11.680> shop

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
this building a little side-by-side shop

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.490 
this building a little side-by-side shop
it's<00:03:12.910> definitely<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.450> same<00:03:13.480> building<00:03:14.110> so

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
it's definitely the same building so

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.110 
it's definitely the same building so
that's<00:03:14.590> cool<00:03:14.829> so<00:03:15.040> basically<00:03:15.370> Rick<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:15.819> right

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
that's cool so basically Rick is right

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.539 
that's cool so basically Rick is right
down<00:03:16.360> there<00:03:16.599> in<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.810> shot<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.379> if<00:03:18.190> we<00:03:18.400> advance

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
down there in the shot and if we advance

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.699 
down there in the shot and if we advance
this<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:20.140> know<00:03:20.200> piece<00:03:20.560> the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
this is the you know piece the

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:21.390 
this is the you know piece the
resistance

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
resistance

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.479 
resistance
you<00:03:21.849> see<00:03:22.180> Grady<00:03:22.840> Memorial<00:03:23.140> Hospital<00:03:24.040> right

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
behind him in this particular shot that

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.410 
behind him in this particular shot that
is<00:03:26.829> definitely<00:03:27.220> cool<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.639> angle<00:03:28.030> more<00:03:28.299> or

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
is definitely cool the angle more or

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.330 
is definitely cool the angle more or
less<00:03:28.569> at<00:03:29.079> adds<00:03:29.620> up<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:31.060> he<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:32.440> that<00:03:32.500> that

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
less at adds up and he on that that

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.960 
less at adds up and he on that that
white<00:03:33.639> parking<00:03:34.120> garage<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.889> is<00:03:36.430> cool

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
white parking garage so that is cool

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.809 
white parking garage so that is cool
there<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:37.389> Beth<00:03:37.720> Peggy<00:03:38.290> in<00:03:38.530> three<00:03:39.099> three<00:03:39.639> more

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
there so Beth Peggy in three three more

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.030 
there so Beth Peggy in three three more
seasons<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.599> know<00:03:40.630> technically<00:03:41.139> she's<00:03:41.859> up
