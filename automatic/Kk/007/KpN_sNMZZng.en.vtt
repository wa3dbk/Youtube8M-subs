00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.770
 Hello, my name is Rosilene and I'm going today.

 prepare for you a delicious 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.070
 pork ribs with a lot of sauce 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.250
 Special 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.230
 Let's go to the ingredients 1 pound and a half 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:32.730
 little guava cake 350 grams guava 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.570
 500ml of filtered water to 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:42.660
 dissolve guava a cup of sauce 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:48.300
 of soybean 40 grams of ginger an onion 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:52.469
 large chopped juice of 1 lemon two 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.440
 pepper finger finely chopped two 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.710
 tablespoons of garlic, or 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.829
 crushed salt to taste 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.510
 So let's start with the little 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.900
 little cake has already been chosen 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.700
 thin around 12 bones and this piece 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.700
 serves three to four people 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:29.890
 Let's play a little juice 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:33.250
 lime on the piece to find out more 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.490
 taste also helps me to cut a little 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.490
 of fat 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.450
 Let's sprinkle a little salt with 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.759
 very careful 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.500
 remembering that the soy sauce already has salt 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:57.130
 can also be used a little bit of 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:59.140
 pepper this is August our 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.450
 little girl will rest some 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.119
 and we're going to prepare the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.119
 marinade we put water 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:15.090
 then we'll put the guava in 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.090
 pieces 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.680
 we do not act on tolls 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.629
 let's hit it well 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.019
 We are going to turn the night ice and add 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.019
 the other marinade seasonings 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.939
 note that was good neck eye 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.109
 the onion she gets in here now 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.290
 then we put a soy sauce 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.750
 the garlic 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.950
 if you want to decrease or increase the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:31.080
 Garlic amount is August put here 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:34.970
 the lemon juice is the lemon 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.790
 important because it goes from the acidity in the sauce 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:43.489
 finally our pepper girl finger 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.489
 I suggest taking segments 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.750
 mix well 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.630
 The interesting thing is that she stays all 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.630
 covered with this sauce 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.340
 You'll water it so you'll use it. 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.340
 everyone 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.110
 a tip if the sauce stays that way too 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.780
 thick and when to start 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.970
 caramel around baking sheet 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.240
 you can and by putting a little bit of 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.240
 Water 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.900
 then we showered the whole little basket with 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.440
 This sauce, now we 're going to turn this 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.710
 line so that the meat is down and 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.169
 receive all this broth and she cooks 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.319
 this seasoning and stay well hydrated 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:05:02.169
 we will also cover this part that surfaces 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:05:04.800
 with sauce if necessary put more 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.800
 world 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.960
 a tip this little girl she gets a lot 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.000
 tasty 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.699
 if you prepare it with a day of 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.060
 advance this marinade and lead to 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.490
 refrigerator leaves 24 hours 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.069
 the other day just remove and put 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.490
 cover with foil and lead to 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:32.789
 cover let's cover with foil 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.639
 remembering that the paper should be with the 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:39.270
 bright side in contact was roasted 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.979
 Matte up this way 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.039
 repeat if more heat 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:48.650
 so we'll cut here as far as 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.650
 and we'll find out 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:56.360
 so then covered can make small 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:06:00.800
 above for steam outlet 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:04.580
 or leave a small side exit 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.830
 she will pass and be moderate for about 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.789
 an hour and a half later we'll take 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.689
 paper and turn left blushing while 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.539
 baking 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:17.360
 at this time you can download it with 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:21.020
 also with sauce or put a little bit 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.860
 water spent an hour and half hour 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.860
 turn the little door 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.320
 ready now let's just blush 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.320
 few minutes 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.120
 this sauce and formed on the bottom of the 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.780
 baking tray 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.520
 We're going to give it all away with him and 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.530
 those who do not like onion 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.360
 very sharp taste of garlic 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.360
 Do you have the option of which sauce 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.040
 we can not put the slices of guava 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:17.060
 and using a cutter you can pick up 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:20.300
 little pieces of guava is not and do 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.130
 these big little stars and 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.950
 decorate the dish 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.380
 I'll finish with the fried cabbage too. 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.480
 you just need to be well chopped up 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.480
 painted in hot oil drain on paper 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:35.920
 towel we'll put here that will give 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.920
