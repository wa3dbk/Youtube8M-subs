I<00:00:02.360> need<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.480> know<00:00:03.659> how<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.929> get<00:00:04.110> my<00:00:04.290> ps4

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
I need to know how to get my ps4

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.730 
I need to know how to get my ps4
controller<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.730> charge<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:07.049> light<00:00:07.290> bar<00:00:07.560> will

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
controller to charge the light bar will

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.169 
controller to charge the light bar will
blink<00:00:07.950> orange<00:00:08.340> as<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.670> charges<00:00:08.880> the

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
blink orange as it charges the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.180 
blink orange as it charges the
controller<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.050> when<00:00:10.469> charging<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.130> complete

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
controller and when charging is complete

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.629 
controller and when charging is complete
the<00:00:11.969> light<00:00:12.210> bar<00:00:12.480> turns<00:00:12.780> off<00:00:13.099> thus<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.340> unit

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the light bar turns off thus the unit

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.609 
the light bar turns off thus the unit
may<00:00:14.790> not<00:00:15.000> be<00:00:15.240> charging<00:00:15.780> because<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.500> is

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
may not be charging because it is

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.630 
may not be charging because it is
already<00:00:16.920> charged

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
already charged

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.260

I<00:00:17.760> think<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> controller<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.619> dead<00:00:20.060> what<00:00:21.060> do<00:00:21.210> I

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
I think the controller is dead what do I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.769 
I think the controller is dead what do I
do

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
do

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.990 
do
the<00:00:22.470> controller<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.039> charged<00:00:23.609> when<00:00:23.880> you

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the controller is charged when you

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
the controller is charged when you
connect<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.390> controller<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.170> ps4<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
connect the controller to the ps4 with a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.089 
connect the controller to the ps4 with a
USB<00:00:26.760> cable<00:00:26.990> did<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.109> use<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.590> right<00:00:28.740> type<00:00:29.070> of

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
USB cable did you use the right type of

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.250 
USB cable did you use the right type of
cable<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.789> make<00:00:29.910> sure<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.630> fully<00:00:30.960> plugged

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
cable and make sure it is fully plugged

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
in at both ends that's the first thing I

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.100 
in at both ends that's the first thing I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
charging if you play the controller

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.530 
charging if you play the controller
until<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> dies<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.369> will<00:01:32.579> take<00:01:32.970> two<00:01:33.150> hours<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
until it dies it will take two hours to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.590 
until it dies it will take two hours to
charge<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.430> not<00:01:35.610> let<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.000> charge<00:01:36.299> long

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
charge if you do not let it charge long

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.990 
charge if you do not let it charge long
enough<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.439> will<00:01:37.650> seem<00:01:37.890> never<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.549> charged

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
enough it will seem never to be charged

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.499 
enough it will seem never to be charged
so<00:01:39.299> I'll<00:01:40.140> leave<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.590> overnight

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
so I'll leave it on overnight

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.850 
so I'll leave it on overnight
