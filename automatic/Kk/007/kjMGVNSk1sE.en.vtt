 made even if you lived several lives 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.039
 because you are a good man Edward

 so take what you want and die 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.320

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.680

 booties looting and adventures you sign up 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.649
 long from here come we toast by the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.370
 freedom for the rich gentlemen and the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.530
 women and you're just for a full world 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.450
 of scoundrels more valid than kings and 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.550
 queens who have expelled us as 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.130
 men of fortune we enjoy 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.100
 abundance and satisfaction pleasure and 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.820
 comfort and freedom and power and man 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.580
 with judgment I would choose that life because it 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.220
 has sunk my hands in murky waters and 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.260
 when I take them out I have resolved that it is better to be 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.290
 commander that to vulgar man and 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.290
 current 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.310
 as well 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:37.950
 who was flying nearby saw it and thought that 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:40.720
 equally strong and able to do it 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.569
 trying to imitate life was launched 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.020
 fast and with great eaves on the 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.700
 fur of a large karting but when trying 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.130
 of lifting the flight he saw that he could not 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.400
 raise which since its size and its 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.560
 strength were not up to the task and while 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.170
 the jackdaw was struggling the ram 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.800
 I even noticed his presence a little more 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.860
 far 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.560
 the pastor enjoyed watching the 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.349
 bird flutter 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.470
 by pressing he took the jackdaw and 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.160
 him mattress that night gave them the great 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.860
 villa to his children as a souvenir 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.580
 they live strange and little father screamed 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.580
 between laughs 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.210
 and after 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:00.330
 two years good you promised and you left 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:03.449
 when I needed it the most, it was all yours 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.500
 because this wandering life is not happy 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:09.700
 I'm so close Carlos please let me 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.880
 do what 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:18.180
 current corner invoice does not move me the 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.180
 resentment but the heart now 

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:26.849
 to all 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.849
 I always try to destroy in 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:32.270
 place to cut even if it's forced on you 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.270
 same 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.520
 captain in way you see yourself lacking in 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.520
 spirit 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.980
 my head is killing me 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.980
 standing 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.230
 you put me in a bind of should 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.260
 Hold a grudge for leaving me with 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.070
 roberts 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:45.980
 but the truth is that I'm glad to see you 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:49.240

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.240

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.440

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.160

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.479

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.590
 visit to the murderers 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.590
