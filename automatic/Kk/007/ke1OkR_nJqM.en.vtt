00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
everything go down this is this is where

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.299 
everything go down this is this is where
the<00:00:50.579> problem<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.530> whenever<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.739> first<00:00:52.949> open

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
this up like the the like default I

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.910 
this up like the the like default I
guess

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
guess

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.670 
guess
this<00:00:59.609> default<00:01:00.030> setting<00:01:00.149> makes<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.199> current

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
this default setting makes this current

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.969 
this default setting makes this current
frame<00:01:02.010> which<00:01:02.850> you're<00:01:03.480> usually<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.379> zero

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
frame which you're usually on like zero

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.679

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
or whatever current frame you're on is

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.730 
or whatever current frame you're on is
the<00:01:06.810> only<00:01:06.990> frame<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.590> what

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the only frame it's going to do what
