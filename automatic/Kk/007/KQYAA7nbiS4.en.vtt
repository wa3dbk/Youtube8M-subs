you're<00:01:06.570> traveling<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.260> don't<00:01:07.290> be

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you're traveling up so you don't be

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.940 
you're traveling up so you don't be
taking<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.979> big<00:01:08.130> bottle<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.650> this<00:01:10.650> fits

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
taking a big bottle like this this fits

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.859 
taking a big bottle like this this fits
nicely<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.670> your<00:01:11.760> bag<00:01:12.000> wherever<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.689> wanna

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
nicely in your bag wherever you wanna

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.950 
nicely in your bag wherever you wanna
play<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:14.000> obviously<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.390> releases<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
play and obviously this releases the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.719 
play and obviously this releases the
less<00:01:16.110> product<00:01:16.590> then<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.729> bottle<00:01:18.180> does<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
less product then the bottle does and

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.330 
less product then the bottle does and
yeah<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.390> i<00:01:21.720> put<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> cotton<00:01:22.470> pad<00:01:22.799> cotton

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
yeah so i put it on a cotton pad cotton

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
yeah so i put it on a cotton pad cotton
or<00:01:23.460> whatever<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.390> swipe<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.200> my<00:01:25.320> face

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
or whatever then swipe it up in my face

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.580 
or whatever then swipe it up in my face
gently<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.400> that's<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.810> i<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.439> as

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
gently and that's it so i just use it as

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.319 
gently and that's it so i just use it as
if<00:01:29.070> i<00:01:29.189> was<00:01:29.310> using<00:01:29.549> normal<00:01:29.850> toner<00:01:30.180> or

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
if i was using normal toner or

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.920 
if i was using normal toner or
astringent<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:32.240> thus<00:01:33.240> all<00:01:33.570> i've<00:01:33.720> been<00:01:33.750> doing

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
astringent and thus all i've been doing

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.929 
astringent and thus all i've been doing
I've<00:01:34.229> been<00:01:34.259> using<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:34.890> maybe<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I've been using it for maybe like a

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.649 
I've been using it for maybe like a
month<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.100> I've<00:01:38.180> noticed<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.299> there's

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
month and I've noticed that there's

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.399 
month and I've noticed that there's
there's<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.530> significant<00:01:41.400> difference<00:01:42.290> in<00:01:43.290> that

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
there's a significant difference in that

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.639 
there's a significant difference in that
in<00:01:43.619> how<00:01:43.920> many<00:01:43.979> break<00:01:44.490> outside<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:46.259> it

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
in how many break outside get I think it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.120 
in how many break outside get I think it
really<00:01:46.680> has<00:01:47.159> been<00:01:47.780> preventing<00:01:49.130> breakouts

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
really has been preventing breakouts

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.740 
really has been preventing breakouts
because<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> only<00:01:50.850> thing<00:01:51.270> I've<00:01:51.450> changed

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
because it's the only thing I've changed

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.690 
because it's the only thing I've changed
it<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.369> my<00:01:53.369> skincare<00:01:53.880> regime<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:55.130> i<00:01:56.130> think<00:01:56.579> i

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it in my skincare regime and i think i

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.680 
it in my skincare regime and i think i
mentioned<00:01:56.969> before

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
mentioned before

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.980 
mentioned before
another<00:01:57.960> video<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.490> like<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.300> use<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.450> witch

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.750 
on his arm to see how my skin would

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
react to it and I definitely have to say

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.310 
react to it and I definitely have to say
that<00:02:14.970> there<00:02:15.120> are<00:02:15.240> definitely<00:02:15.600> fewer

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
that there are definitely fewer
