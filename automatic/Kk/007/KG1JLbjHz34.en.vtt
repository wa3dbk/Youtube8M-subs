00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
240 rifleman and 264 Zukas I mean that

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.779 
240 rifleman and 264 Zukas I mean that
that<00:00:28.320> must<00:00:28.529> be<00:00:28.680> really<00:00:28.830> easy<00:00:28.949> combination<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
that must be really easy combination to

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
that must be really easy combination to
take<00:00:30.090> down<00:00:30.240> because<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> really

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
take down because that is a really

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.430 
take down because that is a really
fragile<00:00:32.189> unit<00:00:32.730> right<00:00:32.880> there<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.840> I'm<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
fragile unit right there so I'm going to

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.350 
fragile unit right there so I'm going to
be<00:00:34.590> swapping<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:35.070> base<00:00:35.250> around<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.329> little

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
first rocket launcher is actually doing

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.260 
first rocket launcher is actually doing
work<00:02:00.920> these<00:02:01.920> are<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> bunch<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.670> five<00:02:02.850> mandela

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
work these are a bunch of five mandela

Zukas<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.020> more<00:02:04.200> off<00:02:04.409> my<00:02:04.649> comment<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.189> really

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
Zukas and more off my comment is really

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.609 
Zukas and more off my comment is really
surprising<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.509> me<00:02:06.630> there's<00:02:06.840> no<00:02:07.049> medics<00:02:07.409> there

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
surprising to me there's no medics there

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.960 
surprising to me there's no medics there
because<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.250> were<00:02:08.340> Maddox<00:02:08.789> there

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
because if there were Maddox there

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.440 
because if there were Maddox there
that'd<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:10.110> bit

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
that'd be a little bit

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.720 
that'd be a little bit
as<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:11.170> guys<00:02:11.260> can<00:02:11.470> see<00:02:11.530> were<00:02:11.830> founding<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.459> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
as you guys can see were founding of the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.850 
as you guys can see were founding of the
unit's<00:02:13.090> very<00:02:13.390> nicely<00:02:13.690> here<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.410> hopefully

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
unit's very nicely here and hopefully

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.650 
unit's very nicely here and hopefully
that<00:02:15.310> shocked<00:02:15.519> lunch<00:02:15.730> over<00:02:16.030> years<00:02:16.300> don't<00:02:16.450> be

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
that shocked lunch over years don't be

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.850 
that shocked lunch over years don't be
hitting<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.959> left<00:02:17.140> side<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.620> will<00:02:17.680> be

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
hitting the left side it will be

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.920 
hitting the left side it will be
extremely<00:02:18.190> convenient<00:02:18.790> then<00:02:19.300> more<00:02:19.599> zucca

start to pop in the very first wave is

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.600 
start to pop in the very first wave is
about<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.629> die<00:02:22.870> here<00:02:23.200> um<00:02:23.459> we're<00:02:24.459> definitely

there<00:02:27.970> are<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.120> many<00:02:28.480> units<00:02:28.930> on<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.230> field

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
there are so many units on the field

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.710 
there are so many units on the field
right<00:02:29.590> now<00:02:29.980> but<00:02:30.790> they're<00:02:31.060> dying<00:02:31.360> like<00:02:31.690> flies

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
all I kind of expect this shock launcher

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.490 
all I kind of expect this shock launcher
it<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.420> gone<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.840> other<00:02:37.870> shock<00:02:38.170> like<00:02:38.349> she's

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
it is gone the other shock like she's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.259 
it is gone the other shock like she's
gone<00:02:38.650> as<00:02:38.769> well<00:02:38.799> there's<00:02:39.099> only<00:02:39.269> rocket

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
gone as well there's only rocket

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.210 
gone as well there's only rocket
launches<00:02:40.629> right<00:02:40.810> now<00:02:41.019> left<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:41.860> let's<00:02:42.040> see

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
launches right now left but let's see

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.500 
launches right now left but let's see
how<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.489> one's<00:02:42.670> gonna<00:02:42.819> be<00:02:42.910> going<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.390> there

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
how this one's gonna be going and there

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.720 
how this one's gonna be going and there
comes<00:02:43.690> in<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.019> last<00:02:44.200> force<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.739> think<00:02:45.069> more

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
comes in the last force I think more

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.210 
comes in the last force I think more
Zukas<00:02:46.450> into<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.930> mix<00:02:47.170> I've<00:02:47.349> never<00:02:47.590> seen<00:02:47.920> so

Zukas into the mix I've never seen so

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.660 
Zukas into the mix I've never seen so
many<00:02:48.400> Zukas<00:02:49.000> ever<00:02:49.540> look<00:02:50.410> at<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.620> look<00:02:51.519> at

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
many Zukas ever look at the look at

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.600 
many Zukas ever look at the look at
these<00:02:51.880> girls<00:02:52.480> man<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.380> insane<00:02:54.069> and<00:02:54.400> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
these girls man this is insane and the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.220 
these girls man this is insane and the
walking<00:02:55.000> over<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.360> mines<00:02:55.599> which<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:56.019> very

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
walking over the mines which is very

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.080 
walking over the mines which is very
convenient<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.860> got<00:02:57.010> everything<00:02:57.459> relatively

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
convenient I got everything relatively

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.940 
convenient I got everything relatively
spread<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.510> out<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.590> going<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.829> be

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
spread it out so this is going to be

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.740 
spread it out so this is going to be
pretty<00:03:00.130> interesting<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.760> watch<00:03:00.940> let's<00:03:01.540> see

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
pretty interesting to watch let's see

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.940 
pretty interesting to watch let's see
how<00:03:01.840> well<00:03:02.079> we're<00:03:02.230> gonna<00:03:02.349> be<00:03:02.470> doing<00:03:02.620> here<00:03:02.890> I

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
how well we're gonna be doing here I

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.460 
how well we're gonna be doing here I
kind<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.280> feel<00:03:03.579> that<00:03:03.880> we<00:03:04.450> might<00:03:04.989> got<00:03:05.290> this

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
kind of feel that we might got this

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.140 
kind of feel that we might got this
depending<00:03:06.040> on<00:03:06.190> if<00:03:06.610> you're<00:03:06.760> going<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.030> be

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
depending on if you're going to be

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.280 
depending on if you're going to be
walking<00:03:07.269> on<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.660> mines<00:03:07.840> there's<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.110> mine

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
walking on the mines there's a mine

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.680 
walking on the mines there's a mine
right<00:03:08.500> there<00:03:08.530> good<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.489> be<00:03:09.579> having<00:03:09.940> damaging

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
right there good to be having damaging

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.300 
right there good to be having damaging
badly<00:03:10.989> there's<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.290> lot<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.470> minds<00:03:11.829> over<00:03:12.130> here

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
badly there's a lot of minds over here

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.400 
badly there's a lot of minds over here
hopefully<00:03:13.299> that's<00:03:13.510> going<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.810> be<00:03:13.930> enough<00:03:14.019> all

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
hopefully that's going to be enough all

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.740 
hopefully that's going to be enough all
this<00:03:15.340> actually<00:03:15.700> going<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:16.030> be<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.299> little<00:03:16.600> bit

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
this actually going to be a little bit

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.770 
this actually going to be a little bit
close<00:03:17.019> because<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.769> am<00:03:17.889> running<00:03:18.310> out<00:03:18.489> of

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
close because I am running out of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.970 
close because I am running out of
buildings<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.930> can<00:03:20.079> hit<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.440> zoo<00:03:20.590> cos<00:03:20.799> there

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
buildings that can hit the zoo cos there

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.250 
buildings that can hit the zoo cos there
is<00:03:21.069> a<00:03:21.220> mortar<00:03:21.609> over<00:03:21.880> here<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:22.569> mortar<00:03:23.049> is

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
is a mortar over here this mortar is

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.309 
is a mortar over here this mortar is
going<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.069> be<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.760> MVP<00:03:24.940> because<00:03:25.540> this<00:03:25.900> mortar

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
going to be the MVP because this mortar

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.410 
going to be the MVP because this mortar
is<00:03:26.440> going<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.769> be<00:03:26.859> taking<00:03:27.250> down<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.670> bunch<00:03:28.239> of

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
is going to be taking down a bunch of

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.960 
is going to be taking down a bunch of
Zukas<00:03:28.870> here<00:03:29.109> and<00:03:29.319> I<00:03:29.590> think<00:03:29.980> we<00:03:30.160> got<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.639> but

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
Zukas here and I think we got this but

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.900 
Zukas here and I think we got this but
only<00:03:31.299> just<00:03:31.329> only<00:03:32.170> just<00:03:32.530> making<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.549> couple<00:03:33.760> of

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
only just only just making a couple of

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.229 
only just only just making a couple of
the<00:03:34.030> small<00:03:34.329> adjustments<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.700> do<00:03:36.700> taking<00:03:37.090> down

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
the small adjustments to do taking down

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.080 
the small adjustments to do taking down
this<00:03:37.389> base<00:03:37.690> but<00:03:38.470> man<00:03:38.650> oh<00:03:38.680> man<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.130> force<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
this base but man oh man the force the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.449 
this base but man oh man the force the
force<00:03:40.359> is<00:03:40.630> absolutely<00:03:41.319> real<00:03:41.560> on<00:03:41.739> this<00:03:41.950> one<00:03:42.220> and

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
force is absolutely real on this one and

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.250 
force is absolutely real on this one and
it's<00:03:43.000> going<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.209> be<00:03:43.389> really<00:03:43.569> funny<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.930> see

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
it's going to be really funny to see

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.110 
it's going to be really funny to see
what<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.650> Zukas<00:03:44.920> are<00:03:45.040> going<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.220> be<00:03:45.310> wiping

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.020 
be a goner here too but these two
mortars<00:03:50.380> over<00:03:50.680> here<00:03:50.980> despite<00:03:51.609> them<00:03:51.850> not

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
mortars over here despite them not

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.000 
mortars over here despite them not
really<00:03:52.299> being<00:03:52.450> all<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.930> high<00:03:53.109> level<00:03:53.500> they're

there we go boom two more left and one
more<00:04:02.769> shot<00:04:03.099> should<00:04:03.459> be<00:04:03.519> enough<00:04:03.849> to<00:04:03.880> wipe<00:04:04.239> them

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
more shot should be enough to wipe them

a<00:04:28.120> way<00:04:28.840> more<00:04:29.080> powerful<00:04:29.259> than<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.740> really<00:04:29.979> was

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
a way more powerful than it really was

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
because well the amount of force that he

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.680 
because well the amount of force that he
had<00:04:32.919> or<00:04:33.220> at<00:04:33.400> least<00:04:33.550> my<00:04:33.759> victory<00:04:34.240> points<00:04:34.570> that's

would we I would be really curious to
see<00:04:48.789> stronger<00:04:49.630> true<00:04:49.900> combinations<00:04:50.500> in

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
see stronger true combinations in

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.100 
see stronger true combinations in
general<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.580> just<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.000> overall<00:04:52.270> placement

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
general and just the overall placement

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.990 
general and just the overall placement
with<00:04:53.289> lieutenant<00:04:53.800> em<00:04:53.860> man<00:04:54.070> being<00:04:54.669> done<00:04:54.970> a

with lieutenant em man being done a

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.520 
with lieutenant em man being done a
little<00:04:55.240> bit<00:04:55.419> smarter<00:04:55.900> than<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.169> is<00:04:56.289> right<00:04:56.320> now

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
little bit smarter than it is right now

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.370 
little bit smarter than it is right now
this<00:04:56.919> very<00:04:57.039> straightforward<00:04:58.030> so<00:04:59.020> I<00:04:59.050> don't

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
this very straightforward so I don't

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.290 
this very straightforward so I don't
really<00:04:59.470> see<00:04:59.650> lieutenant<00:05:00.310> Hammond<00:05:00.880> right<00:05:01.090> now

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300

as<00:05:01.570> a<00:05:01.780> big<00:05:02.169> challenge<00:05:02.470> but<00:05:03.070> still<00:05:03.340> regardless

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
as a big challenge but still regardless

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.810 
as a big challenge but still regardless
of<00:05:03.880> that<00:05:03.910> that<00:05:04.690> replay<00:05:05.169> was<00:05:05.800> a<00:05:05.830> bunch<00:05:06.190> of<00:05:06.370> fun<00:05:06.610> I

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
mean seeing so many units seeing 500

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.999 
mean seeing so many units seeing 500
units<00:05:10.180> being<00:05:10.750> on<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.080> field<00:05:11.229> almost<00:05:11.740> at<00:05:11.889> the
