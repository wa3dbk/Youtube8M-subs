00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
what other sort of examples of that are

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.930 
what other sort of examples of that are
there<00:00:58.929> more<00:00:59.620> power<00:00:59.859> helps<00:01:00.249> us<00:01:00.370> having<00:01:00.729> more

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
there more power helps us having more

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.599 
there more power helps us having more
NPCs<00:01:01.449> on<00:01:01.600> screen<00:01:01.929> that's<00:01:02.229> one<00:01:02.769> thing<00:01:02.949> we

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
NPCs on screen that's one thing we

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.430 
NPCs on screen that's one thing we
wanted<00:01:03.909> to<00:01:03.969> have<00:01:04.210> not<00:01:04.570> only<00:01:04.720> more<00:01:05.049> in<00:01:05.170> pieces

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
wanted to have not only more in pieces

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.590 
wanted to have not only more in pieces
but<00:01:05.590> smarter<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.280> PCs<00:01:06.640> on<00:01:06.820> screen<00:01:07.120> so<00:01:07.480> the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
but smarter and PCs on screen so the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.690 
but smarter and PCs on screen so the
crowd<00:01:07.840> interacts<00:01:08.290> with<00:01:08.380> itself<00:01:08.830> as<00:01:09.160> well<00:01:09.370> so

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
crowd interacts with itself as well so

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.040 
crowd interacts with itself as well so
SIF<00:01:09.970> just<00:01:10.210> happens<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.900> background

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
SIF just happens in the background

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.530 
SIF just happens in the background
without<00:01:11.710> player<00:01:12.100> interactions<00:01:12.790> like<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.330> map

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
without player interactions like the map

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.630 
without player interactions like the map
looks<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.140> huge<00:01:14.530> how<00:01:14.980> much<00:01:15.160> bigger<00:01:15.340> would<00:01:15.550> you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
looks so huge how much bigger would you

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.160 
looks so huge how much bigger would you
say<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:15.940> is<00:01:16.000> than<00:01:16.300> previous<00:01:16.690> instalments

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
say it is than previous instalments

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.960 
say it is than previous instalments
because<00:01:17.350> there<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.650> more<00:01:17.680> interior<00:01:18.280> space<00:01:18.490> not

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
because there is more interior space not

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.700 
because there is more interior space not
as<00:01:19.090> well<00:01:19.240> right<00:01:19.540> I'm<00:01:19.990> one<00:01:20.200> of<00:01:20.320> those<00:01:20.440> guys<00:01:20.500> that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
as well right I'm one of those guys that

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.570 
as well right I'm one of those guys that
don't<00:01:21.400> think<00:01:21.580> that<00:01:21.700> size<00:01:22.030> matters<00:01:22.600> but<00:01:23.020> uh<00:01:23.580> but

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
don't think that size matters but uh but

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.910 
don't think that size matters but uh but
the<00:01:25.030> map<00:01:25.180> is<00:01:25.360> huge<00:01:25.780> is<00:01:25.990> very<00:01:26.200> big<00:01:26.410> in<00:01:26.440> terms<00:01:26.800> of

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
the map is huge is very big in terms of

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.590 
the map is huge is very big in terms of
land<00:01:27.160> mass<00:01:27.400> it's<00:01:27.670> bigger<00:01:27.970> than<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.390> old

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
land mass it's bigger than the old

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.080 
land mass it's bigger than the old
islands<00:01:29.140> from<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.710> previous<00:01:30.190> AC<00:01:30.370> Black<00:01:30.790> Flag

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
islands from the previous AC Black Flag

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.780 
islands from the previous AC Black Flag
combined<00:01:32.020> together<00:01:32.260> so<00:01:32.770> that's<00:01:33.130> or<00:01:33.400> Paris

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
combined together so that's or Paris

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.490 
combined together so that's or Paris
