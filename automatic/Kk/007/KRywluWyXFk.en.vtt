victimization of this individual but the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.600 
victimization of this individual but the
vilification<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.590> what<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.130> United<00:02:58.400> States

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
vilification of what the United States

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.699 
vilification of what the United States
is<00:02:58.790> doing<00:02:58.940> with<00:02:59.209> Guantanamo<00:02:59.810> Bay<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.350> as<00:03:00.560> I

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
is doing with Guantanamo Bay and as I

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.860 
is doing with Guantanamo Bay and as I
said<00:03:00.920> I'm<00:03:01.160> sure<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.180> happening<00:03:02.660> in

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
said I'm sure that it's happening in

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.809 
said I'm sure that it's happening in
some<00:03:03.200> instances<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:04.040> happens<00:03:04.340> in<00:03:04.489> regular

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
some instances it happens in regular

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.610 
some instances it happens in regular
prisons<00:03:05.209> in<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.390> United<00:03:05.420> States<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.410> don't

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
prisons in the United States so I don't

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.990 
prisons in the United States so I don't
see<00:03:06.739> why<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:06.920> wouldn't<00:03:07.100> happen<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.549> a<00:03:07.610> larger

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
see why it wouldn't happen in a larger

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.569 
see why it wouldn't happen in a larger
scale<00:03:08.239> with<00:03:08.690> Guantanamo<00:03:09.350> Bay<00:03:09.500> however<00:03:10.280> I

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
scale with Guantanamo Bay however I

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.220 
scale with Guantanamo Bay however I
think<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.060> majority<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.720> prisoners

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
think the majority of the prisoners

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.310 
think the majority of the prisoners
there<00:03:12.470> are<00:03:12.709> guilty<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.730> are<00:03:13.850> very<00:03:13.970> dangerous

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
there are guilty and are very dangerous

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.750 
there are guilty and are very dangerous
so<00:03:15.320> I<00:03:15.560> think<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.890> film<00:03:16.070> would<00:03:16.280> have<00:03:16.310> been<00:03:16.519> I

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
so I think the film would have been I

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.400 
so I think the film would have been I
would<00:03:17.120> have<00:03:17.150> had<00:03:17.299> much<00:03:17.420> more<00:03:17.570> respect<00:03:18.079> for<00:03:18.290> it

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
would have had much more respect for it

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.349 
would have had much more respect for it
if<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.590> didn't<00:03:18.829> take<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.130> easy<00:03:19.340> path<00:03:19.519> out<00:03:19.970> and

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
if it didn't take the easy path out and

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.120 
if it didn't take the easy path out and
said<00:03:20.690> well<00:03:20.840> we<00:03:20.959> can't<00:03:21.380> really<00:03:21.500> get<00:03:21.650> anybody<00:03:22.040> to

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
said well we can't really get anybody to

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.000 
said well we can't really get anybody to

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
like Daniel Radcliffe and Robert

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.770 
like Daniel Radcliffe and Robert

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.240 
I think horns might be getting a
reckless<00:05:27.840> breakout<00:05:28.230> film<00:05:28.440> and<00:05:28.710> but<00:05:29.130> maybe

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
reckless breakout film and but maybe

their<00:05:44.940> contributions<00:05:45.660> are<00:05:45.780> just<00:05:46.140> as<00:05:46.320> valid

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
their contributions are just as valid

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.830 
their contributions are just as valid
and<00:05:46.710> important<00:05:47.130> as<00:05:47.220> anyone<00:05:47.520> elses<00:05:47.820> so<00:05:48.660> I<00:05:48.690> think

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
and important as anyone elses so I think

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.510 
and important as anyone elses so I think
it's<00:05:49.080> great<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.350> represent<00:05:49.770> that<00:05:49.830> demographic

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
it's great to represent that demographic

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.670 
it's great to represent that demographic
in<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.330> movie<00:05:51.660> like<00:05:51.780> this<00:05:51.990> I<00:05:52.080> hope<00:05:52.260> although<00:05:52.560> I

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
in a movie like this I hope although I

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.900 
in a movie like this I hope although I
don't<00:05:52.860> think<00:05:53.010> it<00:05:53.190> would<00:05:53.280> help<00:05:53.370> women<00:05:53.700> at<00:05:53.820> all

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
don't think it would help women at all

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.640 
don't think it would help women at all
the<00:05:54.150> military<00:05:54.540> if<00:05:54.840> you<00:05:55.200> were<00:05:55.320> like<00:05:55.500> look

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
the military if you were like look

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.690 
the military if you were like look
they're<00:05:55.979> the<00:05:56.100> only<00:05:56.220> ones<00:05:56.490> who<00:05:56.669> are

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
they're the only ones who are

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.040 
they're the only ones who are
sympathizers<00:05:57.479> they<00:05:57.690> don't<00:05:57.840> follow

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
sympathizers they don't follow

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.180 
sympathizers they don't follow
directions<00:05:58.140> when<00:05:58.740> you<00:05:58.800> tell<00:05:58.950> them<00:05:59.040> how<00:05:59.100> to

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
directions when you tell them how to

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.690 
directions when you tell them how to
interact<00:05:59.430> with<00:05:59.820> the<00:06:00.000> with<00:06:00.450> detainees<00:06:01.490> and<00:06:02.490> you

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
interact with the with detainees and you

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.159 
interact with the with detainees and you
know<00:06:02.820> they're<00:06:03.419> they're<00:06:03.690> always<00:06:03.840> difficult

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
know they're they're always difficult

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.600 
know they're they're always difficult
and<00:06:04.590> this<00:06:04.680> is<00:06:04.800> why<00:06:04.890> women<00:06:05.100> shouldn't<00:06:05.370> be<00:06:05.490> in

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
and this is why women shouldn't be in

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.030 
and this is why women shouldn't be in
the<00:06:06.300> military<00:06:06.479> I<00:06:06.870> hope<00:06:07.050> that<00:06:07.229> it's<00:06:07.350> not<00:06:07.530> the

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
the military I hope that it's not the

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.590 
the military I hope that it's not the
way<00:06:08.070> some<00:06:08.460> people<00:06:08.729> will<00:06:08.820> take<00:06:08.970> this<00:06:09.180> movie<00:06:09.479> and

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
way some people will take this movie and

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.909 
way some people will take this movie and
I<00:06:09.630> hope<00:06:09.750> it<00:06:09.840> isn't<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.080> direction<00:06:10.140> it<00:06:10.500> goes<00:06:10.620> I

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
I hope it isn't the direction it goes I

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.710 
I hope it isn't the direction it goes I
hope<00:06:11.040> that<00:06:11.220> it<00:06:11.310> shows<00:06:11.340> that<00:06:11.729> while<00:06:12.210> she<00:06:12.479> you

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
hope that it shows that while she you

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.360 
hope that it shows that while she you
know<00:06:12.750> fights<00:06:13.110> for<00:06:13.320> what<00:06:13.590> she<00:06:13.890> believes<00:06:14.190> is

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
know fights for what she believes is

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.010 
know fights for what she believes is
right<00:06:14.550> that<00:06:15.060> she<00:06:15.210> does<00:06:15.360> it<00:06:15.479> within<00:06:15.600> the<00:06:15.840> system

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
right that she does it within the system

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.840 
right that she does it within the system
and<00:06:16.410> she's<00:06:16.560> a<00:06:16.590> team<00:06:16.860> player<00:06:16.919> which<00:06:17.580> is<00:06:17.610> so

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
and she's a team player which is so

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.060 
and she's a team player which is so
important<00:06:18.330> in<00:06:18.479> the<00:06:18.960> military<00:06:19.560> I<00:06:19.680> mean<00:06:19.830> you<00:06:19.919> saw

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
important in the military I mean you saw

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.920 
important in the military I mean you saw
a<00:06:20.100> similar<00:06:20.340> thing<00:06:20.729> in<00:06:20.880> zero<00:06:21.390> dark<00:06:21.660> thirty

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.400 
where Jessica Chastain's character was
very<00:06:23.550> difficult<00:06:23.880> well<00:06:24.240> brilliant<00:06:24.690> but<00:06:25.140> yet<00:06:25.260> I

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
very difficult well brilliant but yet I
