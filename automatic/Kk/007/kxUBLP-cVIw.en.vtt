00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:03.550
 I think I can take 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.060
 allow me to address you this time 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.760
 to clarify a series of situations rumors that have emerged our sovereign 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.699
 country 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:14.609
 especially in these last days during which your server was 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:15.539
 absent 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.550
 visiting our sister republic of japan 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.710
 first of all 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.710
 I would like to clarify that only 20 people accompanied him on the trip 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.720
 what happens is that as the little gabrielita is newborn 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.649
 there were people who see it indispensable to accompany us 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:32.490
 the nurse the pediatrician the girl 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.350
 the gynecologist in eight days 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.300
 the guy who never from the diaper 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.660
 and the kick that gabriela will sing because he falls asleep 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.890
 we must scream that worse is expensive 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.690
 it's hard for him to fall asleep 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.820
 unfortunately the presidential hairdresser did not fit anymore 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.050
 and the bartender 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.180
 and the first lady of company 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.890
 nor the second 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.750
 and you could not see a couple of guys that I wanted to take that I did not 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.310
 he knew japan 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.440
 I said 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.930
 edgar gutierrez 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.930
 that by the way in my official confidant and fidel Castro also 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.940
 he told me that our vice president and I tell him our vice president paco 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.300
 kings walked shaking Honduran mental mayor 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.180
 that's why it's better to get a quickie 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.180
 It can not be that they took me out of the company and by title 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.940
 messi is fucked environment is going 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.940
 a little window in love with democracy 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.360
 on the other hand 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.990
 I want to recognize that the new one because I took taxes 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.850
 it will only affect the rich to the bourgeois to the wealthy and wealthy 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 who are the ones who have left us in poverty, all of us the poor 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.750
 only to harm those facts 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.580
 who make use of automobiles 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.040
 those who have wanted 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.040
 who are walking with a cell phone believing the closures of the zacapa cartel 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.040
 and those millionaires who open checking or savings accounts in banks 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.390
 national 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.090
 only in the 90s 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.230
 believe me when I got to the guava 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.530
 I had all the desire to make a good government 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.460
 but less endurance like the male that I am 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.570
 on the other hand 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.100
 Rumors are circulating that this Friday, June 1 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.869
 stowe week is going to wear black 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.869
 to protest against taxes and general government 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.819
 but avatar cameron 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.689
 that twenty or fifteen rich people hanen by the ccaa the dress that used piles to 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.049
 I do not care 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.299
 because I know that you just like all my countrymen are very 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.299
 happy and happy with the government that I am doing 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:32.029
 and that every bad voice is going to wear white that day on behalf of the 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.429
 purity and transparency of this government 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.439
 so if you are part of that small minority 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.349
 who does not agree with the government 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.989
 I challenged him myself 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.759
 here is January on Friday, June 1 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:47.259
 no one will be punished for dressing in black 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:50.089
 anyone has the right to say how they want 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:52.089
 ahead 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.779
 of these from January the first of June to see what is going to be done the only 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.889
 ridiculous in the whole city protesting 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.339
 everything else we will be dressed in white supporting this government 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.159
 to see who can more 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.879
 the message of his friend the folk-rock
