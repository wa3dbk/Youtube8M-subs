00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the sides of this bottle stopper will

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.130 
the sides of this bottle stopper will
turn<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.610> what<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.360> an<00:01:09.750> eighteen

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
turn out what we have is an eighteen

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.899 

now<00:01:42.290> all<00:01:42.560> we<00:01:42.680> have<00:01:42.829> to<00:01:42.950> do<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.280> take<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.670> cross

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
now all we have to do is take the cross

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.060 
now all we have to do is take the cross
slide<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.840> move<00:01:45.079> it<00:01:45.229> over<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.530> couple<00:01:45.890> inches

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
slide and move it over a couple inches

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.639 
slide and move it over a couple inches
and<00:01:46.430> down<00:01:46.850> about<00:01:47.149> three<00:01:47.479> inches<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.290> put<00:01:48.560> us

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
and down about three inches and put us

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.609 
and down about three inches and put us
right<00:01:48.770> in<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.250> middle<00:01:49.430> of<00:01:49.820> this<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.619> start

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
right in the middle of this and start

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.219 
right in the middle of this and start
taking<00:01:52.220> on<00:01:52.369> some<00:01:52.640> detail<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:53.420> let's<00:01:53.869> see<00:01:54.049> how

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
taking on some detail and let's see how

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:30.740 
taking on some detail and let's see how
that<00:01:54.259> looks

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.150 

two-thirds<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:31.989> way<00:02:32.230> done<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.769> can<00:02:32.920> see

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
two-thirds of the way done you can see

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.280 
two-thirds of the way done you can see
there's<00:02:33.430> plenty<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.819> detail<00:02:34.330> all<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.170> way

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
there's plenty of detail all the way

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.970 
there's plenty of detail all the way
around

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980
