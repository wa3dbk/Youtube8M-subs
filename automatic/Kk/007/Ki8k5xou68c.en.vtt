00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.610
 mirror that you will have to look at this is 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.039
 a green lake of muscu will help you 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.040

 his manufactures of space no but 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.500
 expect you must put yourself in the lead 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.330
 that your body is more fragile because in 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.050
 20 years so you have to go step by step 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.000
 step 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.550
 first step was going to see a doctor 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.620
 before you throw in lost biceps are 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.110
 the altos 52 kg you must consult 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.110
 your doctor and see if you are fit 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.720
 to become is no and if he tells you that 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.880
 everything is well rotten then triggered the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.880
 beginning of hostilities second and a 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.670
 started slowly after one broke through 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.410
 room doors and 5 testo rebounds 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:03.440
 because small who squatted yoga 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:05.940
 benson yoga yoga yoga you head 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.860
 to the dumbbells next to you see 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.150
 a young man who takes the 40 kg dumbbells 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.800
 and that's the reflex 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.360
 the mistake would be to want to take the 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.970
 same weight as him to show him who 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.290

 muscu but directly on stretchers 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.690
 you must put your ego aside at 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.480
 risk of really hurting you and not 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.250

 road and that it can take a little bit 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.130
 of time and circle several months you 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.780

 first time the room at 40 years old each to 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.190
 his pace it must be done that 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.750
 only if you feel ready after I 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.729
 you do not hide that the first time you 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.600
 have a little pain but it will go 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.930
 better next time 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.000
