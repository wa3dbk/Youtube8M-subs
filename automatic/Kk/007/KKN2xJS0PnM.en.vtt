00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.070
 lots of videos via youtube 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.630
 consult the procedure 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.220
 it stands out that the door procedure is in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.129
 almost every video becomes different 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.900
 carried it out and explained it exactly 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.790
 this lack of clarity that the 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.559
 created a need for a national 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.330
 instruction video about safe inside 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.620
 steps are small building like you yourself 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.269
 knows a lot in a country 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.830

 people and clarity and the lesson 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.690
 a national subject matter 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.850
 take my part from we from south limburg 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.659
 in particular, provide the actors for this 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.489
 movie 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.600
 to ensure that we have a season 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.580
 clear possible image throughout 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.920
 the Netherlands and that is the reason why 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.170
 participate there yes it is fantastic 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.440
 incredibly educational and I really enjoy it 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.440
 to do with it 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.880
 safety region rotterdam-rijnmond 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.110
 north and east gelderland south limburg and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.729
 Midwestern Brabant 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.560
 already had plans for instructional video 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.329
 or even developed in it 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.549
 the fire brigade academy is part of it 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.770
 nifv she had a national interest in one 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.210
 video that the lesson and subject matter about 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.549
 intrusion practice can 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.470
 be transferred to role is up 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.970
 especially the script and the holes too 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.770
 love or any acts you love 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.720
 have previously specified that in the script 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.770
 is actually being implemented 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.770
 is also recorded on it 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.770
 ok keep calm and so lecture 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.970
 not those things 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.930
 we have 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.149
 therefore these organizations decided to 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.740
 join hands and fire the office 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.759
 request protection services and 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.759
 produce such video 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.560
 mourning processing you say to your measurements 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.810
 watched 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.400
 far based on your control 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.380
 of temperature cube between accurate 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.180
 by sola had cancer had come here to 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.870

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.629
 dog out 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.860
 yes but when you have the curriculum over 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.810
 enter safely in the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.430
 instruction video being treated has the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.959
 fire brigade academy together with 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.959
 fire protection service developed 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.799
 You know I'm going to say I have too 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.030
 to deal with special weather conditions 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.769
 the wind that turns 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.959
 rain so you have to break off 2 question 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.879
 and you have to restart to start again 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.819
 Get the right smoking in it again 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.659
 country, which acts for 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.659
 can be made 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.820

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.710
 rachel was good 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.940
 and 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.340
 philosophy and have canceled 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.170
 in the picture 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.489
 most action is very important and with that 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.989
 try on fire in the Netherlands 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.090
 create clarity in a way 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.650
 that it is safe within third approach and 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.690
 what with adding but many existing 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.400
 videos I think we are about after the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.530
 place on the why do something here in how 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.970

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.310
 but why do you get dirty at what time 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.829
 some public good fcv analysis of the 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.820
 brand and the new google 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.440
 you see a lot of different ones 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.000
 variants of the procedure and he 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.000
 says clarity in application
