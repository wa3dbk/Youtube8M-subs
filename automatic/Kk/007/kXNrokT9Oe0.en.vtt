a color corrector I didn't have any so I

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.960 
a color corrector I didn't have any so I

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
still haven't fixed it yet so I've been

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.960 
still haven't fixed it yet so I've been
using<00:03:15.150> foundation<00:03:15.989> on<00:03:16.200> my<00:03:16.410> part<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:17.730> when<00:03:17.940> I

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
using foundation on my part so when I

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.820 
using foundation on my part so when I
take<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.270> off<00:03:18.480> I'll<00:03:18.690> probably<00:03:18.720> go<00:03:19.170> find<00:03:19.410> some

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
take this off I'll probably go find some
