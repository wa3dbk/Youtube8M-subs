00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello my name is other fans i am 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.230
 holistic horses therapin and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.880
 trainer of horses inside.com and me 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.019
 I would like to take a quick look at the topic today 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.820
 deal with how important it is 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.520
 always equestrian, too 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.619
 The problem is, that is 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.420
 just what I'm currently in 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.699
 have also noticed again 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.039
 if you are simply a horse in the long term 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.180
 works and you have the most now 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.580
 people have under quotes 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 only one horse then the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.260
 problematic that your own natural 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.989
 In the long term, that's really what it's like 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.520
 Horse, as it were, goes awry when I am 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.100
 as a rider now for example also a 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.290
 Blockade have emilio in the basin area 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.160
 sacral joint yes then it is 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.230
 usually leaving just a hip 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.879
 agility is better so 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.610
 for example right hip is more flexible 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.340
 as the left hip joint and thereby 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.350
 it just happens that the horse is up 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.649
 the right hand then again and again 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.449
 a resistance, so to speak 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.390
 in the long run, that means for the horse that 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.549
 he resisted by the rider 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.369
 so to speak in the horseback and in his 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.280
 whole on movement in the back so to speak 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.770
 He also feels that we are leading that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.720
 the horse on this hand 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.880
 more limited and not so 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.030
 hardworking or not 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.770
 can run loose 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.990
 therefore it is very important as a rider 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.640
 to work regularly at his seat 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.310
 maybe every now and then 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.710
 from the good, for example, craniosacral 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.850
 therapists from the godfather or 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.180
 to have physiotherapists treated 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.420
 and that you really keep coming back 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.280
 can be corrected or again and again 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.630
 also gymnastics like yoga or pilates 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.340
 doing ball exercises and so on 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.909
 to really be with him 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.740
 agility at his asymmetry and 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.280
 in a positive sense at his 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.640
 even from direction works up 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.030
