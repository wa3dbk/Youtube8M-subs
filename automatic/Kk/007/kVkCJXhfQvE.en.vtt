00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
gas cap gets on there

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.109 
gas cap gets on there
you<00:01:06.060> got<00:01:06.240> an<00:01:06.390> area<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:07.439> more<00:01:07.830> likely<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you got an area that's more likely to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.840 
you got an area that's more likely to
rip<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.720> stretch<00:01:10.020> out<00:01:10.340> for<00:01:11.340> instance<00:01:11.520> right

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
rip and stretch out for instance right

rip and stretch out for instance right
here<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.479> see<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.380> pull<00:01:13.710> on

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
here you can see that if I just pull on

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.780 
here you can see that if I just pull on
it<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.580> little<00:01:14.909> bit<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.610> look

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
it just a little bit and if we look

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.340 
it just a little bit and if we look
really<00:01:18.060> closely<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.020> where

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
really closely you can see that where

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.789 
really closely you can see that where
that<00:01:19.560> cut<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:21.080> it's<00:01:22.080> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> pulling<00:01:22.590> apart

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that cut is it's kind of pulling apart

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.170 
that cut is it's kind of pulling apart
and<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.310> distorting<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.180> little<00:01:24.450> bit<00:01:26.180> so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and it's distorting a little bit so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.520 
and it's distorting a little bit so
that's<00:01:27.360> why<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.600> don't<00:01:27.780> want<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.380> in

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.899 
it gets to the point I'm going to curve
it<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:56.070> come<00:01:56.490> back<00:01:56.520> out<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.729> that

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
it and come back out so you can see that

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.630 
it and come back out so you can see that
I<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> curve<00:02:00.450> cut<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.930> there<00:02:01.310> this<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.460> one

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
I have a curve cut in there this is one

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.709 
I have a curve cut in there this is one
of<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> concepts<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.299> we're<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.570> use

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
of the concepts that we're going to use

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.709 
of the concepts that we're going to use
for<00:02:03.899> cutting<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> gas<00:02:04.409> tank<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.310> you

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
for cutting the gas tank because if you

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.160 
for cutting the gas tank because if you
cut<00:02:06.719> into<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:09.090> know<00:02:09.209> place<00:02:09.629> where<00:02:09.929> there's

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
cut into you know place where there's

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.839 
cut into you know place where there's
going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.590> hole<00:02:10.860> basically<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.819> you

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
going to be a hole basically and you

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.699 
going to be a hole basically and you
don't

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
don't

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.559 
don't
cut<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.220> with<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> curve<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.299> cut<00:02:15.510> it

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
cut it with a curve like that you cut it

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.929 
cut it with a curve like that you cut it
as<00:02:15.689> a<00:02:15.720> sharp<00:02:16.049> angle<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.939> more

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
as a sharp angle it's going to more

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.600 
as a sharp angle it's going to more
easily<00:02:18.090> care<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:19.099> know<00:02:20.099> I'm<00:02:20.159> repeating<00:02:20.310> myself

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
easily care I know I'm repeating myself

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.339 
easily care I know I'm repeating myself
but<00:02:21.060> I'm<00:02:21.120> just<00:02:21.209> giving<00:02:21.480> myself<00:02:21.569> time<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.110> peel

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
but I'm just giving myself time to peel

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.929 
but I'm just giving myself time to peel
this<00:02:22.470> backing<00:02:22.799> off<00:02:23.159> let's<00:02:23.430> take<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.610> look<00:02:23.819> at

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
this backing off let's take a look at

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.119 
this backing off let's take a look at
this<00:02:24.090> now<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.959> have<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.200> backing<00:02:25.439> peeled<00:02:25.950> off

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
this now I have the backing peeled off

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.690 
this now I have the backing peeled off
of<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.989> there's<00:02:27.989> my<00:02:28.170> piece<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.769> now<00:02:28.890> if

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
of this and there's my piece and now if

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.160 
of this and there's my piece and now if
you<00:02:29.849> pull<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.900> see<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.500> doesn't<00:02:33.170> have

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
you pull it you see that it doesn't have

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.679 
you pull it you see that it doesn't have
a<00:02:34.200> tendency<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.650> rip<00:02:35.299> that's<00:02:36.299> just<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.569> way

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
a tendency to rip that's just the way

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.490 
a tendency to rip that's just the way
vinyls<00:02:37.170> made<00:02:38.599> so<00:02:39.599> let<00:02:39.989> me<00:02:40.049> go<00:02:40.170> ahead<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.409> get

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
vinyls made so let me go ahead and get

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.580 
vinyls made so let me go ahead and get
this<00:02:40.590> out<00:02:40.799> of<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.950> way<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:42.540> scissor<00:02:42.840> now

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
this out of the way and the scissor now

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.530 
this out of the way and the scissor now
we're<00:02:43.739> going<00:02:43.859> to<00:02:43.920> use<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.640> exacto<00:02:45.150> knife<00:02:45.359> to

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
we're going to use the exacto knife to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960 
we're going to use the exacto knife to
cut<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.989> let<00:02:46.980> me<00:02:47.040> see<00:02:47.190> if<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.489> lean<00:02:47.730> this

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
cut this let me see if I can lean this

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.569 
cut this let me see if I can lean this
toward<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.379> little<00:02:49.590> bit<00:02:49.709> more<00:02:49.829> there

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
toward you just a little bit more there

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.699 
toward you just a little bit more there
we<00:02:50.700> go<00:02:50.849> now<00:02:51.569> what<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.109> do<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.379> like<00:02:52.530> to

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
we go now what I like to do is like to

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.580 
we go now what I like to do is like to
come<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.280> now<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:53.909> gas<00:02:54.420> cap<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:55.049> going<00:02:55.349> to<00:02:55.440> be

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
come in now the gas cap is going to be

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.589 
come in now the gas cap is going to be
or<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.069> whole<00:02:56.250> gas<00:02:56.489> cap<00:02:56.909> housing<00:02:57.450> and

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
or the whole gas cap housing and

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.449 
or the whole gas cap housing and
everything<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.409> going<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.829> flush<00:02:59.129> with<00:02:59.159> the

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
everything is going to be flush with the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.490 
everything is going to be flush with the
motorcycle<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.359> you<00:03:00.959> don't<00:03:01.139> want<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.319> come

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
motorcycle so you don't want to come

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.170 
motorcycle so you don't want to come
right<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:01.980> edge<00:03:02.189> because<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.879> will<00:03:03.000> pull

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
right to the edge because that will pull

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.729 
right to the edge because that will pull
away<00:03:03.269> we're<00:03:03.659> actually<00:03:03.750> going<00:03:04.079> to<00:03:04.170> wrap<00:03:04.409> down

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
away we're actually going to wrap down

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.569 
away we're actually going to wrap down
inside<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:07.170> recess<00:03:07.650> area<00:03:08.069> where<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.340> cat

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
inside the recess area where the cat

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.270 
inside the recess area where the cat
goes<00:03:08.879> so<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:10.109> order<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.470> give<00:03:10.650> us<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.889> little<00:03:11.069> bit

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
goes so in order to give us a little bit

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.059 
goes so in order to give us a little bit
of<00:03:11.430> room<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:12.840> wrap<00:03:13.049> on<00:03:13.260> down<00:03:13.470> in<00:03:13.650> I'm<00:03:13.799> going<00:03:13.980> to

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
of room to wrap on down in I'm going to

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.369 
of room to wrap on down in I'm going to
cut<00:03:14.310> away<00:03:14.670> from<00:03:14.939> the<00:03:15.060> edge<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:16.260> can

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
cut away from the edge and you can

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.229 
cut away from the edge and you can
visually<00:03:16.769> just<00:03:16.980> look<00:03:17.129> at<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.340> edge<00:03:17.459> here<00:03:17.489> I'm

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
visually just look at the edge here I'm

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.360 
visually just look at the edge here I'm
going<00:03:18.419> to<00:03:18.480> cut<00:03:18.660> away<00:03:18.780> from<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.260> edge<00:03:19.410> around

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
going to cut away from the edge around

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.369 
going to cut away from the edge around
half<00:03:20.940> an<00:03:21.120> inch<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.840> I'm<00:03:24.959> just<00:03:25.109> going<00:03:25.290> to

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
half an inch and I'm just going to

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.400 
half an inch and I'm just going to
continue<00:03:25.620> around<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.639> a<00:03:26.730> circle<00:03:27.030> pattern<00:03:27.629> this

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
continue around in a circle pattern this

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.159 
continue around in a circle pattern this
doesn't<00:03:28.889> have<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.129> be<00:03:29.250> exact

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
doesn't have to be exact

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.629 
doesn't have to be exact
you<00:03:31.169> know<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.349> do<00:03:31.620> kind<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.370> want<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.549> be

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
you know you do kind of want to be

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:33.949 
you know you do kind of want to be
careful<00:03:32.879> how<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.209> do<00:03:33.449> it<00:03:33.599> but<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.810> doesn't

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
careful how you do it but it doesn't

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.300 
careful how you do it but it doesn't
have<00:03:34.169> to<00:03:34.230> be<00:03:34.440> exact

don't<00:03:38.310> really<00:03:38.549> force<00:03:38.909> it<00:03:39.150> if<00:03:39.389> your<00:03:39.799> knife<00:03:40.799> is

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
don't really force it if your knife is

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.809 
don't really force it if your knife is
kind<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:42.560> jagged<00:03:43.560> around<00:03:44.129> or<00:03:44.639> if<00:03:44.699> it's

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
kind of jagged around or if it's

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.580 
kind of jagged around or if it's
slightly<00:03:45.209> dull<00:03:45.629> you<00:03:45.989> know<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.199> might<00:03:46.379> want<00:03:46.560> to

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
slightly dull you know you might want to

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.020 
slightly dull you know you might want to
put<00:03:46.739> another<00:03:46.889> blade<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.400> or<00:03:47.639> something<00:03:47.940> like

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
put another blade on or something like

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.240 
put another blade on or something like
that<00:03:48.209> but<00:03:48.389> don't<00:03:48.540> force<00:03:48.900> it

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:12.670 

and<00:03:57.769> almost<00:03:58.769> done<00:03:59.159> now

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.610 

there<00:04:13.280> we<00:04:13.579> go<00:04:13.790> that's<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.150> nice<00:04:14.450> clean<00:04:14.810> cut<00:04:15.290> and

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
there we go that's a nice clean cut and

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.129 
there we go that's a nice clean cut and
so<00:04:16.609> we<00:04:16.699> have<00:04:16.850> this<00:04:17.000> piece<00:04:17.329> cut<00:04:17.630> out<00:04:17.780> it's<00:04:18.019> a

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
so we have this piece cut out it's a

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.199 
so we have this piece cut out it's a
little<00:04:18.380> bit<00:04:18.530> jagged<00:04:18.829> II<00:04:19.070> there<00:04:19.880> in<00:04:20.000> some

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
little bit jagged II there in some

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.140 
little bit jagged II there in some
places<00:04:20.479> but<00:04:20.989> we'll<00:04:21.229> try<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.560> cut<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:21.979> out<00:04:22.789> as

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
places but we'll try to cut it out as

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.010 
places but we'll try to cut it out as
best<00:04:23.389> as<00:04:23.630> possible<00:04:23.800> now<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:25.039> is<00:04:25.250> an<00:04:25.400> area

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
best as possible now this is an area

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.180 
best as possible now this is an area
where<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.289> know<00:04:27.380> if<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.530> just<00:04:27.650> try<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:27.860> press

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
where you know if you just try to press

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.529 
where you know if you just try to press
it<00:04:28.370> in<00:04:28.460> when<00:04:28.610> your<00:04:28.729> thumbs<00:04:28.970> or<00:04:29.180> something<00:04:29.449> like

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
it in when your thumbs or something like

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.120 
it in when your thumbs or something like
that<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.870> wouldn't<00:04:30.020> be<00:04:30.139> as<00:04:30.320> workable<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.070> you

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
that it wouldn't be as workable so you

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.670 
that it wouldn't be as workable so you
definitely<00:04:31.789> want<00:04:32.539> to<00:04:32.690> use<00:04:33.320> torch<00:04:35.229> to<00:04:36.229> press<00:04:36.470> it

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
definitely want to use torch to press it

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.290 
definitely want to use torch to press it
in<00:04:36.770> there<00:04:36.949> and<00:04:37.070> I'm<00:04:37.160> going<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.430> use<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.940> felt

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
in there and I'm going to use the felt

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.270 
in there and I'm going to use the felt
from<00:04:38.539> the<00:04:38.660> ski<00:04:38.900> squeegee<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.740> press<00:04:39.949> it<00:04:40.130> in

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
from the ski squeegee to press it in

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.670 
from the ski squeegee to press it in
because<00:04:40.610> of<00:04:40.789> course<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.810> squeegees<00:04:42.410> not

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
because of course the squeegees not

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.820 
because of course the squeegees not
conformed<00:04:43.310> to<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.990> rounded<00:04:44.990> shape<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.710> I'm

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
conformed to the rounded shape that I'm

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.730 
conformed to the rounded shape that I'm
pressing<00:04:46.039> it<00:04:46.370> into<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:50.960> start<00:04:51.320> off<00:04:51.500> cutting

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
pressing it into so to start off cutting

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.350 
pressing it into so to start off cutting
on<00:04:51.979> one<00:04:52.190> side<00:04:57.520> you<00:04:58.520> don't<00:04:58.669> really<00:04:58.940> have<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.150> try

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
on one side you don't really have to try

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:33.060 
on one side you don't really have to try
to<00:04:59.419> heat<00:04:59.660> up<00:04:59.690> all<00:05:00.020> of<00:05:00.199> it<00:05:00.289> at<00:05:00.380> once

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.820 

there<00:05:33.670> we<00:05:33.790> go<00:05:33.970> let's<00:05:34.240> take<00:05:34.420> a<00:05:34.450> look<00:05:34.720> at<00:05:34.930> it<00:05:35.170> nice

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
there we go let's take a look at it nice

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.220 
there we go let's take a look at it nice
and<00:05:36.190> neat<00:05:36.220> tucked<00:05:36.850> in<00:05:37.090> clean<00:05:37.780> all<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.110> way

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
and neat tucked in clean all the way

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.200 
and neat tucked in clean all the way
around<00:05:38.500> all<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:39.070> way<00:05:39.250> around<00:05:39.670> and<00:05:39.910> it<00:05:40.030> has<00:05:40.060> a

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
around all the way around and it has a

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.050 
around all the way around and it has a
really<00:05:40.750> high<00:05:40.870> resistance<00:05:41.710> from<00:05:42.550> pulling<00:05:42.970> away

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
really high resistance from pulling away

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.280 
really high resistance from pulling away
from<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.360> edge<00:05:43.510> we're<00:05:43.720> also<00:05:43.810> going<00:05:44.140> to<00:05:44.200> put

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
from the edge we're also going to put

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.830 
from the edge we're also going to put
some<00:05:44.440> edge<00:05:44.740> sealer<00:05:45.190> on<00:05:45.220> this<00:05:45.610> in<00:05:45.910> just<00:05:46.720> a

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
some edge sealer on this in just a

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.290 
some edge sealer on this in just a
second
