move<00:02:01.079> around<00:02:01.340> because<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.490> incision<00:02:03.060> is

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
move around because the incision is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
it's probably about looks like about one

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.890 
it's probably about looks like about one
inch<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.709> two<00:02:10.920> inch

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.479 
it's pretty big under his tummy so
obviously<00:02:16.549> that<00:02:16.909> restricts<00:02:17.540> movement<00:02:17.720> major

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
obviously that restricts movement major

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.039 
obviously that restricts movement major
so<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.670> first<00:02:19.909> night<00:02:20.150> he<00:02:20.209> just<00:02:20.540> stayed<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:20.930> a

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
so the first night he just stayed in a

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.339 
so the first night he just stayed in a
cuddle<00:02:21.319> cup<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.739> I<00:02:21.799> put<00:02:22.720> fleece<00:02:23.720> blanket<00:02:24.230> on

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
him to keep him warm because that would

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.880 
him to keep him warm because that would
be<00:02:25.909> very<00:02:26.090> important<00:02:26.720> especially<00:02:26.959> for<00:02:27.709> a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
be very important especially for a

be very important especially for a
skinny<00:02:28.190> pig<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:30.500> then<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.680> had<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.980> hand<00:02:31.159> feed

got critical care which is something you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.690 
got critical care which is something you
can<00:02:35.989> get<00:02:36.110> at<00:02:36.170> your<00:02:36.409> vets<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:37.250> mix<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.670> with

his<00:04:09.799> cuddle<00:04:10.129> cup<00:04:10.310> every<00:04:10.609> couple<00:04:10.910> hours

his cuddle cup every couple hours

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.289 
his cuddle cup every couple hours
because<00:04:11.389> I'd<00:04:11.569> be<00:04:11.750> wet<00:04:11.930> with<00:04:12.079> pee<00:04:12.639> so<00:04:13.639> suddenly

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
because I'd be wet with pee so suddenly

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.900 
because I'd be wet with pee so suddenly
evening<00:04:14.750> he<00:04:15.079> was<00:04:15.169> actually<00:04:15.379> out<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:16.250> he<00:04:16.699> came

hope they totally get along and missed

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.980 
hope they totally get along and missed
each<00:04:57.950> other<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.860> that<00:05:01.160> is<00:05:01.790> that<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.450> I'm<00:05:02.750> sure

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
each other so that is that and I'm sure

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.750 
each other so that is that and I'm sure
when<00:05:03.200> he<00:05:03.230> goes<00:05:03.470> back<00:05:03.650> for<00:05:03.710> his<00:05:03.950> recheck<00:05:04.370> or<00:05:04.610> not

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
when he goes back for his recheck or not

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.250 
when he goes back for his recheck or not
long<00:05:04.970> after<00:05:05.390> he'll<00:05:05.600> have<00:05:05.750> to<00:05:05.870> have<00:05:05.990> another

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
long after he'll have to have another

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.650 
long after he'll have to have another
x-ray<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:06.860> make<00:05:07.100> sure<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:07.850> he<00:05:08.180> doesn't<00:05:08.510> have

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
x-ray to make sure that he doesn't have

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.040 
x-ray to make sure that he doesn't have
any<00:05:08.870> stones<00:05:09.310> because<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.610> is<00:05:10.730> possible<00:05:11.450> for

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
any stones because it is possible for

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.380 
any stones because it is possible for
them<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:12.800> get<00:05:13.130> another<00:05:13.490> stone<00:05:13.910> right<00:05:14.180> away

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
them to get another stone right away

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.710 
them to get another stone right away
which<00:05:14.630> would<00:05:14.810> be<00:05:14.990> awful<00:05:16.270> so<00:05:17.270> I'm<00:05:17.390> really

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
which would be awful so I'm really

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.140 
which would be awful so I'm really
hoping<00:05:18.110> that<00:05:18.440> that<00:05:19.040> does<00:05:19.250> not<00:05:19.280> happen<00:05:19.670> and

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
hoping that that does not happen and

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.750 
hoping that that does not happen and
that<00:05:20.330> when<00:05:20.930> it<00:05:21.080> gets<00:05:21.440> another<00:05:21.740> x-ray<00:05:22.310> that<00:05:22.580> he

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
that when it gets another x-ray that he

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.570 
that when it gets another x-ray that he
is<00:05:22.880> totally<00:05:23.120> clear<00:05:23.750> again<00:05:23.990> and<00:05:24.290> I<00:05:25.280> want<00:05:25.490> to

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
is totally clear again and I want to

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.640 
is totally clear again and I want to
keep<00:05:25.700> them<00:05:25.850> that<00:05:26.060> way<00:05:26.210> forever<00:05:26.540> if<00:05:27.080> possible

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
keep them that way forever if possible

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.870 
keep them that way forever if possible
stones<00:05:30.650> are<00:05:30.950> just<00:05:31.130> one<00:05:31.280> of<00:05:31.370> those<00:05:31.490> things<00:05:31.760> that

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
stones are just one of those things that

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.310 
stones are just one of those things that
you<00:05:32.060> never<00:05:32.180> know<00:05:32.450> whether<00:05:32.660> if<00:05:32.840> you<00:05:32.960> take<00:05:33.169> it

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
you never know whether if you take it

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.990 
you never know whether if you take it
away<00:05:33.560> it<00:05:33.919> won't<00:05:34.100> come<00:05:34.370> back<00:05:34.550> or<00:05:34.820> whether

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
away it won't come back or whether

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.880 
away it won't come back or whether
they're<00:05:35.300> gonna<00:05:35.419> be<00:05:35.660> a<00:05:35.690> piggy<00:05:35.990> that's<00:05:36.230> prone<00:05:36.620> to

they're gonna be a piggy that's prone to

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.340 
they're gonna be a piggy that's prone to
just<00:05:37.130> getting<00:05:37.340> them<00:05:37.580> over<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.030> over<00:05:38.350> the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
just getting them over and over the

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.730 
just getting them over and over the
surgery<00:05:39.860> was<00:05:40.220> really<00:05:40.640> invasive<00:05:41.140> very<00:05:42.140> serious

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
surgery was really invasive very serious

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.190 
surgery was really invasive very serious
and<00:05:43.190> his<00:05:43.460> recovery<00:05:44.000> like<00:05:44.690> he<00:05:44.900> wouldn't<00:05:45.110> have

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
and his recovery like he wouldn't have

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.540 
and his recovery like he wouldn't have
made<00:05:45.380> it<00:05:45.410> without<00:05:45.669> 24-hour<00:05:46.669> care<00:05:47.980> so<00:05:48.980> it<00:05:49.400> was

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
made it without 24-hour care so it was

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.040 
made it without 24-hour care so it was
very<00:05:49.820> hard<00:05:50.090> work<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.720> I<00:05:50.810> know<00:05:50.870> very
