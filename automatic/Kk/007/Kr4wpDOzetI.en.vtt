it's<00:06:26.000> own<00:06:26.210> thing<00:06:26.240> I<00:06:26.750> guess<00:06:26.960> I've<00:06:27.770> got<00:06:27.800> the

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009 
it's own thing I guess I've got the

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.180 
it's own thing I guess I've got the
little<00:06:29.020> why<00:06:30.020> why<00:06:30.319> I<00:06:30.349> guess<00:06:30.680> you<00:06:30.830> could<00:06:30.949> say

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
little why why I guess you could say

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.740 
little why why I guess you could say
hyper<00:06:31.669> fuse<00:06:32.000> goes<00:06:32.210> through<00:06:32.680> through<00:06:33.680> it<00:06:34.750> and

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
hyper fuse goes through through it and

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.850 
hyper fuse goes through through it and
if<00:06:36.110> you<00:06:36.259> tighten<00:06:36.500> these<00:06:36.919> laces<00:06:37.280> right<00:06:37.729> here<00:06:38.860> it

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
if you tighten these laces right here it

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.430 
if you tighten these laces right here it
all<00:06:40.219> pulls<00:06:40.550> through<00:06:40.759> so<00:06:41.419> it's<00:06:41.569> really<00:06:41.810> nice<00:06:42.110> I

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
all pulls through so it's really nice I

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.540 
all pulls through so it's really nice I
probably<00:06:43.400> should<00:06:43.669> tighten<00:06:44.060> it<00:06:44.120> again<00:06:44.449> but

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550
