00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.230
 so it's saturday again and that's why 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.740
 is it again a new episode top 5 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.180
 today with our top 5 text apex the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.250
 I've searched together and you guys 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.600
 I would like to present here for 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.560
 such a small world I downloaded 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.350
 you probably a description 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.849
 I've linked and I think so 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.410
 I did it all with shader 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.699
 so that looks a bit nicer than 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.920
 Finally there's the not make much of 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.000
 appearance 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.219
 the shots are all the same 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.180
 so that it is better comparable and me 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.360
 I'll make you a perfect match 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.890
 respective texmex tell very happy 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.960
 if you accept my opinion and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.430
 your opinion which texmex you see 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.260
 want thursday following in the comments 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.309
 writes and then I would have said 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.350
 I start directly with fifth place 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.350
 Have fun and let's go 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.650
 the fifth place proves that many 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.119
 many enchanted pack god is one 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.009
 difficult name but does not matter 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.900
 this texture pack already exists a lot 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.030
 long the test object gives the game 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.440
 a Victorian mystical style 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.300
 more precisely, it acts like one 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.950
 already looks pretty gloomy though 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.509
 yet very nice texture pack everything 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.190
 does not work medieval as well 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.780
 In the Middle Ages, the right to market is 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.100
 Of course it's logical for sap to do that too 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.390
 must be and not just something modern 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.860
 So you want something bright and 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.810
 Comic classic is then this pack 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.100
 absolutely not suitable for you if 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.690
 me also almost rustic goes with 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.140
 dark textures and of course 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.390
 middle age 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.700
 which I can recommend the absolute and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.080
 of course, do not think is like everyone else 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.700
 other text grows in the description 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.770
 linked there can definitely be over 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.970
 look and download through the times 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.869
 rather, there is style for that too 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.759
 Not to say at all because it really 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.360
 there are few facts to go further 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.360
 to place four 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.370
 platz in europa proves that way 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.840
 texture pack that creates texture pack 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.820
 is a simple but in my opinion 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.500
 after pretty good six pack and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.180
 brings a realistic rustic 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.350
 feeling in minecraft due to his 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.000
 Good quality is one of them 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.710
 most popular available tex mex 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.120
 one looks at the pack more accurately 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.920
 a mix of realistic and 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.060
 rustic textures just a 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.860
 perfect mixture 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.600
 this is how the textures of the whole gap look 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.220
 Although very realistic but are of 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.530
 the details are limited to the bare minimum 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.450
 The resolution of the pack is 32 32 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.100
 not the highest but nevertheless they are 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.290
 textures of the name and donna werner 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.250
 pretty good from the developers themselves 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.630
 say that her goal was one 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.370
 create realistic texture pack 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.050
 where all textures are clear and simple 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.220
 certainly should be kept 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.330
 There's a lot more to say about that 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.770
 big power texture pack 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.150
 but I leave now the pictures 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.620
 speak and you can of course 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.270
 convince yourself by just doing it 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.590
 self- downloaded we go directly 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.590
 continue to place three 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.459
 number three occupies the modern hd 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.190
 texture pack this texture pack 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.840
 impresses with an extremely realistic 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.040
 sharp and modern look 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.420
 this too is one of the 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.400
 most popular available texture pack 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.989
 When looking closely at respects falls 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.150
 on that as dynamic announces 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.280
 modern textures are inserted 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.989
 designer member or wrong wrong 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.430
 from which has more tools at the same time 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.540
 everything was very important 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.370
 extremely modern design 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.959
 For example, it is open again 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.400
 a have become herdplatte located 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.230
 also many textures directly at the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.150
 reality oriented so who a big 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.709
 City with many skyscrapers builds for 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.840
 this pack is just right 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.519
 in addition to the normal textures brings the 6 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.750
 effect many more improvements 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.000
 so will be one among others 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.140
 high-resolution font a new one 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.360
 texture for the sky 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.400
 so that the water and much more 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.260
 The texture pack is in many 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.599
 different versions available so 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.730
 is the span of 16 16 to 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.549
 maybe even 256 at some point 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.840
 256 available that was number three 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.840
 and welcome to the square number two 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.220
 Maybe I want square number two 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.079
 most famous most beautiful and modern 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.780
 Realistic textraw ex of all times 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.150
 the lg photorealists in my opinion 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.530
 it comes from all the text fixies out there 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.480
 next reality 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.120
 so there are realistic water textures 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.609
 perfectly designed plants nice and 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.539
 cute animals and also wood like that 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.130
 real like never before 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.139
 in my opinion that's almost it 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.060
 perfect texture pack there is only one 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.770
 small hook of no high end computer 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.460
 owns with a powerful graphics card 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.289
 and a lot of ram 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.910
 He will have many problems in this 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.800
 text apec who has leant the 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.720
 Designer originally packs isas 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.580
 hd text hofbeck meanwhile it is like 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.539
 photo lissy but a fixed size in the 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.710
 ascended area 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.020
 This work is also a big one 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.229
 Span of resolution available 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.870
 so there are again 16 pixels visited 256 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.160
 and I think so even 512 can 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.720
 really every user individual 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.160
 write what he likes and what one 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.180
 computer manages that together 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.410
 Schiller sees this texture pack 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.880
 in my opinion simply wonderful 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.880
 and we come to place one 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.350
 place one occupies with me that janina 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.790
 Create texture pack I really liked it 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.169
 difficult to decide what now 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.790
 bursting deposit because I think 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.320
 that lp foto listen just as horny as 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.880
 joana force that's why you can actually 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.750
 speak of that at the first 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.190
 share space 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.870
 nevertheless, already her power here 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.340
 set to one because it's just that 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.810
 pack is what I used the longest 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.240
 I have many and many 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.410
 do not share our own in it 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.389
 just convince this pack 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.830
 its simple, clear and detailed 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.150
 textures at first glance 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.040
 Of course, immediately the similarity to 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.450
 a text on this similarity and 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.040
 Of course not without reason 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.500
 you read in the forum post by gianina 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.850
 can get the texture pack textures 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.590
 from my power of hannibal and 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.120
 Of course, also from Mises Realistik 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.740
 texture pack nevertheless were by gianina 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.540
 also many new and own texts in 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.860
 aspect incorporated into none 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.910
 case of a simple clown talking 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.500
 but also from 9 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.640
 I would call it a balanced and 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.710
 good mix between really 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.910
 By the way, fantastic texmex denotes 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.320
 the textures have a resolution of 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.300
 64 64 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.620
 Of course this ensures sufficient 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.360
 details many players are enthusiastic 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.950
 from this pack and now Daum also 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.900
 one of the best known there is so if 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.400
 he is looking for a good 64 64 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.590
 then I recommend you 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.030
 definitely this pack i have a long time 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.380
 time just played with this until we 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.780
 then you started mixing yourself 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.430
 and also mixed in our own 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.410
 texture pack are really many things 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.270
 from gianina force so i can only do it 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.560
 I recommend his description on the left 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.720
 I hope you enjoyed writing me 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.430
 your personal top 5 6 opex in the 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.190
 comments or just a text 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.660
 something comes to mind I think I know 1 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.350
 is wanted in any case very often 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.760
 and some would be likely 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.979
 ask why I did not bring it 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.640
 has very famous bacon so pretty 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.520
 not in any case 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.479
 See you next Thursday at the 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.250
 user follow again or at one 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.840
 provider in the week until then skin 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.840
 pure people have a good day
