00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello to all these gentlemen 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.970
 art is today a video 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.429
 but very very easy art so for them 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.170
 small long because we all have a small 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.680
 sister or niece who would like to do 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.869
 like us but they have nails 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.550
 very very small and it's impossible to 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.460
 do everything we can do on 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.849
 our waves so to sow the bow you 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:40.500
 would you then need two 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:42.660
 two polish varnish 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.969
 - I took what I was going to show in 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.129
 the video here with my purchases and 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.870
 the Indochine tools so mine and the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.680
 sense but it works anyway they 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.489
 were not there so you have you 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.450
 spent a layer 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.520
 here we are 2 2 of the first look here we are 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.810
 and surprise we can be really 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.810
 carefully I do it horizontally 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:31.000
 if it really goes a little bit further 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:32.320
 finish sister dissolving that's next 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.939
 what reasons are really too 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.780
 big in addition to me my little one it is 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:40.200
 contrast angles so that does not help 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.200
 nothing 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.869
 see his lack is the size of the 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:59.369
 brush so to the tests of khalis to your 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.369
 trying to make a nice effect here 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.660
 even your little more 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.680
 so the thumb I love because it's the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.470
 easier in these shadows you 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:36.440
 do not worry it's a little bit out of place but 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:39.290
 good I cut the video a few seconds 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.480
 to let dry between so that's it 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.750
 season 1 have dried up and now you 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.750
 take your back tinto there you go 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.500
 we follow paris st dupont down I have not 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:03:02.980
 planned support for this video and 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.980
 we take a small step 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.210
 since it's the little ones so I wanted 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.910
 to do something funny enough I 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.910
 wanted to do like the nets of the voices 2 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.760
 3 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.690
 are worse I had poorly dosed 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:43.450
 that's what's beyond it's pretty dirty 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.450
 I propose and kate 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.280
 tested on a fault next I did not 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.280
 really not thought tested to your points 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.730
 here and then 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.730
 5 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.389
 so here we bless the lands as 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.969
 that to show so that's normally 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.949
 it gives that little long but there is 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:32.560
 longer there it's really mini 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.120
 mini so here I have already done the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.409
 work is really cleaner but there 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.659
 it was really about being small 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.900
 I was bad I reuse was a little 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:42.129
 bigger but it's okay we did it 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.569
 managed to do something 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:45.430
 thanks a nice hymn for lending me 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.930
 hands and we soon find ourselves for a 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.469
 new video is not what the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.469
 slate
