00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:08.340
 This is a Kegel home trainer, can be used in medical institutions too 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.420
 Why is it needed in principle? 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.260
 There may be a reasonable question that for the treatment of diseases 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.260
 Male and female genital organs or diseases of the genitourinary system 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.820
 Kegel exercises can be used. 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:39.000
 So the question arises, why do we need the apparatus, if the exercises can be done independently? 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.640
 The answer is such, firstly, the apparatus shows the correctness of the exercises 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.020
 He controls you as opposed to doing the exercises yourself. 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.400
 Secondly, he gives you a training program. 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:04.360
 I'll show you now! You turn it on 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:14.880
 Register as a new user, choose your weight, your height 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.600
 choose the level at which you will work 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:27.780
 And it adapts to you, that is, it determines the characteristics of your body. 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:40.860
 Next, the device sets the program for you and in accordance with the green graph 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 you must perform squeezing the muscles, and thus train them 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.560
 If you fall into the schedule, the device gives you a good rating, if not, then a bad one 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.400
 Accordingly, here you can determine your level. 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.940
 Here out of 100, I now got 7 points 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:13.160
 Thus, you can train every day and improve the condition of your body.
