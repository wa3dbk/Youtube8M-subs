it's<00:00:50.280> probably<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> reviews<00:00:51.120> say<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.840> can

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
it's probably the reviews say so you can

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.490 
it's probably the reviews say so you can
hear<00:00:52.289> how<00:00:52.440> loud

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.180 

once<00:01:02.500> it's<00:01:02.770> ready<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:05.320> are<00:01:05.440> gonna<00:01:05.619> add<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.070> ice

once it's ready we are gonna add the ice

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.789 
once it's ready we are gonna add the ice
so<00:01:07.090> first<00:01:07.720> we're<00:01:07.900> gonna<00:01:07.990> blend<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.590> then<00:01:08.650> I'm

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
so first we're gonna blend and then I'm

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.289 
so first we're gonna blend and then I'm
going<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.010> take<00:01:09.159> this<00:01:09.310> little<00:01:09.460> cylinder<00:01:09.940> out

thick<00:02:04.960> enough<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.830> probably<00:02:06.070> could<00:02:06.250> have

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
thick enough and I probably could have

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.520 
thick enough and I probably could have
mounted<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.730> few<00:02:06.940> more<00:02:07.150> but<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.390> got<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.810> ran<00:02:08.350> out
