00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.540
 The owner of this animal died and he chose 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.690

 I left the shift neither to eat nor to 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.559
 drink and certainly if it had not been 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.329

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.460

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.299
