because<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.310> feel<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.670> when<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> wear

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
because I feel like when you wear

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.880 
because I feel like when you wear
glasses<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.340> lot<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.840> unwanted<00:01:45.840> shadows<00:01:46.619> are

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
glasses a lot of unwanted shadows are

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.460 
glasses a lot of unwanted shadows are
underneath<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.610> eyes<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.170> creates

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
underneath your eyes and it just creates

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.080 
underneath your eyes and it just creates
a<00:01:49.530> lot<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.680> dark<00:01:49.979> circles<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:50.640> eyes<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.000> if

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
a lot of dark circles on your eyes so if

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.160 
a lot of dark circles on your eyes so if
you<00:01:51.180> add<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> little<00:01:51.600> bit<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.930> eyeshadow

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
you add a little bit of eyeshadow

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.530 
you add a little bit of eyeshadow
underneath<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:53.130> eye<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.210> gives<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
underneath your eye it just gives a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.660 
underneath your eye it just gives a
little<00:01:54.810> bit<00:01:55.079> more<00:01:55.320> definition<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.250> next<00:01:56.520> step

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
little bit more definition the next step

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
little bit more definition the next step
in<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.939> look<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.570> apply<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> color

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
in this look is to apply the color

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.240 
in this look is to apply the color
backdoor<00:01:59.340> just<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.350> crease<00:02:01.680> line<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
backdoor just in the crease line and

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.999 
backdoor just in the crease line and
also<00:02:02.820> make<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> v-shape<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.710> kind<00:02:04.950> of

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
also make a v-shape so it's just kind of

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.300 
also make a v-shape so it's just kind of
make<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> line<00:02:05.960> right<00:02:06.960> across<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:08.129> outer

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
make a line right across the outer

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.650 
make a line right across the outer
corner

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
corner

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.120 
corner
and<00:02:09.780> then<00:02:09.930> up<00:02:10.080> into<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.410> crease<00:02:10.650> line<00:02:10.860> then
