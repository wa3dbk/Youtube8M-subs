tree<00:00:00.630> ring<00:00:00.900> dating<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:02.159> based<00:00:02.190> on<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.790> idea

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
tree ring dating is based on the idea

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.829 
tree ring dating is based on the idea
that<00:00:03.179> two<00:00:03.959> trees<00:00:05.089> growing<00:00:06.089> during<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.569> same

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
that two trees growing during the same

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.629 
that two trees growing during the same
years<00:00:07.259> will<00:00:08.189> accrue<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:09.059> same<00:00:09.450> amount<00:00:09.690> of

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
years will accrue the same amount of

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.419 
years will accrue the same amount of
thickness<00:00:11.639> in<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.330> bark<00:00:12.740> per<00:00:13.740> year<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.250> that

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
thickness in the bark per year so that

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.609 
thickness in the bark per year so that
the<00:00:14.580> tree<00:00:14.849> rings<00:00:15.150> will<00:00:15.809> be<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.080> same<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.590> that

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
the tree rings will be the same so that

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.170 
the tree rings will be the same so that
in<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.670> year<00:00:17.930> 1789<00:00:19.640> thickness<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:20.970> tree

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
in a year 1789 thickness on this tree

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.640 
in a year 1789 thickness on this tree
ring<00:00:21.359> will<00:00:21.480> be<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.720> same<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.199> year<00:00:22.470> on

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
ring will be the same as the year on

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.800 
ring will be the same as the year on
this<00:00:23.250> free<00:00:23.490> ring<00:00:23.699> as<00:00:23.850> long<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.269> both<00:00:24.300> grew

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
this free ring as long as they both grew

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.089 
this free ring as long as they both grew
in<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.590> same<00:00:25.890> year<00:00:26.240> 1789<00:00:27.769> that<00:00:28.769> sounds

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
in that same year 1789 that sounds

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.769 
in that same year 1789 that sounds
pretty<00:00:29.220> good<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:30.150> let<00:00:30.269> me<00:00:30.300> tell<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.599> there

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
pretty good but let me tell you there

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.410 
pretty good but let me tell you there
are<00:00:30.810> some<00:00:31.369> serious<00:00:32.369> problems<00:00:32.610> with<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.149> and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
are some serious problems with that and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.600 
are some serious problems with that and
some<00:00:34.110> things<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.530> don't<00:00:34.920> think<00:00:35.280> can

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
some things that I don't think can

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.810 
some things that I don't think can
actually<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:36.239> accounted<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:37.070> now<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
actually be accounted for now the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.610 
actually be accounted for now the
original<00:00:38.910> treeling<00:00:39.719> dating<00:00:40.079> system<00:00:40.410> which

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
original treeling dating system which

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.369 
original treeling dating system which
was<00:00:40.829> put<00:00:41.550> together<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.910> Germany<00:00:42.480> which<00:00:43.079> dates

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
was put together in Germany which dates

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.639 
was put together in Germany which dates
for<00:00:43.559> about<00:00:44.149> 3500<00:00:45.149> years<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.989> that's<00:00:46.140> all<00:00:46.469> they

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
for about 3500 years and that's all they

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.310 
for about 3500 years and that's all they
had<00:00:47.090> just<00:00:48.090> about<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.300> decade<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> half<00:00:48.960> ago

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
had just about a decade and a half ago

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.590 
had just about a decade and a half ago
less<00:00:49.710> than<00:00:49.860> 15<00:00:50.250> years<00:00:50.280> ago<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.239> went<00:00:51.539> to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
less than 15 years ago but I went to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.760 
less than 15 years ago but I went to
call<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.899> that's<00:00:52.050> what<00:00:52.199> they<00:00:52.320> taught<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
call it that's what they taught that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.279 
call it that's what they taught that
there<00:00:52.920> was<00:00:53.039> 3500<00:00:53.879> years<00:00:54.120> or<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> tree-ring

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
there was 3500 years or the tree-ring

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.340 
there was 3500 years or the tree-ring
dating<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.219> now<00:00:56.340> today<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:56.789> say<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.059> have

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
dating and now today they say they have

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.069 
dating and now today they say they have
10,500<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.530> they've<00:00:58.920> extended<00:00:59.520> that<00:01:00.390> time

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
10,500 and they've extended that time

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.500 
10,500 and they've extended that time
period<00:01:01.440> covered<00:01:01.920> by<00:01:02.039> training<00:01:02.430> dating<00:01:02.910> by

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
period covered by training dating by

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.479 
period covered by training dating by
doing<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.439> say<00:01:04.650> well<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.280> one

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
doing this they say well we have one

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.550 
doing this they say well we have one
tree<00:01:05.760> over<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.570> another<00:01:07.110> tree<00:01:07.409> over

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
tree over here and another tree over

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.230 
tree over here and another tree over
here<00:01:07.979> as<00:01:08.189> long<00:01:08.430> as<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:08.760> are<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> same

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
here as long as there are the same

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.780 
here as long as there are the same
variety<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:10.110> example<00:01:10.530> cypress<00:01:11.340> tree<00:01:11.580> in

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
variety for example cypress tree in

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.179 
variety for example cypress tree in
another<00:01:12.150> cypress<00:01:12.600> tree<00:01:12.810> or<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.560> Douglas<00:01:13.950> firs

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
another cypress tree or to Douglas firs

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.450 
another cypress tree or to Douglas firs
then<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.479> put<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.110> together<00:01:16.460> overlap

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
then we can put them together overlap

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.340 
then we can put them together overlap
them<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> Rings<00:01:18.720> pretty<00:01:18.990> much<00:01:19.110> match

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
them and if the Rings pretty much match

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.370 
them and if the Rings pretty much match
then<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.580> say<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.900> extend<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
then we can say that we can extend the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.840 
then we can say that we can extend the
data<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:23.009> now<00:01:23.130> here's<00:01:23.280> my<00:01:23.430> problem<00:01:23.670> with

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
data right now here's my problem with

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.300 
data right now here's my problem with
that<00:01:23.960> my<00:01:24.960> problem<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.740> an<00:01:25.860> engineer<00:01:26.280> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that my problem is that as an engineer I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.880 
that my problem is that as an engineer I
can<00:01:26.640> tell<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.840> find<00:01:30.890> two-by-four

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
can tell you that if I find two-by-four

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.999 
can tell you that if I find two-by-four
from<00:01:32.310> 1950<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> two<00:01:34.170> by<00:01:34.320> four<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
from 1950 and I get a two by four at the

from 1950 and I get a two by four at the

nineteen fifty two by four is going to
withstand<00:01:38.640> about<00:01:39.180> 2,000<00:01:40.049> pounds<00:01:40.320> per<00:01:40.439> square

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
withstand about 2,000 pounds per square

withstand about 2,000 pounds per square

inch in compression but the new one

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.300 
inch in compression but the new one
might<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:43.649> 1200<00:01:44.490> 1350<00:01:45.270> maybe<00:01:45.990> 1,500<00:01:46.770> now<00:01:47.130> why

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
might be 1200 1350 maybe 1,500 now why

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.609 
might be 1200 1350 maybe 1,500 now why
is<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.670> why<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> modern<00:01:48.659> tree<00:01:48.869> weaker<00:01:49.259> well

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
is it why is a modern tree weaker well

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.639 
is it why is a modern tree weaker well
because<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.850> 40s<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.240> 50s<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.689> 30s<00:01:52.140> they

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
because in the 40s and 50s and 30s they

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.179 
because in the 40s and 50s and 30s they
were<00:01:52.740> clear-cutting<00:01:54.740> natural<00:01:55.740> old-growth

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
were clear-cutting natural old-growth

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.609 
were clear-cutting natural old-growth
trees<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:57.060> those<00:01:57.329> trees<00:01:57.659> when<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.290> grew<00:01:58.500> up

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
trees now those trees when they grew up

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.950 
trees now those trees when they grew up
one<00:01:58.860> tree<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.399> little<00:01:59.759> one<00:01:59.969> here<00:02:00.000> would

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
one tree like this little one here would

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.870 
one tree like this little one here would
be<00:02:01.020> blocked<00:02:01.500> at<00:02:01.799> Sun<00:02:02.040> would<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.280> blocked<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.759> it

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
be blocked at Sun would be blocked so it

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.789 
be blocked at Sun would be blocked so it
would<00:02:03.000> grow<00:02:03.180> slower<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.380> they<00:02:04.500> would<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
would grow slower and they would have a

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.230 
would grow slower and they would have a
thicker<00:02:05.219> denser<00:02:05.670> trunk<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.810> wood

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
thicker denser trunk and the wood

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.949 
thicker denser trunk and the wood
cut<00:02:07.360> from<00:02:07.600> those<00:02:07.840> trees<00:02:08.289> is<00:02:08.920> very<00:02:09.280> strong<00:02:09.959> but

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
cut from those trees is very strong but

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.070

now<00:02:11.080> this<00:02:11.349> tree<00:02:11.590> over<00:02:11.860> here<00:02:12.250> growing<00:02:13.060> alone<00:02:13.510> it

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
now this tree over here growing alone it

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.680

drawing<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:17.319> this<00:02:17.500> tree<00:02:17.709> was<00:02:17.860> planted<00:02:17.920> at

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
drawing here this tree was planted at

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.760 
drawing here this tree was planted at
the<00:02:18.520> same<00:02:18.760> time<00:02:19.030> as<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.599> one<00:02:19.840> but<00:02:20.050> it's<00:02:20.530> grown

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
the same time as this one but it's grown

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.620 
the same time as this one but it's grown
bigger<00:02:21.099> it's<00:02:21.580> tree<00:02:21.910> rings<00:02:22.150> are<00:02:22.270> bigger<00:02:22.450> but

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
bigger it's tree rings are bigger but

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.210 
bigger it's tree rings are bigger but
the<00:02:22.720> truth<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.230> they're<00:02:23.470> from<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.739> exact<00:02:24.010> same

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
the truth is they're from the exact same

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.339 
the truth is they're from the exact same
year<00:02:24.519> but<00:02:24.940> using<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.360> system<00:02:25.660> we<00:02:26.019> would<00:02:26.170> say

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
year but using that system we would say

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.759 
year but using that system we would say
oh<00:02:26.560> no<00:02:27.099> these<00:02:27.280> must<00:02:27.550> be<00:02:27.640> from<00:02:27.730> different<00:02:28.090> years

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
oh no these must be from different years

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.410 
oh no these must be from different years
this<00:02:29.769> tree<00:02:30.040> must<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.640> come<00:02:30.880> in<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:31.150> summer

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
this tree must have come in a summer

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.500 
this tree must have come in a summer
when<00:02:31.690> there<00:02:32.230> was<00:02:32.380> less<00:02:32.940> sunshine<00:02:33.940> for

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
when there was less sunshine for

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.470 
when there was less sunshine for
whatever<00:02:34.780> reason<00:02:35.200> but<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:35.860> tree<00:02:36.130> here<00:02:36.760> came

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
whatever reason but this tree here came

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.509 
whatever reason but this tree here came
in<00:02:37.690> when<00:02:37.900> there<00:02:38.050> was<00:02:38.170> good<00:02:38.530> long<00:02:38.800> summers<00:02:39.340> hot

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
in when there was good long summers hot

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.090 
in when there was good long summers hot
summers<00:02:40.000> with<00:02:40.540> good<00:02:40.780> rain<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:40.989> guess<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.590> now

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
summers with good rain I guess and now

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.400 
summers with good rain I guess and now
there<00:02:42.340> he<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.819> he<00:02:43.150> grew<00:02:43.299> up<00:02:43.360> bigger<00:02:43.720> but<00:02:44.260> that's

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
there he is he grew up bigger but that's

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.930 
there he is he grew up bigger but that's
actually<00:02:44.590> wrong<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.069> truth<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.640> tree

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
actually wrong the truth is this tree

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.229 
actually wrong the truth is this tree
grew<00:02:46.569> taller<00:02:46.930> because<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:48.760> had<00:02:48.970> better

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
grew taller because it had better

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.270 
grew taller because it had better
environment<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.440> just<00:02:50.620> simply<00:02:50.980> wasn't

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
environment it just simply wasn't

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.340 
environment it just simply wasn't

it<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.610> something<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.090> happens

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
it and that is something that happens

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.750 
it and that is something that happens
everywhere<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.170> no<00:02:57.130> one<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.430> going<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.640> be

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
6,000 hard for six yet 8000 BC and tell

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.569 
6,000 hard for six yet 8000 BC and tell
me<00:03:10.269> what<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.350> tree<00:03:11.560> density<00:03:11.769> looked<00:03:12.220> like<00:03:12.400> in

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
me what the tree density looked like in

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.550 
me what the tree density looked like in
a<00:03:12.640> forest<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.540> can't<00:03:13.810> do<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:14.410> that

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
a forest you can't do that so that

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.539 
a forest you can't do that so that
theory<00:03:15.040> just<00:03:15.820> completely<00:03:16.180> fails<00:03:17.459> all<00:03:18.459> right

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
theory just completely fails all right

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.340 
theory just completely fails all right
now<00:03:18.730> here's<00:03:19.120> another<00:03:19.329> problem<00:03:19.600> is<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.049> a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
now here's another problem is that a

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.130 
now here's another problem is that a
tree<00:03:20.859> when<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.280> gets<00:03:21.430> over<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.730> certain<00:03:21.910> age

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
tree when it gets over a certain age

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.140 
tree when it gets over a certain age
ceases<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.290> grow<00:03:23.440> perfectly<00:03:23.980> round<00:03:24.250> it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
ceases to grow perfectly round it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.750 
ceases to grow perfectly round it
becomes<00:03:25.540> warped<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.200> odd-shaped<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:27.549> when

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
becomes warped and odd-shaped and when

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.530 
becomes warped and odd-shaped and when
that<00:03:27.790> happens<00:03:28.109> if<00:03:29.109> your<00:03:29.320> Center<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:31.299> over<00:03:31.510> here

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
that happens if your Center so over here

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.319 
that happens if your Center so over here
somewhere<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.790> you're<00:03:33.790> going<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.000> start

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
somewhere and you're going to start

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.059 
somewhere and you're going to start
getting<00:03:34.600> these<00:03:34.829> egg-shaped<00:03:37.500> tree<00:03:38.500> now<00:03:38.859> let

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
getting these egg-shaped tree now let

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.949 
getting these egg-shaped tree now let
the<00:03:39.130> five<00:03:39.310> manager<00:03:39.640> across<00:03:39.940> here<00:03:40.420> I'm<00:03:40.810> going

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
the five manager across here I'm going

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.330 
the five manager across here I'm going
to<00:03:41.049> get<00:03:41.140> one<00:03:41.319> distance<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:41.950> then<00:03:42.069> I<00:03:42.100> measure

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
to get one distance and then I measure

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.069 
to get one distance and then I measure
it<00:03:42.489> across<00:03:42.579> here<00:03:43.209> I'm<00:03:43.540> going<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.780> get<00:03:43.900> another

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
it across here I'm going to get another

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.559 
it across here I'm going to get another
distance<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.680> measure<00:03:44.859> across<00:03:45.069> there<00:03:45.569> again

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
distance I measure across there again

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.690 
distance I measure across there again
something<00:03:47.380> different<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:47.859> this<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:48.459> another

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
something different so this is another

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.759 
something different so this is another
problem<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.420> has<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.959> be<00:03:50.049> accounted<00:03:50.290> for<00:03:51.600> I'm

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
problem that has to be accounted for I'm

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.080 
problem that has to be accounted for I'm
betting<00:03:53.769> that<00:03:54.010> most<00:03:54.069> scientists<00:03:54.639> wouldn't

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
betting that most scientists wouldn't

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.809 
betting that most scientists wouldn't
