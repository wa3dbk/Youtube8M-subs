00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.009
 for those people who like 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:10.000
 eat eggs this is a very idea 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:12.610
 easy but with a lot of flavor and about 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.400
 everything we are going to put a touch of 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.610
 nutrition so I hope you like it 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.820
 we are going to need 2 eggs pepper salt 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.789
 to taste a very large pepper very 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.150
 large very large green and oil 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.810
 olive now yes let's do what we wash 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.870
 the pepper and cut into slices more or 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.790
 less thick and the biggest that is 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.450
 you can find the pepper now you 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.210
 we will place around salt and pepper 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.750
 okay 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.760
 we have to stay more or less like this 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.519
 pepper and salt we mix it and put it 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.470
 all around the pepper on the other 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.530
 side let's put our pan to 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.570
 very low fire with a little bit of 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.949
 olive oil and we're going to add 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.100
 our slice of pepper and we're going to 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.619
 leave there on fire very very low to that more 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.680
 or less is cooked on one side and the other 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.350
 Seal from both sides ok 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.679
 once it's sealed from a part what 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.610
 we turn and wait for the pepper 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:24.330
 We pour the egg is sealed right in the middle 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:27.340
 we save to our liking and we wait for 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.890
 that we were ok 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.590
 how about these rich eggs saw what 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.140
 easy and the truth is that they know super 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.479
 good with the pepper we can 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.210
 accompany with some rich beans with 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.280
 a delicious salad and well this is a 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.770
 way more to prepare the eggs and the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.619
 I really do not like the yolk 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.079
 raw so I 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.209
 I give it twice, but if you're from 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.479
 those that you like to eat the normal yolk 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.909
 so raw because you only give it a single 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.049
 side and ready now to enjoy them 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.049
 thanks for watching bond 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.719
