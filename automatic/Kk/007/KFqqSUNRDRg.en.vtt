on it it will become tougher and it will
become<00:01:44.790> better<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.110> also<00:01:46.200> put<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
become better and if you also put a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.410 
become better and if you also put a
subtle<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.579> control<00:01:48.000> which<00:01:48.240> way

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
subtle on it you can control which way

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.080 
subtle on it you can control which way
it<00:01:48.570> goes<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:50.040> time<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.579> right<00:01:50.880> in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
it goes so now it's time to go right in

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.780 
it goes so now it's time to go right in
ya<00:01:51.630> ha<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
ya ha and then as you can see with a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.730 
ya ha and then as you can see with a
little<00:01:54.149> saddle<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.079> go<00:01:55.200> anywhere<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
little saddle you can go anywhere you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.709 
little saddle you can go anywhere you
want<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.450> horse<00:01:57.659> a

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
want and as you can see the horse a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.670 
want and as you can see the horse a
pretty<00:01:58.020> good<00:01:58.170> way<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.320> getting<00:01:58.590> around

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
pretty good way of getting around

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.440 
pretty good way of getting around
because<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:58.979> goes<00:01:59.189> quite<00:01:59.490> quickly<00:01:59.700> as<00:02:00.000> you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
because it goes quite quickly as you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.999 
because it goes quite quickly as you
would<00:02:00.540> expect<00:02:00.659> because<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.409> bloody<00:02:01.649> horse

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
would expect because it's a bloody horse

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.359 
would expect because it's a bloody horse
and<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.600> also<00:02:03.960> know<00:02:04.229> well<00:02:04.950> don't

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
and then it's you also know well don't

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
and then it's you also know well don't

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
donkeys the exact same way you do horses

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.450 
donkeys the exact same way you do horses
and<00:02:32.020> they're<00:02:32.470> basically<00:02:32.710> exactly<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.280> same

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
and they're basically exactly the same
