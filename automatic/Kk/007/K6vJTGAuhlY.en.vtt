far<00:05:56.180> as<00:05:56.300> lipsticks<00:05:56.840> though<00:05:57.050> so<00:05:57.560> if<00:05:57.710> you<00:05:57.860> can

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
far as lipsticks though so if you can

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.800 
far as lipsticks though so if you can
find<00:05:58.310> them<00:05:58.490> you<00:05:58.640> should<00:05:59.030> grab<00:05:59.270> them<00:05:59.540> and<00:05:59.660> buy

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
find them you should grab them and buy

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.510 
find them you should grab them and buy
them<00:05:59.840> all<00:06:00.200> because<00:06:00.380> they're<00:06:00.680> selling<00:06:01.040> out<00:06:01.190> and
