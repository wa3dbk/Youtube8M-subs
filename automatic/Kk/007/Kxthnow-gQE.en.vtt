00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.380 
but it's about the sizing it you can
make<00:02:37.819> it<00:02:37.970> bigger<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:39.909> you<00:02:40.909> don't<00:02:41.060> really<00:02:41.180> need

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
make it bigger but you don't really need

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.170 
make it bigger but you don't really need
it<00:02:41.510> much<00:02:41.659> bigger<00:02:41.810> than<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:42.790> okay<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:44.060> you

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
it much bigger than that okay then you

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.729 
it much bigger than that okay then you
basically<00:02:44.420> take<00:02:45.340> put<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.370> plant<00:02:46.819> on<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
basically take put a plant on the

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.199 
basically take put a plant on the
cutting<00:02:48.739> thing<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:49.220> take<00:02:49.549> your<00:02:49.790> sewing

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
cutting thing and take your sewing

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.539 
cutting thing and take your sewing
machine<00:02:50.269> naval<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.970> just<00:02:53.239> poke<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.540> hole<00:02:53.720> in

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
machine naval you just poke a hole in

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.000 
machine naval you just poke a hole in
this<00:02:56.049> closest<00:02:57.049> to<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.379> center<00:02:57.620> as<00:02:57.890> you

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
this closest to the center as you

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.460 
this closest to the center as you
possibly<00:02:58.489> can

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.660 

then<00:03:01.710> poke<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.600> straight<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:04.070> turn<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.190> over<00:03:05.310> be

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
then poke it straight in turn it over be

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.150 
then poke it straight in turn it over be
careful<00:03:06.090> with<00:03:06.210> this<00:03:06.360> part<00:03:06.720> what<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.740> do<00:03:08.040> is

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
careful with this part what you do is

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.750 
careful with this part what you do is
just<00:03:08.190> push<00:03:08.400> it

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.630 

alcohol<00:03:13.540> is<00:03:13.810> centered

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
alcohol is centered

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.119 
alcohol is centered
what<00:03:16.640> you're<00:03:16.790> going<00:03:16.940> to<00:03:17.000> do<00:03:17.180> next<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.810> push<00:03:18.470> the

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
what you're going to do next is push the

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.289 
what you're going to do next is push the
needle<00:03:19.750> all<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:21.049> way<00:03:21.200> for<00:03:21.739> room<00:03:22.010> up<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:23.060> here

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
needle all the way for room up to here

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.280 
needle all the way for room up to here
with<00:03:23.510> your<00:03:23.810> fingers

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.340 

watch<00:03:27.890> out<00:03:28.099> your<00:03:28.250> fingers<00:03:28.579> so<00:03:28.610> it's<00:03:28.849> like<00:03:29.000> that

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.780 

and<00:03:32.680> then

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
and then

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.630 
and then
push<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.569> down<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.849> bottom

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.340 

when<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.240> get<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.569> it<00:03:41.690> when<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.870> goes<00:03:42.050> bigger

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
when you get to it when it goes bigger

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.020 
when you get to it when it goes bigger
that's<00:03:42.650> when<00:03:42.800> you<00:03:42.890> need<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.069> do<00:03:43.280> really<00:03:43.640> slowly

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
that's when you need to do really slowly

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.770 
that's when you need to do really slowly
because<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:44.480> can<00:03:44.630> really<00:03:44.959> you<00:03:45.319> can<00:03:45.470> rip<00:03:45.709> it

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
because you can really you can rip it

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.690 
because you can really you can rip it
slowly<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.140> you'll<00:03:48.709> just<00:03:48.920> feel<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.459> slide

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
slowly and you'll just feel it slide

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.250 
slowly and you'll just feel it slide
down<00:03:49.940> in<00:03:50.120> there<00:03:51.069> it's<00:03:52.069> like<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:53.050> and<00:03:54.050> then

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
down in there it's like that and then

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.490 
down in there it's like that and then
you<00:03:54.920> basically<00:03:55.100> have<00:03:55.550> done<00:03:55.880> just<00:03:56.780> let<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.470> sit

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
you basically have done just let it sit

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.440 
you basically have done just let it sit
for<00:03:57.830> a<00:03:58.459> couple<00:03:58.550> hours<00:03:59.590> just<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:00.830> like<00:04:01.760> maintain

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
for a couple hours just so like maintain

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.660 
for a couple hours just so like maintain
its<00:04:02.630> shape<00:04:02.720> longer<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.310> don't<00:04:04.459> have<00:04:04.520> to

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
its shape longer so you don't have to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.880 
its shape longer so you don't have to
rush<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:04.910> play<00:04:05.180> one<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:06.590> don't<00:04:06.770> really

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
rush to play one and I don't really

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.180 
rush to play one and I don't really
think<00:04:07.190> I<00:04:07.610> have<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.239> explain<00:04:08.480> how<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.190> put

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
think I have to explain how to put

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.569 
think I have to explain how to put
bushings<00:04:11.000> on<00:04:13.420> just<00:04:14.770> let<00:04:15.770> me<00:04:15.890> screw<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.340> little

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
bushings on just let me screw the little

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.319 
bushings on just let me screw the little
kingpin<00:04:17.060> nut<00:04:17.299> take<00:04:18.290> off<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.680> truck<00:04:19.209> put<00:04:20.209> the

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
kingpin nut take off the truck put the

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.300 
kingpin nut take off the truck put the
bushing<00:04:20.690> on<00:04:20.810> put<00:04:21.049> Chuck<00:04:21.290> on<00:04:21.470> but<00:04:21.739> pushing<00:04:21.950> on<00:04:22.280> a

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
bushing on put Chuck on but pushing on a

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:31.659 
bushing on put Chuck on but pushing on a
nut<00:04:23.860> Sam<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:29.000> make<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.690> visions<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.530> make<00:04:31.220> um

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
nut Sam to make it the visions I make um

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.630 
nut Sam to make it the visions I make um
I<00:04:32.090> like<00:04:33.050> them<00:04:33.230> because<00:04:33.770> if<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:34.250> make<00:04:34.490> them

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
I like them because if you make them

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.270 
I like them because if you make them
right<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.380> don't<00:04:36.380> know<00:04:36.500> if<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:36.650> can<00:04:36.770> see<00:04:37.040> that

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
right I don't know if you can see that

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.909 
right I don't know if you can see that
but<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:39.970> nut<00:04:40.970> actually<00:04:41.780> goes<00:04:41.960> down<00:04:42.230> into<00:04:42.560> it

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
but the nut actually goes down into it

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.480 
but the nut actually goes down into it
if<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.550> tighten<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:44.860> tighten<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:46.100> tighten<00:04:46.250> up

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
if you tighten it tighten it tighten up

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.860 
if you tighten it tighten it tighten up
goes<00:04:47.270> down<00:04:47.510> into<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:48.050> bushing<00:04:48.440> itself<00:04:49.870> so

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
goes down into the bushing itself so

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.300 
goes down into the bushing itself so
then<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:51.260> keeps<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:51.590> from<00:04:51.740> moving<00:04:51.950> so<00:04:52.280> it

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
then I keeps it from moving so it

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.120 
then I keeps it from moving so it
doesn't<00:04:52.640> get<00:04:52.700> loose<00:04:52.940> but<00:04:53.270> if<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.140> don't<00:04:54.860> like

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
doesn't get loose but if you don't like

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.930 
doesn't get loose but if you don't like
really<00:04:55.520> tight<00:04:55.760> trucks<00:04:56.120> have<00:04:56.360> no<00:04:56.540> fear<00:04:56.840> because

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
really tight trucks have no fear because

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.680 
really tight trucks have no fear because
they<00:04:58.940> still<00:04:59.240> are<00:04:59.360> pretty<00:05:00.520> removing

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
they still are pretty removing

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.240 
they still are pretty removing
especially<00:05:02.690> if<00:05:02.810> you<00:05:02.900> have<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:03.080> bigger<00:05:03.380> bushing

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
especially if you have a bigger bushing

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.760 
especially if you have a bigger bushing
on<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.460> bottom
