00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.889
 We will know Caroline 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:16.759
 Dr 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.060
 it goes on like this 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.509
 and Star Wars 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.779
 Voigt's Wosz DAX da was Star Wars 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 though my first contact must be 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.010
 presumably these take Paris 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.960
 At that time the sea-countries won the road myself in the basement Wutke 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.570
 was 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.540
 My mother has me 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.210
 bought two toy figures 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.640
 she bought me 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.130
 he pulled the zwoa 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.750
 and they will 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.890
 but at that time I had no idea what I had in front of me the one 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.350
 looked like a little biggi rocket 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.970
 and the other more 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.690
 i have to lose i find out how 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.979
 many parents demand 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.780
 because that's so beautiful Braun 1 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.780
 What Scheer should not really be like that 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.580
 a few years later, all 3 Altena came to house parts 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.840
 Back in the cinema thanks to my fatherland with my father, I had the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.900
 Titans from it none in the cinema looked at 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.770
 I can not say why the films were back in the cinema at the time 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.280
 already the first Special Indian or just 20 years Storm from the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.450
 Animals anniversary or so optimal 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.710
 when you expect here and I wish I watched in the cinema 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.710
 but I did not know what I wanted for a while 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.970
 And not only does this show nothing for a lifetime 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.070
 discovered 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.100
 I have fought huge battles with small figures 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.590
 but sure is read from comics 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.480
 and they also designate themselves and such things b 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.820
 I have too 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.330
 I also play much better 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.710
 Of course, I almost learned the films by heart 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.540
 and I did not answer him hard 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.540
 from the increase but which made 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.099
 Chur 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.099
 the Arctic Sea is similar in function 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:19.309
 that's what Magath was about 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:20.739
 the lightsaber 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.639
 has always been something special for me 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.849
 the energy 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.309
 every idea 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30.309
 I have to say is not clear 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.579
 it was always suspected 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.119
 Art object not 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:39.919
 unique and cake 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.749
 and I do not just have two 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:44.949
 I built several 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.269
 even some with Chris part 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.639
 OnStar I'm a really big star failures 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.189
 only more than now but not i am a big mess 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.419
 At least One 5 is, for example, my favorite movie according to her plans 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.920
 that is not so and adults at how was actually planned 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.519
 and JAL I am also one of the people who knew the old sda better 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.179
 Find 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:15.329
 the new ones are and but they are somehow made more for kids and somehow 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.029
 who the old movies 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:21.889
 that was still really coal while heart follows it around who therefore still has it 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.609
 differently for example Episode 5 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.540
 The movie has just everything or adventure humor 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.999
 a Lovestory 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:31.739
 great actor 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.429
 who have the chocolates 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:38.229
 in the to today 5 comes the well-known and 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.359
 Koussa saying of all times before I am soon Bator 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:47.880
 Dr 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.629
 I have a baffoe too 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.689
 Diarra 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.329
 OKI I admit it 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.549
 I love Star Wars 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.159
 Voigt's today she's the weird at Aachen's Star War Merck Finck Red 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.479
 war of stars 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.439
 I can 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.189
 it's just a fantasy world I used to like to hide in the past 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.949
 have 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.949
 very serious of an important problem 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.169
 it is simply beautiful 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.120
 How is it with you, if possible, all east 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.720
 www Bayanoo de 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.489
 or rather to the finish 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.490
 What fascinated you for years and accompanied you on your way through life 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.599
 also sammer off maybe 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.589
 Well, I hope he comes at least a small part of what I say the sentence 

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:35.919
 everyone understand and 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.919
 if any 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.379
 I really liked the video 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.439
 MT too 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.229
 Leave comments 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:54.389
 2 s 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.229
 or not tourist 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.360
 there is no try 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.979
 none yet 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.110
 and is not all texts from the need 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.419
 I thought sometimes 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.610
 Hopefully, George Lucas will not happen 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.039
 Otherwise, he would continue or complete this and finish it 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.139
 then I turned around to look around
