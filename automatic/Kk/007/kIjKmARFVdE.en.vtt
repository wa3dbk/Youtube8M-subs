middle allowing a front burner and the
rear<00:01:33.900> burner<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:35.100> did<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.820> stove<00:01:36.150> similar<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
rear burner I did one stove similar to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.249 
rear burner I did one stove similar to
this<00:01:37.070> for<00:01:38.070> another<00:01:38.490> place<00:01:38.850> which<00:01:39.150> also<00:01:39.479> had<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
this for another place which also had a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.090 
this for another place which also had a
cathedral<00:01:41.100> ceiling<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.899> stovepipe<00:01:43.619> came

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
cathedral ceiling and the stovepipe came

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.190 
cathedral ceiling and the stovepipe came
out<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.490> rear<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.390> essentially<00:01:45.840> does<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
out the rear but it essentially does the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.590 
out the rear but it essentially does the
same<00:01:46.380> thing<00:01:46.920> there<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.399> openings<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.509> the

barrel where the well the front one is

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.130 
barrel where the well the front one is
just<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.280> heat<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.540> front<00:01:54.780> cooking

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
just to heat the the front cooking

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.590 
just to heat the the front cooking
surface<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.770> doesn't<00:01:56.040> actually<00:01:56.219> allow<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
surface it doesn't actually allow the

surface it doesn't actually allow the
flue<00:01:57.990> gases<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.619> escape<00:01:59.149> like<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.899> rear

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
flue gases to escape like the the rear

flue gases to escape like the the rear
the<00:02:01.469> flue<00:02:01.619> gasses<00:02:02.070> actually<00:02:02.460> come<00:02:02.670> out

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
the flue gasses actually come out

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810 
the flue gasses actually come out
through<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> barrel<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.439> up<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.219> pipe<00:02:05.490> in

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
through the barrel and up this pipe in
