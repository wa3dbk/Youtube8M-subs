00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
weapon I would have to say a lot of

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.290

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
must say I mean we want it to probably a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.590 
must say I mean we want it to probably a
good<00:00:46.110> weapon<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.940> weapon

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
good weapon but it's just not a weapon

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that I would have to pick for PvP but I

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.410

lethal fusion rifle well let's face it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.120 
lethal fusion rifle well let's face it
all<00:01:08.070> fusion<00:01:08.790> rifles<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.510> destiny<00:01:10.200> are<00:01:10.229> lethal

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
all fusion rifles and destiny are lethal

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.380 
all fusion rifles and destiny are lethal
they<00:01:11.670> kill<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.960> shot<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.710> close<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.580> we

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
they kill in one shot up close and we

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.080 
they kill in one shot up close and we
all<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:16.049> had<00:01:16.290> our<00:01:16.700> frustrations<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.880> those

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
all have had our frustrations on those

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.539 
all have had our frustrations on those
weapons<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.170> figured<00:01:19.350> hell<00:01:19.950> I'm<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.430> going

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
weapons so I figured hell I'm just going

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.060 
weapons so I figured hell I'm just going
to<00:01:20.580> start<00:01:20.850> using<00:01:21.090> them<00:01:21.420> why<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.830> see

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
to start using them why not and just see

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.270 
to start using them why not and just see
what<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.970> gives<00:01:24.570> me<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.170> destiny<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
what it gives me in destiny and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.030 
what it gives me in destiny and
personally<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.240> great<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.770> thing

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
personally it's great for the thing

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.160 
personally it's great for the thing
because<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.060> fang<00:01:30.299> shoots<00:01:30.689> at<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> long

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
because the fang shoots at a long

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.740 
because the fang shoots at a long
distance<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.729> fusion<00:01:33.060> rifles<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.659> up

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
distance and the fusion rifles for up

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.870 
distance and the fusion rifles for up
close<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.350> was<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.799> alternating<00:01:35.369> between

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
close so I was just alternating between

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.530 
close so I was just alternating between
the<00:01:36.360> two<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.920> worked<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:38.970> really<00:01:39.030> well<00:01:39.329> I

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the two and it worked out really well I

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.170 
the two and it worked out really well I
didn't<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> crazy<00:01:40.619> game<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.340> probably

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
a lot of people lately on how i use a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.370 
a lot of people lately on how i use a
controller<00:03:42.060> so<00:03:42.450> i<00:03:42.480> thought<00:03:42.720> i'd<00:03:42.900> do<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.200> with

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
controller so i thought i'd do it with

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.220 
controller so i thought i'd do it with
this<00:03:43.620> weapon<00:03:43.860> because<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.580> scout<00:03:45.240> rifle<00:03:45.450> i<00:03:45.930> have

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
this weapon because a scout rifle i have

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.960 
this weapon because a scout rifle i have
to<00:03:46.380> hit<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.710> button<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.130> little<00:03:47.370> bit<00:03:47.520> more<00:03:47.910> than

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
to hit the button a little bit more than

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.050 
to hit the button a little bit more than
usual<00:03:48.630> than<00:03:49.110> an<00:03:49.260> auto<00:03:49.470> rifle<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.880> a

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
usual than an auto rifle so it's a

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.970 
usual than an auto rifle so it's a
little<00:03:51.270> bit<00:03:51.390> more<00:03:51.630> challenging<00:03:52.080> i<00:03:52.590> would<00:03:52.740> say

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
little bit more challenging i would say

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.950 
little bit more challenging i would say
it's<00:03:53.160> it's<00:03:53.700> not<00:03:53.970> difficult<00:03:54.240> but<00:03:54.600> it's<00:03:54.840> more

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
it's it's not difficult but it's more

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.130 
it's it's not difficult but it's more
challenging<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.740> i<00:03:56.510> actually<00:03:57.510> would<00:03:57.900> have<00:03:57.990> to

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
challenging and i actually would have to

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.380 
challenging and i actually would have to
