00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that was a slight game design stake in

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.149 
that was a slight game design stake in
my<00:01:17.009> opinion<00:01:19.850> joto<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:21.180> cool<00:01:21.619> do<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.890> going

of<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.210> Japanese<00:01:27.720> atmosphere<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.500> some<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of a Japanese atmosphere in some of the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.770 
of a Japanese atmosphere in some of the
some<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.700> places<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> bell<00:01:30.509> tower

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.390 
thought that was really cool and just a
good<00:02:18.080> way<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.320> put<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.590> bunch<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:18.860> new<00:02:18.980> Pokemon

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
good way to put a bunch of new Pokemon

good way to put a bunch of new Pokemon
in<00:02:19.550> there<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:19.880> all<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.360> I'd<00:02:20.480> say<00:02:20.800> out<00:02:21.800> of

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
in there and all that so I'd say out of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.580 
in there and all that so I'd say out of
the<00:02:22.100> four<00:02:22.400> world<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.270> far<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.780> like<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:24.410> know<00:02:24.560> the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
the four world so far I like to know the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.330 
the four world so far I like to know the
best<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:26.320> just<00:02:27.320> appealed<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.740> me<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:27.890> think<00:02:28.160> part

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
best I just appealed to me I think part

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.560 
best I just appealed to me I think part
of<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.460> was<00:02:28.610> because<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.940> was<00:02:28.970> based<00:02:29.240> off<00:02:29.420> an

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
of that was because it was based off an

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.200 
of that was because it was based off an
actual<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.650> actual<00:02:30.800> type<00:02:31.190> i<00:02:31.370> hath<00:02:31.610> also<00:02:31.820> top

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
actual the actual type i hath also top

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.720 
actual the actual type i hath also top
big<00:02:32.420> island<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:33.040> Japan<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.190> Hulk<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.460> adore

however<00:02:35.240> we<00:02:35.300> want<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.510> call<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.260> think

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
however we want to call it so I think

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.520 
however we want to call it so I think
that<00:02:36.830> worked<00:02:37.040> out<00:02:37.160> well<00:02:37.220> was<00:02:37.610> very<00:02:38.500> sort<00:02:39.500> of

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
that worked out well was very sort of

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.050 
that worked out well was very sort of
put<00:02:39.710> a<00:02:39.740> sense<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.040> realism<00:02:40.400> into<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.790> very

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
put a sense of realism into a very

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.870 
put a sense of realism into a very
unreal<00:02:41.540> scenario<00:02:42.230> but<00:02:42.500> that's<00:02:42.950> my<00:02:43.250> opinion<00:02:43.430> if

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
unreal scenario but that's my opinion if

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.160 
unreal scenario but that's my opinion if
you<00:02:43.970> have<00:02:44.120> different<00:02:44.420> opinion<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.840> can<00:02:44.960> put

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
you have different opinion you can put

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.450 
you have different opinion you can put
it<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.470> comment<00:02:45.950> box<00:02:46.010> with<00:02:46.430> the
