 will put an end but in any case it is 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.900
 the art of pleasing you so I'm going 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.540
 try to keep it a good little 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.769
 moment so on studio as I tell you 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.809
 we said we will end up partly 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.549
 private so the rance pow n'doye and the goal 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.809
 it will be running very fast through 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.670
 the buildings do not switch to midel 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.589
 since there are often flash snipers 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.930
 and other ocz from the haystack or 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.850
 well over the bay building 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.070
 lurking sekkat towards where the enemies 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.690
 so take it's them and put themselves 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.549
 on b to explode the c4 quietly 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.799
 when we ask ourselves these will require 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.439
 get on the building quickly launched 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.619
 the parra in the little door and the ck 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.240
 above the best of the wall so 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.729
 that it falls on point a and so that 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.770
 does a lot of elimination so we 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.539
 goes directly into multi and like you 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.729
 will be able to see it and well it's going 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.899
 directly do a lot of kiel so 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.640
 there I had to lighten the conditions 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.200
 extremes on the side at it's a lot more 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.549
 easy does not need dexterity but 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.979
 not both of you going to see I'm going 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.619
 start the parra here I go here is his 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.659
 parade at the cape I throw the little c4eva 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.159
 a triple fidh so that's good 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.539
 cool and on that side you'll be able 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.219
 noticed that I had no dexterity but 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.880
 if I had it would have been still 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.380
 faster 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.579
 so here I go you will see you 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.049
 I want a little galley to climb 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.490
 but in the end it still goes to market 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.229
 people via the share plus I pay myself 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.850
 on the parra actually to send it and that has 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.560
 market anyway triple click all of 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.119
 even that's really fun 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.490
 here I put you the fashion view 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.869
 studio so for you and finally 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.369
 understand how it went 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.440
 I could even have four if you 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.030
 can you notice a pity we are only 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.700
 three months it's not that bad 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.110
 it's nice to have bonus radios 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.910
 it's nice because there is a small bonus 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.710
 we end up with ghost so always 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.180
 on studio who made it a clip 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.830
 a little bit different from the same since 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.930
 still wanted to take c is 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.610
 when you take it is that you take 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.500
 years and spawn enemies in has and they 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.030
 have the unfortunate tendency to want 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.290
 take but directly so look 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.180
 what goes to what will go up are these 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.770
 in the building is launched the c4 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.570
 directly on b and bam 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.920
 a little triple fidh too so that's it 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.630
 if you want to take these I you 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.700
 advise to run that these 4 / b otherwise 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.510
 he blame me in the opposing camp 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.880
 directly 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.170
 so here's this tutorial it's already 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.160
 completed it's true that these videos to 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.600
 are short but it allows me to 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.220
 to be a little closer to you because 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.660
 that I post a lot more videos 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.430
 finally more regularly at least 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.900
 So here I am, thank you to all 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.580
 to have a year this video until 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.680
 last but I also thank the good plan 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.330
