I say the wrong thing Greg but as you
can<00:00:20.910> see<00:00:21.090> we've<00:00:21.270> changed<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.660> prop<00:00:21.960> from<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
can see we've changed the prop from the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.370 
can see we've changed the prop from the
standard<00:00:22.890> three<00:00:23.220> blade<00:00:24.210> prop<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> two

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
big bugger off modeled 3542 I think 3542

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.400 
big bugger off modeled 3542 I think 3542
apparently<00:00:35.370> we've<00:00:36.360> done<00:00:36.840> some<00:00:37.079> preliminary

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
apparently we've done some preliminary

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.479 
apparently we've done some preliminary
tests<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.200> holding<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.370> you<00:00:41.370> know

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
tests on it and holding it you know

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.580 
tests on it and holding it you know
gingerly<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.239> half<00:00:42.719> throttle<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.320> it's

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
gingerly a half throttle it's it's

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.500 
gingerly a half throttle it's it's
starting<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> go<00:00:44.040> vertical<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.420> we're

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
starting to go vertical so I think we're

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.110 
starting to go vertical so I think we're
going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> desired<00:00:46.260> performance

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
going to get the desired performance

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.430 
going to get the desired performance

through the JR that I used to own and so
we<00:01:30.600> now<00:01:30.780> I've<00:01:30.869> got<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.290> binded<00:01:33.439> we've<00:01:34.439> done

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
completed as you can see the flex which

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.889 
completed as you can see the flex which
is<00:01:40.079> an<00:01:40.200> optional<00:01:40.560> extra<00:01:40.650> with<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.780> with<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
is an optional extra with the with the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.499 
is an optional extra with the with the
beef<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.350> we've<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.369> installed<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
beef and we've just installed the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.580 
beef and we've just installed the
lusatian<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.009> servos<00:01:47.520> slow<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.470> as

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
lusatian the servos slow there and as

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.160 
lusatian the servos slow there and as
you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.070 

and<00:01:53.439> it<00:01:53.619> might<00:01:53.740> be<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.920> bit<00:01:54.040> of<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:54.659> yet<00:01:55.659> they

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
and it might be a bit of you yet they

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.590 
and it might be a bit of you yet they
work<00:01:56.290> instead<00:01:57.280> of<00:01:57.340> just<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.820> normal<00:01:58.150> on-off

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600

sort of speed that the the servos

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.679 
sort of speed that the the servos
running<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.280> runs<00:02:06.729> at<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.030> slow<00:02:07.240> speed<00:02:07.509> we've

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.270 
running it runs at that slow speed we've
been<00:02:07.840> able<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.110> adjust<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.649> a<00:02:08.800> speed<00:02:09.039> we

lights<00:02:15.520> as<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.910> can<00:02:16.030> see<00:02:16.500> they're<00:02:17.500> just

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
lights as you can see they're just

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.420 
lights as you can see they're just
little<00:02:17.860> LED<00:02:18.459> lights<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:20.069> what<00:02:21.069> we<00:02:21.190> found

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
little LED lights and what we found

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.890 
little LED lights and what we found
initially<00:02:21.790> when<00:02:22.090> flying<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.540> model<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.870> that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
initially when flying the model is that

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.690 
initially when flying the model is that
was<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.319> was<00:02:23.470> extremely<00:02:24.069> hard<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.550> get

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
was it was extremely hard to get

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.490 
was it was extremely hard to get
orientation<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.510> sometimes<00:02:25.959> we<00:02:26.170> found<00:02:26.380> we

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
orientation and sometimes we found we

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.509 
orientation and sometimes we found we
were<00:02:26.560> flying<00:02:26.739> upside<00:02:27.100> down<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.400> not

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
were flying upside down and not

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.699 
were flying upside down and not
realizing<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.330> we<00:02:29.140> put<00:02:29.319> it<00:02:29.380> in<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.530> white

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
realizing it so we put it in the white

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.890 
realizing it so we put it in the white
LEDs<00:02:30.220> on<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.489> bottom<00:02:30.790> as<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.600> see<00:02:31.750> we've

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
LEDs on the bottom as you can see we've

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.280 
LEDs on the bottom as you can see we've
only<00:02:32.049> just<00:02:32.110> finished<00:02:32.590> putting<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
only just finished putting in the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.680 
only just finished putting in the
deflects<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.010> wires<00:02:36.340> are<00:02:36.459> beer<00:02:36.940> there<00:02:37.150> and

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
deflects so the wires are beer there and

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.660 
deflects so the wires are beer there and
as<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:37.959> can<00:02:38.080> see<00:02:38.110> we've<00:02:38.890> trunked<00:02:39.280> all<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
as you can see we've trunked all the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.180 
as you can see we've trunked all the
wiring<00:02:39.880> arm<00:02:40.450> putting<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.560> back<00:02:41.769> sets<00:02:42.040> and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
wiring arm putting that back sets and

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.280 
wiring arm putting that back sets and
focus<00:02:42.549> but<00:02:42.790> all<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.480> wiring<00:02:43.690> for<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.019> lights

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
focus but all the wiring for the lights

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.160 
focus but all the wiring for the lights
that<00:02:44.530> come<00:02:44.680> through<00:02:44.739> here<00:02:45.540> under<00:02:46.540> over<00:02:47.049> the

that come through here under over the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.570 
that come through here under over the
strength<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.739> know<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:48.040> I've<00:02:48.190> put<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.489> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
strength to know that I've put in the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.520 
strength to know that I've put in the
wing<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:48.880> then<00:02:49.450> just<00:02:49.660> feed<00:02:49.989> them<00:02:50.110> along<00:02:50.380> the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
wing and then just feed them along the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.170 
wing and then just feed them along the
line<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:51.310> standard<00:02:51.640> lee<00:02:51.880> in<00:02:52.000> there

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
line that is standard lee in there

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.440 
line that is standard lee in there
further<00:02:52.950> for<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.010> survey<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.910> wheels<00:02:55.150> there

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
further for the survey the wheels there

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.080 
further for the survey the wheels there
and<00:02:55.600> these<00:02:56.350> are<00:02:56.530> actually<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.090> standard

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
and these are actually the standard

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.479 
and these are actually the standard
wheel<00:02:58.930> mounts<00:02:59.500> although<00:02:59.859> we've<00:03:00.010> changed<00:03:00.310> the

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
wheel mounts although we've changed the

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.130 
wheel mounts although we've changed the
the<00:03:00.820> wheels<00:03:01.000> just<00:03:01.299> smaller<00:03:01.660> because<00:03:01.870> there

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
the wheels just smaller because there

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.630 
the wheels just smaller because there
are<00:03:02.200> just<00:03:02.380> there's<00:03:02.920> ones<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.280> come<00:03:03.430> standard

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
are just there's ones that come standard

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.880 
are just there's ones that come standard
a<00:03:03.850> huge<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:05.019> as<00:03:05.109> you<00:03:05.230> can<00:03:05.350> see<00:03:05.380> we've<00:03:05.680> built

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
a huge and as you can see we've built

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.780 
a huge and as you can see we've built
this<00:03:06.040> forward<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:07.630> out<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.799> yeah<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.579> that

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
this forward and out so yeah and that

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.340 
this forward and out so yeah and that
angle<00:03:10.359> you<00:03:10.390> can<00:03:10.630> see<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.870> they're<00:03:11.109> quite

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
angle you can see that they're quite

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.229 
angle you can see that they're quite
considerably<00:03:11.950> wider<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.549> forward<00:03:13.030> of<00:03:13.180> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
considerably wider and forward of the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.390 
considerably wider and forward of the
standard<00:03:13.989> position<00:03:14.140> we're<00:03:14.980> feeling<00:03:15.280> we're

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
standard position we're feeling we're

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.849 
standard position we're feeling we're
getting<00:03:15.609> no<00:03:15.730> nose<00:03:16.540> overs<00:03:16.900> even<00:03:17.170> on<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.410> even

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
getting no nose overs even on the even

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.440 
getting no nose overs even on the even
on<00:03:17.950> really<00:03:18.310> good<00:03:18.820> landings<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.299> we're

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
on really good landings that we're

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.900 
on really good landings that we're
getting<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:21.130> very<00:03:21.459> little<00:03:21.609> stability

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
getting so and very little stability

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.560 
getting so and very little stability
when<00:03:22.480> going<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.109> take<00:03:23.260> off<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.760> bf's<00:03:25.120> 92<00:03:25.450> head

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
when going to take off the bf's 92 head

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.720 
when going to take off the bf's 92 head
some<00:03:25.720> talk<00:03:25.900> growing<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.709> can<00:03:26.950> justify<00:03:27.549> that

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
some talk growing and I can justify that

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.210 
some talk growing and I can justify that
it<00:03:28.239> certainly<00:03:28.540> does<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.049> we<00:03:29.859> were<00:03:29.950> finding

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
it certainly does and we were finding

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.699 
it certainly does and we were finding
that<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.640> narrow<00:03:30.900> standard<00:03:31.900> sense<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.560> the

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
that the narrow standard sense of the

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.690 
that the narrow standard sense of the
wheels<00:03:33.220> were<00:03:33.400> just<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:34.930> trouble<00:03:35.700> what

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
wheels were just just a trouble what

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.430 
wheels were just just a trouble what
else<00:03:36.880> are<00:03:36.940> we<00:03:37.000> done<00:03:37.209> there<00:03:37.239> go<00:03:38.049> but<00:03:38.260> we're

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
else are we done there go but we're

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.949 
else are we done there go but we're
planning<00:03:39.100> on<00:03:39.269> trying<00:03:40.269> to<00:03:40.420> help<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.720> torque

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
planning on trying to help the torque

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.809 
planning on trying to help the torque
roll<00:03:41.200> particularly<00:03:41.709> not<00:03:41.920> not<00:03:42.250> as<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.579> plane

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
roll particularly not not as the plane

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.479 
roll particularly not not as the plane
is<00:03:43.030> actually<00:03:43.329> taxing<00:03:43.840> but<00:03:44.079> once<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.799> listen<00:03:45.340> to

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
is actually taxing but once it listen to

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.090 
is actually taxing but once it listen to
the<00:03:45.640> year<00:03:45.850> they<00:03:46.090> usually<00:03:46.540> hook<00:03:46.780> hook<00:03:47.620> over<00:03:47.829> to

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
the year they usually hook hook over to

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.410 
the year they usually hook hook over to
the<00:03:48.190> left<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.459> little<00:03:48.579> bit<00:03:48.790> so<00:03:49.000> we're<00:03:49.150> going<00:03:49.269> to

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
the left a little bit so we're going to

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.170 
the left a little bit so we're going to
try<00:03:49.600> an<00:03:49.750> experiment<00:03:50.319> by<00:03:50.470> putting<00:03:50.829> a<00:03:50.980> plane<00:03:51.880> I

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
try an experiment by putting a plane I

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.809 
try an experiment by putting a plane I
row<00:03:52.750> in<00:03:53.079> it<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.650> actually<00:03:53.859> automatically

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
row in it to actually automatically

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.930 
row in it to actually automatically
bring<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.329> back<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:56.410> has<00:03:56.560> business

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
bring that back it has business

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.250 
bring that back it has business
experiment<00:03:57.940> as<00:03:58.060> plugger<00:03:58.299> there<00:03:58.480> no<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.959> wasn't

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
experiment as plugger there no it wasn't

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.289 
experiment as plugger there no it wasn't
a<00:03:59.290> bigger<00:03:59.470> yeah<00:03:59.950> well<00:04:00.190> I<00:04:00.220> carry<00:04:00.940> on<00:04:01.090> with<00:04:01.209> the

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
a bigger yeah well I carry on with the

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.470 
a bigger yeah well I carry on with the
talking<00:04:01.629> we<00:04:02.470> found<00:04:02.739> that<00:04:03.099> just<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:04.000> standard

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
talking we found that just the standard

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.309 
talking we found that just the standard
connection

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
connection

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.869 
connection
here<00:04:05.560> in<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.799> rear<00:04:05.950> wing<00:04:06.189> was<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.640> was<00:04:06.730> not

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
here in the rear wing was it was not

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.629 
here in the rear wing was it was not
really<00:04:07.150> up<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.269> standard<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:08.799> as<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:09.430> can<00:04:09.489> see

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
really up to standard so as you can see

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.679 
really up to standard so as you can see
we've<00:04:09.760> got<00:04:09.879> some<00:04:09.999> extra<00:04:10.209> tape<00:04:10.450> but<00:04:10.599> I've

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
we've got some extra tape but I've

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.059 
we've got some extra tape but I've
actually<00:04:10.780> ended<00:04:11.109> up<00:04:11.260> gluing<00:04:11.650> them<00:04:11.739> near<00:04:11.980> as

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
actually ended up gluing them near as

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.770 
actually ended up gluing them near as
well<00:04:12.489> because<00:04:12.879> there<00:04:13.269> was<00:04:13.389> considerable

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
well because there was considerable

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.409 
well because there was considerable
movement<00:04:14.469> in<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.680> tail<00:04:14.939> and<00:04:15.939> we<00:04:16.060> were<00:04:16.150> finding

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
movement in the tail and we were finding

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.469 
movement in the tail and we were finding
that<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:17.199> was<00:04:17.350> pretty<00:04:17.500> sluggish<00:04:17.829> in<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.190> year

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
that it was pretty sluggish in the year

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.610 
that it was pretty sluggish in the year
so<00:04:19.479> yet<00:04:20.410> we<00:04:20.849> we<00:04:21.849> just<00:04:21.880> adjusted<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.720> a<00:04:22.750> bit<00:04:22.990> as

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
so yet we we just adjusted that a bit as

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.439 
so yet we we just adjusted that a bit as
you<00:04:23.830> can<00:04:23.949> see<00:04:24.160> we've<00:04:24.340> also<00:04:24.490> taken<00:04:24.820> off<00:04:25.150> what

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
you can see we've also taken off what

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.510 
you can see we've also taken off what
what<00:04:25.750> were<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:26.020> Ducks<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:26.710> don't<00:04:27.220> know<00:04:27.340> what

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
what were the Ducks I don't know what

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.490 
what were the Ducks I don't know what
they<00:04:27.699> are<00:04:28.120> cool<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.870> there<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.139> think<00:04:29.259> i<00:04:29.470> mighta

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
they are cool and there I think i mighta

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.230 
they are cool and there I think i mighta
me<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.860> radiate<00:04:30.310> Oh<00:04:30.340> ducks<00:04:30.669> maybe<00:04:30.970> for<00:04:31.210> the

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
me to radiate Oh ducks maybe for the

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.939 
me to radiate Oh ducks maybe for the
guns<00:04:31.509> in<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.900> original<00:04:32.110> model<00:04:32.620> in<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.830> real

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
guns in the original model in the real

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.379 
guns in the original model in the real
model<00:04:33.479> we're<00:04:34.479> finding<00:04:34.840> that<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:36.820> was<00:04:36.940> it<00:04:37.210> just

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
model we're finding that it was it just

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.999 
model we're finding that it was it just
didn't<00:04:37.630> look<00:04:37.660> streamlined<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:38.620> I've<00:04:38.770> taken

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
didn't look streamlined so I've taken

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.409 
didn't look streamlined so I've taken
those<00:04:39.280> off<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.669> just<00:04:39.759> replaced<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.240> with<00:04:40.300> a

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
those off and just replaced it with a

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.820 
those off and just replaced it with a
bit<00:04:40.539> of<00:04:40.630> silver<00:04:40.810> duct<00:04:41.080> tape<00:04:41.259> as<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.530> can<00:04:41.650> see

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
bit of silver duct tape as you can see

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.909 
bit of silver duct tape as you can see
there<00:04:43.199> okay<00:04:44.199> we're<00:04:44.349> almost<00:04:44.470> ready<00:04:44.650> together

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
there okay we're almost ready together

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.670 
there okay we're almost ready together
sorry<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.849> you<00:04:46.780> need<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:47.050> sort<00:04:47.229> of<00:04:47.289> hold<00:04:47.470> that

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
sorry and you need to sort of hold that

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.960 
sorry and you need to sort of hold that
still<00:04:47.949> if<00:04:48.039> you<00:04:48.070> can<00:04:48.220> hold<00:04:48.310> it<00:04:48.550> with<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.699> other

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
still if you can hold it with the other

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.040 
still if you can hold it with the other
arm<00:04:49.199> yeah<00:04:50.199> like<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:51.400> believe<00:04:51.759> there<00:04:52.750> we<00:04:52.870> go

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
arm yeah like so I believe there we go

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.870 
arm yeah like so I believe there we go
shows<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.860> can<00:04:53.949> see<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:54.220> didn't<00:04:54.430> take<00:04:54.550> much<00:04:54.669> to

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
shows you can see it didn't take much to

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.810 
shows you can see it didn't take much to
plug<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.090> in<00:04:57.990> there<00:04:58.990> you<00:04:59.110> go<00:04:59.310> as<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:00.460> can<00:05:00.580> see

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
plug that in there you go as you can see

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.159 
plug that in there you go as you can see
the<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.910> wiggling<00:05:04.210> of<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.449> jar<00:05:04.660> idea<00:05:04.960> in

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
the the wiggling of the jar idea in

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.580 
the the wiggling of the jar idea in
itself<00:05:05.500> creates<00:05:06.310> so<00:05:06.580> we<00:05:07.570> did<00:05:07.930> find<00:05:08.169> initially

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
itself creates so we did find initially

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.890 
itself creates so we did find initially
that<00:05:08.849> by<00:05:09.849> plugging<00:05:10.090> it<00:05:10.300> in<00:05:10.419> this<00:05:10.539> way<00:05:10.750> it

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
that by plugging it in this way it

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.050 
that by plugging it in this way it
actually<00:05:11.020> was<00:05:11.380> 180<00:05:11.919> degrees<00:05:12.159> out<00:05:12.340> so<00:05:12.639> in<00:05:12.820> fact

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
actually was 180 degrees out so in fact

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.330 
actually was 180 degrees out so in fact
it<00:05:13.240> was<00:05:13.389> making<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.960> problem<00:05:14.139> worse

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
it was making the problem worse

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.560 
it was making the problem worse
different<00:05:15.340> so<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:15.580> just<00:05:15.789> rotate<00:05:16.300> it<00:05:16.539> like

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
different so you just rotate it like

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.480 
different so you just rotate it like
givers<00:05:17.349> doing<00:05:17.590> there<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.039> upside<00:05:18.310> down

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
givers doing there to the upside down

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.689 
givers doing there to the upside down
position<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.199> reverses<00:05:21.039> the<00:05:21.159> gyros<00:05:21.550> are

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
position and that reverses the gyros are

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.520 
position and that reverses the gyros are
fixing<00:05:22.030> that<00:05:22.150> now<00:05:22.210> works<00:05:22.630> in<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.259> correct

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
fixing that now works in the correct

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.100 
fixing that now works in the correct
manner<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:25.000> ailerons<00:05:25.419> are<00:05:25.599> actually<00:05:25.900> working

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
manner the ailerons are actually working

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.890 
manner the ailerons are actually working
in<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:27.190> correct<00:05:27.490> direction<00:05:27.550> to<00:05:28.360> compensate

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
in the correct direction to compensate

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.120 
in the correct direction to compensate
for<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.169> movement<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:29.680> this<00:05:29.830> is<00:05:29.949> something

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
for the movement so this is something

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.680 
for the movement so this is something
that<00:05:30.370> we're<00:05:30.550> certain<00:05:30.880> experimenting<00:05:31.630> with

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
that we're certain experimenting with

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.920 
that we're certain experimenting with
yeah<00:05:32.259> it<00:05:33.130> might<00:05:33.370> even<00:05:33.550> tears<00:05:34.000> or<00:05:34.300> it<00:05:34.720> might<00:05:34.870> not

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
yeah it might even tears or it might not

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.960 
yeah it might even tears or it might not
an<00:05:35.259> really<00:05:35.470> helped<00:05:35.860> us<00:05:35.979> you<00:05:36.550> know<00:05:36.669> what<00:05:36.820> she

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
an really helped us you know what she

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.990 
an really helped us you know what she
gets<00:05:37.090> evil<00:05:37.479> and<00:05:38.430> always<00:05:39.430> into<00:05:39.639> experimental

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
gets evil and always into experimental

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.879 
gets evil and always into experimental
things<00:05:40.509> so<00:05:40.780> yeah<00:05:41.110> they're<00:05:41.380> quite<00:05:41.650> looking

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
things so yeah they're quite looking

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.219 
things so yeah they're quite looking
forward<00:05:41.949> to<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.250> actually<00:05:42.370> yep<00:05:43.090> it's<00:05:43.810> gained<00:05:44.110> a

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
forward to it actually yep it's gained a

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.230 
forward to it actually yep it's gained a
bit<00:05:44.320> of<00:05:44.409> weight<00:05:44.560> over<00:05:44.949> the<00:05:44.979> total<00:05:45.430> time<00:05:45.580> we've

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
bit of weight over the total time we've

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.589 
bit of weight over the total time we've
we've<00:05:46.750> added<00:05:46.930> nylon<00:05:47.770> 200<00:05:48.310> grams<00:05:48.580> but<00:05:48.909> with<00:05:49.449> the

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
we've added nylon 200 grams but with the

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.409 
we've added nylon 200 grams but with the
extra<00:05:49.870> horsepower<00:05:50.139> up<00:05:50.500> front<00:05:50.880> and<00:05:51.880> we<00:05:52.210> found

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
extra horsepower up front and we found

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.990 
extra horsepower up front and we found
there<00:05:53.199> was<00:05:53.259> a<00:05:53.320> real<00:05:53.590> limited<00:05:54.159> range<00:05:54.460> of<00:05:54.729> three

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
there was a real limited range of three

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.379 
there was a real limited range of three
prop<00:05:55.590> three<00:05:56.590> bladed<00:05:56.800> props<00:05:57.210> available<00:05:58.210> on<00:05:58.270> the

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
prop three bladed props available on the

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.140 
prop three bladed props available on the
market<00:05:58.419> so<00:05:59.050> we've<00:05:59.979> gone<00:06:00.159> to<00:06:00.310> that<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:00.639> it's

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
market so we've gone to that and it's

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.480 
market so we've gone to that and it's
just<00:06:01.479> paying<00:06:01.690> dividends<00:06:02.080> we<00:06:02.259> you<00:06:02.860> know<00:06:02.949> go<00:06:03.340> out

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
just paying dividends we you know go out

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.010 
just paying dividends we you know go out
and<00:06:03.610> fly<00:06:03.820> it<00:06:03.849> out<00:06:04.120> in<00:06:04.419> the<00:06:04.509> next<00:06:04.599> week<00:06:04.840> or<00:06:04.960> so

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
and fly it out in the next week or so

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.649 
and fly it out in the next week or so
and<00:06:05.320> I<00:06:05.530> don't<00:06:06.340> have<00:06:06.969> any<00:06:07.120> problem<00:06:07.509> and

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:07.659 
and I don't have any problem and

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.450 
and I don't have any problem and
thinking<00:06:07.900> that<00:06:07.990> we've<00:06:08.430> counteracted<00:06:09.430> the

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
thinking that we've counteracted the

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.710 
thinking that we've counteracted the
weight<00:06:09.699> with<00:06:09.909> more<00:06:10.090> grunt

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
weight with more grunt

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.480 
weight with more grunt
apart<00:06:12.720> from<00:06:12.900> that<00:06:12.990> we<00:06:13.770> were<00:06:13.800> hoping<00:06:14.040> to<00:06:14.310> get<00:06:14.430> a

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
apart from that we were hoping to get a

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.439 
apart from that we were hoping to get a
bit<00:06:14.669> more<00:06:14.820> lift<00:06:15.150> by<00:06:15.870> cutting<00:06:16.290> those<00:06:17.449> vehicle

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
bit more lift by cutting those vehicle

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.960 
bit more lift by cutting those vehicle
is<00:06:18.630> what<00:06:19.230> a<00:06:19.260> call<00:06:19.620> to<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.710> radiator<00:06:20.250> whatever

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
is what a call to the radiator whatever

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.640 
is what a call to the radiator whatever
you<00:06:21.090> whatever<00:06:21.270> you<00:06:21.510> want<00:06:21.660> to<00:06:21.750> call<00:06:22.080> on<00:06:22.320> the

normally<00:06:27.600> be<00:06:27.630> so<00:06:28.080> we're<00:06:28.260> expecting<00:06:28.470> a<00:06:28.979> little

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
normally be so we're expecting a little

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
bit more left from the wing so hopefully

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.250 
bit more left from the wing so hopefully
that<00:06:31.710> we're<00:06:31.860> going<00:06:32.010> to<00:06:32.070> compensate<00:06:32.370> the<00:06:33.260> 200

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
that we're going to compensate the 200

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.140 
that we're going to compensate the 200
grams<00:06:34.590> that<00:06:34.919> we've<00:06:35.070> added<00:06:35.190> to<00:06:35.550> it<00:06:35.669> as<00:06:35.790> you<00:06:35.910> see

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
grams that we've added to it as you see

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.180 
grams that we've added to it as you see
the<00:06:36.840> year<00:06:37.020> duct<00:06:37.260> used<00:06:37.410> to<00:06:37.470> be<00:06:37.560> here<00:06:37.680> is<00:06:37.830> proud

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
the year duct used to be here is proud

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.040 
the year duct used to be here is proud
perhaps<00:06:38.550> seven<00:06:38.850> millimeters<00:06:39.479> and<00:06:39.630> then<00:06:39.840> went

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
perhaps seven millimeters and then went

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.500 
perhaps seven millimeters and then went
down<00:06:40.290> if<00:06:40.740> you<00:06:41.070> soared<00:06:41.550> through<00:06:41.669> the<00:06:42.000> wing<00:06:42.240> the

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
down if you soared through the wing the

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.290 
down if you soared through the wing the
cross<00:06:42.960> section<00:06:43.440> with<00:06:44.280> their<00:06:44.520> in<00:06:44.669> place<00:06:44.970> was

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
cross section with their in place was

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.930 
cross section with their in place was
what<00:06:45.479> was<00:06:45.690> not<00:06:45.870> reading<00:06:46.200> one<00:06:46.820> that<00:06:47.820> you'd

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
what was not reading one that you'd

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.969 
what was not reading one that you'd
expect<00:06:48.330> the<00:06:48.450> wing<00:06:48.600> to<00:06:48.780> be<00:06:48.960> and<00:06:49.169> probably<00:06:49.590> isn't

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
expect the wing to be and probably isn't

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.370 
expect the wing to be and probably isn't
very<00:06:50.010> lift<00:06:50.479> inducing<00:06:51.479> so<00:06:51.780> by<00:06:51.930> cutting<00:06:52.110> them

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
very lift inducing so by cutting them

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.600 
very lift inducing so by cutting them
off<00:06:52.500> we're<00:06:52.740> hoping<00:06:52.860> to<00:06:52.979> increase<00:06:53.160> left

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
off we're hoping to increase left

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.590 
off we're hoping to increase left
compensate<00:06:54.570> for<00:06:54.720> the<00:06:54.810> 200<00:06:55.169> grams<00:06:55.380> apart<00:06:55.710> yeah

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
compensate for the 200 grams apart yeah

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.300 
compensate for the 200 grams apart yeah
and<00:06:57.600> also<00:06:57.840> with<00:06:58.200> the<00:06:58.320> smaller<00:06:58.860> wing<00:06:59.100> the

00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.310 
and also with the smaller wing the

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.710 
and also with the smaller wing the
wheels<00:06:59.430> as<00:06:59.729> well<00:06:59.760> we're<00:07:00.060> expecting<00:07:00.510> a<00:07:00.570> little

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
wheels as well we're expecting a little

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.190 
wheels as well we're expecting a little
better<00:07:01.410> aerodynamics<00:07:02.130> I<00:07:02.660> can't<00:07:03.660> I<00:07:03.780> can't<00:07:03.840> get

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.200 
better aerodynamics I can't I can't get

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.659 
better aerodynamics I can't I can't get
over<00:07:04.229> how<00:07:04.530> big<00:07:04.740> the<00:07:04.889> original<00:07:05.280> wheels<00:07:05.460> I

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
over how big the original wheels I

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.190 
over how big the original wheels I
wouldn't<00:07:06.360> be<00:07:06.419> kidding<00:07:06.660> and<00:07:06.780> saying<00:07:07.020> that

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 
wouldn't be kidding and saying that

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.290 
wouldn't be kidding and saying that
these<00:07:07.530> are<00:07:07.710> half<00:07:07.919> the<00:07:07.950> size<00:07:08.310> of<00:07:08.760> the<00:07:08.880> originals

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
these are half the size of the originals

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.930 
these are half the size of the originals
yeah<00:07:09.800> out<00:07:10.800> of<00:07:10.860> the<00:07:11.039> box<00:07:11.280> you<00:07:11.400> did<00:07:11.580> have<00:07:11.699> a<00:07:11.729> few

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 
yeah out of the box you did have a few

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.550 
yeah out of the box you did have a few
problems<00:07:12.180> the<00:07:12.360> seams<00:07:12.600> of<00:07:12.690> gravity<00:07:13.050> was<00:07:13.169> miles

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
problems the seams of gravity was miles

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.560 
problems the seams of gravity was miles
out<00:07:13.860> as<00:07:14.370> you<00:07:14.490> can<00:07:14.580> see<00:07:14.760> over<00:07:14.970> here<00:07:15.000> goobers<00:07:15.389> got

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
out as you can see over here goobers got

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.520 
out as you can see over here goobers got
the<00:07:16.039> the<00:07:17.039> Packers<00:07:17.340> own<00:07:17.460> p-51<00:07:18.300> and<00:07:18.810> basically

the the Packers own p-51 and basically

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.110 
the the Packers own p-51 and basically
out<00:07:19.710> of<00:07:19.740> the<00:07:19.889> box<00:07:20.070> that<00:07:20.250> just<00:07:20.520> got<00:07:20.669> up<00:07:20.789> and

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
out of the box that just got up and

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.890 
out of the box that just got up and
float<00:07:21.750> you<00:07:22.110> know<00:07:22.229> very<00:07:22.650> very<00:07:22.740> well<00:07:23.900> sullenly

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
float you know very very well sullenly

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.930 
float you know very very well sullenly
we<00:07:25.200> sort<00:07:25.440> of<00:07:25.500> accepted<00:07:26.010> it<00:07:26.400> will<00:07:26.550> expect<00:07:26.849> to

we sort of accepted it will expect to

we sort of accepted it will expect to
destiny<00:07:27.330> the<00:07:27.450> same<00:07:27.660> and<00:07:27.810> ran<00:07:27.900> into<00:07:28.050> a<00:07:28.200> few

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 
destiny the same and ran into a few

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.040 
destiny the same and ran into a few
issues<00:07:28.820> other<00:07:29.820> than<00:07:29.940> that<00:07:30.240> the<00:07:30.539> cabling<00:07:30.900> in

issues other than that the cabling in

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.930 
issues other than that the cabling in
here<00:07:31.260> was<00:07:31.410> all<00:07:31.590> jammed<00:07:32.250> up<00:07:32.370> which<00:07:32.610> was<00:07:32.760> a<00:07:32.789> bit

of<00:07:33.030> shame<00:07:33.270> so<00:07:33.479> we<00:07:33.570> had<00:07:33.720> to<00:07:33.900> find<00:07:34.830> a<00:07:34.950> way<00:07:34.979> of

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.220 
of shame so we had to find a way of

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.920 
of shame so we had to find a way of
loosening<00:07:35.580> the<00:07:35.760> the<00:07:36.150> artist<00:07:36.539> so<00:07:36.660> it<00:07:36.750> works

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930 
loosening the the artist so it works
