gameplay you're probably going to see at

not<00:01:36.640> as<00:01:36.790> high<00:01:36.910> as<00:01:37.060> 20<00:01:37.390> or<00:01:37.479> 30<00:01:37.720> thanks<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.500> the

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
not as high as 20 or 30 thanks to the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.810 
not as high as 20 or 30 thanks to the
fact<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.830> you<00:01:38.950> spend<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.250> lot<00:01:39.399> of<00:01:39.430> time<00:01:39.550> being

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
fact that you spend a lot of time being

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.639 
fact that you spend a lot of time being
crouched<00:01:40.180> in<00:01:40.420> doors<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:41.110> not<00:01:41.170> actually

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
crouched in doors and not actually

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.410 
crouched in doors and not actually
actively<00:01:41.950> running<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:42.850> it's<00:01:43.090> going<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.300> be<00:01:43.390> a

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
actively running so it's going to be a

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.910 
actively running so it's going to be a
lot<00:01:43.539> better<00:01:43.720> than<00:01:43.959> that<00:01:44.050> normally<00:01:44.500> but<00:01:44.770> once

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
lot better than that normally but once

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.260 
lot better than that normally but once
you<00:01:45.009> start<00:01:45.069> fighting<00:01:45.459> a<00:01:45.520> bunch<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.789> guards<00:01:45.970> or

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
you start fighting a bunch of guards or

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.090 
you start fighting a bunch of guards or
run<00:01:46.720> through<00:01:46.899> the<00:01:46.990> city<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.380> will<00:01:47.590> notice<00:01:47.890> the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
run through the city you will notice the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.440 
run through the city you will notice the
frames<00:01:48.310> per<00:01:48.459> second<00:01:48.789> take<00:01:48.910> a<00:01:48.940> bit<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.119> a<00:01:49.240> dive

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
frames per second take a bit of a dive

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.300 
frames per second take a bit of a dive
now<00:01:50.080> as<00:01:50.200> far<00:01:50.319> as<00:01:50.440> actual<00:01:50.800> gameplay<00:01:51.069> is

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
now as far as actual gameplay is

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.770 
now as far as actual gameplay is
concerned<00:01:51.700> thief<00:01:51.970> has<00:01:52.149> been<00:01:52.300> somewhat<00:01:52.569> of<00:01:52.630> a

mixed bag for me there are some things
that<00:01:54.580> are<00:01:54.670> really<00:01:54.910> like<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.450> there's<00:01:55.569> a<00:01:55.630> lot

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
that are really like and there's a lot

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.719 
that are really like and there's a lot
of<00:01:55.840> good<00:01:56.020> groundwork<00:01:56.440> to<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.860> but<00:01:57.369> at<00:01:57.459> the<00:01:57.550> same

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
of good groundwork to it but at the same

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.919 
of good groundwork to it but at the same
time<00:01:57.910> there's<00:01:58.149> some<00:01:58.300> things<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:58.569> really

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
bother me some of which are subjective

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.699 
bother me some of which are subjective
and<00:02:00.910> may<00:02:00.970> not<00:02:01.000> matter<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.660> but<00:02:02.289> some<00:02:02.649> of

and may not matter to you but some of

and may not matter to you but some of
which<00:02:02.800> are<00:02:02.920> also<00:02:03.069> really<00:02:03.429> objective<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:04.450> to

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
which are also really objective so to

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:05.550 
which are also really objective so to
begin<00:02:04.600> with<00:02:04.750> let's<00:02:05.050> look<00:02:05.140> at<00:02:05.259> some<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.440> the

begin with let's look at some of the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.900 
begin with let's look at some of the
good<00:02:05.709> things<00:02:05.740> specifically<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.670> core

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
good things specifically the core

previous series but some of them are new
as<00:02:11.319> well<00:02:11.349> in<00:02:11.650> terms<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:11.950> how<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.130> avoid<00:02:12.640> and

reduce visibility fire arrows that can

aspect<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:53.000> have<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.120> bit<00:02:53.240> of<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.390> problem<00:02:53.630> with

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
aspect I have a bit of a problem with

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.540 
aspect I have a bit of a problem with
and<00:02:54.110> that's<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.560> fact<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:54.830> once<00:02:55.130> your<00:02:55.220> MP

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
and that's the fact that once your MP

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.700 
and that's the fact that once your MP
runs<00:02:55.760> out<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.480> can<00:02:56.510> still<00:02:56.870> tap<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.410> focus

button to do a little blank and it still

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.730

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
highlights objects you can use which

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.770

makes<00:03:00.950> finding<00:03:01.220> hidden<00:03:01.490> switch<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:01.970> really

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
makes finding hidden switch is really

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.000 
makes finding hidden switch is really
easy<00:03:02.990> in<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.350> game<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.620> almost<00:03:03.770> really

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
easy in the game it almost really

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.560 
easy in the game it almost really
defeats<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.400> purpose<00:03:04.550> of<00:03:04.850> hidden<00:03:05.210> switches

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570

engaging now some aspects do feel a bit

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.770 
engaging now some aspects do feel a bit
easy<00:03:52.430> at<00:03:52.580> first<00:03:52.610> for<00:03:53.000> instance<00:03:53.270> lock<00:03:53.510> picking

easy at first for instance lock picking
but<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.410> is<00:03:54.470> mainly<00:03:54.620> due<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.980> fact<00:03:55.100> that

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
but this is mainly due to the fact that

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.680 
but this is mainly due to the fact that
didn't<00:03:55.459> want<00:03:55.670> lock-picking<00:03:56.120> itself<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.600> be

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.509 
didn't want lock-picking itself to be
hard<00:03:57.019> but<00:03:57.260> instead<00:03:57.590> just<00:03:57.860> something<00:03:58.370> that

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
hard but instead just something that

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.190 
hard but instead just something that
takes<00:03:58.700> time<00:03:59.030> so<00:03:59.330> that<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.480> guard<00:03:59.660> might<00:03:59.900> notice

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200

the sense that there are multiple paths

depending on who you are this may or may

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
not bother you for instance if you're a

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.420 
not bother you for instance if you're a
fan<00:05:42.020> of<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.230> older<00:05:42.440> games<00:05:42.620> you're<00:05:43.280> probably

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
fan of the older games you're probably

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.620 
fan of the older games you're probably
going<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:43.670> be<00:05:43.760> angry<00:05:44.030> because<00:05:44.180> those<00:05:44.450> had<00:05:44.600> a

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
going to be angry because those had a

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.960 
going to be angry because those had a
very<00:05:44.840> big<00:05:45.050> emphasis<00:05:45.530> on<00:05:45.770> open<00:05:46.160> areas<00:05:46.550> whereas

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
very big emphasis on open areas whereas

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.210 
very big emphasis on open areas whereas
this<00:05:47.120> is<00:05:47.390> basically<00:05:47.810> just<00:05:47.930> path<00:05:48.470> a<00:05:48.680> or<00:05:48.830> path<00:05:49.010> B

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
this is basically just path a or path B

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.950 
this is basically just path a or path B
now<00:05:49.550> while<00:05:49.790> those<00:05:49.940> last<00:05:50.150> two<00:05:50.390> may<00:05:50.660> not<00:05:50.810> matter

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
now while those last two may not matter

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.960 
now while those last two may not matter
to<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.230> the<00:05:51.380> last<00:05:51.530> point<00:05:51.950> is<00:05:52.130> definitely<00:05:52.790> just

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
to you the last point is definitely just

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.790 
to you the last point is definitely just
one<00:05:53.210> objectively<00:05:53.930> bad<00:05:54.140> thing<00:05:54.380> about<00:05:54.470> the<00:05:54.650> game

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
one objectively bad thing about the game

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.620 
one objectively bad thing about the game
that<00:05:54.830> just<00:05:55.130> really<00:05:55.580> negatively<00:05:56.120> affects<00:05:56.450> it

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
that just really negatively affects it

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.600 
that just really negatively affects it
and<00:05:56.810> that's<00:05:57.140> the<00:05:57.320> enemy<00:05:57.470> AI<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:58.340> the<00:05:58.400> fact

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
and that's the enemy AI and the fact

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.950 
and that's the enemy AI and the fact
that<00:05:58.700> they<00:05:58.850> just<00:05:59.000> don't<00:05:59.210> notice<00:05:59.720> or<00:05:59.900> care

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
that they just don't notice or care

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.290 
that they just don't notice or care
about<00:06:00.380> anything<00:06:01.010> you<00:06:01.670> can<00:06:01.700> pretty<00:06:01.970> much<00:06:02.060> just

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
about anything you can pretty much just

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.180 
about anything you can pretty much just
be<00:06:02.480> crouching<00:06:02.780> in<00:06:03.050> the<00:06:03.170> shadows<00:06:03.560> and<00:06:03.800> you're

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
be crouching in the shadows and you're

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.890 
be crouching in the shadows and you're
invisible<00:06:04.400> even<00:06:04.790> if<00:06:05.060> the<00:06:05.150> guard<00:06:05.330> is<00:06:05.480> only<00:06:05.600> four

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
invisible even if the guard is only four

invisible even if the guard is only four

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
feet away and staring right at you

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.340 
feet away and staring right at you
doesn't<00:06:07.700> matter<00:06:07.790> you're<00:06:08.210> in<00:06:08.300> the<00:06:08.360> shadows<00:06:08.660> no

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
doesn't matter you're in the shadows no

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.750 
doesn't matter you're in the shadows no
one<00:06:09.440> can<00:06:09.560> see<00:06:09.680> you<00:06:09.770> on<00:06:09.980> top<00:06:10.220> of<00:06:10.280> that<00:06:10.490> they<00:06:10.610> just

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
one can see you on top of that they just

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.010 
one can see you on top of that they just
seem<00:06:10.910> to<00:06:11.030> forget<00:06:11.270> about<00:06:11.360> your<00:06:11.570> existence

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
seem to forget about your existence

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.140 
seem to forget about your existence
really<00:06:12.380> quickly<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:12.950> not<00:06:13.100> care<00:06:13.520> for<00:06:13.790> instance

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
really quickly and not care for instance

really quickly and not care for instance
my<00:06:14.270> favorite<00:06:14.720> example<00:06:15.080> of<00:06:15.170> this<00:06:15.290> is<00:06:15.530> on<00:06:15.710> a

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
my favorite example of this is on a

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.530 
my favorite example of this is on a
mission<00:06:15.920> where<00:06:16.250> I<00:06:16.280> opened<00:06:16.850> a<00:06:16.880> door<00:06:17.090> and<00:06:17.300> snuck

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
mission where I opened a door and snuck

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.720 
mission where I opened a door and snuck
in<00:06:17.720> left<00:06:18.290> the<00:06:18.380> door<00:06:18.500> open<00:06:18.530> guards<00:06:19.190> noticed<00:06:19.550> and

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.730 
in left the door open guards noticed and

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.860 
in left the door open guards noticed and
they<00:06:19.850> were<00:06:19.940> alerted<00:06:20.210> which<00:06:20.510> makes<00:06:20.750> sense

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
they were alerted which makes sense

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.930 
they were alerted which makes sense
that's<00:06:21.200> how<00:06:21.290> a<00:06:21.320> stealth<00:06:21.590> game<00:06:21.620> works<00:06:21.980> but<00:06:22.820> then

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
that's how a stealth game works but then

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.160 
that's how a stealth game works but then
I<00:06:23.000> closed<00:06:23.300> that<00:06:23.420> door<00:06:23.690> while<00:06:23.960> they<00:06:24.080> were

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.170 
I closed that door while they were

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.260 
I closed that door while they were
staring<00:06:24.500> directly<00:06:24.590> at<00:06:24.860> it<00:06:24.980> and<00:06:25.220> no<00:06:25.880> one<00:06:26.030> cared

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270

just brings the whole experience down

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.640 
just brings the whole experience down
because<00:06:42.020> you<00:06:42.140> don't<00:06:42.290> really<00:06:42.440> feel<00:06:42.620> like
