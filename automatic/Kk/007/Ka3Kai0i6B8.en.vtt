00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.620
 It would be time to remove him because a man 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.500

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.810
 throw something up in the garage on 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.530
 In the morning, lay down the new balconies and 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.370

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.590
 so here is such a knife for a long, long 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.200
 years nobody used 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.649
 I took the lead paper to see errors 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.649

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.740
 interesting or something not that kind of it 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.750
 To this invention health men here 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.240

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.960

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.640
 same painted then opened to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.770
 yes of course they wore this knife on 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.180
 keys like this than I am certain I am not 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.700

 all of a sudden where did he get this knife from 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:06.670
 I know but I wear this made by hand made 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:09.510

 here is such a one and only 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.480
 interesting German memory acceptance that one 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.930
 what 2 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.570
 and grandfather stayed here for a long time from a friend 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.750
 and presented that here is such an interesting one 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.840
 legs of course scratched often drove 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.680
 some bread sausage ate 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.060
 then he got me 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.100
 that means we don't know what the legs will be 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.890
 tell me flattering what is 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.370
 interesting interesting it stops 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.120
 there will be a reset here 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.930
 bracket if on camera it is visible above 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.930
 andrey face and 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.860
 so as you know, let's still stuck and 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.170
 I will show that there is a knife like this 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.340
 cling to school skirt sleep telly 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.600
 so here it opens that is 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.670
 moves away and immediately 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.360
 for them i went to fuck there this spring 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.080
 central means that's it 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.720
 by saying 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.720
 100 pairs relegated here this one thing 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:25.600
 Here I am surrounded by this university 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.610
 These are not published here. 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.310
 correctly call here our homemade 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.970
 Basically few 9 secluded gardens such 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.070
 constructions found something proper 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.290
 saying here are such 2 1 man 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.150
 rare to some extent in principle 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.930
 This knife is also created by this reptile on 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.810
 80 here that is it is not modern not even 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.210
 the knife of the 90s what is it that this old 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.760
 still found soviet times soviet times and 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.610
 hastily 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:02.890
 knife show how to embed 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:06.220
 take a piece of paper just too 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:11.400
 on paper not a badger cuts perfectly like 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.400
 well corrected objects for translation 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.080
 koss has heated up on this 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.870
 such here is a vi 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.790
 for I have somewhere else there were many 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.220
 Many Soviet on the same I certainly would like 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.600
 quickness find all recover and even 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.060
 to some extent probably me 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.800
 interested in privatizing those knives from 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.420

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.130
 look your cool these knives to 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.420

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.130
 cool patrol knives would be very 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.140
 see them interesting to see but 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.250
 of course she was logical was pure 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.930
 self-made knives and now you will find them 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.000
