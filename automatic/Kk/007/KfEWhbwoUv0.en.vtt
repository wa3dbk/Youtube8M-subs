different individual sounds and you know
typically<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.340> record<00:00:26.700> drums<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.210> use

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
between 10 and 14 microphones just on

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.840 
between 10 and 14 microphones just on
the<00:00:30.750> drum<00:00:30.990> kit<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.560> you're<00:00:32.190> dealing<00:00:32.640> with<00:00:32.669> a

the drum kit so you're dealing with a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.360 
the drum kit so you're dealing with a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
lot of complex relationships between the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.189 
lot of complex relationships between the
mics<00:00:35.610> phase<00:00:36.000> relationships<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:38.210> it's<00:00:39.210> it's

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
mics phase relationships and it's it's

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.900 
mics phase relationships and it's it's
one<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.830> more<00:00:40.949> challenging<00:00:41.010> things<00:00:41.730> it's

recording I had done before and really

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.520 
recording I had done before and really
using<00:00:53.930> using<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.140> room<00:00:55.409> to<00:00:56.510> achieve<00:00:57.530> certain

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
using using the room to achieve certain

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.219 
using using the room to achieve certain
sound<00:00:58.769> certain<00:00:59.040> quality<00:00:59.519> of<00:00:59.640> sounds<00:01:00.089> I<00:01:00.239> think

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
sound certain quality of sounds I think

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.149 
sound certain quality of sounds I think
that<00:01:01.920> being<00:01:02.400> able<00:01:03.150> to<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:04.049> hear<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
that being able to to hear the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.440 
that being able to to hear the
difference<00:01:05.489> between<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> different<00:01:06.180> sounds

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
difference between the different sounds

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.710 
difference between the different sounds
is<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.780> something<00:01:07.320> that's<00:01:07.440> learnable<00:01:08.090> I<00:01:09.090> think

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
is is something that's learnable I think

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.130 
is is something that's learnable I think
a<00:01:09.960> lot<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.530> comes<00:01:10.680> down<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.070> personal<00:01:11.280> taste

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140
