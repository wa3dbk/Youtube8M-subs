00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.150
 meet those who have a beautiful 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.960
 and expensive car 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.160
 do not believe these people mac pro sample 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.009
 2013 will produce indelible 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.470
 impression on any person though 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.359
 a little bit of the computer world 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.510
 Technologies you are watching the first part 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.210
 review mac pro 2013 on japanese dr

 . ru at the microphone Ilya Cossacks and in this 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.140
 video we will carefully evaluate the appearance 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.420
 This computer will talk about available 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.040
 configuration interfaces and other 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.040
 interesting things we start 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.750
 the theater begins with a hanger 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.519
 iphone with activation a mac pro with big 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.149
 black box in which besides the very 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.879
 mac pro 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.979
 there is a power cable a set of instructions 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.290
 and two stickers with apples 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:58.229
 which are typical for any apple technique 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.510
 they are distinguished by their color they are black which is pretty 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.420
 unusual and unusual proper 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.739
 so they caught our attention 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.840
 configuration of the computer arrived to 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.539
 us on the test next 6 nuclear 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.060
 intel zeon e5 processor with clock 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.130
 frequency of 3 and a half gigahertz and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.550
 twelve megabytes of third cache 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.259
 level 16 gigabyte fast operational 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:26.069
 ddr3 memory operating at 1 1866 frequency 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.640
 megahertz volume ssd drive 256 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.450

 two video cards mdf fair for d500 with three 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.450
 gddr5 gigabytes of memory each module 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.340
 Wi-Fi standard and SIM and bluetooth 4 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.440
 version of the word computer is far from 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.110
 simple its computing power 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.209
 enough for simultaneous connection 6 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.160
 Thunderbolt monitors and output 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.280
 images on them and you will agree 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.920
 more than impressive however 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.050
 impressive appearance of the computer besides 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.640
 the fact that in a small building engineers and 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.289
 apple designers could fit 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.690
 incredibly powerful stuffing 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.030
 they also managed to make an appearance 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.099
 computers are incredibly attractive and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.500
 original as opposed to system 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.869
 blocks similar to a big black box 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.030
 mac pro pleases the eye of cylindrical 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.290
 form with no sharp corners and 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.110
 extra buttons 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.849
 holes and other visual debris in 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.129
 quality of the material used in 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.680
 making the case was used 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.410
 aluminum, but even though this is a new 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.420
 mac pro weighs very much even five 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.330
 kilos in height all this magnificence 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.450
 stretches out on your desktop by 25 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.250
 centimeters that for the system unit 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.200
 incredibly little difficult to say which one 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.510
 side is the interface connectors 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.459
 Considering the round shape of the mac pro case 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.769
 I suggest to agree on the fact that the connectors 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.060
 according to tradition they will be back and so and back 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.280
 that's what's the very top of 2 3 and a half miles 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.310
 right connectors 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.709
 audio devices just below 4 ports and us by 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.810
 30 followed by six ports 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.980
 thunderbolt 2 to connect 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.840
 peripheral devices 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.630
 such as monitors or external 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.640
 Drives are even lower than 2 gigabit 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.190
 ethernet is also on the back of the case 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.300
 there was a place for just one 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.050
 port hdmi 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.650
 version 1.4 power buttons and connectors 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.870
 power supply 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.510
 note that each connector group 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.610
 has a white frame curious about what apple 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.470
 as in all its products in mac pro 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.540
 paid a lot of attention to detail 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.819
 for example when you turn the body 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.620
 computer connectors to itself is a frame 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.019
 automatically highlighted 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.269
 LEDs in the case for you to be 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.970
 easier to connect peripheral devices 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.730
 as they say a trifle but very pleasant 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.769
 little thing we love apple too 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.540
 there was a place behind and a slider which 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.110
 blocks the removal of the upper part of the body 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.340
 which covers the most beautiful and 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.530
 technologically advanced part of the new 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.480
 computer its insides worth 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.910
 note that the cover is removed 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.970
 very simple we just move 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.280
 slider and pull the cover up no 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.290
 There will be no difficulties with this 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.269
 little wonder usually 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.359
 spin the computer case is required 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.890
 time and a screwdriver here is just like that 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.750
 without any difficulty 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.640
 you can add or subtract 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.680
 operational memory on twitter 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.380
 appleinsider underscore room and thrown 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.419
 cry from cais tagged Aida mac pro that 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.979
 What are you interested to learn about the new product? 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.229
 so at the end of this video 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.200
 I propose to voice a few questions 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.960
 our readers and answers are helpful 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.669
 or mac pro thing in general why about this 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.380
 we'll talk in the next video where 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.169
 we test directly 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.060
 computer power 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.100
 plastic or aluminum is used in 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.940
 housing cover as its steel case 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.340
 in the lid 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.410
 used aluminum 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.750
 and this is also cool to our readers 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.910
 very interesting to see the port lighting 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.910
 in the dark well let's see again 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:55.379
 we found the proposal interesting 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:59.629
 compare the sizes of mac pro with ipad and 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.629
 other things here please 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.150
 computer startup time also 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.520
 worried our followers on twitter 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.120
 according to our measurements almost pure 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.999
 system 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.729
 from the fully off state 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:31.330
 loaded for 14 point 90 one hundredth 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.340
 seconds 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.039
 quite to yourself quickly and on this we are with you 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.289
 say goodbye leave your questions ideas and 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.330
 just impressions about the new magician samples 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.840
 comments subscribe to new 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.419
 video 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.740
 and very soon we will return to this miracle 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.300
 keg and talk about it 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.300
 performance bye bye
