00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:11.470
 It is now the best fishing pattern but it is now 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.320
 This time, this is about me 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:19.460
 I would like to explain 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.950
 To this is another fundamental roughly This is even though I know things 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.910
 It has become to say only wind throwing 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:32.500
 In the place of the individual lip 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:35.950
 I feel like it's selling like a shaft that hits the water flow Well nowadays everyone well 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.730
 I think that it is good if you think that this is a weak lure 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.829
 I will 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.750
 And say whether and when to use in 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.750
 And get to introduce in the Tteyuu what if the lure of good a 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.860
 If it says in color, it is almost after 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:56.180
 When Ano spawning Tteyuu after the bus has finished 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:01:00.620
 Now blue blue blue blue throwing a patch of even Nabae date in Lake Biwa 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.750
 It feels like it's coming from below Well I'm just throwing it all and winding it 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.450
 Roughly ask to match the height of the floating level is or asked to decide the army of weight 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.940
 3/8 Press Toka say such a place I will think good kana best 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.890
 so 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.310
 It's a trailer I'm using here It's a two-stage pintail when it comes to a trailer 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.030
 Say this 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:26.590
 Has come out from Fish Arrow still say I flash j + Gee 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:30.500

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.850
 Kedomo I know this series Tteyuu Chez Ricky Fish 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.340
 Well that's not too famous though 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:46.469
 It's like an American bass professional made it 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.270
 It's a jig, so I think there is no trust. Two dark colors. Such colors are attached. 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.409
 is 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:57.820
 Anything I think that good but I do not apart from particular also sticking say in color 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:02:01.479
 Oh yeah this was the color of the name 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.690
 Please try it Well recommended for beginners 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.170
 I 'm just throwing it back and winding it, but I think it is recommended 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.170
 You wish
