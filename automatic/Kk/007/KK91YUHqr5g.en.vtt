 Victor Galeano who will arrive with the blood 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.180

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.550
 championship currently many have 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.440
 speculated about the diego mount

 Dominguez who marches third in the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.760

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.879
 improve the performance of the car 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.500
 looking askance at the next race with 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.100
 the same intentions and in the same

 team 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.080

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:52.100
 the disappointment in the previous race 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.659
 Alejandro Galanti who in this 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.449
 big opportunity is toyota corolla 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.180
 super2000 will seek to recover ground after 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.010
 its abandonment in caguas and in that way 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.510
 get back into the conversation in 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.760
 a bid that does not allow the minimum error 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.980
 that bid that now keeps him with 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.750
 Alberto Antebi in particular for the 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.670

 fully at the tip of class n4 a 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.700
 new triumph would make the pilot of 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.619
 falling down is closer to the title and 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.780
 arrive in unbeatable conditions for 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.940
 the chaco a good start that has marked 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.440
 interesting times in Caaguazú has 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.600
 lost a lot of ground with that 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.970

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.610
 even in the class carlos cortázar has 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.259
 had a regular performance although its 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.420
 caaguazú neglect has deprived him

 in the n4 ligth german maune comes as 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.290
 absolute dominator 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.810

 of the division where the slings dominate

 South American and of course will try 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.170
 impose again and hope that 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.450
