iPhone for tonight phone 4s and this is

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.829 
iPhone for tonight phone 4s and this is
a<00:00:13.710> case<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.219> goes<00:00:14.280> around<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.690> has<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
a case that goes around it and it has a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.429 
a case that goes around it and it has a
built-in<00:00:16.320> scanner<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.100> right<00:00:17.280> there<00:00:17.580> and

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
built-in scanner in it right there and

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.029 
built-in scanner in it right there and
this<00:00:19.439> case<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.980> called<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.430> linear<00:00:20.640> probe<00:00:21.150> for

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
this case is called a linear probe for

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.620 
this case is called a linear probe for
and<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.880> I'm<00:00:23.970> just<00:00:24.090> going<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.240> go<00:00:24.330> ahead<00:00:24.420> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
and so I'm just going to go ahead and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.750 
and so I'm just going to go ahead and
show<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.810> how<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.019> works<00:00:25.519> so<00:00:26.519> I'm<00:00:26.609> going<00:00:26.730> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
show you how it works so I'm going to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.880 
show you how it works so I'm going to
slide<00:00:27.060> my<00:00:27.240> iPhone<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.929> here<00:00:28.880> open<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:30.240> my

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
slide my iPhone in here open up my

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.720 
slide my iPhone in here open up my
Amazon<00:00:31.890> app<00:00:32.099> called

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
Amazon app called

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.490 
Amazon app called
needle<00:00:33.120> Pricer<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:35.900> basically<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.110> triggers

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
needle Pricer and basically the triggers

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.180 
needle Pricer and basically the triggers
lose<00:00:37.950> where<00:00:38.130> the<00:00:38.190> index<00:00:38.520> finger<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:40.130> and<00:00:41.130> you

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
lose where the index finger is and you

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.440 
lose where the index finger is and you
can<00:00:41.340> probably<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> laser<00:00:42.060> come<00:00:42.330> out

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
can probably see the laser come out

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.370 
can probably see the laser come out
there<00:00:44.300> so<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:45.480> gonna<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.750> ahead<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:45.990> scan<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
there so I'm gonna go ahead and scan a

00:00:46.380 --> 00:01:22.950 
there so I'm gonna go ahead and scan a
few<00:00:46.620> books<00:00:46.830> to<00:00:46.950> show<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.160> how<00:00:47.310> it<00:00:47.430> works

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.300 

alright<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.350> there<00:01:24.469> are<00:01:24.560> seven<00:01:24.890> books<00:01:25.070> that<00:01:25.250> I

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
just scanned so basically what I like

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.190 
just scanned so basically what I like
about<00:01:28.130> this<00:01:28.490> is<00:01:28.819> this<00:01:29.390> is<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.659> trigger<00:01:29.899> button

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
about this is this is the trigger button

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.899 
about this is this is the trigger button
right<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.979> index<00:01:31.250> finger<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:31.759> it's

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
right you the index finger so it's

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.160 
right you the index finger so it's
really<00:01:32.030> easy<00:01:32.299> to<00:01:32.420> activate<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.049> laser<00:01:35.170> that's

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
really easy to activate the laser that's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.130 
really easy to activate the laser that's
instead<00:01:36.679> rather<00:01:37.490> than<00:01:37.850> putting<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.539> Bluetooth

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
instead rather than putting a Bluetooth

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.319 
instead rather than putting a Bluetooth
scanner<00:01:39.530> in<00:01:39.710> your<00:01:39.799> other<00:01:39.979> hand<00:01:40.369> or<00:01:40.969> having<00:01:41.240> the

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
scanner in your other hand or having the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
velcro a scanner to the back yard phone

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.070 
velcro a scanner to the back yard phone
having<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.119> trigger<00:01:44.390> right<00:01:44.599> here<00:01:44.659> is<00:01:44.899> pretty

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
having a trigger right here is pretty

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.350 
having a trigger right here is pretty
handy<00:01:46.539> another<00:01:47.539> thing<00:01:47.869> I<00:01:48.200> like<00:01:48.709> is<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.899> price

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
handy another thing I like is the price

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.279 
handy another thing I like is the price
this<00:01:53.360> costs<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.409> Linea<00:01:54.829> Pro<00:01:55.099> for<00:01:55.399> cost<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.720> got

this for my backup also this scanner

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.430 
this for my backup also this scanner
right<00:02:23.000> here<00:02:23.239> only<00:02:23.600> works<00:02:23.840> with<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.139> needle

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
right here only works with the needle

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.590 
right here only works with the needle
scan<00:02:24.769> app<00:02:25.069> I've<00:02:25.370> tried<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.790> with<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:25.910> few<00:02:26.329> other

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
scan app I've tried it with a few other

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.530 
scan app I've tried it with a few other
Amazon<00:02:27.470> scouting<00:02:28.459> apps<00:02:28.639> and<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.150> didn't<00:02:29.389> work

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
Amazon scouting apps and it didn't work

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.569 
Amazon scouting apps and it didn't work
it<00:02:29.720> was<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.870> program<00:02:30.319> for<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:30.650> right<00:02:30.980> here<00:02:31.250> so

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
it was a program for this right here so

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.530 
it was a program for this right here so
that's<00:02:31.760> something<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.120> keep<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.359> mind<00:02:34.389> just<00:02:35.389> a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540
