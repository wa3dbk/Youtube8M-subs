right you would actually shave down on

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.260 
right you would actually shave down on
the<00:02:46.270> here<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:47.260> create<00:02:48.130> that<00:02:48.460> feed<00:02:49.290> right<00:02:51.270> so

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
the here and create that feed right so

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.490 
the here and create that feed right so
let's<00:02:52.480> say<00:02:52.630> for<00:02:52.870> instance<00:02:54.900> now<00:02:55.900> how<00:02:56.320> do<00:02:56.380> you

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
let's say for instance now how do you

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.400 
let's say for instance now how do you
create<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.860> more<00:02:57.160> feet<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:58.570> how<00:02:58.810> i<00:02:58.840> do<00:02:58.990> it<00:02:59.200> i

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
create a more feet this how i do it i

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.670 
create a more feet this how i do it i
just<00:02:59.620> go<00:02:59.830> on<00:02:59.980> long<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.460> lines<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.870> slant

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
just go on long the lines and I slant

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.090 
just go on long the lines and I slant
and<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.460> slammed<00:03:03.880> my<00:03:04.090> machine<00:03:04.720> upward<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.500> I

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
and I slammed my machine upward and I

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
and I slammed my machine upward and I
just<00:03:06.310> go<00:03:06.520> for<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.420> just<00:03:07.830> until<00:03:08.830> it

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
just go for it and I just until it

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.979 
just go for it and I just until it
blends<00:03:10.120> in<00:03:10.300> I<00:03:10.890> mean<00:03:11.890> cutting<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.730> power<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.510> not

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
blends in I mean cutting it power is not

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.800 
blends in I mean cutting it power is not
one<00:03:14.800> of<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.010> biggest<00:03:15.280> techniques<00:03:15.970> but<00:03:16.630> it's

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
one of the biggest techniques but it's

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.780 
one of the biggest techniques but it's
very<00:03:17.020> effective<00:03:17.650> because<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.220> doesn't<00:03:18.640> take

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
very effective because it doesn't take

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.720 
very effective because it doesn't take
off<00:03:18.970> as<00:03:19.209> much<00:03:19.239> hair<00:03:19.959> as<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.200> wood<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.950> for

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
off as much hair as a wood and for

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.810 
off as much hair as a wood and for
amateurs<00:03:22.270> is<00:03:22.660> very<00:03:23.050> easy<00:03:23.590> in<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.280> very<00:03:24.520> easy

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
amateurs is very easy in a very easy

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.160 
amateurs is very easy in a very easy
technique<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.600> use<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:27.010> remember<00:03:27.880> this<00:03:28.060> if<00:03:28.989> you

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
technique to use so remember this if you

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.380 
technique to use so remember this if you
don't<00:03:29.200> remember<00:03:29.470> anything<00:03:29.920> else<00:03:30.390> remember

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
don't remember anything else remember

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.560 
don't remember anything else remember
that<00:03:31.770> you<00:03:32.770> go<00:03:32.980> up<00:03:33.220> with<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.670> highest<00:03:33.940> unless

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
that you go up with the highest unless

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.740 
that you go up with the highest unless
you<00:03:34.750> want<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:35.170> ball<00:03:35.700> unless<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:37.239> want<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.600> to

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
you want a ball unless you want this to

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.410 
you want a ball unless you want this to
be<00:03:37.870> bumped<00:03:38.290> then<00:03:38.770> you<00:03:39.010> go<00:03:39.220> download<00:03:39.700> but<00:03:40.300> if

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
be bumped then you go download but if

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.840 
be bumped then you go download but if
you<00:03:40.570> don't<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.680> just<00:03:41.920> do<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.640> highest

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
you don't you just do it to the highest

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.110 
you don't you just do it to the highest
adjustable<00:03:43.480> level<00:03:43.780> zoom<00:03:44.590> zoom<00:03:44.620> up<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.520> then

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
adjustable level zoom zoom up and then

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.009 
adjustable level zoom zoom up and then
go<00:03:46.360> halfway<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:47.410> go<00:03:48.400> down<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.090> it's<00:03:49.870> gonna

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
go halfway and go down and it's gonna

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.220 
go halfway and go down and it's gonna
blend<00:03:50.470> no<00:03:51.160> matter<00:03:51.430> what<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:51.970> if<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:52.810> doesn't

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
blend no matter what and if it doesn't

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.440 
blend no matter what and if it doesn't
blend<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:53.860> know<00:03:54.040> this<00:03:54.220> is<00:03:54.430> not<00:03:54.730> blending

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
blend and you know this is not blending

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.780 
blend and you know this is not blending
what<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:55.840> want<00:03:56.080> to<00:03:56.170> do<00:03:56.380> is<00:03:57.010> probably<00:03:57.370> want<00:03:57.730> to

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
what you want to do is probably want to

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.400 
what you want to do is probably want to
go<00:03:57.910> down

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
go down

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.920 
go down
if<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:59.100> want<00:03:59.490> to<00:03:59.550> adjust<00:03:59.670> it<00:04:00.120> up<00:04:00.270> a<00:04:00.420> little

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930
