right there a magma pump mech pump pump
is<00:04:03.239> good<00:04:03.450> gives<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.870> resources<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:05.099> energy

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
is good gives you resources and energy

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.330 
is good gives you resources and energy
like<00:04:07.230> like

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
like like

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.960 
like like

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
fuel you need and then the next thing is

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.050 
fuel you need and then the next thing is
a<00:04:13.000> radar<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:15.190> camera

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
a radar the camera

a radar the camera
and<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.419> power<00:04:17.660> plan<00:04:18.019> just<00:04:18.410> ordinary<00:04:18.919> problem

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
and the power plan just ordinary problem

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.250 
and the power plan just ordinary problem
and<00:04:19.730> then<00:04:19.850> you<00:04:20.000> have<00:04:20.239> here<00:04:20.630> in<00:04:20.810> nuclear<00:04:21.230> power

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
and then you have here in nuclear power

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.430 
and then you have here in nuclear power
plant<00:04:21.980> you<00:04:22.700> see<00:04:22.730> even<00:04:23.180> more<00:04:23.480> energy<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.400> let's

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
plant you see even more energy and let's

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.580 
plant you see even more energy and let's
go<00:04:27.440> on<00:04:27.680> back

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
go on back

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.670 
go on back
and<00:04:29.680> we<00:04:29.800> have<00:04:29.950> here<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:31.230> build<00:04:32.230> unit

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
and we have here the build unit

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.629 
and we have here the build unit
structures<00:04:33.280> as<00:04:33.610> military<00:04:34.680> structures<00:04:35.680> like<00:04:36.580> a

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
structures as military structures like a

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.020 
structures as military structures like a
train<00:04:36.970> scam<00:04:37.330> we<00:04:37.690> already<00:04:37.960> have

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
train scam we already have

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.320 
train scam we already have
and<00:04:39.150> we<00:04:39.360> have<00:04:39.480> a<00:04:39.540> hospital<00:04:40.700> vehicle<00:04:41.700> factory

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
and we have a hospital vehicle factory

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.730 
and we have a hospital vehicle factory
and<00:04:43.310> Agrifac<00:04:44.310> tree

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.920 

and<00:04:47.040> then<00:04:47.370> last<00:04:47.700> thing<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.300> building

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
and then last thing this building

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.040 
and then last thing this building
defense<00:04:49.410> structures<00:04:50.250> like<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.330> Gunter<00:04:51.780> we

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
defense structures like the Gunter we

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.320 
defense structures like the Gunter we
already<00:04:52.410> have<00:04:52.680> by<00:04:53.010> default<00:04:53.490> then<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.810> cannon

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
already have by default then a cannon

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.300 
already have by default then a cannon
then<00:04:56.479> over<00:04:57.110> here<00:04:57.370> that<00:04:58.370> is<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:58.610> missile<00:04:59.060> silo

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
then over here that is a missile silo

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.200 
then over here that is a missile silo
bang

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.689 

and<00:05:04.539> then<00:05:04.630> you're<00:05:04.750> probably<00:05:04.990> wondering<00:05:05.699> where

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
and then you're probably wondering where

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.909 
and then you're probably wondering where
it<00:05:06.820> can<00:05:06.970> get<00:05:07.150> resources<00:05:07.600> from<00:05:07.960> or<00:05:08.500> where<00:05:08.710> can<00:05:08.889> I

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
it can get resources from or where can I

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.939 
it can get resources from or where can I
build<00:05:09.160> my<00:05:09.430> my<00:05:09.880> buildings<00:05:10.470> for<00:05:11.470> example<00:05:11.860> you

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
build my my buildings for example you

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.520 
build my my buildings for example you
can<00:05:12.100> get<00:05:12.340> resources<00:05:12.699> here<00:05:13.690> from<00:05:13.960> those<00:05:14.139> trees

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
can get resources here from those trees

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.360 
can get resources here from those trees
from<00:05:15.190> those<00:05:15.400> rocks<00:05:15.729> and<00:05:16.860> so<00:05:17.860> it's<00:05:18.070> gallows

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
from those rocks and so it's gallows

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.050 
from those rocks and so it's gallows
pots<00:05:18.759> over<00:05:19.090> here<00:05:19.479> those<00:05:19.840> are<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.320> sports<00:05:21.310> we

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
pots over here those are the sports we

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.379 
pots over here those are the sports we
can<00:05:22.419> build<00:05:22.690> only<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:24.250> magnapunch<00:05:24.699> you<00:05:25.150> can

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
can build only the magnapunch you can

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.499 
can build only the magnapunch you can
build<00:05:25.840> nowhere<00:05:26.500> else<00:05:26.620> a<00:05:27.009> magma<00:05:27.669> pump<00:05:27.940> except

build nowhere else a magma pump except

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.850 
build nowhere else a magma pump except
on<00:05:28.660> those<00:05:28.810> yellow<00:05:29.110> spots<00:05:29.789> remember<00:05:30.789> that<00:05:30.970> and

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
on those yellow spots remember that and

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.409 
on those yellow spots remember that and
good<00:05:32.860> tip<00:05:33.070> for<00:05:33.100> today<00:05:33.490> but<00:05:33.729> to<00:05:34.000> start<00:05:34.270> that

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
good tip for today but to start that

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.460 
good tip for today but to start that
game<00:05:34.449> is<00:05:34.990> building<00:05:35.949> a<00:05:36.009> lot<00:05:36.160> of<00:05:36.250> resources<00:05:36.729> and

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
game is building a lot of resources and
