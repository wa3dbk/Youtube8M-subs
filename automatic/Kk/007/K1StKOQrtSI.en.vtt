in<00:01:12.570> question<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
in question I think that the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.330 
in question I think that the
circumstances<00:01:16.140> since<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.310> been

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340

present<00:01:20.580> situation<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.270> does<00:01:21.450> seem

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
present situation it does seem

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.760

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
reasonable to give them another chance

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.440 
reasonable to give them another chance
but<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:25.920> Chelsea<00:01:26.130> hadn't<00:01:26.670> taken<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.150> issue<00:01:27.210> to

but if Chelsea hadn't taken the issue to

the courts presumably the ban would
