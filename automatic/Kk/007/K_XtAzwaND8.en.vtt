00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.850
 the 'case guateque' marked a milestone in history 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.760
 it was the first time for the second one if we consider the case of vice are that a 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.030
 president of the united states of america had to choose half of his 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.689
 mandate 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:16.349
 on June 17, 1972 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.349
 five thieves were arrested in the watergate building 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.879
 had penetrated the Democratic Party barracks to place eavesdropping 

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:26.619
 illegals 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.669
 the documents found to the group dubbed the quatre plumbers 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.470
 They showed that they were following orders from Jowhar Ja a former agent of the CIA 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.360
 from the beginning nixon denied any direct or indirect participation in 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.130
 that case 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.110
 that scandal did not prevent richard nixon from embracing the elections of 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.210
 November 1972 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.470
 being re-elected president and defeating the Democratic senator yorman cÃºper 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.630
 Nissan began his second term as president of the United States 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.640
 in January 1963 the plumbers of uatre were condemned 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.340
 although there was growing suspicion that there were songs between before 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.970
 the two post Washington journalists may have kind of score along with their 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.480
 deep throat anonymous source 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.050
 brought to light all the irregularities of the committee of 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.200
 Nissan Relection 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.770
 forcing a commission of inquiry 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.770
 whose interrogations were broadcast on television 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.650
 mcgee 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.250
 a goal that was not 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.850
 in that act 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.450
 a large number of mission partners are now being questioned and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.650
 they were forced to resign 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.340
 in April fell to the dictator of the fb and patrick gray successor of the historic jr a 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.420
 jover 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.400
 after being accused of having impeded the investigations 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 and for mere reasons fell Minister Richard Jenkins 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.390
 and the presidential advisors jal de man eris andean mulch 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.380
 the latter changes its version in 1973 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.950
 when he accused no German dream of hampering the investigation 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.150
 and related that the president records all the conversations of the white house 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.230
 reason why all public opinion then concentrated on asking 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.030
 the inks to listen to the nissan conversations and their 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.949
 collaborators 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:20.069
 and find out if he was very involved in the espionage case a the this policy 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.049
 they did 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.529
 porter 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.649
 what probably very few people know 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:30.079
 is that the non-US white house recording system or 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.059
 decline 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:34.120
 partly to avoid the need 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.849
 each meeting always and partly to jarque every moment there was proof 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.180
 of all the verbal agreements an improvised without formal 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.670
 nixon dismissed the archibal cox special prosecutor who demanded the delivery of 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.609
 the ribbons 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.939
 that arbitrariness proved that the opposition promoted an impi 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.939
 impeachment process of the president of the united states of america 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:04.230
 in the end it would not be necessary in June 1974 nixon delivered all inks and 8 of 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.879
 August 1984 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.879
 resigned as president of the United States 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:16.349
 the new president arrives at fort indulto nixon of all responsibility that 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.379
 I could have 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.510
 lucky that he had no claim that he would go to jail
