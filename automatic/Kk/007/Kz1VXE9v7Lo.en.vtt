00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 good morning to all of you guys here in June 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.270
 have been www.lexbook.it on the page 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.429
 facebook to our site in description 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.250
 today we are little the player avoid benzema 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.770
 iv benzema iv shows an 86 of 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.390
 over 85 of 385 of speed 76 of 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.619
 pass 5 more than the version 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.680
 not inform 84 of dribbling 78 suddenly 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.019
 at the top the other bigger ones we will see them 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.310
 had finalization and short passages 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.800
 so mark these two 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.420
 characteristics because they are among their own 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.280
 great 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.149
 ok as usual he used in the department 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.040
 alone or in pairs and they are not are not 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.550
 really managed to get an idea in 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.090
 fifteen sixteen games I did 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.039
 if it is worthwhile or not they take and if 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.600
 worth it or not to deploy it alone 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.670
 is a player who has alternated 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.890
 excellent performance with performance 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.890
 undertone in both solutions 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.969
 ok having said that we pass the first one promised 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.250
 pro have said the passages by force 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.900
 because this player at 92 steps 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.820
 courts and 82 cross 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.770
 so if you play in the pair 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.119
 and you get a wide ball you can 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.619
 put it in a month if you have a good one 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.630
 head hitter 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.780
 you risk doing many many times 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.210
 so while in 92 short passages yes 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.850
 reveals a feature more than 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.400
 fundamental because the best way to 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.140
 unmark this player here are the 12 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.329
 we will then see that he takes physical strength 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.439
 I'm not at the top and therefore really 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.150
 you need to create the space to enter e 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.810
 creating the space where there is no one 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.970
 because this is the only way to be sure of flakes 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.829
 sure to score goals because of 97's 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.740
 finalization then whenever it is 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.530
 enter the area you score goals that you pull 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.950
 even at random but he always looks and finds 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.930
 always a corner is a beautiful thing 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.030
 it's awesome more than once 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.520
 I pulled almost at random and returned 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.230
 then another pro is the ball control 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.600
 when I usually talk about control 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.830
 paolo dribbling ball i say eh turns around 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.450
 well in tight spaces 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.880
 instead I enjoyed it more with him 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.780
 play with the team then wait 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.610
 the comrades and make passes rather than 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.860
 santa in the egg one against one that many 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.990
 sometimes even failed 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.670
 dribbling I didn't find myself 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.440
 very well that lived has become is not 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.200
 a counter because anyway if a person 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.210
 sa man jumps well but control 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.850
 ball allowed me to juggle 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.350
 play with your feet and bring me the ball 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.910
 from right to left so as to 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.230
 choose with which foot also in 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.390
 how to do the steps for my parents 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.430
 companions and more than sometimes I also have 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.560
 wait for the team to go up then 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.270
 I stopped the ball and got the without 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.820
 let me touch because physical strength does not 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.230
 it's great and then I waited for my companion 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.130
 and he gives it to him with the passage 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.160
 the last one, however, with regards to shooting 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.860
 above all it is the tir power to 91 of 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.470
 potentials that have an effect of 88 and 86 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.630
 budget so you have a range of 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.400
 fairly broad shooting solutions 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.900
 because it is an effect 88 allows you to 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.540
 make good shots even from the edge 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.940
 of the area and when you are a little more 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.820
 secluded 86 of i love shopping 91 of 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.980
 power shot here to put it together 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.080
 at the 97th goal of scoring 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.420
 whenever you are on the edge of the area 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.920
 and pull of power then a nice one 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.680
 thumb up 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.290
 now instead we move on to counter-encounters 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.970
 I 'm almost here with this player 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.890
 heavy 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.360
 alternates excellent performance performances 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.940
 mediocre and undertone 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.450
 so the shot and the physical strength as 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.390
 I didn't really like the combination 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.209
 because often it happened that I have it on 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.880
 I live without marking it with my servants 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.780
 and there they start to run looked like 90's 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.660
 speed 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.700
 then later he was recovered because of 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.480
 certainly the jury is the old woman and therefore 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.160
 also a good value 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.810
 then face it to recover is due 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.330
 always play of physical strength but 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.060
 only 79 of physical strength and therefore 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.310
 more than a few times they took me 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.570
 he retrieved noemi shifted and therefore he is 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.500
 It was something that made me turn away 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.720
 very 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.280
 so let's move on to the last one against 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.770
 header with a header by 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.410
 this player when it came to 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.660
 serve the companions with the banks and it is me 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.940
 liked and felt his meter and 87 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.460
 but when you find yourself scoring goals 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.930
 this made him a goal on I think one 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.860
 twenty thirty cross that I have him 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.990
 made in these jokes especially 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.790
 when it gives up I leave alone so a 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.940
 thumb down even for the shot of 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.530
 head that is not incisive may be but 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.100
 is not engraved can score but is not 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.410
 incisor 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.150
 having said that I hope I have been there 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.750
 useful a little that the tea lives on these 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.520
 players and I remind you that Saturday there 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.520
 it will be the double review instead if not 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.120
 the monster with 90 speed 90 pickup 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.360
 91 dribbling ok 91 dribbling 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.280
 sasch alghero and maybe who knows could 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.530
 arrive on Monday but this does not 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.530
 leaves you our latest videos and babas
