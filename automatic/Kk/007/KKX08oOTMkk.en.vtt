as a basis for everything we're going to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.130 
as a basis for everything we're going to
put<00:00:20.490> into<00:00:20.699> use<00:00:21.000> through<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.359> course<00:00:21.660> let's

put into use through this course let's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.900 
put into use through this course let's
introduce<00:00:22.380> some<00:00:22.560> basic<00:00:22.769> concepts<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.730> will

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
introduce some basic concepts that will

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.340 
introduce some basic concepts that will
make<00:00:24.060> understanding<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> world<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.199> digital

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
make understanding the world of digital

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.950 
make understanding the world of digital
color<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.980> bit<00:00:26.310> easier<00:00:26.670> we're<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.660> start

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
color a bit easier we're going to start

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.410 
color a bit easier we're going to start
with<00:00:28.050> color<00:00:28.320> spaces<00:00:28.890> color<00:00:29.550> spaces<00:00:30.060> define

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
with color spaces color spaces define

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.540 
with color spaces color spaces define
the<00:00:30.539> range<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:31.050> colors<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.410> tones<00:00:31.740> available

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the range of colors and tones available

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.760 
the range of colors and tones available
for<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> digital<00:00:32.910> file<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:34.290> might<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.710> that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
for a digital file you might think that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.440 
for a digital file you might think that
the<00:00:35.010> largest<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.610> will<00:00:35.760> always<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> best

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the largest one will always be the best

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.049 
the largest one will always be the best
so<00:00:37.320> I'll<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.129> one<00:00:38.309> well<00:00:38.820> this

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
so I'll just go with that one well this

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.670 
so I'll just go with that one well this
is<00:00:39.210> frequently<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.170> case<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.559> we're

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
is frequently not the case so we're

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.220 
is frequently not the case so we're
going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> explore<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.600> color<00:00:42.600> spaces<00:00:43.079> are

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
going to explore this color spaces are

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.830 
going to explore this color spaces are
an<00:00:43.320> area<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.739> cause<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> lot<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.579> confusion<00:00:44.850> so

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
an area that cause a lot of confusion so

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.029 
an area that cause a lot of confusion so
it's<00:00:45.989> important<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> understand<00:00:46.770> where<00:00:46.950> they

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
it's important to understand where they

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.490 
it's important to understand where they
all<00:00:47.190> fit<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.850> what<00:00:48.390> characteristics<00:00:48.870> may

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
all fit in and what characteristics may

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.139 
all fit in and what characteristics may
affect<00:00:49.890> how<00:00:50.129> an<00:00:50.280> image<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.640> viewed

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
affect how an image is viewed

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.000 
affect how an image is viewed
first<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.989> all<00:00:52.050> let's<00:00:52.260> clarify<00:00:52.500> one<00:00:52.980> thing

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
first of all let's clarify one thing

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.299 
first of all let's clarify one thing
there<00:00:53.670> are<00:00:53.699> no<00:00:53.940> bad<00:00:54.570> color<00:00:55.020> spaces<00:00:55.530> while<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
there are no bad color spaces while it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.040 
there are no bad color spaces while it
is<00:00:56.399> true<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.820> some<00:00:57.090> spaces<00:00:57.600> having<00:00:57.870> much

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
is true that some spaces having much

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.740 
is true that some spaces having much
greater<00:00:58.379> color<00:00:58.680> range<00:00:58.980> many<00:00:59.850> devices<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.629> we

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
greater color range many devices that we

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.290 
greater color range many devices that we
use<00:01:00.780> are<00:01:01.399> impacted<00:01:02.399> by<00:01:02.430> color<00:01:02.789> workflow

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
use are impacted by color workflow

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.390 
use are impacted by color workflow
simply<00:01:03.750> because<00:01:04.049> they<00:01:04.229> can't<00:01:04.500> display<00:01:05.129> or

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
simply because they can't display or

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
simply because they can't display or
create<00:01:05.939> all<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.720> colors<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.140> larger

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
create all of the colors that larger

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.940 
create all of the colors that larger
color<00:01:07.979> spaces<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.900> for<00:01:09.900> example<00:01:09.990> prophoto

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
color spaces have for example prophoto

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.550 
slightly greater ability to represent
blues<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.340> greens<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.759> srgb<00:02:09.450> seeing<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
blues and greens and srgb seeing the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.260 
blues and greens and srgb seeing the
color<00:02:10.770> spaces<00:02:11.250> together<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.819> going<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.090> make

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
color spaces together is going to make

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.190 
color spaces together is going to make
it<00:02:12.420> simple

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it simple

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960 
it simple
I'm<00:02:13.319> going<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.590> use<00:02:13.739> an<00:02:13.890> app<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> Macintosh

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
I'm going to use an app on the Macintosh

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.880 
I'm going to use an app on the Macintosh
operating<00:02:15.180> system<00:02:15.959> called<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.379> color<00:02:16.590> sync

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
operating system called the color sync

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.100 
operating system called the color sync
utility<00:02:17.459> this<00:02:18.269> allows<00:02:18.540> me<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.870> show<00:02:19.050> you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
utility this allows me to show you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.110 
utility this allows me to show you
different<00:02:19.530> color<00:02:19.739> spaces<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.430> profiles<00:02:20.849> and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
different color spaces and profiles and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.850 
different color spaces and profiles and
how<00:02:21.420> they<00:02:21.599> relate<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.959> each<00:02:22.200> other<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.560> three

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
how they relate to each other in three

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.860 
how they relate to each other in three
dimensions<00:02:23.370> now<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.150> app<00:02:24.330> doesn't<00:02:24.690> actually

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
dimensions now this app doesn't actually

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.570 
dimensions now this app doesn't actually
play<00:02:25.200> any<00:02:25.290> part<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.920> putting<00:02:26.099> our<00:02:26.340> color

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
play any part in putting our color

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.030 
play any part in putting our color
workflow<00:02:27.360> together<00:02:27.720> I'm<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.410> bringing<00:02:28.769> it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
workflow together I'm just bringing it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.100 
workflow together I'm just bringing it
up<00:02:29.160> because<00:02:29.400> seeing<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> color<00:02:30.209> spaces<00:02:30.780> makes

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
up because seeing the color spaces makes

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.750 
up because seeing the color spaces makes
it<00:02:31.260> easier<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> understand<00:02:32.160> what's<00:02:32.370> going<00:02:32.670> on

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
it easier to understand what's going on

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.660 
it easier to understand what's going on
so<00:02:33.030> let's<00:02:33.390> jump<00:02:33.720> into<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.170> app<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.670> here's

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
so let's jump into that app so here's

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.520 
so let's jump into that app so here's
the<00:02:35.760> color<00:02:35.940> sync<00:02:36.209> utility<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:37.019> can<00:02:37.050> see<00:02:37.319> if<00:02:37.410> we

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the color sync utility you can see if we

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.620 
the color sync utility you can see if we
click<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.890> profiles<00:02:38.400> up<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.760> top<00:02:38.970> here<00:02:39.239> we<00:02:39.480> get

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
click on profiles up the top here we get

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.120 
click on profiles up the top here we get
a<00:02:39.690> list<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.989> all<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> profiles<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.830> are<00:02:40.950> in

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
a list of all the profiles that are in

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.000 
a list of all the profiles that are in
our<00:02:41.250> system<00:02:41.549> so<00:02:41.940> if<00:02:42.420> we<00:02:42.629> bring<00:02:42.959> up<00:02:43.140> say<00:02:43.500> Adobe

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
our system so if we bring up say Adobe

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.670 
our system so if we bring up say Adobe
RGB<00:02:44.269> we<00:02:45.269> then<00:02:45.480> get<00:02:45.599> a<00:02:45.660> plot<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.500> can

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
RGB we then get a plot of it and you can

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.520 
RGB we then get a plot of it and you can
grab<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.069> and<00:02:47.280> spin<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.030> around<00:02:48.290> now<00:02:49.290> that's

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
grab it and spin it around now that's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.350 
grab it and spin it around now that's
all<00:02:49.709> very<00:02:49.860> lovely<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.670> doesn't<00:02:51.000> tell<00:02:51.150> us<00:02:51.180> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
all very lovely but it doesn't tell us a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.420 
all very lovely but it doesn't tell us a
whole<00:02:51.390> lot<00:02:51.569> by<00:02:52.019> itself<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:52.769> need<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.040> compare

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
whole lot by itself we need to compare

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.490 
whole lot by itself we need to compare
it<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.640> something<00:02:54.000> else<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.599> let's<00:02:55.200> leave<00:02:55.440> that

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
it to something else so let's leave that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.890 
it to something else so let's leave that
there<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.220> if<00:02:56.579> we<00:02:56.700> click<00:02:56.970> here<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.299> click<00:02:57.480> on

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
there and if we click here and click on

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.800 
there and if we click here and click on
hold<00:02:58.200> for<00:02:58.440> comparison<00:02:59.010> we<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.790> overlay<00:03:00.269> other

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
hold for comparison we can overlay other

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.809 
hold for comparison we can overlay other
profiles<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:01.739> top<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.489> let's<00:03:02.640> take<00:03:02.790> a

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
profiles on top of this so let's take a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.170 
profiles on top of this so let's take a
look<00:03:03.030> at<00:03:03.120> srgb<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.920> we<00:03:05.010> click<00:03:05.190> on<00:03:05.280> srgb<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.120> we

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
look at srgb so we click on srgb and we

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.690 
look at srgb so we click on srgb and we
get<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.510> see<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.900> srgb<00:03:07.709> space<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.310> color

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
get to see the srgb space in color

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.530 
get to see the srgb space in color
inside<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.079> grayed<00:03:10.470> out<00:03:10.500> Adobe<00:03:11.040> RGB<00:03:11.190> space<00:03:11.760> so

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
inside the grayed out Adobe RGB space so

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.690 
inside the grayed out Adobe RGB space so
what<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.930> showing<00:03:12.959> us<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.980> Adobe

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
what this is showing us is that Adobe

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.180 
what this is showing us is that Adobe
RGB<00:03:14.819> is<00:03:15.329> larger<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:15.989> every<00:03:16.319> color<00:03:16.620> dimension

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
RGB is larger in every color dimension

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.800 
RGB is larger in every color dimension
then<00:03:17.430> srgb<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.389> can<00:03:18.510> see<00:03:18.540> in

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
then srgb is and you can see in

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.809 
then srgb is and you can see in
particular<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.769> greens<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.340> blues<00:03:20.549> on<00:03:20.790> the

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
particular the greens and blues on the

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.640 
particular the greens and blues on the
one<00:03:21.060> side<00:03:21.299> there's<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.660> lot<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.139> extra<00:03:22.500> space

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
one side there's a lot of extra space

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.650 
one side there's a lot of extra space
over<00:03:23.160> here<00:03:23.190> now<00:03:24.180> if<00:03:24.359> we<00:03:24.540> hold<00:03:25.160> srgb<00:03:26.450> again<00:03:27.450> here

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
over here now if we hold srgb again here

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.379 
over here now if we hold srgb again here
we<00:03:27.750> have<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:28.049> by<00:03:28.200> itself<00:03:28.850> let's<00:03:29.850> take<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.090> look

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
we have it by itself let's take a look

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.099 
we have it by itself let's take a look
at<00:03:30.600> it

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
at it

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.509 
at it
with<00:03:31.319> say<00:03:31.590> CMYK<00:03:32.329> now<00:03:33.329> CMYK<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.769> much<00:03:35.100> smaller

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
with say CMYK now CMYK is a much smaller

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.240 
with say CMYK now CMYK is a much smaller
color<00:03:35.910> space<00:03:36.239> than<00:03:36.480> srgb<00:03:37.200> but<00:03:37.950> as<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.069> mentioned

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
color space than srgb but as I mentioned

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.030 
color space than srgb but as I mentioned
however<00:03:38.940> as<00:03:39.150> we<00:03:39.299> spin<00:03:39.630> around<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:40.680> can<00:03:40.859> see

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
however as we spin around you can see

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.729 
however as we spin around you can see
that<00:03:41.220> CMYK<00:03:41.700> does<00:03:42.660> have<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.930> lot<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.230> blue<00:03:43.590> and

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
that CMYK does have a lot of blue and

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.270 
that CMYK does have a lot of blue and
green<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:44.370> srgb<00:03:45.120> just<00:03:45.389> can't<00:03:45.690> address

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
green that srgb just can't address

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.890 
green that srgb just can't address
that's<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.549> common<00:03:48.060> reason<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.720> lot<00:03:48.870> of

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
that's a common reason that a lot of

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.050 
that's a common reason that a lot of
designers<00:03:49.440> will<00:03:49.620> work<00:03:49.799> in<00:03:49.950> Adobe<00:03:50.340> RGB<00:03:50.489> when

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
designers will work in Adobe RGB when

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.280 
designers will work in Adobe RGB when
they<00:03:51.180> have<00:03:51.359> an<00:03:51.510> image<00:03:51.750> that's<00:03:51.900> going<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.170> go

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
they have an image that's going to go

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.039 
they have an image that's going to go
out<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> CMYK<00:03:53.010> printer<00:03:53.700> because<00:03:54.480> Adobe<00:03:54.900> RGB

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
out to a CMYK printer because Adobe RGB

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.800 
out to a CMYK printer because Adobe RGB
completely<00:03:55.950> encompasses<00:03:56.609> CMYK<00:03:57.120> let's<00:03:57.630> take<00:03:57.780> a

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
completely encompasses CMYK let's take a

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.949 
completely encompasses CMYK let's take a
look<00:03:57.989> at<00:03:58.079> that<00:03:58.200> so<00:03:58.950> we<00:03:58.980> hold<00:03:59.310> CMYK<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.359> let's

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
look at that so we hold CMYK and let's

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.069 
look at that so we hold CMYK and let's
bring<00:04:01.230> in<00:04:01.410> Adobe<00:04:01.889> RGB<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.579> you<00:04:03.450> can<00:04:03.599> see<00:04:03.840> it's

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
bring in Adobe RGB and you can see it's

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.039 
bring in Adobe RGB and you can see it's
completely<00:04:04.549> surrounded<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.760> CMYK<00:04:06.299> profile

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
completely surrounded the CMYK profile

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.229 
completely surrounded the CMYK profile
fact<00:04:07.799> we<00:04:07.920> can<00:04:08.069> reverse<00:04:08.370> this<00:04:08.609> so<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.849> can<00:04:09.030> see

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
fact we can reverse this so you can see

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.120 
fact we can reverse this so you can see
it<00:04:09.329> again<00:04:09.419> and<00:04:10.310> then<00:04:11.310> put<00:04:11.489> CMYK<00:04:12.109> inside<00:04:13.130> you

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
it again and then put CMYK inside you

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.219 
it again and then put CMYK inside you
can<00:04:14.280> see<00:04:14.400> even<00:04:14.549> though<00:04:14.790> Adobe<00:04:15.359> RGB<00:04:15.510> is<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.870> much

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
can see even though Adobe RGB is a much

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.830 
can see even though Adobe RGB is a much
larger<00:04:16.650> space<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:17.820> still<00:04:18.090> gets<00:04:18.269> used<00:04:18.539> because

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
larger space it still gets used because

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.640 
larger space it still gets used because
it<00:04:19.229> completely<00:04:19.729> encompasses<00:04:20.729> CMYK<00:04:21.650> now

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
it completely encompasses CMYK now

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.200 
it completely encompasses CMYK now
there's<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.830> lot<00:04:22.950> of<00:04:23.039> talk<00:04:23.250> about<00:04:23.430> prophoto<00:04:24.090> RGB

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
there's a lot of talk about prophoto RGB

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.360 
there's a lot of talk about prophoto RGB
let's<00:04:24.810> bring<00:04:25.020> that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
let's bring that

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.030 
let's bring that
by<00:04:25.580> itself<00:04:26.030> will<00:04:26.870> clear<00:04:27.139> this<00:04:27.290> comparison<00:04:27.919> and

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
by itself will clear this comparison and

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.460 
by itself will clear this comparison and
bring<00:04:28.160> up<00:04:28.280> Profoto<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:29.060> yes<00:04:29.930> you<00:04:30.080> can<00:04:30.199> see<00:04:30.260> we

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
bring up Profoto and yes you can see we

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.189 
bring up Profoto and yes you can see we
have<00:04:30.620> this<00:04:30.770> enormous<00:04:31.280> color<00:04:31.729> space<00:04:32.060> you<00:04:32.930> think

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
have this enormous color space you think

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.600 
have this enormous color space you think
that<00:04:33.410> must<00:04:33.620> be<00:04:33.740> wonderful<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.280> want<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.520> use

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
that must be wonderful I want to use

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.159 
that must be wonderful I want to use
that<00:04:34.820> one<00:04:35.030> it's<00:04:35.150> like<00:04:35.300> having<00:04:35.570> more<00:04:35.690> crayons

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
that one it's like having more crayons

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.790 
that one it's like having more crayons
in<00:04:36.320> your<00:04:36.470> box<00:04:36.680> if<00:04:37.550> we<00:04:37.669> go<00:04:37.790> ahead<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:38.000> hold<00:04:38.270> this

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
in your box if we go ahead and hold this

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.040 
in your box if we go ahead and hold this
we<00:04:39.800> can<00:04:39.949> put<00:04:40.130> Adobe<00:04:40.790> RGB<00:04:40.940> in<00:04:41.389> there<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.720> you

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
we can put Adobe RGB in there and you

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.810 
we can put Adobe RGB in there and you
can<00:04:42.199> see<00:04:42.380> wow<00:04:42.590> it's<00:04:42.830> much<00:04:43.070> bigger<00:04:43.220> than<00:04:43.370> Adobe

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
can see wow it's much bigger than Adobe

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.400 
can see wow it's much bigger than Adobe
RGB<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:45.530> completely<00:04:46.130> Dwarfs<00:04:46.669> s<00:04:46.820> RGB<00:04:47.449> and

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
RGB and it completely Dwarfs s RGB and

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.379 
RGB and it completely Dwarfs s RGB and
CMYK<00:04:48.470> you<00:04:49.220> can<00:04:49.460> imagine<00:04:49.760> what<00:04:50.090> that's<00:04:50.180> going

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
CMYK you can imagine what that's going

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.320 
CMYK you can imagine what that's going
to<00:04:50.479> look<00:04:50.600> like<00:04:50.630> tiny<00:04:51.590> inside<00:04:52.190> there<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:53.270> you

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
to look like tiny inside there so you

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.600 
to look like tiny inside there so you
would<00:04:53.510> think<00:04:53.540> again<00:04:53.990> Adobe<00:04:54.410> RGB<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:55.070> good<00:04:55.400> for

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
would think again Adobe RGB is good for

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.219 
would think again Adobe RGB is good for
CMYK<00:04:56.030> but<00:04:56.449> why<00:04:56.600> don't<00:04:56.660> I<00:04:56.900> want<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.139> use

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
CMYK but why don't I want to use

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.650 
CMYK but why don't I want to use
prophoto<00:04:57.710> RGB<00:04:57.800> well<00:04:58.639> in<00:04:58.789> some<00:04:59.000> cases<00:04:59.030> you<00:04:59.510> will

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
prophoto RGB well in some cases you will

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.790 
prophoto RGB well in some cases you will
and<00:04:59.780> we're<00:04:59.870> going<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.050> get<00:05:00.139> into<00:05:00.320> this<00:05:00.500> when<00:05:00.710> we

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
and we're going to get into this when we

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.129 
and we're going to get into this when we
get<00:05:00.949> into<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.280> software<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.789> bit<00:05:01.940> more<00:05:02.210> but<00:05:03.020> you

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
get into the software a bit more but you

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.960 
get into the software a bit more but you
need<00:05:03.289> to<00:05:03.380> understand<00:05:03.860> is<00:05:04.070> that<00:05:04.100> there<00:05:04.639> are<00:05:04.789> no

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
need to understand is that there are no

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.850 
need to understand is that there are no
devices<00:05:05.330> that<00:05:05.960> can<00:05:06.080> actually<00:05:06.410> show<00:05:06.680> us

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
devices that can actually show us

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.760 
devices that can actually show us
prophoto<00:05:07.639> RGB<00:05:07.729> so<00:05:08.660> if<00:05:08.840> your<00:05:09.020> image<00:05:09.350> contains

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
prophoto RGB so if your image contains

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.920 
prophoto RGB so if your image contains
colors<00:05:10.190> that<00:05:10.430> are<00:05:10.580> way<00:05:10.789> out<00:05:11.030> here<00:05:11.300> for<00:05:11.449> example

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
colors that are way out here for example

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.960 
colors that are way out here for example
your<00:05:12.620> monitor<00:05:13.070> can't<00:05:13.310> show<00:05:13.490> it<00:05:13.520> to<00:05:13.639> you<00:05:13.789> and

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
your monitor can't show it to you and

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.390 
your monitor can't show it to you and
your<00:05:14.600> printer<00:05:14.960> can't<00:05:15.199> print<00:05:15.470> it<00:05:15.560> so<00:05:15.979> there<00:05:16.220> are

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
your printer can't print it so there are

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.310 
your printer can't print it so there are
some<00:05:16.669> reasons<00:05:17.090> to<00:05:17.180> stay<00:05:17.630> away<00:05:17.870> from<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:18.260> and

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
some reasons to stay away from it and

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.990 
some reasons to stay away from it and
we'll<00:05:18.440> get<00:05:18.590> into<00:05:18.860> that<00:05:19.010> more<00:05:19.160> in<00:05:19.430> software

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
we'll get into that more in software

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.450 
we'll get into that more in software
it'll<00:05:20.210> make<00:05:20.330> a<00:05:20.360> lot<00:05:20.600> more<00:05:20.780> sense<00:05:21.010> this<00:05:22.010> utility

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
it'll make a lot more sense this utility

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.159 
it'll make a lot more sense this utility
