00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
move it in all the states which your

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.350 
move it in all the states which your
typical<00:01:13.890> entity<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.400> move<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.880> this

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
typical entity then you move it in this

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.570 
typical entity then you move it in this
debate<00:01:15.630> stage<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.830> common<00:01:17.280> mistake

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
debate stage so the common mistake

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.399 
debate stage so the common mistake
people<00:01:17.610> make<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.390> don't<00:01:18.659> they're

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
people make is they don't they're

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.810 
people make is they don't they're
editing<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> wrong<00:01:20.220> state<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
editing in the wrong state and that

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
editing in the wrong state and that
happens<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.180> me<00:01:21.210> even<00:01:21.659> now<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> time<00:01:22.350> oh

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
happens to me even now all the time oh

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.289 
happens to me even now all the time oh
I'm<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.250> wrong<00:01:23.369> state<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.060> doesn't

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
I'm in the wrong state so it doesn't

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.580 
I'm in the wrong state so it doesn't
look<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.540> go<00:01:24.750> back<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.930> make<00:01:25.080> sure<00:01:25.140> editing

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
look right go back and make sure editing

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.260 
look right go back and make sure editing
the<00:01:25.650> right<00:01:25.770> state<00:01:25.979> base<00:01:26.520> state<00:01:26.790> allows<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the right state base state allows you to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.050 
the right state base state allows you to
mate<00:01:27.630> globally<00:01:28.350> where<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.460> individual

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
mate globally where the individual

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.910 
mate globally where the individual
states<00:01:30.270> allow<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.780> manipulate<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
states allow you to manipulate on that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.440 
states allow you to manipulate on that
state<00:01:32.100> level<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.909> I'm<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.119> get<00:01:33.270> rid<00:01:33.390> of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
state level so I'm going to get rid of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.940 
state level so I'm going to get rid of
this<00:01:33.570> from<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> Bay<00:01:34.229> State<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:36.740> just<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.829> make

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.410 
sure I'm cleared delete that and it's
not<00:01:44.280> any<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.549> my<00:01:44.610> other<00:01:44.759> states<00:01:45.030> that's<00:01:45.210> good

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
not any of my other states that's good

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.670 
not any of my other states that's good
so<00:01:45.509> I'm<00:01:45.570> go<00:01:45.720> back<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.990> base<00:01:46.140> state<00:01:46.380> I'm<00:01:46.560> gonna

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
so I'm go back to base state I'm gonna

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.289 
so I'm go back to base state I'm gonna
drag<00:01:46.860> out<00:01:47.009> five<00:01:47.250> buttons<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> state<00:01:48.000> on

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
drag out five buttons on the state on

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.480 
drag out five buttons on the state on
the<00:01:48.450> stage<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.829> grab<00:01:49.920> out<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.310> drag

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
five buttons and I would just kind of

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.230 
five buttons and I would just kind of
put<00:01:52.049> them<00:01:52.170> at<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.259> top<00:01:52.350> somewhere<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:54.119> put

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
put them at the top somewhere I just put

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:05.800 
put them at the top somewhere I just put
them<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.450> after<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> other

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
so you know in HTML where you build

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.410 
so you know in HTML where you build
pages<00:02:09.220> what<00:02:10.220> I'm<00:02:10.399> doing<00:02:10.640> others<00:02:10.819> using<00:02:11.030> stage

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
names state to state 3 state for and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.030 
names state to state 3 state for and
then<00:02:46.190> state<00:02:46.430> 5

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.809 

just<00:02:52.040> remember<00:02:52.280> if<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.400> want<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.610> move<00:02:52.700> these

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
just remember if you want to move these

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.160 
just remember if you want to move these
buttons<00:02:53.150> around<00:02:53.269> then<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.720> want<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.959> do<00:02:54.080> it

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
buttons around then you want to do it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.509 
buttons around then you want to do it
always<00:02:54.470> in<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.680> base<00:02:54.830> state<00:02:55.069> you<00:02:55.160> don't<00:02:55.310> do<00:02:55.459> in

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
always in the base state you don't do in

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.559 
always in the base state you don't do in
another<00:02:55.730> state<00:02:55.940> because<00:02:56.180> it'll<00:02:56.360> only<00:02:56.420> be

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
another state because it'll only be

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.809 
another state because it'll only be
moved<00:02:56.750> in<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:56.989> state<00:02:57.319> so<00:02:57.680> if<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.430> can<00:02:58.550> move

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
moved in that state so if you can move

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:59.830 
moved in that state so if you can move
them<00:02:58.940> around<00:02:59.060> globally<00:02:59.510> that's<00:02:59.660> what<00:02:59.750> you

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
them around globally that's what you

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.540 
them around globally that's what you
want<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.050> do<00:03:00.110> okay<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:00.950> we<00:03:01.040> have<00:03:01.069> these<00:03:01.280> states

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
want to do okay so we have these states

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.860 
want to do okay so we have these states
in<00:03:01.700> whack<00:03:01.879> when<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.180> click<00:03:02.390> on<00:03:02.510> one<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.720> actually

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
in whack when I click on one I actually

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.559 
in whack when I click on one I actually
want<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.200> go<00:03:03.379> to<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.590> state<00:03:03.800> and<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:05.180> if<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.420> go

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
want to go to a state and so if you go

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.970 
want to go to a state and so if you go
to<00:03:05.629> your<00:03:05.750> handout<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.290> have<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.590> code<00:03:06.800> in<00:03:06.950> your

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
to your handout I have that code in your

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.320 
to your handout I have that code in your
hand<00:03:07.220> out<00:03:07.370> right<00:03:07.580> now<00:03:07.760> let<00:03:07.879> me<00:03:07.910> go<00:03:08.060> there<00:03:08.180> right

now we're going to show you how to do

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.180 
now we're going to show you how to do
some<00:03:14.000> inline<00:03:14.360> action<00:03:14.720> scripting<00:03:15.049> today<00:03:18.190> right

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
some inline action scripting today right

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.550 
some inline action scripting today right
here<00:03:19.370> in<00:03:19.459> state<00:03:19.730> is<00:03:19.910> what's<00:03:20.120> called<00:03:20.440> this<00:03:21.440> is

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
here in state is what's called this is

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.110 
here in state is what's called this is
called<00:03:21.620> inline<00:03:22.069> action<00:03:22.670> scripting<00:03:22.970> but

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
called inline action scripting but

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.940 
called inline action scripting but
actually<00:03:23.360> put<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:23.660> on<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.900> button<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:24.799> it's

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
actually put this on the button so it's

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.610 
actually put this on the button so it's
click<00:03:25.220> equal<00:03:25.610> current<00:03:26.030> state<00:03:26.500> then<00:03:27.500> you've

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
click equal current state then you've

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.190 
click equal current state then you've
got<00:03:27.709> these<00:03:27.799> single<00:03:28.489> quotes<00:03:28.700> around<00:03:29.200> double

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
got these single quotes around double

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.440 
got these single quotes around double
quotes<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.819> that's<00:03:31.819> it<00:03:32.060> you're<00:03:32.150> going<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.329> go

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
quotes and that's it you're going to go

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.440 
quotes and that's it you're going to go
to<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.840> write<00:03:33.019> that<00:03:33.140> on<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.290> board<00:03:34.329> so<00:03:35.329> go

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
to so to write that on the board so go

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.940 
to so to write that on the board so go
to<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.569> dub<00:03:35.780> back<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.140> adobe<00:03:36.410> flex<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.799> bring

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
to a dub back to adobe flex and bring

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.850 
to a dub back to adobe flex and bring
that<00:03:36.980> up<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:40.510> this<00:03:41.510> is<00:03:41.660> gets<00:03:41.900> really<00:03:42.470> simple

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
that up and this is gets really simple

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.780 
that up and this is gets really simple
this<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.010> this<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.430> now<00:03:43.519> you're<00:03:43.610> going<00:03:43.730> to

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
this is this is now you're going to

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.250 
this is this is now you're going to
interplay<00:03:44.090> between<00:03:44.120> that<00:03:44.660> source<00:03:44.959> code<00:03:45.230> and

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
interplay between that source code and

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.410 
interplay between that source code and
design<00:03:45.680> code<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.489> whatever<00:03:46.670> button<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.209> click

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
design code so whatever button you click

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.910 
design code so whatever button you click
on<00:03:47.629> it's<00:03:47.840> going<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.019> take<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.319> that<00:03:48.560> part

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
on it's going to take you to that part

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.670 
on it's going to take you to that part
of<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.069> code<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:50.120> highlight<00:03:50.599> state<00:03:51.170> one<00:03:51.440> for

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680

example that button and just go to
source<00:03:54.379> code<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:55.540> there's<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.690> code<00:03:56.900> right

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
source code and there's the code right

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.660 
source code and there's the code right
there<00:03:59.410> and<00:04:00.410> you<00:04:00.530> can<00:04:00.620> see<00:04:00.829> there's<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.400> button

up just a little bit and hit your

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.620 
up just a little bit and hit your
spacebar<00:04:06.829> and<00:04:07.340> when<00:04:07.819> you<00:04:07.880> do<00:04:08.000> this<00:04:08.180> whole<00:04:08.359> list

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
spacebar and when you do this whole list

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.009 
spacebar and when you do this whole list
comes<00:04:08.870> up<00:04:08.989> do<00:04:09.079> you<00:04:09.139> see<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.349> list<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.780> this

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
comes up do you see that list and this

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.150 
comes up do you see that list and this
is<00:04:12.170> one<00:04:12.319> of<00:04:12.349> the<00:04:12.470> really<00:04:12.590> powerful<00:04:12.829> things

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
is one of the really powerful things

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.250 
is one of the really powerful things
about<00:04:13.340> Dobie<00:04:13.609> flex<00:04:13.819> is<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.120> code<00:04:14.359> hinting<00:04:14.540> so

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
about Dobie flex is this code hinting so

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.589 
about Dobie flex is this code hinting so
if<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.500> just<00:04:15.709> start<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.250> type<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.760> letter<00:04:16.970> let's

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599 
if I just start to type the letter let's

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.199 
if I just start to type the letter let's
start<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.900> type<00:04:18.049> click<00:04:18.669> you<00:04:19.669> can<00:04:19.700> see<00:04:19.970> there<00:04:20.150> it

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
start to type click you can see there it

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.940 
start to type click you can see there it
is<00:04:20.269> it<00:04:20.450> appeared<00:04:20.780> after<00:04:20.900> CL<00:04:21.349> so<00:04:21.650> it<00:04:21.709> kind<00:04:21.889> of

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
is it appeared after CL so it kind of

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.070 
is it appeared after CL so it kind of
has<00:04:22.460> some<00:04:22.610> smart<00:04:22.910> intelligence<00:04:23.330> double<00:04:23.870> click

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
has some smart intelligence double click

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.839 
has some smart intelligence double click
on<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:24.229> it<00:04:24.650> automatically<00:04:25.490> puts<00:04:25.550> those

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
on that it automatically puts those

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.120 
on that it automatically puts those
quotes<00:04:26.180> in<00:04:26.389> for<00:04:26.630> me<00:04:26.780> so<00:04:27.740> I'm<00:04:27.830> go<00:04:27.919> ahead<00:04:28.039> and

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
quotes in for me so I'm go ahead and

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.670 
quotes in for me so I'm go ahead and
type<00:04:28.250> in<00:04:28.430> current<00:04:29.710> state<00:04:32.139> equals<00:04:33.139> x<00:04:33.260> you<00:04:33.320> have

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
type in current state equals x you have

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.420 
type in current state equals x you have
to<00:04:33.830> use<00:04:33.919> my<00:04:34.070> single<00:04:34.400> quotes<00:04:36.580> state<00:04:37.900> 01<00:04:39.220> now<00:04:40.220> at

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
to use my single quotes state 01 now at

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.700 
to use my single quotes state 01 now at
this<00:04:40.550> point<00:04:40.849> I<00:04:41.150> don't<00:04:41.599> want<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.080> do<00:04:42.169> this<00:04:42.320> over

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
this point I don't want to do this over

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.250 
this point I don't want to do this over
and<00:04:42.800> over<00:04:42.889> again<00:04:43.130> alright<00:04:43.849> so<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:44.870> just<00:04:45.110> come

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
and over again alright so I just come

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.000 
and over again alright so I just come
along<00:04:45.440> just<00:04:45.590> copy<00:04:45.860> this<00:04:46.099> code<00:04:46.340> right<00:04:46.400> here<00:04:48.010> see

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
along just copy this code right here see

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.809 
along just copy this code right here see
that<00:04:49.190> and

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.010 

just<00:04:53.819> open<00:04:53.940> up<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.240> next<00:04:54.419> one<00:04:54.539> and<00:04:54.599> paste<00:04:54.870> it

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
just open up the next one and paste it

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.170 
just open up the next one and paste it
in<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.770> now<00:04:56.669> you're<00:04:56.759> going<00:04:56.879> to<00:04:56.940> know<00:04:57.000> why<00:04:57.150> I

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
in and now you're going to know why I

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.570 
in and now you're going to know why I
used<00:04:57.479> an<00:04:57.629> idiot's<00:04:57.990> technique<00:04:58.379> of<00:04:58.530> naming<00:04:58.949> got

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
used an idiot's technique of naming got

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.430 
used an idiot's technique of naming got
state<00:04:59.819> 01<00:05:00.090> 02<00:05:00.300> 03<00:05:00.479> because<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.050> didn't<00:05:01.289> want<00:05:01.319> to

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
state 01 02 03 because I didn't want to

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.469 
state 01 02 03 because I didn't want to
do<00:05:01.710> more<00:05:01.860> than<00:05:02.009> just<00:05:02.069> backspace<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.090> hit<00:05:03.270> two

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
do more than just backspace to hit two

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:04.820 
do more than just backspace to hit two
in<00:05:03.509> there<00:05:03.780> see<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.199> pretty<00:05:04.409> easy<00:05:04.560> just<00:05:04.710> to

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
in there see it's pretty easy just to

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.409 
in there see it's pretty easy just to
put<00:05:04.979> all<00:05:05.069> those<00:05:05.190> in<00:05:05.340> there<00:05:05.520> so<00:05:05.940> go<00:05:06.090> ahead<00:05:06.210> and

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
put all those in there so go ahead and

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.600 
put all those in there so go ahead and
put<00:05:06.569> all<00:05:06.599> your<00:05:07.310> your<00:05:08.310> states<00:05:08.639> in<00:05:08.789> there<00:05:09.000> and

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
put all your your states in there and

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.930 
put all your your states in there and
this<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:11.759> 3<00:05:14.960> and<00:05:16.340> put<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.400> next<00:05:17.580> one<00:05:17.639> in<00:05:17.819> there

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
this is 3 and put the next one in there

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:29.480 
this is 3 and put the next one in there
let<00:05:18.090> that<00:05:18.120> be<00:05:18.330> four

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.280 

05<00:05:30.490> and<00:05:30.940> that's<00:05:31.240> it<00:05:31.420> then<00:05:31.900> you<00:05:31.960> go<00:05:32.050> ahead<00:05:32.200> and

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
05 and that's it then you go ahead and

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.930 
05 and that's it then you go ahead and
save<00:05:32.470> that<00:05:32.500> and<00:05:32.890> just<00:05:33.250> see<00:05:33.430> if<00:05:33.460> any<00:05:33.610> errors

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
save that and just see if any errors

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.550 
save that and just see if any errors
appear<00:05:34.270> and<00:05:34.870> if<00:05:34.960> they<00:05:35.050> don't<00:05:35.170> you<00:05:35.320> should<00:05:35.470> be

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
appear and if they don't you should be

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.140 
appear and if they don't you should be
in<00:05:35.650> pretty<00:05:35.770> good<00:05:35.830> shape<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.850> I<00:05:36.970> would<00:05:37.120> go

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
in pretty good shape and I would go

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.580 
in pretty good shape and I would go
right<00:05:37.480> after<00:05:37.660> you're<00:05:37.840> done<00:05:37.960> go<00:05:38.110> right<00:05:38.320> back<00:05:38.440> to

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
right after you're done go right back to

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.840 
right after you're done go right back to
design<00:05:38.740> view<00:05:38.950> and<00:05:39.160> I'm<00:05:39.310> walk<00:05:39.460> around<00:05:39.730> and<00:05:39.820> see

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
design view and I'm walk around and see

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.350 
design view and I'm walk around and see
how<00:05:40.030> everyone's<00:05:40.390> doing<00:05:45.060> okay<00:05:46.060> so<00:05:46.180> what<00:05:46.270> we're

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
how everyone's doing okay so what we're

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.100 
how everyone's doing okay so what we're
going<00:05:46.450> to<00:05:46.540> do<00:05:46.630> right<00:05:46.780> now<00:05:46.930> we're<00:05:47.020> gonna

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
going to do right now we're gonna

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.150 
going to do right now we're gonna
actually<00:05:47.200> run<00:05:47.470> this<00:05:47.590> project<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:48.010> same<00:05:48.130> thing

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
actually run this project and same thing

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.530 
actually run this project and same thing
happens<00:05:48.670> now<00:05:48.760> how<00:05:48.850> do<00:05:48.910> you<00:05:49.030> run<00:05:49.120> a<00:05:49.180> project

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
happens now how do you run a project

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.640 
happens now how do you run a project
make<00:05:49.660> sure<00:05:49.720> you<00:05:49.810> clicked<00:05:50.080> on<00:05:50.170> the<00:05:50.290> inside<00:05:50.560> your

because there's nothing different on all

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.940 
because there's nothing different on all
the<00:06:22.090> different<00:06:22.210> stages<00:06:22.630> I<00:06:22.990> mean<00:06:23.140> all<00:06:23.290> so<00:06:23.890> it

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
the different stages I mean all so it

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.080 
the different stages I mean all so it
all<00:06:24.100> looks<00:06:24.130> the<00:06:24.370> same<00:06:24.460> so<00:06:24.670> we're<00:06:24.910> going<00:06:25.000> to

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
all looks the same so we're going to

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.550 
all looks the same so we're going to
come<00:06:25.420> along<00:06:25.600> here<00:06:25.720> and<00:06:25.750> put<00:06:25.900> some<00:06:25.990> labels<00:06:26.410> on

come along here and put some labels on

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.530 
come along here and put some labels on
here<00:06:26.860> so<00:06:27.280> we<00:06:27.370> actually<00:06:27.520> see<00:06:27.790> it<00:06:27.910> change<00:06:28.180> okay

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
here so we actually see it change okay

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.570 
here so we actually see it change okay
so<00:06:29.110> let's<00:06:29.290> come<00:06:29.410> along<00:06:29.620> and<00:06:29.770> add<00:06:29.920> some<00:06:30.130> labels

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
so let's come along and add some labels

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.700 
so let's come along and add some labels
because<00:06:30.870> this<00:06:31.870> is<00:06:31.990> the<00:06:32.080> first<00:06:32.260> time<00:06:32.350> I<00:06:32.470> built<00:06:32.650> a

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
because this is the first time I built a

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.200 
because this is the first time I built a
state<00:06:32.950> I<00:06:32.980> would<00:06:33.130> oh<00:06:33.250> my<00:06:33.400> god<00:06:33.580> it<00:06:33.790> doesn't<00:06:33.970> work

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
state I would oh my god it doesn't work

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.420 
state I would oh my god it doesn't work
but<00:06:34.330> it<00:06:34.450> does<00:06:34.600> work<00:06:34.630> it's<00:06:35.470> just<00:06:35.770> you<00:06:35.860> can't

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
but it does work it's just you can't

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.290 
but it does work it's just you can't
tell<00:06:36.580> the<00:06:36.670> difference<00:06:36.820> they're<00:06:37.060> all<00:06:37.150> the<00:06:37.270> same

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
tell the difference they're all the same

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.700 
tell the difference they're all the same
so<00:06:37.570> what<00:06:37.660> I'm<00:06:37.720> gonna<00:06:37.810> do<00:06:37.900> is<00:06:37.960> come<00:06:38.170> along<00:06:38.350> here

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
and just so I can differentiate between

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.020 
and just so I can differentiate between
the<00:06:40.960> states<00:06:41.170> I'm<00:06:41.320> gonna<00:06:41.470> go<00:06:41.560> to<00:06:41.620> state<00:06:41.890> 1<00:06:42.160> see

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
the states I'm gonna go to state 1 see

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:53.289 

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:57.299 

and<00:07:53.860> when<00:07:54.849> you<00:07:54.939> do<00:07:55.059> that<00:07:55.860> you<00:07:56.860> should<00:07:56.949> see<00:07:57.159> that

00:07:57.299 --> 00:07:57.309 
and when you do that you should see that

00:07:57.309 --> 00:08:00.149 
and when you do that you should see that
you<00:07:57.550> should<00:07:57.699> see<00:07:57.849> them<00:07:57.939> changing<00:07:59.039> move<00:08:00.039> that

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 
you should see them changing move that

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:03.359 
you should see them changing move that
over<00:08:00.189> you<00:08:00.399> can<00:08:00.520> see<00:08:00.610> that<00:08:01.169> two<00:08:02.169> three<00:08:02.830> four

00:08:03.359 --> 00:08:03.369 
over you can see that two three four

00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:06.149 
over you can see that two three four
five<00:08:04.139> so<00:08:05.139> now<00:08:05.259> you<00:08:05.319> have<00:08:05.409> different<00:08:05.770> things<00:08:06.009> at

00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:06.159 
five so now you have different things at

00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:07.379 
five so now you have different things at
different<00:08:06.189> stages<00:08:06.580> so<00:08:06.879> that's<00:08:07.059> pretty<00:08:07.210> cool

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:07.389 
different stages so that's pretty cool

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:09.149 
different stages so that's pretty cool
and<00:08:07.629> that<00:08:08.319> was<00:08:08.439> one<00:08:08.589> of<00:08:08.649> the<00:08:08.710> things<00:08:08.830> we<00:08:08.979> had

00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:09.159 
and that was one of the things we had

00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:10.529 
and that was one of the things we had
problems<00:08:09.490> with<00:08:09.550> my<00:08:09.699> first<00:08:09.849> start<00:08:10.119> doing<00:08:10.419> this

00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:10.539 
problems with my first start doing this

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:12.089 
problems with my first start doing this
we<00:08:10.749> couldn't<00:08:10.960> tell<00:08:11.080> the<00:08:11.169> difference<00:08:11.199> so<00:08:11.589> you

00:08:12.089 --> 00:08:12.099 
we couldn't tell the difference so you

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:13.230 
we couldn't tell the difference so you
got<00:08:12.189> to<00:08:12.279> put<00:08:12.399> something<00:08:12.580> on<00:08:12.699> the<00:08:12.849> stage<00:08:13.029> so<00:08:13.180> you

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.240 
got to put something on the stage so you

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.839 
got to put something on the stage so you
can<00:08:13.360> see<00:08:13.479> it<00:08:13.889> go<00:08:14.889> ahead<00:08:15.099> and<00:08:15.189> stop<00:08:15.399> this<00:08:15.610> and

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:15.849 
can see it go ahead and stop this and

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:20.249 
can see it go ahead and stop this and
then<00:08:15.969> all<00:08:16.469> will<00:08:17.469> start<00:08:17.649> the<00:08:17.710> next<00:08:17.830> section
