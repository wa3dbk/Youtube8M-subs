00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.730
 One day I took a taxi to the 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.730
 airport 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.010
 We were running in the right lane. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.040
 when suddenly a black car came out 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.930
 so parking nothing of our 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.230
 front 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.330
 the taxi driver abruptly stepped on the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.160
 car slid 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.460
 he escaped from hitting the other car 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.370
 even though it was for a very very sad 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.010
 little month 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.309
 ra the driver of the black car shook the 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.989
 And started to scream at us. 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.789
 He took his arm out and made that gesture. 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.739
 With your hand you know what it is that does not 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:53.539
 I'm going to speak in the face. I was very nervous. 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.210
 but now look how interesting 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.479
 the taxi driver who was taking me 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.059
 He just smiled and waved. 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:06.590
 to the other guy and made a sign like that 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:11.560
 positive and he made it a 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.710
 way it tastes so natural so friendly 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.299
 I was thinking about that outraged 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.000
 by the way what was done and is done 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.590
 Positive because of the smile on the face. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.060
 This guy almost ruined his car. 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.729
 It was then that the cab driver 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.720
 taught that what I now call the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:35.200
 That's the truth. 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.119
 besides the garbage truck they 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.229
 explained that many people are like 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.459
 garbage trucks 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:48.990
 people walk around loaded 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:53.159
 full of frustrations full of anger 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:58.830
 full of traumas of disappointment 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.830
 stressed nerves 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.620
 then as their daughters of garbage 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620
 grow up 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.600
 these people need a place to 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.900
 download and sometimes load on top 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.900
 of people 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.540

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.730

 It's his problem, it's the other's problem. 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.750
 person of the other driver of the 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:40.760
 is driving the garbage truck 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.760
 smile wave 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.310
 I always wish well and go ahead 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.470
 do not take the trash from these people and 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.909
 nor spread it over other people in the 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:58.599
 work at home or on the streets 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:02.440
