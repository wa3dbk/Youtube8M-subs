to get a seal to where you are able to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.189 
to get a seal to where you are able to
let<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:57.180> index<00:00:57.420> card<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:57.960> holding

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
let go and the index card is now holding

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.549 
let go and the index card is now holding
the<00:00:58.440> water<00:00:58.649> absolutely<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.940> its<00:01:00.120> own<00:01:00.559> just

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
the water absolutely on its own just

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.370 
the water absolutely on its own just
from<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> suction

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.260 

and<00:01:08.740> if<00:01:09.070> we<00:01:09.189> move<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.460> index<00:01:09.729> card<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:13.090> water

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
and if we move the index card the water

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.780 
and if we move the index card the water
will<00:01:13.479> fall<00:01:13.689> out<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:15.250> first<00:01:15.280> trick<00:01:15.549> was

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
will fall out so the first trick was

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
fairly easy we will now move on to the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.690 
two or three of those and it should be
pretty<00:01:49.450> equivalent<00:01:50.280> next<00:01:51.280> you're<00:01:51.369> gonna<00:01:51.429> want

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
pretty equivalent next you're gonna want

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.340 
pretty equivalent next you're gonna want
to<00:01:51.729> stir<00:01:51.909> it<00:01:51.940> very<00:01:52.240> well<00:01:52.569> to<00:01:52.869> make<00:01:53.020> sure<00:01:53.050> the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
to stir it very well to make sure the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.460 
to stir it very well to make sure the
salt<00:01:53.530> is<00:01:53.770> fully<00:01:54.009> dissolved<00:01:54.340> inside<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.179> water

after you have the salt water nice and
stirred<00:02:01.030> you're<00:02:01.149> gonna<00:02:01.270> want<00:02:01.509> ahead<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:01.960> pick

two to three drops and stir that up as
well<00:02:11.850> now<00:02:12.850> here<00:02:13.209> is<00:02:13.360> where<00:02:13.540> things<00:02:13.750> get<00:02:14.019> a

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
well now here is where things get a

little bit tricky you're gonna want to

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.600 
little bit tricky you're gonna want to
keep<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.989> glass<00:02:17.260> with<00:02:17.650> salt<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.280> make<00:02:18.430> sure

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
keep the glass with salt and make sure

index card on with we did before get a

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.330 
index card on with we did before get a
nice<00:02:26.590> firm<00:02:26.920> grip<00:02:26.980> on<00:02:27.459> it<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.820> nice<00:02:28.480> seal<00:02:29.220> flip<00:02:30.220> it

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
nice firm grip on it a nice seal flip it

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.410 
nice firm grip on it a nice seal flip it
upside<00:02:30.730> down<00:02:32.640> wait<00:02:33.640> till<00:02:33.820> we<00:02:33.880> get<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.180> seal

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
upside down wait till we get that seal

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.110 
upside down wait till we get that seal
on<00:02:34.600> it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.059 

once<00:02:40.750> we<00:02:40.900> have<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.170> seal<00:02:41.440> we<00:02:41.620> are<00:02:41.739> going<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:41.980> go

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
once we have the seal we are going to go

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.369 
once we have the seal we are going to go
ahead<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.670> place<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:42.940> on<00:02:43.269> top<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.200> other

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
ahead and place it on top of the other

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.930 
ahead and place it on top of the other
glass<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:46.569> we<00:02:47.440> will<00:02:47.560> very<00:02:47.800> carefully<00:02:48.129> and<00:02:48.670> try

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
glass and we will very carefully and try

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.589 
glass and we will very carefully and try
to<00:02:49.060> steadily<00:02:49.930> remove<00:02:50.379> this<00:02:51.060> index<00:02:52.060> card<00:02:52.360> which

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
to steadily remove this index card which

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.680 
to steadily remove this index card which
is<00:02:52.629> the<00:02:52.840> most<00:02:54.030> complicated<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.450> difficult

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
is the most complicated and difficult

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:08.490 
is the most complicated and difficult
part<00:02:56.290> of<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:57.340> trick

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.140 

the<00:03:08.890> cup<00:03:09.100> should<00:03:09.280> now<00:03:09.370> be<00:03:09.490> pretty<00:03:09.700> much<00:03:09.850> sealed

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
the cup should now be pretty much sealed

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.780 
the cup should now be pretty much sealed
together<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.990> if<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.800> can<00:03:11.980> see<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.490> little<00:03:12.670> bit

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
together and if you can see a little bit

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.360 
together and if you can see a little bit
of<00:03:12.850> leaking<00:03:13.240> there<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.680> bottom<00:03:14.920> is<00:03:15.190> going<00:03:15.310> to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
of leaking there the bottom is going to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.890 
of leaking there the bottom is going to
be<00:03:15.430> much<00:03:15.760> lighter<00:03:16.060> than<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.360> top<00:03:16.600> this<00:03:16.840> is

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
be much lighter than the top this is

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.300 
be much lighter than the top this is
because<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.410> food<00:03:17.560> coloring<00:03:17.770> is<00:03:18.070> gonna

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
because the food coloring is gonna

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.040 
because the food coloring is gonna
dominantly<00:03:18.790> stay<00:03:19.090> on<00:03:19.240> the<00:03:19.360> top<00:03:19.570> where<00:03:19.930> there

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
dominantly stay on the top where there

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.450 
dominantly stay on the top where there
is<00:03:20.170> no<00:03:20.350> salt<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.770> salt<00:03:20.950> will<00:03:21.130> stay<00:03:21.280> on<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
is no salt the salt will stay on the

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.010 
is no salt the salt will stay on the
bottom<00:03:21.640> more<00:03:21.940> because<00:03:22.210> it<00:03:22.330> is<00:03:22.360> heavier<00:03:22.780> and

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
bottom more because it is heavier and

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.530 
bottom more because it is heavier and
food<00:03:23.950> colored<00:03:24.250> water<00:03:24.490> is<00:03:24.820> lighter<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:25.510> a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
food colored water is lighter so a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.440 
food colored water is lighter so a
little<00:03:25.720> stay<00:03:25.990> on<00:03:26.140> top<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.880> can<00:03:28.000> also<00:03:28.150> tell

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
little stay on top and you can also tell

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.640 
little stay on top and you can also tell
that<00:03:28.600> this<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.900> little<00:03:29.140> bit<00:03:29.260> more<00:03:29.350> foggy

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
that this is a little bit more foggy

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.990 
that this is a little bit more foggy
than<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.040> top<00:03:30.250> is<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.520> will<00:03:36.640> end<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:36.970> for

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
than the top is so that will end it for

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.240 
than the top is so that will end it for
today's<00:03:37.330> tricks<00:03:37.720> but<00:03:37.990> before<00:03:38.380> I<00:03:38.410> go<00:03:38.860> if

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
today's tricks but before I go if

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.720 
today's tricks but before I go if
anybody<00:03:39.940> ever<00:03:40.380> challenges<00:03:41.380> you<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:42.160> straw

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
anybody ever challenges you to a straw

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.790 
anybody ever challenges you to a straw
water<00:03:43.240> competition<00:03:44.080> which<00:03:44.230> probably<00:03:44.470> doesn't

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
water competition which probably doesn't

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.650 
water competition which probably doesn't
exist<00:03:44.890> but<00:03:45.700> I'm<00:03:45.790> sure<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.090> could<00:03:46.240> somewhere

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
exist but I'm sure it could somewhere

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.900 
exist but I'm sure it could somewhere
and<00:03:46.870> they<00:03:47.770> want<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.010> see<00:03:48.160> how<00:03:48.280> fast<00:03:48.580> you<00:03:48.760> can

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
and they want to see how fast you can

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.730 
and they want to see how fast you can
fill<00:03:49.180> up<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.660> other<00:03:49.810> glass<00:03:50.080> with<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.530> water

fill up the other glass with the water

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.460 
fill up the other glass with the water
by<00:03:51.190> transferring<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.910> with<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.060> straw<00:03:52.450> don't<00:03:53.320> do

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
by transferring it with a straw don't do

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.450 
by transferring it with a straw don't do
it<00:03:53.590> like<00:03:53.740> this<00:03:56.910> do<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.060> like<00:03:58.210> this
