00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.670
 1200 spectators got in the second Ferrari is a lot for her 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.709
 Offered admission 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.320
 in the 5 2-home victory of the Schweinfurt Mighty Dogs on the Hartz IV and call 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.550
 20 not only 15 goals but also a whole series of penalties 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.630
 especially the coolest escaped with increasing backlog of the 

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:26.980
 playing area 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.149
 the question how high he expected to fail 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.149
 despite the later date already decided 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.559
 The referee performance should never be commented on him Award 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.800
 the solar title allows 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.040
 44 minutes sent the boards pointed against the plexiglass 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.380
 In addition, there are two ten-minute penalties for a game misconduct penalty 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380
 listen and be amazed for the Bulls' caretaker 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.040
 but the guilt is certainly less to look at the referees than rather 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.650
 at the 0 4 degrees the bag of the opponent 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.250
 it is a sporty behavior 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.400
 us to other athletes 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.750
 Euro one percent more cars on the German hiking seal box fuller 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.440
 and he worked well 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.450
 one takes into account that the guests anyway only with twelve man never 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.220
 a man had started 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.940
 the cyclists were shipped as hopelessly south to seven times the docks 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.020
 especially the victory was held that evening, the man of the match kept meeting 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.250
 three times and dusts all seven assists to success 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.020
 It started because I believe the lead roles 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.350
 Married in 1950 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.540
 first of all worry 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.320
 for the time being or Wales was saved 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.540
 already after the first third that the Ducks won 6 2 1 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.610
 a decision had been made 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.990
 only good that the water pipes are not at the whim of the opponent 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.160
 let sunbathe be presented again in magnificent playful mood 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.800
 Sergei WaÃŸmiller here with the 4 to 1 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.130
 only in the middle third was the spectators a balanced game 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.599
 offered in those Sonthofen whether the suddenly discovered passion 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.539
 the Mighty Dogs will be much more demanding 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:18.549
 two hits from four relaxed on two offside screwed the 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.549
 Intermediate on an 8 to 3 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.889
 but then left the will again to the guests and with him left the 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.049
 Guests again often the ice in the direction of cool box 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.790
 The more women in the last 20 minutes certainly still the one or 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.799
 can refill another gate 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.199
 looking forward to coming tasks Stoneman but something the m-net Schwank here 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.609
 with the goal to 12 to 3 m stood these are now the last four home games 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.359
 It looks pretty good as the results of thirds follows Mark lost law 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.749
 six points ahead of Dortmund 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.829
 7 4 is just like that 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.459
 especially now quickly create that he convinced and on 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.069
 let's keep looking 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.599
 so there was after the 2 1 met secondly, she is still a third reason to celebrate 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.199
 the play-off feature is almost done 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.869
 everything could already be clear with a home victory on Friday over Memmingen 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.869
 be made 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.299
 humorous and
