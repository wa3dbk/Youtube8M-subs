blue so now make sure that samsung kies
isn't<00:02:33.800> running<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.250> background<00:02:34.990> okay<00:02:35.990> so

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
isn't running in the background okay so

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.470 
isn't running in the background okay so
once<00:02:37.250> you've<00:02:37.400> extracted<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.120> file<00:02:38.300> we

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
once you've extracted the file we

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.600 
once you've extracted the file we
downloaded<00:02:38.510> from<00:02:39.080> link<00:02:39.320> 3<00:02:39.620> we'd<00:02:40.190> have<00:02:40.400> all

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
downloaded from link 3 we'd have all

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.660 
downloaded from link 3 we'd have all
these<00:02:40.760> files<00:02:41.090> here<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:43.250> basically

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
these files here so you just basically

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.260 
these files here so you just basically
select<00:02:44.420> AP<00:02:45.310> for<00:02:46.310> AP<00:02:48.130> with<00:02:49.130> ok<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:49.970> give<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.209> a

select AP for AP with ok just give it a

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.180 
select AP for AP with ok just give it a
couple<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.510> seconds<00:02:50.870> checks<00:02:51.230> for<00:02:51.410> md5<00:02:51.890> it

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
couple of seconds checks for md5 it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.190 
couple of seconds checks for md5 it
might<00:02:52.400> seem<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.880> uh<00:02:53.060> not<00:02:53.330> respond<00:02:53.840> just<00:02:54.020> give

there you go guys we are done so at this

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.390 
there you go guys we are done so at this
point<00:03:56.930> we<00:03:57.350> are<00:03:57.380> done<00:03:57.530> with<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.739> PC<00:03:58.040> part<00:03:58.280> of

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
point we are done with the PC part of

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.850 
point we are done with the PC part of
this<00:03:58.519> tutorial<00:03:59.030> so<00:03:59.360> we<00:03:59.780> can<00:03:59.930> go<00:04:00.080> ahead<00:04:00.200> close

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
this tutorial so we can go ahead close

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.610 
this tutorial so we can go ahead close
this<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.269> know<00:04:02.390> three<00:04:02.720> would<00:04:02.930> not<00:04:03.080> reboot

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
this and you know three would not reboot

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.979 
this and you know three would not reboot
so<00:04:04.220> just<00:04:04.880> wait<00:04:05.060> for<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.420> boot<00:04:05.510> back<00:04:05.750> up

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
so just wait for it to boot back up

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.990 
so just wait for it to boot back up

will<00:04:08.180> always<00:04:08.570> take<00:04:08.750> longer<00:04:09.080> than<00:04:09.290> your

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
will always take longer than your

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.620 
will always take longer than your
regular<00:04:09.560> boot<00:04:09.890> times<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:10.850> do<00:04:11.000> not<00:04:11.120> panic<00:04:11.330> if

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
regular boot times so do not panic if

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.300 
regular boot times so do not panic if
this<00:04:11.810> takes<00:04:12.019> about<00:04:12.200> five<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.590> 10<00:04:12.860> minutes

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
again that's normal so at this point you

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.550 
again that's normal so at this point you
can<00:04:16.700> you<00:04:17.030> can<00:04:17.180> also<00:04:17.330> disconnect<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.260> micro
