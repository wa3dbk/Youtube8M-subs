00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello youtube people my name is 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.790
 robert arium and I bring you the gta 3 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.980
 multiplayer well as you can notice 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.080
 this is my first video I hope so 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.670
 serve them like and subscribe already 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.670
 that I have zero subscribers 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.570
 well to start they need the gta 3 and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.949
 also two more files that I will upload 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.949
 mediafire ya 4 jared 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.910
 first we open the file then they 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.740
 will leave an installer give him to next 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.390
 and then they have to put where it is 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.120
 located hold three and then to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.219
 next and nothing else 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.840
 then do not be excited to open it 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.590
 because to make it work you have to 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.590
 put the crack 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.480
 to the crack we give right click and extract 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.820
 here 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.770
 if you ask them for password they put rogert 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.770
 adium and it will automatically be extracted 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.480
 ah 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.610
 we right click on your gta icon 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.830
 3 and look for where it says open location 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:10.050
 of the file now drag the crack to 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.180
 the folder of your gta 3 and if you tell them if 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.180
 you want to replace you give him like that 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.240
 and now if you want you can erase 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.640
 the crash since we will not use it anymore 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.090
 Y 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.549
 i 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.439
 now we enter the light file and you 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.509
 to click on Internet and official and them 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.310
 the list of servers will come out but I already 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.299
 I have my server that's why I give him 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.299
 only the cndh 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.650
 excuse me if it looks bad is because I'm 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.840
 recording with canvas and study 7 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.970
 as you will see the game is already some 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.740
 I asked them to put the CD-2 in this 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.430
 case you can see perfectly that 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.430
 works correctly 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.440
 on some servers it will ask you to 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.270
 register put diagonal bar and 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.460
 register space your password and 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.290
 then press the enter key and then 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.420
 the control key to select your 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.550
 good character that 's all I hope that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.900
 serve them subscribe if it served you and we 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.900
 we see in a next video 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.610
 ah 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.870
 ah I forgot to tell you that if you get them 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.030
 some error when entering the game 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.220
 simply train your gta 3 and in 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.989
 screen settings change the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.810
 resolution to anyone but yes or yes 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.610
 have the x 32 at the end well that 's it 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.650
 Any problem notify me and also 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.650
