00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.360
 Well I think it's a time for 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.910
 be excited not any euphoria if 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.119
 a big illusion not because the goal 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.430
 logically it is closer 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.410
 I think we have a very good line 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.080
 already for a long time I think there 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.150
 to talk about all the positive leads 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.520
 this this team doing during 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.950
 many days and I think it 's a 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.420
 exciting moment not to transmit it to the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.319
 hobby what they are with that 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.149
 illusion from minute one on Sunday and 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:45.909
 For our part, we are going to 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.710
 continue working in the same way 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.359
 to achieve the objective as soon as possible 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.329
 possible 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:55.510
 well I think that throughout the year I 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.969
 I have been improving, I have been improving in each 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.260
 in every game I think that now I'm 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.589
 at a good time 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.189
 I am enjoying many parties 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.070
 followed in this club to do it with a 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.170
 tremendous security every Sunday and with 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.119
 very much desire to work every 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.560
 Sunday to keep improving no no I 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.930
 It's worth what I've done so far 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.090
 but I want I want more I want to continue 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.210
 working I want to be better goalkeeper every 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.190
 Sunday and hopefully next year 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.039
 can also be demonstrated first 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.500
 division that is where I want to be good 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.630
 We have been going a long time since 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.119
 I think we are 20 we have lost them 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.610
 only one game I think with the 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.890
 arrival of merino there was a change of 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.950
 mentality must be said there are 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.619
 saying it like that was able to change us that 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.380
 chip that good that the team was is 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.140
 in a complicated situation we did everything 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.880
 is a step forward and from there 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.950
 we have had a lot of continuity 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.350
 has gained in confidence because the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.740
 results have been given every day 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.920
 and now we are in a moment more 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.220
 quiet I do not think that people 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.170
 it does not have so much pressure because 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.110
 the team is here is first one 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.480
 difference of points and that makes the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.060
 final every Sunday play with less 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.540
 pressure and that things come out a lot 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.360
 better if it's what I'm telling you, I do not think 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.209
 which is a very good moment 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.730
 in which unbeatable good not all 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.010
 we talked about arriving in April in 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.590
 this situation that also by far 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.500
 of points about the third I think 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.980
 which is an unbeatable situation but 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.319
 can only create illusion if we believe 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.830
 that is all done when there are 27 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.140
 points to play we would be wrong 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.959
 I think it's a good time to be 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.900
 happy for we have a line 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.200
 very good but nothing of conformism 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.390
 to lower your arms and think you're 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.269
 all done not so much excitement 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.810
 because the goal is closer but 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.080
 that stays there good is a match 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.090
 logically with two clubs 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.590
 that most of its history has been 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.370
 passed in the first division but that 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.590
 now we are in second in 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.660
 different situations they carry 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.390
 several days without no win and come to 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.730
 our field with a lot of desire 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.210
 of doing it to get your 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.070
 goal that getting into play or not is a 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.630
 party surely that is very nice 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.480
 because it's going to be Sunday at 2 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.790
 the morning the stadium will be beautiful the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.710
 people will be cheering from minute 1 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.020
 and before an opponent that is going to be 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.120
 very complicated and as I said before 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.140
 with a story behind first 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.420
 good edition I think I speak I speak 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.270
 very much with him I do not have a good 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.270
 relationship with him luckily I've spent 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.810
 situations very similar to yours in 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.910
 the quarry of madrid and good my advice 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.580
 is that among all of us who are 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.459
 around you have to help him not he has 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.050
 to be focused on giving the maximum each 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.269
 Sunday as he is doing is 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.450
 being fundamental to us and is a 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.950
 important player today 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.829
 in our team not capable of 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.720
 revolutionize a party on its own but 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.930
 he has to have his feet on the ground 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.450
 know what to follow 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.690
 working so it's very young that everything 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.690
 what is around many times is not 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.270
 It's not as pretty as they want it 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.639
 paint and have to have maturity 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.849
 enough to make a good decision 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.039
 and I think that 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.189
 have a moment to give you a 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.529
 continuity and doing it in a big club 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:53.600
 as is the betis that will help 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:56.240
 grow 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.040
 to continue enjoying minutes already 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.440
 continue to be important I think that 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.100
 among all of us who are around is 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.180
 that you have to help him good 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.250
 I have one very clear thing that I am 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.490
 enjoying the present since it arrives 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.670
 to this club the situations are gone 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.680
 giving first renove I wanted to 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:23.620
 enjoy here I have two more years in 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.720
 first division I've always said no 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.750
 I'm here to enjoy this 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.900
 team at first and I'm sure that 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.060
 that it will not logically be like that 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.730
 grow with this club I believe in the project 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.440
 that there will be this club on the 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:44.150
 first division and I want to enjoy 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:47.980
 he at first not for me is the main thing 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.980
 and the only thing I think
