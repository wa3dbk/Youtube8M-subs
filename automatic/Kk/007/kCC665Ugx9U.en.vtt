00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
hello again so let's see what we have

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.880 
hello again so let's see what we have
for<00:00:14.250> blender<00:00:14.849> 271<00:00:15.800> shall<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:18.260> this<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> build

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
for blender 271 shall we this is a build

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.529 
for blender 271 shall we this is a build
of<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.130> google<00:00:20.670> Summer<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.000> Code<00:00:21.090> paint

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
of the google Summer of Code paint

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.570 
of the google Summer of Code paint
branch<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:27.260> that's<00:00:28.260> entered<00:00:28.590> texture<00:00:29.369> paint

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
branch so that's entered texture paint

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.170 
branch so that's entered texture paint
mode<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.150> see<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.349> do<00:00:31.969> first<00:00:32.969> thing

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
mode and see what we can do first thing

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.940 
mode and see what we can do first thing
you<00:00:33.360> might<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.750> noticed<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.680> long

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
you might have noticed is that as long

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.900 
you might have noticed is that as long
as<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.309> enter<00:00:35.550> texture<00:00:35.940> paint<00:00:36.149> mode<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:37.290> can

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
as we enter texture paint mode we can

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.770 
as we enter texture paint mode we can
paint<00:00:38.910> yes<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:40.110> last<00:00:41.149> no<00:00:42.149> need<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.480> stop

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
paint yes at last no need to stop

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.430 
paint yes at last no need to stop
anything<00:00:43.079> no<00:00:43.680> nothing<00:00:44.239> of<00:00:45.239> course<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.289> might

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
anything no nothing of course you might

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.910 
anything no nothing of course you might
have<00:00:46.620> noticed<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:47.539> the<00:00:48.539> UV<00:00:48.899> setup<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.739> not

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
have noticed that the UV setup is not

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.369 
have noticed that the UV setup is not
the<00:00:50.190> ideal<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.629> cold<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:52.079> takes

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the ideal one but the cold now takes

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.200 
the ideal one but the cold now takes
care<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.739> adding<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> material<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
care of adding a material and the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.430 
care of adding a material and the
diffuse<00:00:54.570> layer<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.289> not<00:00:55.530> exist<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
diffuse layer if it not exist so you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.790 
diffuse layer if it not exist so you
most<00:00:59.219> likely<00:00:59.460> will<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.120> go<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.620> edit<00:01:01.620> mode

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
most likely will have to go to edit mode

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.060 
most likely will have to go to edit mode
and<00:01:02.390> do<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.449> smart<00:01:03.840> projection<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.860> add<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and do a smart projection to add a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.560 
and do a smart projection to add a
proper<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.850> layer<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.390> then<00:01:07.229> go<00:01:07.530> back<00:01:07.740> and

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
proper you layer and then go back and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.250 
proper you layer and then go back and
paint<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:12.150> second<00:01:12.540> thing<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.810> might<00:01:13.049> have

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
paint the second thing you might have

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.010 
paint the second thing you might have
noticed<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.939> strange<00:01:15.570> color

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
noticed is that we have a strange color

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.590 
noticed is that we have a strange color
wheel<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.950> left<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.880> quite<00:01:18.090> different

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
wheel on the left it's quite different

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.670 
wheel on the left it's quite different
than<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.080> wheel<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.310> has<00:01:20.460> had<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.880> far

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
than the wheel then there has had so far

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.289 
than the wheel then there has had so far
this<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> user<00:01:23.070> preference<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:24.060> have

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
this is a user preference you don't have

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.380 
this is a user preference you don't have
to<00:01:24.689> use<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:27.840> enable<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:29.009> go

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
to use it and to enable it you just go

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.120 
to use it and to enable it you just go
to<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> color<00:01:30.720> picker<00:01:30.930> type<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.619> select

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
to the color picker type and select

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.760 
to the color picker type and select
either<00:01:32.780> ages<00:01:33.780> V<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> previous

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
either ages V which is the previous

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.609 
either ages V which is the previous
behavior<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.110> ages<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.259> losing<00:01:37.530> your

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
behavior and ages of losing your

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.410 
behavior and ages of losing your
behavior<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.799> deal<00:01:40.979> with<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.430> Giselle<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
behavior so the deal with a Giselle is

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.310 
behavior so the deal with a Giselle is
that<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:43.140> uses<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:44.540> different<00:01:45.540> model<00:01:45.960> which<00:01:46.290> is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
that it uses a different model which is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.670 
that it uses a different model which is
based<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.430> lightness<00:01:48.060> lightness<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.840> so

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
based on a lightness lightness is so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.969 
based on a lightness lightness is so
well<00:01:50.540> it's<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.869> has<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.530> tint<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
well it's it has to do with tint and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.840 
well it's it has to do with tint and
shade<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.460> collar<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:55.100> how<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.310> works<00:01:56.640> is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
shade of the collar so how this works is

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.760 
shade of the collar so how this works is
that<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.420> select<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.020> color<00:01:58.259> for

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that there you select a color for

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
that there you select a color for
example<00:01:59.250> let's<00:01:59.369> say<00:01:59.520> blue<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.000> then<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.780> you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
example let's say blue and then if you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.749 
example let's say blue and then if you
want<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> shade<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.740> blue<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.520> lower

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
want the shade of blue you just lower

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.260 
want the shade of blue you just lower
the<00:02:02.969> lightness<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.079> dark<00:02:04.409> blue<00:02:04.619> or

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
the lightness and you get a dark blue or

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.380 
the lightness and you get a dark blue or
if<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.390> want<00:02:06.630> tint<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.110> blue<00:02:07.819> light<00:02:08.819> color<00:02:09.149> we

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
if you want tint of blue light color we

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.390 
if you want tint of blue light color we
just<00:02:09.629> increase<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.440> get

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
just increase it then you get

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.880 
just increase it then you get
a<00:02:11.489> light<00:02:12.480> blue<00:02:15.230> it's<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.319> different<00:02:16.709> philosophy

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
a light blue it's a different philosophy

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.630 
a light blue it's a different philosophy
than<00:02:18.079> hue<00:02:19.079> saturation<00:02:19.200> value<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:21.260> also

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
than hue saturation value and also

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.030 
than hue saturation value and also
colors<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.939> a<00:02:24.299> given<00:02:24.599> lightness<00:02:25.110> which<00:02:25.769> means

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
colors of a given lightness which means

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.199 
colors of a given lightness which means
all<00:02:26.750> colors<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.930> are<00:02:28.079> on<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.470> wheel<00:02:28.650> are

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
all colors that are on the wheel are

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.119 
all colors that are on the wheel are

more or less at the same luminance at
more<00:02:32.489> or<00:02:32.519> less<00:02:32.819> it's<00:02:33.329> an<00:02:33.510> approximation<00:02:34.049> it's

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
more or less it's an approximation it's

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.710 
more or less it's an approximation it's
not<00:02:34.620> really<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.129> same<00:02:35.250> luminance<00:02:35.909> as<00:02:36.420> we

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
not really the same luminance as we

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.050 
not really the same luminance as we

that the car is not go away not only

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:48.559 
that the car is not go away not only
that<00:03:39.480> but<00:03:39.629> I<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.109> rotate<00:03:40.919> and<00:03:44.569> transform<00:03:47.569> my

that but I can rotate and transform my
object<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.169> space<00:03:49.319> will<00:03:50.280> not<00:03:50.489> really

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
object in space will not really

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.710

transform but I can move in space and

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.380 
transform but I can move in space and
press<00:03:54.720> ENTER<00:03:55.049> again<00:03:55.079> and<00:03:55.560> reduce<00:03:55.889> a<00:03:55.919> curve

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.590 

and<00:04:00.870> if<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.200> want<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.500> new<00:04:01.620> curve<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:02.330> can<00:04:03.330> go<00:04:03.540> to

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
and if I want a new curve I can go to

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.550 
and if I want a new curve I can go to
the<00:04:03.870> stroke<00:04:04.230> panel<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:05.990> here<00:04:06.990> you<00:04:07.110> can<00:04:07.230> see<00:04:07.290> we

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
the stroke panel and here you can see we

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.760 
the stroke panel and here you can see we
have<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.709> new<00:04:07.920> data<00:04:08.160> block<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:10.200> we<00:04:10.470> can<00:04:10.620> add<00:04:10.740> a

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
have a new data block and we can add a

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:18.580 
have a new data block and we can add a
new<00:04:10.980> curve<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:14.520> do<00:04:14.670> what<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:14.880> like<00:04:15.180> with<00:04:15.240> it

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.390 

here<00:04:19.590> we<00:04:19.709> change<00:04:20.370> color<00:04:21.329> well<00:04:22.320> this<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:23.220> color

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
here we change color well this the color

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.370 
here we change color well this the color
is<00:04:23.490> /<00:04:23.790> brush<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:24.390> you<00:04:24.450> could<00:04:24.780> make<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> brush

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
is / brush so you could make a brush

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.500 
is / brush so you could make a brush
with<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.830> surgeon<00:04:26.220> curve<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.150> certain

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
with the surgeon curve and the certain

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.820 
with the surgeon curve and the certain
color<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.050> then<00:04:28.200> we<00:04:28.560> use<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:31.220> pressing<00:04:32.220> enter

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
color and then we use it pressing enter

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.180 
color and then we use it pressing enter
okay<00:04:35.120> not<00:04:36.120> only<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.450> but<00:04:36.930> it's<00:04:37.260> possible<00:04:37.980> now

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
okay not only that but it's possible now

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.700 
okay not only that but it's possible now
to<00:04:40.970> press<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.240> select<00:04:42.540> all<00:04:42.840> handles<00:04:43.470> and

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
to press a to select all handles and

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.860 
to press a to select all handles and
press<00:04:44.150> G<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:46.530> grab<00:04:46.770> them<00:04:46.980> or<00:04:47.360> are<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.600> rotate

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
press G to grab them or are to rotate

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.190 
press G to grab them or are to rotate
them<00:04:49.110> or<00:04:49.290> as<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:50.040> scale<00:04:50.310> them<00:04:50.990> so<00:04:51.990> it's

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
them or as the scale them so it's

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.370 
them or as the scale them so it's
totally<00:04:52.650> a<00:04:54.770> full<00:04:55.770> transform<00:04:56.250> system<00:04:56.730> and<00:04:57.380> you

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
totally a full transform system and you

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.770 
totally a full transform system and you
can<00:04:58.590> shape<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.490> rushes<00:04:59.910> in<00:05:00.120> any<00:05:00.300> way<00:05:00.450> you<00:05:00.510> like

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
can shape the rushes in any way you like

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.710 
can shape the rushes in any way you like
and<00:05:01.580> this<00:05:02.580> is<00:05:02.760> still<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.150> development

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
and this is still the development

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.990 
and this is still the development
version<00:05:04.110> so<00:05:04.680> there<00:05:04.860> will<00:05:05.010> be<00:05:05.040> a<00:05:05.160> way<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.430> for

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
version so there will be a way to for

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.270 
version so there will be a way to for
example<00:05:06.060> adding<00:05:06.660> new<00:05:06.930> curve<00:05:07.200> point<00:05:07.590> in<00:05:08.130> the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
example adding new curve point in the

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.350 
example adding new curve point in the
middle<00:05:08.550> of<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.669> curve<00:05:08.970> if<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.600> wish<00:05:09.810> or<00:05:11.360> the

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
middle of the curve if you wish or the

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.380 
middle of the curve if you wish or the
littler<00:05:12.780> point<00:05:13.490> but<00:05:14.490> this<00:05:14.520> will<00:05:14.970> be<00:05:15.120> added

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
littler point but this will be added

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.820 
littler point but this will be added
later<00:05:17.150> still<00:05:18.150> it's<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.750> big<00:05:19.200> leap<00:05:19.440> for

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
later still it's a big leap for

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.310 
later still it's a big leap for
usability<00:05:20.310> I<00:05:20.610> think<00:05:22.729> and<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:24.840> last<00:05:25.020> thing

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
usability I think and the last thing

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.120 
usability I think and the last thing
that<00:05:26.040> I<00:05:26.220> would<00:05:26.400> like<00:05:26.820> to<00:05:26.850> show<00:05:27.030> you<00:05:27.210> is<00:05:27.570> the<00:05:28.500> new

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
that I would like to show you is the new

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:37.130 
that I would like to show you is the new
detail<00:05:29.910> setting<00:05:30.860> in<00:05:31.860> our<00:05:32.010> skull<00:05:32.340> code<00:05:33.350> so<00:05:36.140> if

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
detail setting in our skull code so if

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
we open up the topology panel and press

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.690 
we open up the topology panel and press

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
on table dynamic we're in dynamic

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.080 
on table dynamic we're in dynamic
topology<00:05:44.820> mode<00:05:45.300> and<00:05:45.660> we're<00:05:46.229> scouting<00:05:46.560> and<00:05:47.090> if

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
topology mode and we're scouting and if

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.920 
topology mode and we're scouting and if
we<00:05:48.270> go<00:05:48.450> further

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.740 

inside<00:05:54.860> and<00:05:55.220> scale<00:05:55.880> on<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.120> object<00:05:56.270> you<00:05:56.720> can

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
inside and scale on the object you can

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.469 
inside and scale on the object you can
see<00:05:57.080> that<00:05:57.259> the<00:05:57.530> tail<00:05:57.830> that<00:05:57.979> gets<00:05:58.340> out<00:05:58.490> it<00:05:58.669> gets

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
see that the tail that gets out it gets

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.490 
see that the tail that gets out it gets
smaller<00:06:00.340> the<00:06:01.340> more<00:06:01.550> we<00:06:01.699> scale<00:06:02.199> the<00:06:03.199> mobile

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
smaller the more we scale the mobile

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
smaller the more we scale the mobile
resume<00:06:03.800> sorry<00:06:05.590> but<00:06:06.590> if<00:06:06.740> we<00:06:06.889> go<00:06:07.100> ahead<00:06:07.280> and

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
resume sorry but if we go ahead and

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.300 
resume sorry but if we go ahead and
change<00:06:08.300> relative<00:06:09.020> detail<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:09.889> constant

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
change relative detail the constant

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:18.330 
change relative detail the constant
detail<00:06:13.900> then<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.080> detail<00:06:15.380> won't<00:06:15.590> change

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.640 

actually<00:06:19.340> let's<00:06:19.520> change<00:06:19.880> that<00:06:20.240> to<00:06:20.650> subdivide

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
actually let's change that to subdivide

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:30.219 
actually let's change that to subdivide
collapse<00:06:25.030> ok<00:06:27.220> so<00:06:28.220> now<00:06:28.690> detail<00:06:29.690> won't<00:06:29.960> change

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
collapse ok so now detail won't change

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.240 
collapse ok so now detail won't change
and<00:06:31.660> the<00:06:32.660> detailed<00:06:32.990> setting<00:06:33.410> is<00:06:33.560> interpreted

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
and the detailed setting is interpreted

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.100 
and the detailed setting is interpreted
as<00:06:34.490> a<00:06:35.020> percentage<00:06:36.020> of<00:06:36.130> a<00:06:37.130> blender<00:06:37.669> unit<00:06:38.110> like

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
as a percentage of a blender unit like

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.960 
as a percentage of a blender unit like
what<00:06:39.710> you<00:06:39.860> can<00:06:40.009> see<00:06:40.130> on<00:06:40.190> the<00:06:40.340> grip<00:06:40.490> on<00:06:40.669> the<00:06:40.789> grid

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
what you can see on the grip on the grid

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.550 
what you can see on the grip on the grid
so<00:06:41.270> this<00:06:41.539> will<00:06:41.780> be<00:06:41.930> 2<00:06:41.960> percent<00:06:42.590> of<00:06:44.500> off<00:06:45.500> the

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
so this will be 2 percent of off the

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.120 
so this will be 2 percent of off the
grid<00:06:45.830> which<00:06:46.220> means<00:06:46.460> 50<00:06:47.259> triangles<00:06:48.259> per<00:06:48.500> per

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130 
grid which means 50 triangles per per

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:56.170 
grid which means 50 triangles per per
unit<00:06:50.740> so<00:06:51.740> if<00:06:51.889> I<00:06:51.979> go<00:06:52.009> ahead<00:06:52.250> and<00:06:54.820> scalp<00:06:55.820> that<00:06:56.000> you

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
unit so if I go ahead and scalp that you

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.330 
unit so if I go ahead and scalp that you
can<00:06:56.330> see<00:06:56.570> that<00:06:56.599> it<00:06:57.169> has<00:06:57.199> added<00:06:57.650> quite<00:06:57.889> a<00:06:57.919> little

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
can see that it has added quite a little

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:06.279 
can see that it has added quite a little
geometry<00:06:58.550> inside<00:07:02.740> so<00:07:04.870> this<00:07:05.870> will<00:07:06.020> be<00:07:06.139> useful

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:06.289 
geometry inside so this will be useful

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:09.490 
geometry inside so this will be useful
for<00:07:06.530> people<00:07:06.770> who<00:07:07.039> want<00:07:07.220> to<00:07:07.720> make<00:07:08.720> sculpts<00:07:09.289> with

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
for people who want to make sculpts with

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.279 
for people who want to make sculpts with
a<00:07:09.530> set<00:07:09.860> amount<00:07:10.250> of<00:07:10.550> geometry<00:07:11.090> also<00:07:12.050> it<00:07:12.110> might

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:12.289 
a set amount of geometry also it might

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:16.450 
a set amount of geometry also it might
help<00:07:12.560> to<00:07:12.729> sculpt<00:07:14.590> at<00:07:15.590> the<00:07:15.830> third<00:07:16.010> level<00:07:16.250> of

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460 
help to sculpt at the third level of

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.189 
help to sculpt at the third level of
geometry<00:07:17.000> initially<00:07:17.449> and<00:07:17.630> then<00:07:19.659> go<00:07:20.659> down<00:07:20.900> in

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 
geometry initially and then go down in

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:26.999 
geometry initially and then go down in
detail<00:07:22.539> when<00:07:23.539> you<00:07:23.720> start<00:07:24.050> refining<00:07:24.409> the<00:07:25.340> skull

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:27.009 
detail when you start refining the skull

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:31.689 
detail when you start refining the skull
so<00:07:29.259> this<00:07:30.259> is<00:07:30.289> it<00:07:30.530> for<00:07:30.710> now<00:07:30.770> this<00:07:31.370> is<00:07:31.520> still<00:07:31.669> the

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:31.699 
so this is it for now this is still the

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:35.260 
so this is it for now this is still the
development<00:07:32.300> version<00:07:33.699> there<00:07:34.699> will<00:07:34.880> be<00:07:34.909> still

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
development version there will be still

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.730 
development version there will be still
more<00:07:35.539> to<00:07:35.599> come<00:07:35.750> for<00:07:36.740> blender<00:07:37.070> 2.7<00:07:37.880> t<00:07:37.970> 1<00:07:38.320> so<00:07:39.320> i

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:39.740 
more to come for blender 2.7 t 1 so i
