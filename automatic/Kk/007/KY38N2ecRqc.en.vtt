 a new model as the mode of 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.480
 goals and then this mode does not take part and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.650
 textures with body was done very well already 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.150
 that I'm using a mode 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.860
 share story for this study 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.260
 are in this way which is very important 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.850
 great what happens this module as more 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.710
 seeing that after this mode is adding you 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.809
 what goes through six eggs or seven 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.010
 waters this battery command are 7 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.080
 eggs and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eggs with a 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.269
 subscriber sent it to me he told me to 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.640
 I had to see if I liked it and so 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.150
 Well, I'm here, we're here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.290
 I really loved it here as we see and 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.379
 you will need this mode we will need what 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.019
 that after blocks of diamond block 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.700
 the outside of gold fasting blocks 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.340
 blocks of errors are or blocks of what 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.580
 that is what you want to do is the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.060
 common goal here tells me that he asks me 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.880
 four blocks of committing reston and 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.400
 a pumpkin here asks me four blocks 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.800
 of diamond and a pumpkin here asks me 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.180
 four sand and one pumpkin 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.090
 here he asks me 4 and 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.410
 of gold and a pumpkin and then when I 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.720
 I'm going to teach him what I need 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.400
 because I did not go into the materials here 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.050
 are these are four of these 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.510
 crystal of those that are in the portal 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.040
 never 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.910
 and here is the other one if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.920
 what is this that is the sneijder is the 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.450
 of neider well then I'm going to 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.090
 show at this moment I'm going to put the 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.070
 200 eggs here and as we see 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.930
 let's start with the first what 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.510
 happens is that we are the truth I loved it 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.300
 because they see that they follow us the goals 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.740
 continue when you hit automor by 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.130
 example let's touch to see let's 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.290
 put him on because I do not want him to 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.720
 convinces in some way how he attacks him 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.710
 until I kill him 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.710
 for all 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.750
 is that I do not know why it does not kill us 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.420
 but you have to continue you have to kill me 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.630
 modes we love I spent a 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.670
 Subscriber secamic and others attacking us 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.650
 the monkeys but well, there are some 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.930
 I think they do not work 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.240
 Well, one thing that happens is also 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.550
 that when you kill a golden and with 17 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.950
 greece and I know why we're going to put the 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.180
 golden of this and now as you come we are going to 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.180
 do what they attack themselves 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.920
 you 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.030
 see what he does with the gold 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.990
 because according to gold what it does is that what 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.530
 it does like in an explosion 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.870
 if anything where of these remains to second 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.400
 bang now we go for the deluxe mnr 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.400
 and diana we do not get to this one 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.900
 it does not do anything 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.989
 but I saw that it says nothing 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.879
 when doing more explosions we are going to 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.310
 go through the next thing is to 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.939
 sand which I do not think is not 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.850
 Nothing I do not think anything but that great 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:29.740
 let's spend all together 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:32.650
 to a stone house of those of neider 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.870
 stone color of the crystal 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.430
 snow rather it leaves you like 15 crystal 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.170
 It's one thing that I also like because 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.660
 is what is is they are very complicated 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.330
 see, see 28 volt, it does not take care 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.210
 pieces all of which I 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.300
 loved fernandez I loved to see how 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.069
 they kill poor chicken chicken good and 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.950
 when it hits well as it sounds 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.349
 as they sound they saw how they sound like 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.219
 it sounds like they want to hit a 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:04.010
 monkey existing pieces of the map of the 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.239
 map and the good thing that pixel tells us 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.280
 art the pixel art 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.280
 we see those modes that the phases 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:16.150
 what's wrong with them, what do you think? 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.640
 they have because they leave us we 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.590
 they want to let us go we go with darts 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.390
 for her those spots the big ones that 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.960
 election by fierce or trans 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.000
 bots 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.240
 I do not know why but today they appeared here 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.009
 usually 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.770
 you just have to stick and leave for 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.599
 faithful medium or rather if they are not left 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.030
 see by measuring if we of haring by 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.610
 the creator and that was because I do not know if the 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.220
 fierce creator and true the creator puts 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.770
 the comment that is that is this party 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.449

 social networks continues on facebook and in 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.960
 twitter on twitter follows more like 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.330
 because on twitter I'm just posting 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.370
 when we favor of hunger and 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.800
 nothing on facebook so I'll publish 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.750
 because it does not know when I will 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.020
 play because um suddenly you have to 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.430

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.040
 and especially on twitter on twitter 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.880
 hundred appears that there is at the moment 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.670
 then this would be the mountain of 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.920
 two goals which all these 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.620
 I loved it we're good, everyone is 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.290
 very good sexy and apart 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.740
 I really loved it without hesitation 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.840
 He loved it, this, above all, he endorsed them 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.310
 his good friend luis garcía says goodbye 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.310
 until the next video 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.040
 and they all died 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.379
 of all 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.100
 is 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.090
 the 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.520
 this 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.470
 and 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:35.349
 I want to do the toilet 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.000
 he called me to action 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.010
 d 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.560
 all right
