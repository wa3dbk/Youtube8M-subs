00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
spaceman should know first okay we off

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.740 
spaceman should know first okay we off
to<00:00:22.500> space<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.490> go<00:00:23.699> past<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.570> upper

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
to space we go past the upper

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.130 
to space we go past the upper
stratosphere<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:26.490> now<00:00:27.119> we're<00:00:27.480> passing<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
stratosphere and now we're passing the
