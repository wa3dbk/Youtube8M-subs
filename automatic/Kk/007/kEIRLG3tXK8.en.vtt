00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.320
 the economic situation is currently taking 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.609
 turn less favorable than on the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.670
 beginning of the year 2014 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.470
 but this difficult passage does not put off 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.449
 in question the favorable trends of 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.080
 dairy market to medium and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.180
 long term 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.150
 the consumption of dairy products 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.760
 global scale remain dynamic 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.409
 out of crisis period as in 2009 she 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.600
 progresses in the order of 2 and a half to 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:44.420
 hundred a year and this dynamic is not 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.920
 challenged today 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.930
 the embargo that russia has put in place 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.000
 this summer against the products 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.920
 dairy products of the European Union and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.970
 united states is obviously not a 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.799
 good news for operators 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.320
 European and French 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.229
 but Russia was and remains 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.689
 deficit in dairy products and this 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.519
 is not the embargo that suddenly 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.740
 magic wand will develop the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.890
 Russian milk production and make the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.990
 self-sufficient country then the Russian embargo 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.840
 product market organizations 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.390
 dairy farmers and place buyers in a 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.460
 hand wait position that feeds 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.450
 a downward trend in the prices of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.510
 dairy products 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.340
 but in the end the embargo will 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.370
 especially induce a set of chairs 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.960
 musical instruments among the suppliers of 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.820
 Russia and it is not at all certain 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.070
 that the level of global imports 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.400
 of Russia will fall in the months to 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.640
 come 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.610
 moreover world demand remains well 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.290
 oriented imports from countries such 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.210
 that China have continued to progress 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.460
 since the beginning of 2014 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.050
 in fact the current difficulties of the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.270
 dairy market are not 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.600
 linked to insufficient demand but to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.550
 an abundant supply for more 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.890
 of one year milk production was 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.540
 significantly increased within both 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.360
 main suppliers of the market 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.549
 global that are the European Union and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.069
 the new zealand in the space of a year 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.060
 milk production has increased by 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.370
 little more than 6 million tons 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.720
 in europe and just under 2 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.630
 million tons in new zealand 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.550
 that is, relative growth of 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.410
 four and a half percent for the union 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.900
 nine and a half per cent 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.569
 for the new zealand wave of rhythm 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.640
 significantly higher growth than 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.660
 growth in global consumption 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.730
 dairy products 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.390
 milk production in France has 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.099
 largely followed this dynamic trend 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.099
 on the first seven months of the year 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.380
 2014 collection has grown more than 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.390
 7% compared to the period 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.959
 equivalent of 2013 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.459
 despite all the France had 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.450
 room for maneuver at the beginning of this 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.700
 last campaign and the collection should 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.580
 to be at the end of the campaign in 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.420
 below the national quota so at 31 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.580
 March 2015 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.890
 on the end of 2013 this is the 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.480
 beginning of the year 2014 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.360
 the markets had rather well cashed 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.130
 this extra production of the union 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.860
 European Union and New Zealand 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.790
 because this revival intervened after a 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.040
 period of scarcity but stocks that 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.359
 was at their lowest level during 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.799
 summer 2013 gradually bailed out and 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.890
 once his stocks have been 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.329
 restored the maintenance of a rhythm 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.160
 sustained development of the 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.600
 milk production began to weigh 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.829
 in the markets and induced a decline 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.989
 of the price of dairy products on 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.940
 international markets from 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.850
 spring 2014 so a trend 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.760
 downward had already begun this summer 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.680
 less than August at the moment when Russia has 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.889
 set up its embargo 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.109
 and this political decision of russia 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.510
 reinforced this downward trend in 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.799
 placing buyers in a position 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.350
 wait 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.670
 today the prices of the products 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.370
 dairy on international markets 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.489
 is therefore at their most 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.799
 low since the middle of 2012 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.079
 this deterioration of the markets is not going 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.130
 have an immediate impact on the price of 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.130
 milk on the farm 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.690
 indeed in binding contracts 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.390
 the dairies to the breeders the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.180
 determining the price of milk is the 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.510
 more often based on indicators 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.390
 observed three months earlier and 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.790
 so lower prices of products 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.570
 dairy on international markets 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.970
 will mostly impact the price of milk on 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.220
 the beginning of the year 2015 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.380
 in fact until the end of 2014 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.020
 the price of milk should be maintained at 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.790
 relatively high levels it is 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.730
 besides likely that the price 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.820
 average of the year 2014 will be clearly 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.040
 higher than the year 2013 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.710
 an increase of 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.810
 the order of 6 to 7% on the beginning of 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.450
 the year 2015 the forecasts are 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.240
 difficult to establish because decisions 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.210
 policies implemented or not by the 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.760
 European Commission, especially the 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.740
 increase in intervention prices 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.840
 will have an impact on the evolution of 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.790
 price of dairy products on 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.170
 international markets and by 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.650
 consequence on the price of milk at the 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.900
 closed 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.400
 but whatever happens on time 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.720
 today it is certain that the 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.240
 milk prices on the beginning of the year 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.580
 2015 will be down fairly sharply 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.500
 compared to the price level of the 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.780
 milk on the end of 2014 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.760
 as a conclusion the price of milk 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.640
 will stay in France at levels 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.730
 relatively high between September and 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.440
 December 2014 before experiencing a 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.010
 downtrend on the beginning of 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.230
 the year 2015 whose scale and duration 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:51.370
 are not currently totally 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:53.110
 known political decisions put 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.210
 implemented by the European Commission 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.270
 in terms of regulation but also 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.490
 the evolution of collection in europe 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.550
 will she or will not maintain a level 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:07.180
 also supported will be determining 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.850
 to actually target the profile of this 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.230
 floating period 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.450
 whatever happens if the conjuncture 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.560
 difficult announcement on the beginning of 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:21.110
 the year 2015 a favorable turnaround 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.880
 second half is not excluded 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.510
 market fundamentals, particularly 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.440
 terms of demand are structurally 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.440
 well oriented
