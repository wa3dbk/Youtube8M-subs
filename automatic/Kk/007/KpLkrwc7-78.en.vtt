spending this is a passive ability your

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.600 
spending this is a passive ability your

okay<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:31.230> means<00:03:31.440> it'll<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:32.090> reduce<00:03:33.090> your

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
okay that means it'll just reduce your

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
cast on which is good and say big damage

situations<00:03:36.930> i'm<00:03:37.050> sure<00:03:37.230> resurgence<00:03:37.770> has<00:03:37.950> some

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
situations i'm sure resurgence has some

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.320 
situations i'm sure resurgence has some
sort<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.489> cool-down<00:03:38.700> otherwise<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.300> would

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
sort of a cool-down otherwise that would

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.320 
sort of a cool-down otherwise that would
be<00:03:39.510> extremely<00:03:39.870> overpowered<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.670> yeah<00:03:41.850> this

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
be extremely overpowered so yeah this

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.970 
be extremely overpowered so yeah this
looks<00:03:42.480> like<00:03:42.720> could<00:03:42.959> be<00:03:43.140> i<00:03:43.440> think<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:43.950> probably

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
looks like could be i think it probably

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.070 
looks like could be i think it probably
looks<00:03:44.580> like<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.730> raid<00:03:44.940> healer<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.330> me<00:03:45.480> the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
looks like a raid healer to me the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.820 
looks like a raid healer to me the
corruption<00:03:46.590> does<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:48.110> an<00:03:49.110> instance<00:03:49.560> healer<00:03:49.739> i

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
corruption does and an instance healer i

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.590 
corruption does and an instance healer i
mean<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.220> still<00:03:50.370> be<00:03:50.459> good<00:03:50.640> i'm<00:03:50.820> pretty<00:03:51.480> sure

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
mean it still be good i'm pretty sure

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.509 
mean it still be good i'm pretty sure
any<00:03:51.780> classic<00:03:52.140> until<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.380> flashpoint<00:03:53.370> i'm

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
any classic until a flashpoint i'm

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.729 
any classic until a flashpoint i'm
sorry/not<00:03:53.880> instance<00:03:54.269> flashpoint<00:03:54.750> but<00:03:55.380> i

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
sorry/not instance flashpoint but i

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.320 
sorry/not instance flashpoint but i
think<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.519> would<00:03:56.640> be<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.760> very<00:03:56.910> good<00:03:57.030> rate

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
think this would be a very good rate

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.430 
think this would be a very good rate
healer<00:03:57.630> like<00:03:57.780> in<00:03:57.900> general<00:03:58.019> just<00:03:58.230> till

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
and to get the madness it's shared it

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.690 
and to get the madness it's shared it

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:09.969 
okay so I wonder in the last video

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:12.160 
okay so I wonder in the last video
parasitism<00:04:10.969> its<00:04:11.269> passive<00:04:11.689> and<00:04:11.810> it's<00:04:11.900> causes

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
parasitism its passive and it's causes

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.720
