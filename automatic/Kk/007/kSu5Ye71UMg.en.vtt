ah

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.120 

well<00:05:30.640> maybe<00:05:31.510> over<00:05:31.900> here<00:05:31.930> by<00:05:32.350> the<00:05:32.410> krustyland

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
well maybe over here by the krustyland

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.490 
well maybe over here by the krustyland
entrance<00:05:33.850> if<00:05:34.060> it<00:05:34.660> was<00:05:34.750> a<00:05:34.780> smaller<00:05:35.230> building

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
entrance if it was a smaller building

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.520 
entrance if it was a smaller building
the<00:05:36.280> entrance<00:05:36.490> would<00:05:36.790> block<00:05:37.170> because<00:05:38.170> this<00:05:38.380> is

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
the entrance would block because this is

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.400 
the entrance would block because this is
so<00:05:38.770> tall<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.450> it's<00:05:40.450> a<00:05:40.600> lot<00:05:40.750> smaller<00:05:41.110> than<00:05:41.350> a

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
so tall and it's a lot smaller than a

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.310 
so tall and it's a lot smaller than a
normal<00:05:41.530> building<00:05:42.190> I<00:05:42.750> think<00:05:43.750> this<00:05:43.960> is<00:05:44.110> a<00:05:44.140> good

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
normal building I think this is a good

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:53.270 
normal building I think this is a good
spot<00:05:44.530> so<00:05:44.800> let's<00:05:45.160> put<00:05:45.310> it<00:05:45.430> right<00:05:45.490> here

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.030 

ouch<00:05:54.390> 36<00:05:55.230> hours

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.410 

oh<00:05:58.100> well<00:05:58.970> what<00:05:59.180> can<00:05:59.300> you<00:05:59.450> do

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
oh well what can you do

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.390 
oh well what can you do
it<00:06:02.020> was<00:06:02.170> inevitable<00:06:02.680> that<00:06:02.740> things<00:06:03.100> would<00:06:03.280> get

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
it was inevitable that things would get

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.250 
it was inevitable that things would get
more<00:06:03.640> expensive<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.300> take<00:06:04.480> longer<00:06:04.810> to<00:06:05.080> build

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
more expensive and take longer to build

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.010 
more expensive and take longer to build
as<00:06:05.590> we<00:06:06.040> went<00:06:06.220> on<00:06:08.010> now<00:06:09.010> I<00:06:09.040> don't<00:06:09.360> like<00:06:10.360> all<00:06:10.690> the

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
as we went on now I don't like all the

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.980 
as we went on now I don't like all the
green<00:06:11.350> in<00:06:11.560> this<00:06:11.800> right<00:06:12.100> corner<00:06:12.660> greens<00:06:13.660> are

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
green in this right corner greens are

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.660 
green in this right corner greens are
associated<00:06:14.470> with<00:06:14.620> vegetables<00:06:15.250> and<00:06:15.490> I<00:06:15.610> don't

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
associated with vegetables and I don't

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.800 
associated with vegetables and I don't
want<00:06:16.000> greens<00:06:16.360> on<00:06:17.490> my<00:06:18.490> plate<00:06:18.790> and<00:06:19.120> I<00:06:19.330> don't<00:06:19.360> want

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
want greens on my plate and I don't want

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.680 
want greens on my plate and I don't want
