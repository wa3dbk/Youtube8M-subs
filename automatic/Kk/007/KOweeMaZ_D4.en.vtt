00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.759
 to go 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.260
 cover of the wall 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.680
 these are the necessities with which you 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.680
 begins 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.129
 We start with the whiteboard 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.609
 cut foil to size I put it 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.609
 first up 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.660
 and then I will put some stripes where 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.660
 I have to cut it out 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.710
 then script with the smoke off 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.210
 then we stick it on it and me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.520
 first start with a corner that sticks 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.580
 I then up in the corner and then I pull it 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.610
 slowly from below, so that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.290
 stays pretty straight and then I strike 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.310
 everything funny my hand I want 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.310
 no bubbles left 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.810
 then I continue with some polaroid 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.150
 photos clothespins 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.130
 and magnet tape and I just grab one 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.540
 piece of magnetic tape until I stick on one 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.730
 clothespin and then I do the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.010
 clothespin around the photo and I care 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.790
 before you see the magnet tape 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.790
 and so I continue 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.130
 then we continue with post-it i 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.860
 color six different poses 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.310
 use and do Saturday and Sunday than 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.310
 together 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.349
 then I put some whiteboard pens 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.789
 from the hema a bit in a row and that 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.789
 I move to the top right corner 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.800
 well then i put my photos hat pretty 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.760
 together and below that I write one 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.760
 kind of description 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.290
 At the top I had the memo board in it 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.290
 pink 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.189
 and at the bottom I write the days of 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.189
 the week ago 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.209
 I also write under and all that I have to 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.560
 to do 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.599
 maybe you timer cakes so 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.250
 culturally as I test a kind 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.379
 how you made it smaller 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.970
 and this actually looks like it 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.610
 this does not necessarily have to be on your desk 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.989
 and this is more for the wall 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.940
 when last I write too 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.090
 put on and then your memo board is completely 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.090
 off 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.599
 that was the video cappuccino of the 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.890
 comically many more coolio hyves and beds 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.470
 videos about 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.299
 so that will just see this diy is very 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.400
 simple but of course I am already a lot 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.109
 finish faster and you want something like that 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.579
 not too complicated 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.769
 I hope you will get this more too 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.599
 go make if you just have the ios 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.540

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.519

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.310
