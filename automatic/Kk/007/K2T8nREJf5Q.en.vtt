00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
stock cubes or already made stocks we're

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.719 
stock cubes or already made stocks we're
going<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.380> add<00:01:26.500> about<00:01:26.650> a<00:01:26.800> third<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:27.400> it<00:01:27.550> to

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
going to add about a third of it to

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:35.190 
going to add about a third of it to
style<00:01:28.030> with<00:01:31.950> mixing<00:01:32.950> through<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.399> roux<00:01:34.200> this

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
style with mixing through the roux this

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.870 
style with mixing through the roux this
allows<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.890> thicken<00:01:36.190> without<00:01:36.550> becoming

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
allows it to thicken without becoming

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.950 
allows it to thicken without becoming
lumpy<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:40.180> as<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.330> can<00:01:40.420> see<00:01:40.479> that's<00:01:40.810> now

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
lumpy and as you can see that's now

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.950 
lumpy and as you can see that's now
thickening<00:01:41.470> out<00:01:42.330> so<00:01:43.330> we<00:01:43.450> can<00:01:43.600> add<00:01:43.690> some<00:01:43.930> more

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
thickening out so we can add some more

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:55.380 
thickening out so we can add some more
stock<00:01:44.440> into<00:01:44.830> that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.880 

we'll<00:01:56.390> be<00:01:56.540> seasoning<00:01:57.140> this<00:01:57.320> with<00:01:57.470> salt<00:01:57.680> and

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
we'll be seasoning this with salt and

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.950 
we'll be seasoning this with salt and
pepper<00:01:57.920> towards<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.610> end<00:01:58.759> if<00:01:59.030> you're<00:01:59.330> using<00:01:59.659> a

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
pepper towards the end if you're using a

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.100 
pepper towards the end if you're using a
stock<00:02:00.380> cube<00:02:00.770> or<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.210> ready<00:02:02.210> prepared<00:02:02.750> stock

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
stock cube or a ready prepared stock

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.499 
stock cube or a ready prepared stock
that<00:02:03.320> you've<00:02:03.470> bought<00:02:03.649> from<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.979> supermarket<00:02:04.509> be

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
that you've bought from a supermarket be

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:06.969 
that you've bought from a supermarket be
careful<00:02:05.930> with<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.110> amount<00:02:06.350> of<00:02:06.439> seasoning

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
careful with the amount of seasoning

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.710 
careful with the amount of seasoning
that<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:07.250> put<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:07.670> always<00:02:07.909> taste<00:02:08.209> it<00:02:08.420> first

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
that you put in always taste it first

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.540 
that you put in always taste it first
because<00:02:09.110> some<00:02:09.289> of<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.500> stocks<00:02:09.800> can<00:02:10.399> be

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
because some of the stocks can be

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.360 
because some of the stocks can be
incredibly<00:02:11.060> salty<00:02:11.739> so<00:02:12.739> if<00:02:12.860> you're<00:02:13.010> using<00:02:13.220> your

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
incredibly salty so if you're using your

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.220 
incredibly salty so if you're using your
own<00:02:13.489> freshly<00:02:14.090> made<00:02:14.239> stock<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.810> won't<00:02:15.019> have

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
own freshly made stock you won't have

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.550 
own freshly made stock you won't have
that<00:02:15.260> issue<00:02:16.510> sauce<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.750> thickened<00:02:18.080> up<00:02:18.170> again

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
that issue sauce is thickened up again

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.040 
that issue sauce is thickened up again
and<00:02:19.310> we're<00:02:19.580> going<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.760> add<00:02:20.000> in<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.660> rest<00:02:20.870> of
