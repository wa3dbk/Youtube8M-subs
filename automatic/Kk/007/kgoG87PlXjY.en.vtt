see what my wits at the proof that you
guys<00:02:00.920> this<00:02:01.220> is<00:02:01.340> ish<00:02:01.490> bulk<00:02:01.790> really<00:02:02.510> can't<00:02:02.750> make

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
guys this is ish bulk really can't make

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.660 
guys this is ish bulk really can't make
the<00:02:03.080> difference<00:02:03.290> in<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.920> short<00:02:04.190> period<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.610> time

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
the difference in a short period of time

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.640 
the difference in a short period of time
then<00:02:05.510> I'm<00:02:05.660> going<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.840> do<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:05.990> little<00:02:06.080> base<00:02:06.410> have

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
then I'm going to do a little base have

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.920 
then I'm going to do a little base have
glass<00:02:06.920> worker<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.970> get<00:02:08.300> my<00:02:08.390> palm<00:02:08.630> pollen

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
glass worker and get my palm pollen

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
passion and my dumbbell presses so

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.890 
passion and my dumbbell presses so
that's<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.370> that's<00:03:45.550> a<00:03:45.670> massive<00:03:45.940> increases<00:03:46.510> too

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
that's a that's a massive increases too

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.260 
that's a that's a massive increases too
and<00:03:47.230> she's<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.590> little<00:03:48.010> bit<00:03:48.250> on<00:03:48.490> my<00:03:48.550> chest

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.600 
and she's a little bit on my chest
already<00:03:49.540> so<00:03:49.990> guys<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.890> experiment<00:03:51.370> is<00:03:51.459> going

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
already so guys the experiment is going

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.030 
already so guys the experiment is going
well<00:03:51.819> so<00:03:52.060> far<00:03:52.090> very<00:03:52.360> hardly<00:03:53.050> with<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.470> now

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
well so far very hardly with that now

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.400 
well so far very hardly with that now
let's<00:03:54.280> check<00:03:54.550> in<00:03:54.730> with<00:03:54.760> skills<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.690> see<00:03:55.930> how

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
let's check in with skills and see how

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.229 
let's check in with skills and see how
many<00:03:56.620> kilograms<00:03:56.860> I've<00:03:57.310> actually<00:03:57.489> gained<00:03:57.970> in

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
many kilograms I've actually gained in

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.199 
many kilograms I've actually gained in
the<00:03:58.750> last<00:03:58.959> week<00:03:59.459> right<00:04:00.459> guys<00:04:00.670> time<00:04:00.970> for<00:04:01.150> the

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
the last week right guys time for the

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.360 
the last week right guys time for the
big<00:04:01.360> way<00:04:01.540> in<00:04:01.569> then<00:04:01.959> let's<00:04:02.200> see<00:04:02.440> if<00:04:02.920> I've<00:04:03.100> gained

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
big way in then let's see if I've gained

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:11.120 
big way in then let's see if I've gained
a<00:04:03.459> couple<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.760> kilograms<00:04:04.030> from<00:04:04.450> last<00:04:04.690> week<00:04:06.120> ok

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.550 

ok<00:04:12.130> that's<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.470> early<00:04:14.470> 9.4<00:04:15.400> that's<00:04:16.440> that's<00:04:17.440> a

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
ok that's a early 9.4 that's that's a

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.229 
ok that's a early 9.4 that's that's a
pretty<00:04:17.739> big<00:04:17.980> increase<00:04:18.400> guys<00:04:18.669> that's<00:04:18.880> probably

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
pretty big increase guys that's probably

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.690 
pretty big increase guys that's probably
one<00:04:19.480> of<00:04:19.510> those<00:04:19.690> expected<00:04:20.380> that's<00:04:20.530> me<00:04:20.829> well

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
one of those expected that's me well

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.170 
one of those expected that's me well
roughly<00:04:22.290> 11<00:04:23.290> the<00:04:23.410> half<00:04:23.560> kilograms<00:04:24.070> off<00:04:24.340> or<00:04:24.940> my

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
roughly 11 the half kilograms off or my

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.720 
roughly 11 the half kilograms off or my
target<00:04:25.600> weight<00:04:25.750> is<00:04:25.960> so<00:04:26.260> let's<00:04:26.950> hope<00:04:27.130> next<00:04:27.490> week

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
target weight is so let's hope next week

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.190 
target weight is so let's hope next week
I'll<00:04:28.060> be<00:04:28.120> exactly<00:04:28.660> where<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:28.900> need<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.080> be

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
I'll be exactly where I need to be

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.960 
I'll be exactly where I need to be
that's<00:04:29.979> a<00:04:30.040> good<00:04:30.190> increase<00:04:30.610> so<00:04:30.790> this

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
that's a good increase so this

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.730 
that's a good increase so this
definitely<00:04:31.270> work<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:31.990> action<00:04:32.320> calories

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
definitely work and the action calories

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.890 
definitely work and the action calories
extra<00:04:33.100> bulk<00:04:33.340> going<00:04:34.180> in<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.630> they<00:04:34.750> actually

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
extra bulk going in and they actually

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.960 
extra bulk going in and they actually
having<00:04:35.380> left<00:04:35.590> them<00:04:35.770> as<00:04:36.220> making<00:04:36.490> some<00:04:36.729> serious

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
having left them as making some serious

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.940 
having left them as making some serious
changes<00:04:37.330> to<00:04:37.690> my<00:04:37.810> physical<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.560> quite<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.770> short
