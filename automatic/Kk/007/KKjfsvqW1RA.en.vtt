00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
discussed and reviewed I think that's a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.380 
discussed and reviewed I think that's a
fairly<00:00:41.280> good<00:00:41.430> balance<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.269> think

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
fairly good balance but I don't think

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.299 
fairly good balance but I don't think
there's<00:00:42.629> enough<00:00:42.869> emphasis<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.559> engineering<00:00:44.100> I

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
there's enough emphasis on engineering I

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.310 
there's enough emphasis on engineering I
really<00:00:44.580> don't<00:00:44.790> know<00:00:44.909> about<00:00:45.059> using<00:00:45.540> yeah<00:00:46.290> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
really don't know about using yeah I

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.590 
really don't know about using yeah I
think<00:00:46.619> it's<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.769> little<00:00:46.860> bit<00:00:47.100> prosaic<00:00:47.699> for<00:00:48.449> what

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
think it's a little bit prosaic for what

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.539 
think it's a little bit prosaic for what
we're<00:00:48.839> doing<00:00:49.199> here<00:00:49.530> everybody<00:00:50.010> knows<00:00:50.250> we've
