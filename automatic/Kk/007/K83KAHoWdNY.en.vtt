00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
it's you know it seems like it's gonna

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.310 
it's you know it seems like it's gonna
work<00:04:17.310> out<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.880> way<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.870> know<00:04:18.960> to<00:04:19.020> kind<00:04:19.230> of

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
work out that way you know to kind of

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.110 
work out that way you know to kind of
get<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.590> all<00:04:19.650> over<00:04:19.950> with<00:04:19.980> and<00:04:20.310> in<00:04:20.730> the

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
get it all over with and in the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.060 
get it all over with and in the
speculation<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.320> think<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.590> lot<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.740> people

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
speculation and I think a lot of people

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.370 
speculation and I think a lot of people
you<00:04:23.669> know<00:04:23.820> asked<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:24.720> know<00:04:24.840> why<00:04:24.990> tell<00:04:25.260> the

you know asked you know why tell the
team<00:04:25.620> so<00:04:26.100> are<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.430> last

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
team so are the last

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.330 
team so are the last
let<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.480> lot<00:04:27.690> of<00:04:27.840> those<00:04:27.960> emotions<00:04:28.470> get<00:04:29.130> out<00:04:29.250> of

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
let a lot of those emotions get out of

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.920 
let a lot of those emotions get out of
the<00:04:29.400> way<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.850> everybody<00:04:30.300> went<00:04:30.510> about<00:04:30.750> their

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
the way and everybody went about their

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.260 
the way and everybody went about their
business<00:04:30.990> as<00:04:31.500> we<00:04:31.980> went<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.250> Daytona<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:33.090> race

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
business as we went to Daytona and race

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.780 
business as we went to Daytona and race
the<00:04:33.450> car<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.680> think<00:04:34.740> that's<00:04:35.070> paid<00:04:35.310> off<00:04:35.340> so<00:04:35.760> I

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
the car and I think that's paid off so I

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.670 
the car and I think that's paid off so I
think<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.570> know<00:04:36.660> hopefully<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.110> timing<00:04:37.470> kind

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
think you know hopefully the timing kind

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.670 
think you know hopefully the timing kind
of<00:04:37.770> eases<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.640> for<00:04:38.850> for<00:04:39.180> both<00:04:39.330> sides<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:40.020> to

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
of eases it for for both sides to to

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.410 
of eases it for for both sides to to
kind<00:04:40.890> of<00:04:40.920> go<00:04:41.040> about<00:04:41.220> their<00:04:41.430> business<00:04:41.790> as<00:04:42.030> the
