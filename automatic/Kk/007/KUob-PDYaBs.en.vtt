00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.500
 months 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello youtube friends as they are today 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.369
 I bring a new video tutorial that good 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.379
 let's do an elevator in the form of 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.970
 zipper and well this is the first part 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.279
 since the dividends since they are going to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.289
 take a long time the video and the second part 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.610
 I'll be uploading I think tomorrow morning 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.700
 it depends on what day you are seeing this 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.259
 video and good what we are interested in is 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.500
 good any plate material 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.600
 pressure of stone or wood network all 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.910
 network night are repeaters pistons 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
 sticky and this time stairs and good 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.710
 materials and good the tutorial has been 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.989
 explained good then continuing with 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.879
 this is going to have to do this this 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.819
 hole two deep four of 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.469
 long and two wide good simply 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:52.289
 it was not shown let's have to put 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.059
 another block is followed along not what 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.309
 let's remove this forgiveness and well what 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.989
 we are going to leave like this and well now what 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.089
 let's do is go here in this 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.589
 good habit I'm going to remove this because 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.870
 was going to be where we are going to put the plate 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.120
 of pressure and let's put three good 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.159
 four blocks and just always then 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.250
 let's put a repeat here another field 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.110
 and we're going to put this in three thousand kwanzas 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.180
 t3 and be 4 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.630
 well now let's shoot the right thing 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.260
 well and we are going to set the bar here 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.560
 register torch here and we're going to put 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.150
 another here like this now what we are going to have 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.700
 what to do is here we are going to put a 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.680
 repeater always looking out 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.750
 we're going to have to put the part right 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.460
 this block and well I want the elevator 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.979
 I'm going to make it 10 tall you 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.660
 they can do it whatever they want and the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.180
 truth is that they also need a 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.550
 little good connection for good then 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.710
 to do this elevator because if you 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.750
 work is because of the connection or not good 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.530
 there is an approximately one as 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.240
 oriented 30 percent of 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.340
 odds of you getting stuck 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.399
 so if you do it very very high and you 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.020
 houses every day a little more than half or 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.940
 when you're getting good, well, the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.640
 truth is that it would be fatal because 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.860
 you die and kisses so if you have a 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.229
 connection is excellent because up 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.970
 go ahead in the good problem once 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.350
 done this already as you see there we put the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.660
 blocks and now we're going from here to put a 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.370
 block here 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.940
 up the repeater what here put 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.730
 that on this side but can not add and 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.250
 11 111 as well as me 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.920
 and good and also from this part that 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.049
 just from above do what 111 and well 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.049
 it would be ready and now what we are going to 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.430
 to do is that we have this we go as 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.950
 there is grabbing a bit of way to 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.180
 good zipper the truth is that they had to 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.340
 use your imagination a little 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.180
 Well now what we have to do is 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.590
 go everything from this side time to I have 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.709
 a scrub look I do not know why 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.930
 long good now let's go this 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.299
 side and we're going to put repeaters all the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.590
 I walk here and the other side here is here 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.390
 and the other side always watching for 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.489
 outside without any type because if 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.549
 put on three or two is that 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.680
 then later it will come out nuanced 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.829
 back and they will create jobs equal 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.340
 I right now and good following with 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.400
 this is going to get like that 111 place in 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.010
 this elevator is going to have a lot of 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.019
 that about one and one hand because the truth 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.849
 is something is light or to do but it is worth 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.139
 the penalty believe me you can pity one that 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.569
 I'd just be going to put a block 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.999
 but I know what we're not going to put anything 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.249
 now I want to talk about a little thing 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:40.099
 Channel a friend and I lotero the 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:43.230
 'islands of tutorials for the compu 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.489
 minecraft was ps the same as the 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.819
 totally this side of which by the 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.950
 repeaters good equal of the same pc 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.790
 we will be soon we will be 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.340
 making a series that we're going to be 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.099
 surviving in order obviously 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.150
 we will be trying to survive and 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:05.340
 good for and have a laugh so 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.650
 less are the funny moments not nothing 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.349
 more to inform you of that new one that 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.329

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.159
 me and the creator of the server that is diego 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.549
 we bought there I'll leave them both 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.440
 channels in the description that series and 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.910
 Well, it's going to be made of the days 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.690
 that we can not be sure that 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.940
 days but good as are the big ones 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.550
 colleagues and we have in this series what 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.660
 let's park the bad crafter apc 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.340
 channel visit my friend who does 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.259
 tutorials of the man canceled despite being 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.720
 reviews of mods the text watts and so on 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.820
 many more things and also a video 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.599
 wilbur who is very good too 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.530
 as I do not know a little bit of his life not a 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.690
 bullet that we're going to have to do is 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.810
 so we go two rows completely straight 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.139
 but not 10 as in right here 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.370
 and well now we're going to have to with the 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.470
 material that we are using is more 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.570
 recommendable we are going to have to do here 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.700
 a bit like the planchette no sherry 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.550
 I'm going to do this is what it is for 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.050
 go up a little bit good I tell you how the 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.780
 tablita xerez because the truth is that 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.190
 it seems if in zig zag not for something 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.740
 called like that but because the contest is 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.050
 in zig zag now we are going to have to 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.340
 keep putting and here we put and there and 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.260
 good and we put last and now we go 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.180
 to have to put along this from 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.820
 our little board of sherry we are going to have 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.800
 to go putting repsol torches and 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.990
 well I fell asleep the truth not to me anymore 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.630
 that to beat him but they have to 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.430
 be back may not be well above 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.229
 of the block has to be back because 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.479
 as you see the exception to the repeater but if 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.300
 we put it here it is not activated then 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.580
 they have to put it right back there if not 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.710
 they put it behind will not work 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.120
 so good, continuing with this, let's go 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.760
 have to raise good I'm going to 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.889
 raise and good we remain here to just and 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.240
 since we arrived here we do not put anything 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.580
 more and we go down 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.509
 going down 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.360
 Now what do you have to do to us? Let's 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.430
 have to go adding the pistons and 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.400
 We do not need a jump 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.830
 we have to go all the other side all 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.539
 everything else on the other side is 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.490
 grabbing a side I do not know why put the 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.650
 transport and we go of which to cover here 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.069
 where are the repeaters as you see is 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.509
 something tangled this but good if I 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.719
 do to my steps and seeing our 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:25.240
 videos well, if it's going to work out well 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:28.030
 that I hope for sure in the elevator not 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.530
 you can raise friends because always in 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.360
 your wi-fi connection there is always a second 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.729
 delay then they will stay 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.080
 stuck in less than half you see 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.840
 how do we have to put redstone 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.009
 so about 100 or 110 does not stop when the 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.430
 repeaters and we have to go putting 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:45.560
 networks take along this and ready 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.720
 we go down here going down and down 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.770
 and the same thing will be on the other side but 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.530
 as we already have it here 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:55.040
 greetings to my friend filtered that 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.630
 connected and well here I just got married and 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.740
 well I see them the second part of 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.020
 tutorial that will be left in the 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.120
 description an annotation and good up 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:06.050
 then see you in the second part 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.050
 ah 

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:19.029
