00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.650
 although i'm keirin and from now on you don't have a subscription to the gym 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.770
 need more to be perfect in the sea because you have a personal trainer with the 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.590
 hand thanks to a benchmark the kinect training for the export three-seater 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.390
 in the family box of course the game itself one with a card for four ten 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.390
 days book is live or cool prio 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.710
 to be able to play this game you of course need that I taste those six back 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.470
 but I cook three tasting 60 kinect because that is specially meant for that 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.330
 when the game starts you will first choose your person trainer 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.370
 find a tailor-made program with you 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.220
 after you have entered your age height and weight you can ditsen to a 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.080
 put together a program but, for example, blowing becomes a strong one 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.710
 does the exercises exclusively 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.930
 where you become tight whereby you therefore have lean muscle mass and you 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.260
 can choose a program that makes you slim and therefore where you have a lot of fat 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
 burns on the basis of intensive cardio and strength training 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.100
 once you have chosen, you will do a fit test 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.530
 where a person trainer time on the basis of some good exercises 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.549
 condition is the balance and lexie that time 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.950
 the kinect record all your movements accurately so that when 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.860
 comes one does not do well the trainer jan will correct 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.320
 from this time per second to the opponent 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.970
 and who have you look at how fit you are at that moment and your athletic ability 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.090
 and after comparing this also with the average of your age 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.050
 you now tell your trainer on which days you would like to train that he is the 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.850
 can make ideal planning and so you can, for example, do cardio training on Monday 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.990
 For example, on Wednesday do strength training well every four weeks 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.480
 The fit test will then be passed to see what your filling point will look like 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.140
 so you can really see if you are making progress 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.640
 he can also just train whenever you want, even if you have not planned anything 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.770
 represent your person's training program 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.930
 then you go for example to short training and then you can indicate what kind of 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.700
 type of trainer wants to do for example a weight training or weight training 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.240
 cardio training then opt for cardio training, for example, he can 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.739
 choose which level is normally difficult or intensive 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.829
 Reiki would be for normal because I was a beginner actually 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.679
 and training 4 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:15.939
 I just train for 15 minutes 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.549
 that can choose 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.140
 also worth doing your intensive five-minute sessions, it's all about pom pom 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.230
 pom pom pumps 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.030
 and then even more fun are of course the short challenges such as hit ball where 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.370
 the balls must evade the course where hordes must jump 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.819
 they respond quickly to the challenge because they have to avoid more 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.069
 approach you quickly 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.159
 when your cat does that you may need the kinect sensor a little more 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.140
 point downwards otherwise he cannot register here 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.740
 keep in mind that you have enough space for your TV 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.740
 for practicing certain sports exercises 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.609
 the game makes the ideal customized training schedule based on 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.929
 the pitesti at the start of the game must do what the bus is looking at 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.719
 condition flexibility balance and strength 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.859
 And the great thing is when you developed yourself in the killer whale 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.640
 the training program will also adjust accordingly 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.470
 but you have a person coach at your disposal that is closer to it 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.690
 break through gives your explanation about different exercises for example 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.699
 which uses muscles 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.209
 and the great thing is that you can invite friends to train with thanks to a 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.719
 spotlight 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.209
 whether you want to train to become stronger and more slender with nac plus the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.259
 Kinect training you would achieve your personal goals 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:33.369
