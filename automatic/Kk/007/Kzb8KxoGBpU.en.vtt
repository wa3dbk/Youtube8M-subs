00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.470
 hello kitchens welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.920
 from laura I am Laura and this is my 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.980
 kitchen today we're going to cook golden brown 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.340
 salt and the ingredients that we need 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.220
 are a pair of gilthead breams that are big and 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.550
 quite salt like two kilos of salt for 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.550
 to bake 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.160
 We put the oven to preheat with the 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:34.230
 fire both above and below to 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 a temperature of 180 degrees 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.790
 we cover the bottom of the tray that 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.030
 let's put it in the oven and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.450
 cover with salt make a CaÃ±ita 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.450
 fat salt 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.840
 and on this bed of salt we put the 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.840
 golden 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.340
 and we cover them all with more salt 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.150
 Finally, if we have a small 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.520
 vaporizer we vaporize a little bit of 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.640
 water above the salt 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.770
 just like that and this is now ready to go 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.560
 baked 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.460
 we put the golden ones in the central part 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.189
 of the oven and let them cook or 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.189
 are made is baked for half an hour 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.510
 good kitchens, it's been half past 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.869
 hour and now what we have left is the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.390
 hard task of taking our fish 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.900
 of salt but as you can see, a 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.780
 crust that is very easy to clean well 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.420
 that with patience we will remove the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.960
 salt of the gilthead 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.380
 and we will serve it already clean of thorns and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.710
 of skin that we can accompany them with 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.950
 a mayonnaise sauce with aioli with some 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.930
 boiled potatoes like you better than 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.140
 good to look what look more delicious 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.150
 it 's golden brown we're going to go 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.850
 taking out well in fillets to remove 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.420
 well all the thorns and we will serve 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.420
 half ration or golden average per person 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.870
 so nothing cooks here cleaning 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.420
 My little fish let you go and see what 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.459
 little things that the best myths and 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.459
