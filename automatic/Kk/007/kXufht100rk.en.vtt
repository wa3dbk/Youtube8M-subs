00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
towelettes however are not strong enough

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.550 
towelettes however are not strong enough
to<00:01:17.260> get<00:01:17.500> off<00:01:17.620> my<00:01:18.280> mascara<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.180> my<00:01:19.360> liner<00:01:19.690> ooh

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
look at that all that makeup on my face

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.890 
look at that all that makeup on my face
I<00:01:23.740> know<00:01:23.800> it's<00:01:24.160> gunky<00:01:24.730> so<00:01:25.150> now<00:01:25.300> I'm<00:01:25.420> taking<00:01:25.750> off

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
I know it's gunky so now I'm taking off

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.350 
I know it's gunky so now I'm taking off
my<00:01:26.140> eye<00:01:26.170> shadow<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.280> like<00:01:27.910> I<00:01:28.060> said<00:01:28.240> the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
my eye shadow and like I said the

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.880 
my eye shadow and like I said the
towelettes<00:01:28.900> are<00:01:29.050> not<00:01:29.200> really<00:01:29.500> strong<00:01:29.830> enough

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
towelettes are not really strong enough

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.030 
towelettes are not really strong enough
to<00:01:30.310> get<00:01:30.520> off<00:01:30.760> my<00:01:31.120> mascara<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:32.140> my<00:01:32.680> gel<00:01:33.010> liner

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
to get off my mascara and my gel liner

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.250 
to get off my mascara and my gel liner
so<00:01:33.760> I<00:01:33.790> will<00:01:34.180> be<00:01:34.360> using<00:01:34.570> something<00:01:35.050> different

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
so I will be using something different

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:50.440 
so I will be using something different
to<00:01:35.770> get<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.130> or

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.620 

so<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.480> usually<00:01:52.470> find<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.310> corner<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.420> will

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
so I usually find a corner and I will

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.560 
so I usually find a corner and I will
use<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.870> corner<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.680> remove<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.880> lipstick

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
use that corner to remove my lipstick

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.480 
use that corner to remove my lipstick
and<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.080> have<00:01:58.260> a<00:01:58.290> hard<00:01:58.620> time<00:01:58.680> getting<00:01:59.220> my

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and I have a hard time getting my

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.940 
and I have a hard time getting my
lipstick<00:01:59.910> off<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.300> I<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.720> use<00:02:01.050> a<00:02:01.080> dries<00:02:01.560> howl

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
lipstick off if I just use a dries howl

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.610 
lipstick off if I just use a dries howl
so<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.730> started<00:02:03.180> using<00:02:03.480> the<00:02:04.080> towelettes

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
so I started using the towelettes

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.500 
so I started using the towelettes
because<00:02:04.950> they're<00:02:05.130> moistened<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.910> it<00:02:06.240> helps

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
because they're moistened and it helps

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:29.270 
because they're moistened and it helps
to<00:02:06.660> get<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.900> off<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.110> little<00:02:07.320> bit<00:02:07.560> better<00:02:28.280> I'm

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
to get it off a little bit better I'm

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.760 
to get it off a little bit better I'm
going<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.880> take<00:02:30.120> off<00:02:30.360> my<00:02:30.420> eye<00:02:30.690> makeup<00:02:31.230> using
