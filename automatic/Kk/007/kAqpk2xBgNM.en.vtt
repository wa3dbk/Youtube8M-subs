00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.559
 hi hello again and today we are going to do 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.920
 a gradient but with a brightness and 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.920
 brigitte 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.350
 The first thing I did was put my base 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.820
 handler 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.820
 and then apply link 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.710
 bloody 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.470
 and there is the brightness that I have used has 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.220
 heap of colors has the red has 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.760
 green has purple and is the 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.330
 let's go for us it 's literal all the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.490
 way the the chain to grace buenisimo yo 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.580
 I think that really is making me 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.280
 he gives me April and I am basing the 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.950
 guilty that you know it well then for 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.140
 doing a gradient has little science what 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.270
 only thing we have to do is hit 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.300
 small brushstrokes and chozos goes to 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.870
 brush comes 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.110
 but first let's do it with the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.270
 very very drained brush the first 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.820
 touches we are going to leave although the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.979
 brush I'm very drained in the part 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.110
 further away from the nail bed so that 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.720
 if we have some gobs of brightness and 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.240
 brightness is staying in the most 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.600
 away and we will go giving small 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.600
 touches 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.770
 to go downloading a little but very 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.350
 little glitter so that the effect is of 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.020
 less to more 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.549
 we can do load the brush 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.549
 new with very little paint 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.000
 we reload 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.690
 and we are leaving a little longer 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.020
 we calculate more or less where we have left 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.020
 half 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.330
 already with the most loaded floor 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.780
 We are depositing let a little tip 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.780
 of the nail 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.480
 calling and a little more we leave 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.480
 a little more ornate 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.769
 I the truth is that I think it is 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.170
 manipulates is very simple even for 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.170
 all tastes and long short nails 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.190
 in very elegant m 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.910
 As you can see it is very easy to wait 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.910
 a little bit dry 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.900
 we apply our trick atom I would say that 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.750
 If we are not careful in applying a 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.209
 good coarse layer could get caught 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.569
 the brightness in our clothes then easy 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.390
 we give a coat and spent about 23 hours 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.630
 we can give another layer again and no longer 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.940
 we have no problem 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.280
 I hope you liked it and let me 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.210
 your doubts your comments that 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.240
 do with the little finger up if you like 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:24.070
 and good that you already know ready for 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.070
 envy goodbye
