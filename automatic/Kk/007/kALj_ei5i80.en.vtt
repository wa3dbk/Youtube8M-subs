00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.349

 made spiral walt king I said it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.960
 Well anyway, the case is worth that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.059
 point is today today today that point is 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.040
 can see very easily as soon as I 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.320
 I hit someone and I jumped a little 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.780
 I catch that point there I do not like anything 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.290

 legally do it without explaining it 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:04.910
 and rock and that hinders the process 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.910
 of the race let's see if now 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.360
 we do not pass this or back man 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.610
 if we did not have the speakers for 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.010
 back complicated we go more aggressive and 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.410
 best 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:37.420

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.280
 same 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.270

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.590
