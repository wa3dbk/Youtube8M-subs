00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.970
 Here are a top behavior 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.650
 surprising 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.260
 at rest she is practically 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.120
 right because its center of gravity is 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.220
 very low 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.780
 but when it was turned she 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.620
 tilts quickly to 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.529
 the horizontal then continues to rocked and 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:38.320
 ends up upside down for 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:40.900
 turn in balance on his rod the 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.020
 router used here has a 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:48.190
 important feature it does not have any 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.620
 tip like ordinary tops also 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.110
 as soon as it begins to bow 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.360
 because of the precession his point of 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.739
 contact with the support is no longer 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.230
 aligned with the main axis of rotation 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.470
 the top does not turn around anymore 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.300
 this point but slips and these are the 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.870
 friction forces due to this slip 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.740
 that will accelerate its tipping 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.820
 until she spills 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.860
 completely to stand on his rod 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.600
 its frictional forces make lose a 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.780
 much of the kinetic energy 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.300
 initial also it is necessary to launch the spinning top 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.420
 with vigor to hope to see her 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.420
 return 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.600
 it was amazing that 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.870
 when the router turn on its rod 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.810
 its direction of rotation around the axis 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.220
 main was reversed between the beginning 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.220
 and the end of the experience
