00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
that that was good at the start love but

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.389 
that that was good at the start love but
then<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:51.899> i<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.230> started<00:00:52.590> focusing<00:00:52.949> on

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
then what i really started focusing on

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
then what i really started focusing on
was<00:00:54.059> making<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.600> much<00:00:54.719> money<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.230> could

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
was making as much money as I could

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.040 
was making as much money as I could
because<00:00:55.649> price<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.280> relatively<00:00:56.969> low<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
because price is relatively low and I

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.630 
because price is relatively low and I
wanted<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.469> take<00:00:58.620> advantage<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.460> much

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
wanted to take advantage of that as much

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.029 
wanted to take advantage of that as much
as<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.850> could<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.379> started<00:01:01.680> working

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
as I could so I I really started working

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.490 
as I could so I I really started working
on<00:01:02.070> runecrafting<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.960> was<00:01:04.140> mostly

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
on runecrafting and so this was mostly

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.109 
on runecrafting and so this was mostly
in<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.830> first<00:01:05.159> weekend<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.909> came<00:01:06.090> out

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
K and I invested all in Dragon stones

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.160 
K and I invested all in Dragon stones
which<00:01:13.350> were<00:01:13.380> 12<00:01:13.740> cage<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.369> then<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.420> wasn't

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
which were 12 cage and then I wasn't

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.380

able<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.470> play<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.340> following<00:01:17.970> week<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the glories and I made quite a bit of

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.249 
the glories and I made quite a bit of
money<00:01:50.430> off<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:51.509> are<00:01:51.659> plenty<00:01:52.079> of

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
money off of that there are plenty of

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.770 
money off of that there are plenty of
merchanting<00:01:52.710> options<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.000> 07<00:01:54.270> servers

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
merchanting options in the 07 servers

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.289

people<00:01:55.470> aren't<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.490> used<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.909> not<00:01:57.090> using

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
people aren't really used to not using

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
people aren't really used to not using
the<00:01:57.689> GE<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.009> can<00:01:59.219> make<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.430> lot<00:01:59.549> of

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the GE and so you can make a lot of

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340 
the GE and so you can make a lot of
money<00:01:59.939> off<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.270> people<00:02:00.299> who<00:02:00.689> are<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.960> little<00:02:01.020> bit

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
impatient or the address some stuff

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.550 
impatient or the address some stuff
at<00:02:06.400> their<00:02:06.610> convenience<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.320> works

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
at their convenience so that works

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.960 
at their convenience so that works
pretty<00:02:08.830> well<00:02:10.290> so<00:02:11.290> yeah<00:02:11.920> let's<00:02:12.280> see<00:02:12.490> I<00:02:12.520> made

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
pretty well so yeah let's see I made

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.070 
pretty well so yeah let's see I made
let's<00:02:13.870> say<00:02:14.020> I'm<00:02:14.200> at<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:15.300> 530<00:02:16.300> cable<00:02:16.660> rafting

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
let's say I'm at a 530 cable rafting

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.240 
let's say I'm at a 530 cable rafting
experience<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.340> that's<00:02:18.720> somewhere<00:02:20.070> just<00:02:21.070> a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
experience so that's somewhere just a

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.190 
experience so that's somewhere just a
rough<00:02:21.520> estimate<00:02:21.940> off<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.570> top<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.750> my<00:02:22.900> head

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
rough estimate off the top of my head

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.710 
rough estimate off the top of my head
I'd<00:02:24.070> say<00:02:24.610> that's<00:02:24.960> probably<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:27.550> level<00:02:28.150> 44<00:02:28.630> is

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
I'd say that's probably of level 44 is

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.620 
I'd say that's probably of level 44 is
about<00:02:28.960> 50k<00:02:29.770> experience<00:02:30.280> I'd<00:02:30.460> say<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:30.880> 400<00:02:31.480> ATK

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
about 50k experience I'd say so 400 ATK

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.430 
about 50k experience I'd say so 400 ATK
experience<00:02:32.820> roughly<00:02:33.820> 50<00:02:34.360> K<00:02:34.570> nature's<00:02:34.990> that<00:02:35.380> I

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
experience roughly 50 K nature's that I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.920 
experience roughly 50 K nature's that I
made<00:02:35.620> some<00:02:36.100> around<00:02:36.460> there<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.510> I'm<00:02:37.810> not

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
made some around there and so I'm not

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.150 
made some around there and so I'm not
really<00:02:37.990> sure<00:02:38.200> how<00:02:38.380> much<00:02:38.500> profit<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:38.980> is

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
really sure how much profit that is

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.800 
really sure how much profit that is
because<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.550> prices<00:02:39.850> have<00:02:40.210> changed<00:02:40.240> I

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
because the prices have changed I

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.390 
because the prices have changed I
remember<00:02:41.260> selling<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.620> first<00:02:41.830> few<00:02:42.040> nature's

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
remember selling the first few nature's

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.270 
remember selling the first few nature's

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
for somewhere around 120 each another up

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.570 
for somewhere around 120 each another up
to<00:02:45.430> about<00:02:45.580> 250<00:02:45.970> each<00:02:46.210> so<00:02:47.190> I've<00:02:48.190> made<00:02:48.340> quite<00:02:48.520> a

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.040 
to about 250 each so I've made quite a

yeah<00:05:46.729> I<00:05:46.760> also<00:05:46.940> do<00:05:47.210> need<00:05:47.389> to<00:05:47.479> get<00:05:47.599> a<00:05:47.630> whip<00:05:47.840> but

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
yeah I also do need to get a whip but

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.839 
yeah I also do need to get a whip but
they're<00:05:48.289> ridiculously<00:05:49.160> overpriced<00:05:49.580> at<00:05:49.789> the

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
they're ridiculously overpriced at the

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.700 
they're ridiculously overpriced at the
moment<00:05:50.150> because<00:05:50.270> they're<00:05:50.660> just<00:05:51.020> brand<00:05:51.289> new<00:05:51.500> I

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
moment because they're just brand new I

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.460 
moment because they're just brand new I
think<00:05:52.340> the<00:05:52.400> first<00:05:52.550> person<00:05:53.090> got<00:05:54.050> there<00:05:54.260> whip

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
think the first person got there whip

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.920 
think the first person got there whip
today<00:05:54.770> or<00:05:55.039> yesterday<00:05:55.190> so<00:05:55.599> yeah<00:05:56.599> I'll<00:05:56.690> wait<00:05:56.900> a

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
today or yesterday so yeah I'll wait a

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.219 
today or yesterday so yeah I'll wait a
while<00:05:57.110> on<00:05:57.349> that<00:05:57.560> and<00:05:58.210> yeah<00:05:59.210> so<00:05:59.389> that's<00:05:59.599> really

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
while on that and yeah so that's really

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.820 
while on that and yeah so that's really
it<00:06:00.410> for<00:06:00.680> all<00:06:00.800> my<00:06:01.280> bank<00:06:01.490> video<00:06:02.110> as<00:06:03.110> for<00:06:03.530> future
