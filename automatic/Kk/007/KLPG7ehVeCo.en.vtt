00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
show you how you normally go to the shop

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.640 
show you how you normally go to the shop
so<00:03:31.820> :<00:03:32.060> clone<00:03:32.330> shops<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.930> then<00:03:33.080> you<00:03:33.320> can<00:03:33.470> get

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
so : clone shops and then you can get

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.410 
so : clone shops and then you can get
super<00:03:33.890> or<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.370> can<00:03:34.490> get<00:03:34.580> prayer<00:03:34.790> potions<00:03:35.000> here

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
super or you can get prayer potions here

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.320 
super or you can get prayer potions here
and<00:03:35.980> there's<00:03:36.980> only<00:03:37.130> a<00:03:37.250> hundred<00:03:37.460> of<00:03:37.790> them<00:03:37.940> so

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
and there's only a hundred of them so

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.300 
and there's only a hundred of them so
that<00:03:38.570> means<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:39.140> can<00:03:39.290> only<00:03:39.500> do<00:03:39.860> an<00:03:40.100> increment

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
that means you can only do an increment

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.190 
that means you can only do an increment
of<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.820> hundred<00:03:41.000> each<00:03:41.270> time<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.750> then<00:03:41.960> there's

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
of a hundred each time and then there's

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.870 
of a hundred each time and then there's
a<00:03:42.290> thousand<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.770> those<00:03:42.950> so<00:03:43.490> it's<00:03:43.670> really

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
a thousand of those so it's really

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.150 
a thousand of those so it's really
unbalanced<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:44.840> kind<00:03:45.080> of<00:03:45.170> hard<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.680> make

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
unbalanced and it's kind of hard to make

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.310 
unbalanced and it's kind of hard to make
you<00:03:46.670> can<00:03:46.910> make<00:03:47.120> profit<00:03:47.330> but<00:03:47.660> of<00:03:47.840> course<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.170> lot

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
you can make profit but of course a lot

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.690 
you can make profit but of course a lot
of<00:03:48.350> people<00:03:48.680> will<00:03:48.800> probably<00:03:49.010> be<00:03:49.340> doing<00:03:49.490> this

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
of people will probably be doing this

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.190 
of people will probably be doing this
method<00:03:49.910> as<00:03:50.150> well<00:03:50.330> so<00:03:50.540> it's<00:03:50.660> kind<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:50.930> hard<00:03:51.140> to

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
method as well so it's kind of hard to

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.660 
method as well so it's kind of hard to
do<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.190> so<00:03:52.790> also<00:03:53.510> guys<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.870> have<00:03:54.670> brawling

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
do that so also guys I have brawling

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.050 
do that so also guys I have brawling
gloves

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
gloves

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.000 
gloves
herblore<00:03:56.390> so<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:57.020> means<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:57.320> get<00:03:57.500> more<00:03:57.710> XP

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
herblore so that means I get more XP

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.830 
herblore so that means I get more XP
meaning<00:03:58.520> I<00:03:58.610> get<00:03:58.760> more<00:03:59.030> points<00:03:59.210> per<00:03:59.450> hour<00:03:59.570> and

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
meaning I get more points per hour and

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.050 
meaning I get more points per hour and
more<00:04:00.260> XP<00:04:00.650> obviously<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.700> should<00:04:01.940> be

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
more XP obviously so you should be

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.930 
more XP obviously so you should be
looking<00:04:02.270> at<00:04:02.570> probably<00:04:03.110> around<00:04:03.740> 90<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.490> 100

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
looking at probably around 90 to 100

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
200 to 275 points per hour now I bought

making around 50k profit per potion so

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.710 
making around 50k profit per potion so
if<00:04:42.919> we<00:04:43.039> do<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.310> math<00:04:43.550> we're<00:04:44.419> gonna<00:04:44.569> average

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
if we do the math we're gonna average

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.430 
if we do the math we're gonna average
out<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.199> around<00:04:45.380> 5,000<00:04:46.099> per<00:04:46.220> hour<00:04:46.340> I'm<00:04:46.819> making

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
out to around 5,000 per hour I'm making

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.240 
out to around 5,000 per hour I'm making
750<00:04:48.440> ml<00:04:48.620> per<00:04:48.830> hour

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
750 ml per hour

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.370 
750 ml per hour
however<00:04:49.580> 500<00:04:50.210> mil<00:04:50.419> of<00:04:50.449> that<00:04:50.690> is<00:04:50.870> in<00:04:51.020> supplies

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
however 500 mil of that is in supplies

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.469 
however 500 mil of that is in supplies
because<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:51.860> bought<00:04:52.039> them<00:04:52.250> for<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:52.789> expensive

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
because I bought them for so expensive

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.629 
because I bought them for so expensive
so<00:04:54.229> I'm<00:04:54.349> actually<00:04:54.530> only<00:04:54.830> making<00:04:55.130> a<00:04:55.280> total

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
so I'm actually only making a total

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.420 
so I'm actually only making a total
profit<00:04:55.849> of<00:04:56.060> 250<00:04:56.810> ml<00:04:57.139> an<00:04:57.319> hour<00:04:57.470> which<00:04:57.949> is<00:04:57.979> still

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
profit of 250 ml an hour which is still

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.159 
profit of 250 ml an hour which is still
really<00:04:58.639> good<00:04:58.940> because<00:04:59.180> it's<00:04:59.539> stable<00:04:59.990> since

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
really good because it's stable since

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.140 
really good because it's stable since
you<00:05:00.289> can<00:05:00.470> ask<00:05:00.680> them<00:05:00.889> and<00:05:01.039> you<00:05:01.460> can<00:05:01.610> even<00:05:01.820> sell

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
you can ask them and you can even sell

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.939 
you can ask them and you can even sell
them<00:05:02.270> to<00:05:02.449> players<00:05:02.690> for<00:05:03.110> a<00:05:03.380> hundred<00:05:03.830> and

them to players for a hundred and
seventy-five<00:05:04.280> K<00:05:04.639> each<00:05:04.820> meaning<00:05:05.389> that<00:05:05.539> you'll

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
seventy-five K each meaning that you'll

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.020 
seventy-five K each meaning that you'll
actually<00:05:06.020> make<00:05:06.139> a<00:05:06.169> 75<00:05:06.710> K<00:05:06.979> profit<00:05:07.340> per<00:05:07.580> potion

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
actually make a 75 K profit per potion

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.939 
actually make a 75 K profit per potion
now<00:05:08.810> you<00:05:09.259> also<00:05:09.740> get<00:05:10.099> you<00:05:10.190> know<00:05:10.310> 200<00:05:11.000> to<00:05:11.330> 350<00:05:11.960> PK

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
now you also get you know 200 to 350 PK

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.790 
now you also get you know 200 to 350 PK
points<00:05:13.190> per<00:05:13.310> hour<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.849> that<00:05:14.810> amount<00:05:15.259> of<00:05:15.410> PK

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.370 
points per hour and that amount of PK
points<00:05:16.130> goes<00:05:16.310> for<00:05:16.550> anywhere<00:05:16.849> from<00:05:17.380> probably
