00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.720
 I would like to get points in any match in the future but with 3 points 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.720
 I thought that I could not line up but commented that 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.179
 Most 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.669
 It has not changed so much 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.760
 I wonder why 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.900
 Whether the first game is the most important 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.640
 aluto 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.150
 After all 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.519
 Also in the United States 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.550
 A country that has never won a world cup 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.779
 Emirates' appeal 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.899
 Mental aspect 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.689
 It is good to take profit separately from anywhere but after all 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.600
 Lol of the mental side team When thinking about such a situation 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.830
 Points in the first match 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.900
 I have to take it 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.240
 team is 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.940
 Concerns about mentally going down- 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.940
 I feel it 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.650
 Netherlands 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.890
 After all this is 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.890
 I think it is strong because it is super first class 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.350
 If there is no possibility of taking any points 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.350
 The possibility may be low though 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.240
 Our job is to challenge the possibility of gangrene 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.280
 was 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.280
 I think that way 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.730
 Become ja 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.980
 The Yomiuri Shimbun is included 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.850
 ecb by last March 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.650
 s terminal circle 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.780
 It is a test match 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.260
 Mima City So, as Okada 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.310
 What the 19th 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.310
 To narrow down 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.090
 May be considered liquid crystal 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.180
 I talked about it, but our complaint between stations 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.970
 There are some points for correction as well 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.700
 Up to now 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700
 Analyze your scoring ability 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.320
 As we pre-press from the front, we have all scored points 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.870
 Absent 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.150
 However, when I was answered in the moment I caught 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.070
 In overwhelming speed difference 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.489
 Mase has a winning line 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.249
 For that case he said 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:12.520
 Yeah 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.590
 Microphone available 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.469
 Medieval point 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.659
 Korea 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.209
 In the game of wood 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.539
 Esd and staff check or depending on the situation 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:23.659
 Next match 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:24.670
 2 games- 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.599
 Upper checkpoint 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.669
 I want to consider 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.669
 I think it's western style 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.560
 I was from now 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.560
 07 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.859
 I wonder if it's French 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.329
 I want to ask that director Okada but I received that 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.790
 Okubo is a player but his position is 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:51.790
 That Nakota dances strongly again and there is also a possibility of Gangnam-gu 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.629
 There are various man players and he has a prayer among them 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.079
 I think I've finally come back recently 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.779
 I dare to come to Okubo Kobe et al. 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:05.109
 I want you to tell me that attitude of my head 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.599
 This is not selected and its backup members 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.649
 Though different 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.569
 And bring the selected 100,000 people 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:12.400
 iron 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.460
 I want to work together, so I think about that 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.069
 I want to bring it 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.069
 10 days for beating 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.779
 The escalator has returned and it is quite easy 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.349
 There were many people who didn't 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:29.909
 What do you say 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.289
 The true meaning is true 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.079
 s Such things are close 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.639
 I feel that I came back 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.329
 eh 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.279
 When fighting in the world cup 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:43.429
 One to one 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.369
 If you can not write with the ball 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:48.990
 How long does it take to notify Matsumoto City 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.779
 So in that way 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.779
 He's the speed of the moment the strength of his hit 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:57.529
 Such thing 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.529
 That's why he is elected 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:03.319
 then 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.779
 With members in the young supporting part 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.589
 30 years 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:12.379
 With the remaining 27 members of the remaining 27 registered members 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:13.839
 Totally different 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:15.739
 think 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.509
 So I'll take you 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.789
 At 25-23 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:20.660
 f 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.949
 After this 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.949
 Even knowing in consultation with the technical committee 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.499
 The fourth round 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.779
 Naturally it will be said in it 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.059
 Even players who have entered 30 years 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.439
 May be included 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.039
 f 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.639
 Are all the young members bringing in 30 people? 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.639
 It may not be so 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.620
 East part 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.139
 And I think the richness of TV Tokyo 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.770
 I'm electro but I will report about fr players 

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:05.939
 When cherry blossoms are examined as if they are spiritually main 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.789
 It was said that 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.319
 Well that's his condition site 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.129
 If 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.129
 I told that I thought of something like Mourinho 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:18.479
 bed 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.770
 I put it in now 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.400
 what is called bebo 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.130
 The Buddhist statue that had been before that ship is usually being rehabilitated 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.419
 Forced fascism 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.909
 First of all for him 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.310
 The rice side stood up 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.660
 So I talk to him and I can still do it 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.080
 Cactus 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.719
 He was a representative after becoming Park 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:41.930
 And 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.889
 after that 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.349
 We talked about the members 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.830
 Then .bo rejoices 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.979
 I saw that he played with what stance he could get 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:51.529
 Heel 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:54.589
 While looking at such Kawaguchi auto 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:55.800
 He is 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.089
 Before losing 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.019
 I will aim for a representative for such things 

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:05.159
 If so, I think that there is also such a possibility in the end 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.740
 Was 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.400
 But what happens if you do a big injury 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.330
 If you can just play, it will change from thinking at that time 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.860
 did not 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.139
 In that sense I did not decide to start 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.339
 There is not 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:21.469
 After all he 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:24.559
 Change in various painful experiences 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:28.489
 I felt such things and I will finally make it
