welcome to the automated course flight
training<00:01:04.870> for<00:01:05.290> engineers<00:01:06.480> this<00:01:07.480> course

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
training for engineers this course

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.220 
training for engineers this course
consists<00:01:08.440> of<00:01:08.590> two<00:01:08.860> parts<00:01:09.660> navigation<00:01:10.660> and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
consists of two parts navigation and

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:28.140 
consists of two parts navigation and
gravitation<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.680> just<00:01:26.920> hold<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.700> bottom<00:01:28.000> of

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
gravitation so just hold the bottom of

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:43.290 
gravitation so just hold the bottom of
it<00:01:28.979> actually<00:01:41.640> that's<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.729> direction<00:01:43.030> I'm

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
it actually that's the direction I'm

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:50.100 
it actually that's the direction I'm
going<00:01:48.119> accelerate<00:01:49.119> to<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.600> opposite

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
going accelerate to the opposite

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.300 
going accelerate to the opposite
direction<00:01:50.440> of<00:01:50.710> your<00:01:50.830> velocity<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:52.060> slow<00:01:52.330> down

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.130 

that's<00:01:57.310> how<00:01:57.460> you<00:01:57.520> slow<00:01:57.759> down<00:01:58.140> opposite

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
that's how you slow down opposite

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.190 
that's how you slow down opposite
direction<00:01:59.550> just<00:02:00.550> cook<00:02:00.910> it

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.130 

seni<00:02:03.890> Kate<00:02:04.159> around<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.670> area<00:02:05.030> collect<00:02:05.899> all

seni Kate around the area collect all

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.660 
seni Kate around the area collect all
three<00:02:06.500> targets

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:34.040 

basically<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.960> gravity<00:02:14.960> game<00:02:15.400> very<00:02:16.400> cool

times

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:43.740

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
let's go to the actual game wait so once

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.839 
let's go to the actual game wait so once

you are done with the tutorial the real
game<00:03:46.120> begins

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:28.890 

this<00:04:08.390> game

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900

good day guys ownership to the rest will

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.720 
good day guys ownership to the rest will
return<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.870> your<00:04:35.960> mother<00:04:36.200> ship<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:37.460> story

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
return to your mother ship the story

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
return to your mother ship the story
basically<00:04:37.970> like<00:04:38.420> anything

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.910 

can<00:04:47.350> read<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> mothership<00:04:49.920> eventually

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
can read to the mothership eventually

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.610 
can read to the mothership eventually
we'll<00:04:51.040> get<00:04:51.250> there

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.650 

let's<00:04:55.310> go<00:04:55.520> down<00:04:55.790> slow<00:04:56.210> down<00:04:58.449> and<00:04:59.449> see<00:04:59.630> the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
let's go down slow down and see the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.439 
let's go down slow down and see the
circle<00:05:00.229> thing<00:05:00.260> you<00:05:01.190> have<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.370> stay<00:05:01.820> for<00:05:02.240> that

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
circle thing you have to stay for that

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.040 
circle thing you have to stay for that
amount<00:05:02.870> of<00:05:03.020> time<00:05:03.130> for<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.630> objective<00:05:05.630> Triple

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
amount of time for the objective Triple

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.250 
amount of time for the objective Triple
P<00:05:06.850> naturally<00:05:08.470> collections<00:05:10.930> all<00:05:11.930> right<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:12.169> you

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
P naturally collections all right so you

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:20.980 
P naturally collections all right so you
got<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.440> collect<00:05:12.710> debris<00:05:19.449> all<00:05:20.449> right<00:05:20.630> so<00:05:20.810> there

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
got to collect debris all right so there

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:38.830 
got to collect debris all right so there
are<00:05:21.080> six<00:05:21.560> pieces<00:05:23.740> yeah

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.689 

thing<00:05:39.730> the<00:05:40.730> best<00:05:40.970> way<00:05:41.210> is<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:42.490> drive<00:05:43.490> it

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
thing the best way is to drive it

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.760 
thing the best way is to drive it
navigate<00:05:44.210> it<00:05:44.300> slowly<00:05:44.600> for<00:05:45.169> collecting<00:05:45.650> these

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
navigate it slowly for collecting these

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.870 
navigate it slowly for collecting these
red<00:05:46.040> berries<00:05:46.300> otherwise<00:05:47.300> you<00:05:47.510> just<00:05:47.660> fly<00:05:48.169> off

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
red berries otherwise you just fly off

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.280 
red berries otherwise you just fly off
takes<00:05:49.880> a<00:05:50.030> lot<00:05:50.210> of<00:05:50.240> time<00:05:50.389> to<00:05:50.690> get<00:05:50.810> back<00:05:51.050> into

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
takes a lot of time to get back into

00:05:51.290 --> 00:06:21.930 
takes a lot of time to get back into
orbit<00:05:53.290> yeah<00:05:54.290> like<00:05:54.650> that

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:41.209 

dunmore

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:46.260 

trash<00:06:42.219> nothing<00:06:43.210> but<00:06:43.360> trash<00:06:43.949> and<00:06:44.949> so<00:06:45.340> on<00:06:45.490> that's

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
trash nothing but trash and so on that's

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.179 
trash nothing but trash and so on that's
a<00:06:46.389> play<00:06:46.569> the<00:06:46.689> game<00:06:47.370> it<00:06:48.370> is<00:06:48.520> kind<00:06:48.789> of<00:06:48.909> new<00:06:49.840> to<00:06:49.870> me

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:50.189 
a play the game it is kind of new to me

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:54.209 
a play the game it is kind of new to me
