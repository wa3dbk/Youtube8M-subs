00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
before I think I always expected it to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.399 
before I think I always expected it to
be<00:01:45.209> hard<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.779> then<00:01:45.959> you<00:01:46.109> don't<00:01:46.289> really

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
be hard but then you don't really

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.949 
be hard but then you don't really
realize<00:01:46.560> until<00:01:46.889> you<00:01:47.249> get<00:01:47.429> here<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.749> have

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
realize until you get here that you have

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.199 
realize until you get here that you have
to<00:01:48.989> work<00:01:49.289> very<00:01:49.319> hard<00:01:49.709> but<00:01:50.489> you<00:01:50.609> play<00:01:50.789> hard<00:01:51.029> as

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
to work very hard but you play hard as

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.989 
to work very hard but you play hard as
well<00:01:51.389> so<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.020> makes<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.319> a<00:01:52.409> lawyer<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.950> think<00:01:53.849> the
