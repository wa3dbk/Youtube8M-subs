00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
hello there here are a few tips if

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.670 
hello there here are a few tips if
you're<00:00:04.589> thinking<00:00:05.040> about<00:00:05.339> about<00:00:05.670> installing

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
you're thinking about about installing

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.339 
you're thinking about about installing
self-adhesive<00:00:07.680> tiles<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.960> as<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.050> can<00:00:10.200> see

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
self-adhesive tiles and as you can see

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.610 
self-adhesive tiles and as you can see
in<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.530> picture<00:00:10.980> our<00:00:11.639> bathroom<00:00:12.420> had<00:00:12.840> carpet

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
in the picture our bathroom had carpet

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.020 
in the picture our bathroom had carpet
for<00:00:13.889> some<00:00:14.070> reason<00:00:14.400> they<00:00:14.490> decided<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.849> put

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
for some reason they decided to put

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.080 
for some reason they decided to put
carpet<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> bathroom<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.400> so<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.760> looked

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
carpet in the bathroom and so we looked

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.840 
carpet in the bathroom and so we looked
around<00:00:18.240> about<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.960> do<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.520> we<00:00:20.520> decided

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
around about what to do and we decided

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.460 
around about what to do and we decided
to<00:00:20.970> put<00:00:21.650> self-adhesive<00:00:22.650> tires<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.840> think

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to put self-adhesive tires so I think

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.849 
to put self-adhesive tires so I think
that<00:00:25.949> speakeasy<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.060> install<00:00:27.449> them<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.500> only

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that speakeasy to install them the only

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.080 
that speakeasy to install them the only
difficult<00:00:29.369> part<00:00:29.400> would<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.029> about<00:00:30.740> grouting

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
difficult part would be about grouting

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.030 
difficult part would be about grouting
putting<00:00:33.090> installing<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> grout<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.980> between

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
putting installing the grout in between

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.040 
putting installing the grout in between
tiles<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.090> first<00:00:36.300> thing<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.630> need<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:36.960> is

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
tiles the first thing you need to do is

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.470 
tiles the first thing you need to do is
to<00:00:37.170> remove<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.920> carpet<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.300> pretty

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to remove the carpet and this is pretty

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.979 
to remove the carpet and this is pretty
easy<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.809> do<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.379> pull<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.739> up<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.719> once<00:00:42.719> all

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
easy to do just pull it up and once all

those all the mess after you do that the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.620 
those all the mess after you do that the
subfloor<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.470> or<00:01:07.860> might<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.450> labeled<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
subfloor my or might not be labeled and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.140 
subfloor my or might not be labeled and
straight<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> good<00:01:11.640> thing<00:01:11.880> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
straight but it is a good thing to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.230 
straight but it is a good thing to
install<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:13.280> layer<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.640> plywood<00:01:15.200> that<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.650> made

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
install a layer of plywood that is made

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.080 
install a layer of plywood that is made
purpose-to<00:01:20.150> for<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> tires<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:23.090> it's

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
purpose-to for the tires and it's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.109 
purpose-to for the tires and it's
important<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> put<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> plywood<00:01:26.119> pretty

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
important to put the plywood pretty

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.539 
important to put the plywood pretty
precisely<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.930> need<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.290> go<00:01:28.829> around<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
precisely you need to go around on the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.569 
precisely you need to go around on the
edges<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.860> this<00:01:31.860> takes<00:01:32.159> some<00:01:32.280> time<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
edges and this takes some time to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.179 
edges and this takes some time to
achieve<00:01:32.850> also<00:01:33.689> once<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.140> lay<00:01:34.680> all<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
achieve also once you lay all the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.640 
achieve also once you lay all the
plywood<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:36.090> need<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.540> put<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> lot<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.320> nails

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
plywood you need to put a lot of nails

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.179 
plywood you need to put a lot of nails
in<00:01:38.509> order<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.689> keep<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.259> place<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.530> you're

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
in order to keep it in place so you're

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.700 
in order to keep it in place so you're
sure<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.549> normal<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.659> think<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.290> put<00:01:43.470> nails

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
sure it's normal so I think I put nails

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.499 
sure it's normal so I think I put nails
every<00:01:44.100> three<00:01:44.430> inches<00:01:44.759> all<00:01:44.970> around<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.360> edges

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
every three inches all around the edges

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.620 
every three inches all around the edges
and<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> nice<00:01:47.130> power<00:01:47.670> tool<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and I have a nice power tool that is

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
and I have a nice power tool that is
battery-operated<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:50.009> puts<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> nails<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
battery-operated that puts the nails and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.170 
battery-operated that puts the nails and
was<00:01:52.470> really<00:01:52.860> really<00:01:53.640> handy<00:01:55.280> if<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.549> subfloor

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
was really really handy if the subfloor

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.899 
was really really handy if the subfloor
is<00:01:57.450> not<00:01:57.750> labeled<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.710> straight<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.579> cell

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
is not labeled a straight the cell

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.630 
is not labeled a straight the cell
product<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> very<00:02:01.860> liquid<00:02:02.159> cement

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
product is like a very liquid cement

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.819 
product is like a very liquid cement
that<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.810> pour<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.229> software<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that you can pour on the software and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.969 
that you can pour on the software and
then<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.130> can<00:02:05.570> kind<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.659> spread<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.469> make

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
then you can kind of spread it and make

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.630 
then you can kind of spread it and make
the<00:02:08.129> surface<00:02:08.750> pretty<00:02:09.750> much<00:02:10.050> leveled<00:02:10.860> now<00:02:11.280> with

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the surface pretty much leveled now with

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.120 
the surface pretty much leveled now with
the<00:02:11.760> real<00:02:11.910> tiles<00:02:12.300> is

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
the real tiles is

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.650 
the real tiles is
important<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.550> have<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.910> software<00:02:14.270> straight

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
important to have the software straight

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.920 
important to have the software straight
with<00:02:15.140> vinyl<00:02:15.710> tiles<00:02:15.980> because<00:02:16.670> they<00:02:16.850> adapt<00:02:17.300> is

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
with vinyl tiles because they adapt is

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.450 
with vinyl tiles because they adapt is
not<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:18.830> critical<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.650> after<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:22.130> put<00:02:22.430> the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
not so critical so after you put the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.490 
not so critical so after you put the
plywood<00:02:22.850> now<00:02:23.600> it's<00:02:23.750> time<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.080> start<00:02:24.320> laying

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
plywood now it's time to start laying

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.820 
plywood now it's time to start laying
the<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:25.610> tires<00:02:25.910> what<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.450> did<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.900> cut<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> line<00:02:27.590> in

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
the the tires what I did I cut a line in

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.400 
the the tires what I did I cut a line in
the<00:02:27.920> center<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.600> when<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:29.690> put<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> line<00:02:30.110> try

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
the center and when you put a line try

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.250 
the center and when you put a line try
to<00:02:30.470> see<00:02:30.860> not<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.400> end<00:02:31.730> up<00:02:31.910> on<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.450> sides<00:02:32.750> get<00:02:33.140> up

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
to see not to end up on the sides get up

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.220 
to see not to end up on the sides get up
with<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> very<00:02:33.830> small<00:02:34.250> piece<00:02:35.240> of<00:02:35.270> tiles<00:02:35.930> because

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
with a very small piece of tiles because

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.780 
with a very small piece of tiles because
otherwise<00:02:36.590> they<00:02:36.830> don't<00:02:36.860> stick<00:02:37.250> on<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.550> floor

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
otherwise they don't stick on the floor

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.630 
otherwise they don't stick on the floor
they<00:02:38.300> don't<00:02:38.480> stick<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.870> this<00:02:39.020> on<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.530> yarns<00:02:40.160> on

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
they don't stick on this on the yarns on

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.120 
they don't stick on this on the yarns on
the<00:02:40.790> plywood<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:43.070> then<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.940> put<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.200> line<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.740> I

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
the plywood so then I put the line and I

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.310 
the plywood so then I put the line and I
started<00:02:46.610> laying<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:49.250> first<00:02:49.400> tile<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.080> then<00:02:51.080> I

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
started laying the first tile and then I

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.660 
started laying the first tile and then I
have<00:02:51.950> used<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.610> quarter<00:02:53.450> inch<00:02:53.980> spacers<00:02:54.980> they

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
have used a quarter inch spacers they

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.730 
have used a quarter inch spacers they
make<00:02:55.880> different<00:02:56.180> spaces<00:02:56.870> they<00:02:56.990> use<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:57.500> they

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
make different spaces they use that they

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.310 
make different spaces they use that they
have<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.190> quarter<00:02:58.790> 1/8<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.390> 3/8<00:02:59.750> I<00:03:00.020> think<00:03:00.230> I

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
have the quarter 1/8 and 3/8 I think I

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.980 
have the quarter 1/8 and 3/8 I think I
saw<00:03:00.530> in<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.680> store<00:03:00.920> or<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:02.360> can<00:03:02.690> also<00:03:02.840> put

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
saw in the store or you can also put

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.670 
saw in the store or you can also put
this<00:03:03.320> tile<00:03:03.620> without<00:03:04.450> spacers<00:03:05.450> just<00:03:05.930> one<00:03:06.200> after

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
this tile without spacers just one after

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.340 
this tile without spacers just one after
another<00:03:06.710> in<00:03:07.610> this<00:03:08.390> case<00:03:08.660> even<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.050> need<00:03:09.200> to

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
another in this case even you need to

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.980 
another in this case even you need to
put<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.890> grout<00:03:10.190> but<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.120> wanted<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.720> put<00:03:11.900> the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
put the grout but I wanted to put the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.990 
put the grout but I wanted to put the
grout<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.260> make<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.680> look<00:03:12.830> more<00:03:13.010> real<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:16.000> then

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
grout to make it look more real so then

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.360 
grout to make it look more real so then
you<00:03:17.180> start<00:03:17.540> putting<00:03:17.720> all<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.050> tiles<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.620> when

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
you start putting all the tiles and when

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.320 
you start putting all the tiles and when
once<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.970> get<00:03:20.150> by<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:20.900> corners<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.970> tiles

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
once you get by the corners this tiles

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.390 
once you get by the corners this tiles
are<00:03:23.450> very<00:03:23.480> easy<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.810> cut<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.980> can<00:03:25.130> use<00:03:25.370> a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
are very easy to cut you can use a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.350 
are very easy to cut you can use a
utility<00:03:26.360> knife<00:03:26.630> or<00:03:27.110> just<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.920> scissor<00:03:28.760> you<00:03:29.120> can

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
utility knife or just a scissor you can

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.190 
utility knife or just a scissor you can
pretty<00:03:29.690> much<00:03:29.930> cut<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.890> ties<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.930> go<00:03:32.930> around

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
pretty much cut the ties and go around

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.540 
pretty much cut the ties and go around
all<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.530> corners<00:03:34.840> once<00:03:35.840> all<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.860> tiles<00:03:37.340> are

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
all the corners once all the tiles are

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.500 
all the corners once all the tiles are
laid<00:03:38.420> down<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:40.010> next<00:03:40.280> thing<00:03:40.430> would<00:03:40.610> be<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:41.300> put

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
laid down the next thing would be to put

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.600 
laid down the next thing would be to put
the<00:03:41.630> grout<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.230> this<00:03:42.380> was<00:03:42.620> my<00:03:43.130> opinion<00:03:43.490> the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
the grout and this was my opinion the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.770 
the grout and this was my opinion the
most<00:03:43.730> difficult<00:03:44.180> part<00:03:44.390> of<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.810> whole<00:03:44.959> job<00:03:44.990> and

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
most difficult part of the whole job and

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.750 
most difficult part of the whole job and
my<00:03:47.780> advice<00:03:48.110> is<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.980> have<00:03:49.160> somebody<00:03:49.520> to<00:03:49.730> help

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
my advice is to have somebody to help

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.740 
my advice is to have somebody to help
you<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.300> to<00:03:50.840> buy<00:03:51.050> at<00:03:51.350> least<00:03:51.700> two<00:03:52.700> sponges<00:03:53.300> and

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
you and to buy at least two sponges and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.350 
you and to buy at least two sponges and
I'll<00:03:54.170> tell<00:03:54.350> you<00:03:54.440> why<00:03:54.590> first<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:55.940> all<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.270> need

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
I'll tell you why first of all you need

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.580 
I'll tell you why first of all you need
to<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:57.530> squeeze<00:03:58.370> out<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.760> grout<00:03:59.270> I<00:03:59.630> by<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.470> way

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
to to squeeze out the grout I by the way

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
to to squeeze out the grout I by the way
I<00:04:00.620> use<00:04:01.209> ready-made<00:04:02.260> mix<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:04.250> can<00:04:04.400> do<00:04:04.520> it

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
I use ready-made mix you can do it

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.270 
I use ready-made mix you can do it
yourself<00:04:05.030> but<00:04:05.440> since<00:04:06.440> this<00:04:06.590> was<00:04:06.800> a<00:04:06.830> very<00:04:06.980> small

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
yourself but since this was a very small

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.190 
yourself but since this was a very small
job<00:04:07.550> and<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.180> didn't<00:04:08.480> know<00:04:08.540> exactly<00:04:08.870> how<00:04:08.990> to<00:04:09.020> do

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
job and I didn't know exactly how to do

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.560 
job and I didn't know exactly how to do
it<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.380> just<00:04:09.410> bought<00:04:09.680> Ready<00:04:10.670> Mix

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
it I just bought Ready Mix

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.980 
it I just bought Ready Mix
I<00:04:11.720> found<00:04:12.380> out<00:04:12.590> afterwards<00:04:13.540> then<00:04:14.540> they<00:04:14.720> sell

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
I found out afterwards then they sell

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.500 
I found out afterwards then they sell
different<00:04:15.140> colors<00:04:15.800> I<00:04:16.070> thought<00:04:16.340> it<00:04:17.180> was<00:04:17.359> only

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
different colors I thought it was only

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.860 
different colors I thought it was only
why<00:04:17.810> he<00:04:17.870> came<00:04:18.140> only<00:04:18.290> white<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.830> put<00:04:19.580> white<00:04:19.880> but

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
why he came only white I put white but

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.469 
why he came only white I put white but
they<00:04:21.620> make<00:04:21.799> many<00:04:22.070> different<00:04:22.190> halls<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.970> now<00:04:23.450> I

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
they make many different halls and now I

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.590 
they make many different halls and now I
wish<00:04:23.930> I'd<00:04:24.110> put<00:04:24.320> some

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
wish I'd put some

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600 
wish I'd put some
a<00:04:24.630> bit<00:04:24.990> more<00:04:25.140> targeted<00:04:25.680> now<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.280> too<00:04:26.370> late

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
a bit more targeted now it's too late

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.540 
a bit more targeted now it's too late
but<00:04:27.090> anyway<00:04:27.360> so<00:04:27.570> what<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.650> have<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.830> do<00:04:29.070> is<00:04:29.310> to

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
but anyway so what you have to do is to

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.770 
but anyway so what you have to do is to
squeeze<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.740> mix<00:04:32.070> in<00:04:33.030> between<00:04:33.090> tiles

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
squeeze the the mix in between tiles

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.350 
squeeze the the mix in between tiles
like<00:04:34.200> you're<00:04:35.100> trying<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.550> squeeze<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:36.030> trip

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
like you're trying to squeeze you trip

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.330 
like you're trying to squeeze you trip
to<00:04:36.540> squeeze<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.960> in<00:04:37.080> between<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.500> then<00:04:38.160> of

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
to squeeze it in between and then of

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.650 
to squeeze it in between and then of
course<00:04:38.450> you<00:04:39.450> wouldn't<00:04:39.960> make<00:04:40.140> a<00:04:40.170> mess<00:04:40.560> all<00:04:41.220> over

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
course you wouldn't make a mess all over

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.210 
course you wouldn't make a mess all over
now<00:04:42.660> this<00:04:43.080> mess<00:04:43.380> needs<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.770> be<00:04:43.860> removed

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
now this mess needs to be removed

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.120 
now this mess needs to be removed
immediately<00:04:44.460> because<00:04:45.150> this<00:04:45.800> compound<00:04:46.800> this

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
immediately because this compound this

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.490 
immediately because this compound this
makes<00:04:47.820> if<00:04:48.720> it<00:04:48.930> becomes<00:04:49.320> dry<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:50.040> stains<00:04:51.500> the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
makes if it becomes dry it stains the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.960 
makes if it becomes dry it stains the
times<00:04:52.770> then<00:04:53.010> is<00:04:53.130> going<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.340> be<00:04:53.430> very<00:04:53.760> difficult

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
times then is going to be very difficult

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.230 
times then is going to be very difficult
ok<00:04:54.390> so<00:04:55.050> what<00:04:55.230> you<00:04:55.320> have<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.530> do<00:04:55.650> once<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:56.670> lay

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
ok so what you have to do once you lay

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.050 
ok so what you have to do once you lay
down<00:04:57.270> you<00:04:57.600> do<00:04:57.750> like<00:04:57.960> four<00:04:58.560> or<00:04:58.620> five<00:04:58.650> tiles<00:04:59.070> it

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
down you do like four or five tiles it

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.360 
down you do like four or five tiles it
dies<00:05:00.390> depending<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.080> then<00:05:01.410> you<00:05:01.530> clean<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.280> you

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
dies depending and then you clean so you

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.920 
dies depending and then you clean so you
need<00:05:02.670> to<00:05:02.790> take<00:05:02.970> this<00:05:03.210> sponge

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
need to take this sponge

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.960 
need to take this sponge
you<00:05:04.260> put<00:05:04.470> a<00:05:04.500> sponge<00:05:04.980> in<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.340> bucket<00:05:05.730> full<00:05:05.880> of

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
you put a sponge in a bucket full of

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.880 
you put a sponge in a bucket full of
water<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:07.700> then<00:05:08.700> you<00:05:09.060> remove<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.170> excess<00:05:10.680> of

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
water and then you remove the excess of

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.110 
water and then you remove the excess of
water<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:11.490> then<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.090> have<00:05:12.180> to<00:05:12.270> do<00:05:12.390> one<00:05:12.720> pass

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
water and then you have to do one pass

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.410 
water and then you have to do one pass
turn<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.810> sponge<00:05:16.170> and<00:05:16.530> another<00:05:17.430> pass<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:18.090> try

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
turn the sponge and another pass and try

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.340 
turn the sponge and another pass and try
to<00:05:18.480> clean<00:05:18.810> up<00:05:18.980> the<00:05:19.980> excess<00:05:20.040> of<00:05:20.490> ground<00:05:21.080> now<00:05:22.080> if

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
to clean up the excess of ground now if

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.900 
to clean up the excess of ground now if
you<00:05:22.440> have<00:05:22.530> somebody<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:22.920> is<00:05:23.250> helping<00:05:23.790> you

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
you have somebody that is helping you

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.270 
you have somebody that is helping you
they<00:05:24.090> can<00:05:24.300> hand<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:25.320> other<00:05:25.470> sponge<00:05:25.890> so

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
they can hand you the other sponge so

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.670 
they can hand you the other sponge so
you<00:05:26.340> never<00:05:26.610> stop<00:05:26.910> because<00:05:27.180> I<00:05:27.270> went<00:05:27.480> to<00:05:27.510> need<00:05:27.690> to

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
you never stop because I went to need to

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.530 
you never stop because I went to need to
do<00:05:28.920> it<00:05:29.010> pass<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.520> clean<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.060> sponge<00:05:30.330> the

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
do it pass and clean the sponge the

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.630 
do it pass and clean the sponge the
basket<00:05:31.050> by<00:05:31.200> yourself<00:05:31.530> already<00:05:31.710> takes<00:05:32.460> a<00:05:32.520> lot

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
basket by yourself already takes a lot

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.610 
basket by yourself already takes a lot
of<00:05:32.670> time<00:05:32.970> to<00:05:33.570> people<00:05:33.750> are<00:05:33.960> perfect<00:05:34.380> for<00:05:34.470> this

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
of time to people are perfect for this

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.880 
of time to people are perfect for this
job

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
job

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.740 
job
so<00:05:35.160> one<00:05:35.370> that's<00:05:35.760> why<00:05:35.910> I<00:05:35.940> said<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.330> sponges

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
so one that's why I said to sponges

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.780 
so one that's why I said to sponges
while<00:05:37.020> you're<00:05:37.170> using<00:05:37.320> one<00:05:37.620> sponge<00:05:37.950> your

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
while you're using one sponge your

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.620 
while you're using one sponge your
helper<00:05:39.270> is<00:05:39.600> cleaning<00:05:40.010> the<00:05:41.010> other<00:05:41.160> spoon<00:05:41.630> so

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
helper is cleaning the other spoon so

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.460 
helper is cleaning the other spoon so
the<00:05:42.810> trick<00:05:43.080> is<00:05:43.290> to<00:05:43.500> use<00:05:44.370> a<00:05:44.850> clean<00:05:45.600> side<00:05:45.930> of<00:05:46.170> the

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
the trick is to use a clean side of the

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.030 
the trick is to use a clean side of the
sponge<00:05:46.740> only<00:05:47.220> once<00:05:47.460> so<00:05:48.150> you<00:05:48.180> pass<00:05:48.780> once<00:05:49.260> and

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
sponge only once so you pass once and

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.710 
sponge only once so you pass once and
you<00:05:50.160> turn<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.550> pass<00:05:50.730> away<00:05:50.880> and<00:05:50.970> this<00:05:51.090> is<00:05:51.270> really

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
you turn it pass away and this is really

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.900 
you turn it pass away and this is really
really<00:05:51.990> important<00:05:52.500> also<00:05:53.070> another<00:05:53.670> thing<00:05:53.850> that

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
really important also another thing that

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.200 
really important also another thing that
I<00:05:54.240> notice<00:05:54.920> make<00:05:55.920> sure<00:05:56.250> that<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.640> grout<00:05:56.910> in

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
I notice make sure that the grout in

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.390 
I notice make sure that the grout in
between<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.630> tiles<00:05:57.840> are<00:05:58.140> totally<00:05:58.920> smooth

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
between the tiles are totally smooth

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.030 
between the tiles are totally smooth
because<00:06:00.030> once<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.540> grout<00:06:00.780> compound<00:06:01.620> becomes

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
because once the grout compound becomes

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.610 
because once the grout compound becomes
dry<00:06:03.590> you<00:06:04.590> gotta<00:06:05.310> have<00:06:05.580> a<00:06:05.850> very<00:06:06.330> rough<00:06:06.930> surface

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
dry you gotta have a very rough surface

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.050 
dry you gotta have a very rough surface
and<00:06:07.890> you<00:06:07.980> don't<00:06:08.160> want<00:06:08.340> that<00:06:08.460> you<00:06:08.520> want<00:06:08.760> to<00:06:08.910> be

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
and you don't want that you want to be

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.910 
and you don't want that you want to be
very<00:06:09.420> smooth<00:06:09.840> if<00:06:09.990> you<00:06:10.080> see<00:06:10.260> something<00:06:10.650> that<00:06:10.680> is

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
very smooth if you see something that is

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.070 
very smooth if you see something that is
like<00:06:11.160> a<00:06:11.430> dent<00:06:12.270> or<00:06:12.510> something

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
like a dent or something

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.070 
like a dent or something
remove<00:06:13.560> it<00:06:13.590> immediately<00:06:14.300> because<00:06:15.300> as<00:06:15.570> you<00:06:15.840> see

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
remove it immediately because as you see

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.790 
remove it immediately because as you see
that's<00:06:16.350> how<00:06:16.530> it<00:06:16.650> will<00:06:16.830> be<00:06:17.660> after<00:06:18.660> you're<00:06:19.620> done

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
that's how it will be after you're done

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.070 
that's how it will be after you're done
with<00:06:19.980> grouting<00:06:20.460> in<00:06:20.880> my<00:06:21.120> case<00:06:21.390> I<00:06:21.600> put<00:06:21.810> a<00:06:21.870> little

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
with grouting in my case I put a little

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.790 
with grouting in my case I put a little
bit<00:06:22.230> of<00:06:22.410> threshold<00:06:22.890> with<00:06:23.370> the<00:06:23.460> existing

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
bit of threshold with the existing

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.320 
bit of threshold with the existing
laminate<00:06:25.800> floor<00:06:26.040> and<00:06:26.450> with<00:06:27.450> a<00:06:27.480> small<00:06:29.330> toilet

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
laminate floor and with a small toilet

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.350 
laminate floor and with a small toilet
and<00:06:30.770> the<00:06:31.770> job<00:06:31.980> is<00:06:32.010> done<00:06:32.280> all<00:06:32.490> this<00:06:32.850> cost<00:06:33.210> me
