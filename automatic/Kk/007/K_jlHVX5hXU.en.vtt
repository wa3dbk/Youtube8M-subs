so<00:00:05.279> we<00:00:05.609> know<00:00:05.730> Springfree<00:00:06.270> trampoline<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.930> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
so we know Springfree trampoline is the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.110 
so we know Springfree trampoline is the
safest<00:00:07.140> trampoline<00:00:07.710> in<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.069> world<00:00:08.309> and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
safest trampoline in the world and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.430 
safest trampoline in the world and
you're<00:00:09.269> probably<00:00:09.389> wondering<00:00:09.570> why<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.019> costs

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
you're probably wondering why it costs

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.520 
you're probably wondering why it costs
more<00:00:10.639> customers<00:00:11.639> have<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.969> decide<00:00:12.380> how<00:00:13.380> much

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
more customers have to decide how much

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.129 
more customers have to decide how much
safety<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.250> quality<00:00:14.670> they<00:00:14.880> can<00:00:15.059> afford<00:00:15.360> when

safety and quality they can afford when

safety and quality they can afford when
we<00:00:16.379> designed<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.520> Springfree<00:00:18.060> trampoline<00:00:18.539> it

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
we designed the Springfree trampoline it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.310 
we designed the Springfree trampoline it
took<00:00:18.990> us<00:00:19.140> 15<00:00:20.130> years<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.640> get<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.850> right<00:00:21.320> Jorge

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
took us 15 years to get it right Jorge

Nissen<00:00:22.800> built<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.310> first<00:00:23.519> trampoline<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:24.300> the

Nissen built the first trampoline in the
1930s<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.740> since<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.730> there's<00:00:27.510> really<00:00:27.779> been

1930s and since then there's really been

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.589 
1930s and since then there's really been
no<00:00:28.050> change<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.890> basic<00:00:29.070> configuration

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
this is the first time really that

this is the first time really that
someone<00:00:32.279> has<00:00:32.520> redesigned<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.809> from<00:00:33.960> the

someone has redesigned it from the

someone has redesigned it from the
ground<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.770> looked<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.430> way<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.880> getting

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
ground up and looked at a way of getting

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.080 
ground up and looked at a way of getting
rid<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> some<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> main<00:00:37.950> impact<00:00:38.579> points

in<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.109> case<00:01:01.379> we've<00:01:02.250> had<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
in this case we've had to have the

in this case we've had to have the
special<00:01:03.120> recipe<00:01:03.480> developed<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.379> they

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
special recipe developed so that they

special recipe developed so that they
will<00:01:04.799> last<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.309> distance<00:01:05.600> all<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.750> these

will last the distance all of these

will last the distance all of these
things<00:01:07.200> contribute<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:08.150> something<00:01:09.150> that's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
things contribute to something that's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.929 
things contribute to something that's
inevitably<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.990> more<00:01:10.260> expensive<00:01:10.560> product<00:01:11.040> but

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
inevitably a more expensive product but

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.880 
inevitably a more expensive product but
the<00:01:12.119> reason<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.590> can

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the reason for that is so that we can

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.469 
the reason for that is so that we can
take<00:01:14.159> away<00:01:14.400> some<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> danger<00:01:15.330> of

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
take away some of the danger of

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.810 
take away some of the danger of
conventional<00:01:16.229> trampolines<00:01:16.740> there's<00:01:17.580> many

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
conventional trampolines there's many

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.640 
conventional trampolines there's many
reasons<00:01:18.119> why<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> traditional<00:01:19.140> trampoline

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
reasons why a traditional trampoline

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.270 
reasons why a traditional trampoline
could<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.340> cheaper<00:01:20.630> but<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.810> most<00:01:22.290> cases<00:01:22.560> it's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
could be cheaper but in most cases it's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.310 
could be cheaper but in most cases it's
because<00:01:23.490> they've<00:01:24.090> cut<00:01:24.479> corners<00:01:25.020> somewhere

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
because they've cut corners somewhere

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.530 
because they've cut corners somewhere
any<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.130> them<00:01:26.250> fall<00:01:26.549> apart<00:01:26.670> relatively

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
any of them fall apart relatively

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.920 
any of them fall apart relatively
quickly

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
quickly

the ultraviolet inhibitor is often left

the ultraviolet inhibitor is often left
out<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> materials<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.189> conventional

out of the materials and conventional
trampolines<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.540> means<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.930> they<00:01:34.079> don't

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
trampolines and it means that they don't

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
trampolines and it means that they don't
last<00:01:34.500> very<00:01:34.650> long<00:01:34.979> some<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.000> research<00:01:36.390> that

shows<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.990> padding<00:01:40.920> material<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
shows that the padding material that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.730 
shows that the padding material that
they<00:01:41.610> use<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:42.240> protect<00:01:43.200> children<00:01:43.710> from

falling onto the frames or the springs

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.880 
falling onto the frames or the springs
deteriorates<00:01:46.860> quite<00:01:47.549> quickly<00:01:47.939> so

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
deteriorates quite quickly so

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.870 
deteriorates quite quickly so
traditional<00:01:49.890> trampolines<00:01:50.340> would<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.670> to

traditional trampolines would have to

traditional trampolines would have to
