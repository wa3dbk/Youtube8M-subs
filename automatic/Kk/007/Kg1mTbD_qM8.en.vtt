00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.450
 let's start with the second part of 

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:10.000
 this tutorial of the sketch this guy 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.660
 gladiator and good to me has left me 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.930
 this way I have ready the hat and 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.100
 to the extent that I want it already reaches the 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.289
 part in the middle of the forehead then 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.710
 Now what we are going to do is that since 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:31.160
 you finished can they go to 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.300
 make a chain and finish here 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.250
 they cut their stamen 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:42.399
 and strip now we adjust well now they 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.980
 I explain to be able to do the following 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:49.430
 part we have to mark 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.700
 the length and follows the width of the forehead 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.340
 What are we going to knit here? 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.790
 over here we will no longer weave this part 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.540
 then we are going to mark it in this way 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.400
 with 2 security support with bits 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.720
 of yarn that you have out there 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.660
 well then here where they finished off 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.250
 what we have to do is that we're going to 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.250
 line up well in half 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.500
 here and this is our half and it is the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.020
 half of the forehead of the part of 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.310
 opposite then what are we going to do 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.670
 now we're going to put 22 points or 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:36.200
 20 points according to the size of your 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:40.450
 cap ok then I in my case that is 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.909
 like a size like 4 to 5 years 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.460
 this hat then I'm going to put 22 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.789
 points that I will leave free for the 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.470
 part of the front then marked this 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:57.909
 shore and this one and that here are 22 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.980
 and after that we're going to start 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:05.650
 to knit 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:09.369
 at this end here on the east side 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:13.000
 let's go here ok 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.200
 towards the left side and I'm going to withdraw 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.200
 my mark 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:27.920
 and well I always do my 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:31.710
 my house is here in this way 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.830
 then now the step 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.680
 and I make half a point a chain and here 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.630
 same I will make a half point and this 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.520
 it is very just very tight I do not know no 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.240
 we have the fear that we are out there 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.520
 go the fraying then out there 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.360
 I will also answer my 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.360
 stamen 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.660
 Now what we 're going to do is we 're going 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:04.350
 to knit in half a point until this part 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.390
 from here to the other marker like this 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.150
 you have to go weaving half 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.780
 point for all 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.950
 these turns 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:20.209
 that I more or less calculate that they are 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:27.260
 more or less this this long that are 1 2 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:29.870
 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 as 12 laps 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.840
 more or less long than us 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.050
 we must knit 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.470
 this round trip here we come to the 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.440
 first to the second marker and we return 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.600
 and so we have to be doing 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.260
 our 12 laps 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:53.100
 I'm already finishing making my first 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:57.450
 back and I already found my bookmark 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.510
 the second marker I withdraw it and now 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.110
 I make my last half point and how am I going to 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:09.590
 come up with the other turn I'm going to make a 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:15.250
 twist me string and start 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:20.880
 again right here in half a point 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:24.510
 and I knit half a point again 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.740
 half a point and that's how you are going to 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:32.190
 keep knitting all all your 12 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.320
 about ok and we are already 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.770
 we see when you are and I am 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.770
 have 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:44.990
 Well look here I've already woven 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:49.640
 this 10 laps and it is not yet the long 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:53.600
 what I want is still missing about 3 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:57.440
 or 4 more laps then when you 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.450
 have more or less this long or earlier if 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:07.100
 they want it they will make an increase in 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:10.850
 each end of our fabric we are going to 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.890
 make a chain we turn and you know that 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.520
 right here it becomes our 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:19.640
 point our half point and now we're going 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.240
 to do the increase here as we are going to 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.030
 do let's weave two half points in 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.810
 a single 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.810
 point 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:37.009
 and I keep knitting normal until I 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.009
 get to the other side 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.860
 I arrived on the other side then we go 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.310
 here and nothing else I have two points this 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.729
 is the last and the last but now here 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.020
 I'm going to knit 2 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:56.680
 half points together 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.410
 and after sherry he solito normal that 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:03.190
 it's the last one and then again it was 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.289
 with a chain and I make my points 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.680
 normal 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:10.370
 if this is going to give you an effect of this 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.400
 shape 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:17.419
 then so you are going to continue 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.889
 weaving and if you want them to have 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.659
 plus 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.659
 be more marked 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.340
 the increase that we did here or that 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:31.490
 they want it to look more to the right 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.590
 Well, they leave two more laps and what 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.639
 they do nothing again they do 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:43.009
 another increase only on the banks ok and already 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:45.090
 you finish knitting your hat 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:49.230
 this form 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:52.000
 and then it is ready for this mine 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:55.000
 I'm almost finished 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.460
 aha then be right now in the next 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.940
 tutorial I'm going to show you how we're going to 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.630
 do the crest and how are we going to do the 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.630
 cover
