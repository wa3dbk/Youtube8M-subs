00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.620
 Any sock that I knit, I like to finish 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.620
 like this. 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:33.280
 I knit two loops together at the beginning of the knitting needles, then knit 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:51.309
 just facial. 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.289
 Naturally - the same on each spoke 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.949
 number of loops. 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.440
 I do the same with the loops on the second spoke. 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:19.550
 I knit two loops together and then knit just facial 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:31.200
 to the end of this knitting needle. 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.430
 Regardless how this sock pattern is connected. 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.670
 Also knit loops on the third and fourth needles. 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:56.850
 Second row of loops off: first loop - front, 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:24.790
 but 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.270
 The next two loops are knit together. 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.590
 Also knit loops on the following three needles. 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:44.560
 Next, I knit a third row of loop hinges: two faces, and a third 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:55.280
 and the fourth knit together, further to the end knitting needles 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:07.010
 facial. Also knit loops on the following three needles. 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:17.180
 The next fourth row: knit three facial, and the fourth 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:29.560
 and the fifth knit together, then just facial. 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.900
 Knit until the end of the row. 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:47.209
 Fifth row: I knit four facial, and the fifth and sixth 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.790
 I knit loops together, further loops are facial. 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.849
 Knit to the end of the row. 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:09.250
 The sixth row: I knit the first five loops face, and 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:29.210
 I knit the sixth and seventh loops together, then the front ones. 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.409
 Also knit loops on the following three needles. 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:40.509
 Knit the following row: six facial, seventh and eighth 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:46.819
 knit loop together. 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.300
 Also knit loops on the following three needles. 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:58.720
 Then we decrease again, first the needles: first 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:07.020
 two loops together, to the end of the loops on the spoke - facial. 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.220
 Also knit loops on the following three needles. 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.460
 So, I think you understand the principle: the next row 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.169
 will - one knit, two together. 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.479
 In the next row - two faces, two together. 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:29.949
 And it all comes down to the fact that in the end the needles will remain 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:35.180
 six or four, you can eight loops, which 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.889
 need to then pull the thread. 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:48.559
 Another reduction of the loop can be done by tying two 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:54.009
 loops together on each spoke always at the beginning. 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.939
 On the sock there will be four braids, which in the end 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:04.979
 end up at the end of the sock.
