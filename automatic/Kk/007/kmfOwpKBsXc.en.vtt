movement was a necessary movement now I
think<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.740> process<00:02:03.280> we<00:02:04.110> refrained<00:02:05.110> from

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
think in the process we refrained from

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.669 
think in the process we refrained from
giving<00:02:05.920> female<00:02:06.700> characteristics<00:02:07.380> value<00:02:08.380> and

giving female characteristics value and

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.620 
giving female characteristics value and
