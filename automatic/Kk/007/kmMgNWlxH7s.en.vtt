00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.139
 hi all guys today i'm here with 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.450
 a new video to tell you about a new one 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.450
 arms the weapon in question 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:30.119
 let's check that it is unloaded and lapi 1 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:32.070
 lapi 1 heir of the mythical p38 speaking 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.059
 a bit of the history of p1 we can't 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.780
 don't mention p38 because everything from there 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.989
 It began 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.920
 then the p38 was produced well 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.390
 let's say created in 38 but come 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.809
 adopted by Nazi Germany 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.520
 only from the 40 the bodies they adopted 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.789
 now I only mention one for example from 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.969
 berna and dott.sa for the entire duration 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.129
 Of the war 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.149
 after the war 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.500
 furthermore they were made also 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.720
 ordered by the social republic 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.600
 Italian in which the painted models was 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.790
 always reduced p 38 models with 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.840
 not even the level changes are light 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.150
 practical only in the name that was one 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.030
 more civil version here but not not 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.930
 there were these big changes 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.520
 after the second world war the p38 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.909
 came apart used is produced 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.729
 also by the French but changed the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.240
 cheeks those of the original p38 e 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.759
 real wood and instead of p1 came 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.640
 replaced with alloy grips 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.130
 dark aluminum 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.229
 in addition to france return also to 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.909
 Germans both the army and the bundeswehr 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.829
 that albums insurance policy and that is to the police 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.110
 in fact this on the cart 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.130
 ap la b and w so it was a gun 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.960
 military and goals achieved the sights do not know 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.649
 if I can see them anyway 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.520
 aims for which they also allowed shooting 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.450
 in poor condition 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:15.680
 of light after this premise we see a 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:21.330
 just as p1 does not change from p 38 is 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.700
 identical they are very similar only for 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.799
 some details then first of all 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.200
 let's see p1 and p38 had 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.580
 however a dog exposed in the second 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.030
 world war came explicitly 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.780
 requested by military departments to have 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.549
 a gun with the exposed dog indeed 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:47.310
 the safe dog is located 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.579
 on the right side of the cart in 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.049
 This at the moment is insecure and 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.400
 so she's ready to shoot obviously 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:59.760
 the weapon was checked before 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.430
 video is equipped with the bat icahn and that is 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.989
 so if we put the blow in the barrel 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.579
 we believe that more simply on the dog 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.579
 putting it insecure 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.440
 the dog will be beaten safely without 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.440
 that could blow a blow 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.560
 what can we also say that when 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.090
 the weapon will be loaded now I can't do it 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.750
 see why I don't have a bullet in 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:32.310
 reed slightly here slightly above 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.530
 the dog will come out an indicator that 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.519
 will show you that the weapon is armed and has the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.190
 shot in the barrel 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.090
 that is, it is not only loaded ie it is not 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.069
 was only cannes and oscar owners 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.790
 reported the cart but will tell you 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.530
 just who will be will be present a 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.290
 bullet inside the chamber 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:59.160
 burst for disassembly then it 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:02.790
 disassembly is very simple before 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.680
 all you need to put the weapon insecure in 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.910
 this way 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:13.130
 pull the carriage back and lock it 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:16.199
 with gross for once this done 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.450
 this must be pushed forward 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.799
 lever 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:25.530
 this must be pushed forward 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.550
 lever once this is done 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:35.440
 simultaneously pull back the 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:38.860
 trolley and press the trigger e 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:44.260
 we have the two main parts the body 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.630
 of the weapon our cart and for 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.970
 remove the barrel we have to press e 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.220
 keep the part raised 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.640
 central in this way 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:58.830
 we have short and lift the part 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:02.200
 central that will thus release the barrel 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.050
 we have also completely dismantled the 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:10.450
 trolley barrel to reassemble 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:12.550
 the weapon we only pass the 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.620
 new inside the barrel holding the 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.710
 central part is always raised and one 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.610
 once inside, we can lower it 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:24.070
 locking the barrel inside the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:28.240
 trolley then we take back the stem 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:31.090
 of the weapon and reassemble the trolley here 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.280
 may be there may be 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.990
 of the raised parts of the mechanics but 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.410
 just be careful lowering them to the 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.169
 Carriage passage is back in 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.620
 cart style to reassemble it must 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:48.160
 push it to the bottom and make it snap 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:52.210
 it is to hold it where it is open and close again 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:57.220
 the lever and let go to see 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.710
 if indeed accompanying the weapon if there 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:04.390
 maneuver was performed correctly 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:06.720
 It takes away the safe and for Scarella 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.720
 find 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.050
 obviously something important is the caliber 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.200
 as written here by us was ri 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:20.400
 Banked 9 for 21 but originally it was 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.960
 the 9 mm obviously was remarked not 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.500
 for 21 for the reasons that all of us 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.290
 we also know this gun in 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.020
 especially the pizza is not this p38 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.700
 a small one there was was one historic 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.780
 gun that replaced the luger 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:39.750
 tombstone 08 and taken service precisely from 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.240
 since 40 years a last curiosity the 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.620
 gun and both in single action and in 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.160
 double action 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.160
 an example
