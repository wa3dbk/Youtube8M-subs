00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
good actors that sometimes you need to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.440 
good actors that sometimes you need to
have

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450

have
and<00:02:14.540> your<00:02:15.020> life<00:02:15.170> needs<00:02:15.319> to<00:02:15.470> be<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.650> little

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and your life needs to be a little

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.030 
and your life needs to be a little
 up<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.400> get<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.760> get<00:02:16.910> tap<00:02:17.390> into<00:02:17.720> those

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
 up to get to get tap into those

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.970 
 up to get to get tap into those
kind<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.099> feelings<00:02:20.080> that's<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.200> good<00:02:21.410> question

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
kind of feelings that's a good question

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.170 
kind of feelings that's a good question
um<00:02:23.260> yeah<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.470> mean<00:02:24.680> maybe<00:02:24.920> maybe<00:02:25.580> well<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:25.970> think

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
um yeah I mean maybe maybe well I think

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.330 
um yeah I mean maybe maybe well I think
what<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.540> takes<00:02:26.750> is<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:27.110> takes<00:02:27.319> experience<00:02:27.680> and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
what it takes is it takes experience and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.940 
what it takes is it takes experience and
it<00:02:28.520> takes<00:02:28.760> observation<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.290> pretty<00:02:30.680> good

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
it takes observation to be a pretty good

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.320 
it takes observation to be a pretty good
actor<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.580> living<00:02:32.209> your<00:02:32.360> life<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.900> not<00:02:34.330> you

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
actor and living your life and not you

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.880 
actor and living your life and not you
know<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.510> have<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.840> study<00:02:36.050> people<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.680> have

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
know you have to study people you have

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.199 
know you have to study people you have
to<00:02:37.069> but<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.550> doesn't<00:02:37.819> mean<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.030> have<00:02:38.060> to

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
to but that doesn't mean you have to

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.670 
to but that doesn't mean you have to
come<00:02:38.510> from<00:02:38.750> necessarily<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.560> really<00:02:39.890> kind<00:02:40.100> of

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
come from necessarily a really kind of

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.870 
come from necessarily a really kind of
volatile<00:02:42.680> background<00:02:43.250> or<00:02:43.489> that<00:02:43.610> kind<00:02:43.760> of

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
volatile background or that kind of

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.290 
volatile background or that kind of
thing

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
thing

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.360 
thing
it<00:02:44.690> doesn't<00:02:45.140> hurt<00:02:45.349> to<00:02:45.650> come<00:02:45.980> from<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.310> I

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
it doesn't hurt to come from that I

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.850 
it doesn't hurt to come from that I
think<00:02:46.489> if<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:46.880> want<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.090> be<00:02:47.209> an<00:02:47.810> actor<00:02:48.170> but

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
think if you want to be an actor but

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.340 
think if you want to be an actor but
it's<00:02:49.100> not<00:02:49.220> necessary<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:50.150> think<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.780> think

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
it's not necessary I think I think

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.930 
it's not necessary I think I think
what's<00:02:51.500> necessary<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.160> paying<00:02:52.430> attention<00:02:52.580> to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
what's necessary is paying attention to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.699 
what's necessary is paying attention to
your<00:02:53.390> own<00:02:53.420> emotions<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.230> other<00:02:54.319> people's

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
your own emotions and other people's

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.220 
your own emotions and other people's
emotions<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.489> just<00:02:55.790> being<00:02:56.480> observant<00:02:56.900> and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
emotions and just being observant and

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.460 
emotions and just being observant and
see<00:02:57.650> how<00:02:57.769> people<00:02:58.870> interact<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.230> me<00:03:00.380> is

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
see how people interact that to me is

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.979 
see how people interact that to me is
you<00:03:01.010> can<00:03:01.160> self<00:03:01.430> teach<00:03:01.670> yourself<00:03:02.600> how<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.720> be<00:03:02.900> an

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
you can self teach yourself how to be an

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:10.300 
you can self teach yourself how to be an
actor<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.319> think<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:04.209> mean<00:03:05.209> I<00:03:05.330> I<00:03:06.640> tried<00:03:09.010> but<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.069> lot

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
actor I think I mean I I tried but a lot

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.309 
actor I think I mean I I tried but a lot
of<00:03:10.340> comedians<00:03:10.910> I<00:03:11.030> feel<00:03:11.209> use<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:12.140> like

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
of comedians I feel use that to like

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.900 
of comedians I feel use that to like
escape<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.920> little<00:03:13.130> bit<00:03:13.220> from<00:03:13.430> their<00:03:13.549> own<00:03:13.670> lives

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
escape a little bit from their own lives

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.509 
escape a little bit from their own lives
what<00:03:14.269> do<00:03:14.330> you<00:03:14.420> mean<00:03:14.540> yes<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.380> feel<00:03:15.739> like<00:03:15.860> that<00:03:15.980> so

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
what do you mean yes I feel like that so

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.400 
what do you mean yes I feel like that so
many<00:03:16.700> comedians<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.420> are<00:03:17.569> kind<00:03:17.989> of<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.200> little

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
many comedians that are kind of a little

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.319 
many comedians that are kind of a little
sad<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.950> then<00:03:19.070> they<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:19.760> don't<00:03:19.940> know<00:03:20.060> about

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
sad and then they you don't know about

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.340 
sad and then they you don't know about
it<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.540> think<00:03:20.690> they're<00:03:20.840> always<00:03:21.019> happy

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
it you think they're always happy

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.810 
it you think they're always happy
because<00:03:21.739> yeah<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:21.980> think<00:03:22.130> that's<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.549> stereotype

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
because yeah I think that's a stereotype

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.520 
because yeah I think that's a stereotype
you're<00:03:23.390> right<00:03:23.570> but<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.840> mean<00:03:23.870> there's<00:03:24.109> reasons

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
you're right but I mean there's reasons

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.080 
you're right but I mean there's reasons
for<00:03:24.560> stereotypes<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.400> mean<00:03:25.519> that<00:03:25.640> most

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
for stereotypes that mean that most

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.210 
for stereotypes that mean that most
comics<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.870> I<00:03:26.900> know<00:03:27.049> do<00:03:27.560> have<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.799> little<00:03:28.100> bit

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
comics that I know do have a little bit

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.400 
comics that I know do have a little bit
of<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.459> sadness<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.600> them<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:29.930> that's<00:03:30.019> not<00:03:30.170> the

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
of a sadness to them but that's not the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.960 
of a sadness to them but that's not the
