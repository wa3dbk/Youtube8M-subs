I<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.710> theory<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> whole<00:01:14.340> game

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
I have this theory that the whole game

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.160 
I have this theory that the whole game
is<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:14.909> an<00:01:15.060> origin<00:01:15.509> story<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:16.020> sir

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
is really an origin story for sir

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.990 
is really an origin story for sir
hammerlock<00:01:16.710> alright<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.759> two<00:01:17.880> different

hammerlock alright it's two different

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700 
hammerlock alright it's two different
companies<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.810> I'm<00:01:18.869> probably<00:01:19.020> wrong<00:01:19.290> but

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
companies and I'm probably wrong but

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.460 
companies and I'm probably wrong but
come<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:19.979> look<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> resemblance<00:01:21.320> also<00:01:22.320> did

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
come on look at the resemblance also did

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.719 
come on look at the resemblance also did
I<00:01:22.530> mention<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.920> game<00:01:23.130> allows<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> play

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
I mention this game allows you to play

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.429 
I mention this game allows you to play
as<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.909> giant<00:01:24.270> flying<00:01:24.479> Cthulhu<00:01:25.020> monster

as a giant flying Cthulhu monster

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.240 
as a giant flying Cthulhu monster
because<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.159> does<00:01:27.560> at<00:01:28.560> number<00:01:28.950> three<00:01:29.159> is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
because it does at number three is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.039 
because it does at number three is
