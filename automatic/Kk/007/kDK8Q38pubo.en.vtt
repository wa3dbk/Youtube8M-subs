00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.490
 hello everyone and welcome to retro 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.020
 good trainer today I'm going to talk about a 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.090
 application launched for nintendo 3ds 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.369
 related to pokemon and this is ni 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.349
 more or less than the pokédex 3d but as 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.939
 many of you know the pokédex 3d but it's a 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.369
 update of the pokédex that already 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.320
 we had for a long time in our 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.700
 try 3d it's just that we now have 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.579
 not only of the pokemon of the regions 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.950
 of series but of the data of the 648 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.480
 pokemon and all its possible ways the 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.880
 question is that we will find it again 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.440
 in this pokédex, apart from the addition 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.210
 of all pokémon have been included more 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.670
 stage backgrounds such as a 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.829
 kind of engine room an ocean a 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.329
 sky or the universe among others and 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.489
 a code has also been created 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.379
 augmented reality or saer code for 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.879
 each one of the pokemon and its forms by 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.829
 so thanks to the camera in train of 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.719
 3ds we can take pictures of all the 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.789
 pokémon in the real world from burgos 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.109
 only up to 90, but if they just leave you 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.819
 that case we can not do it because it 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.039
 unlock by code that will come out more 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:02.120
 forward these these passwords and good 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.800
 As I say we can take pictures of 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.180
 all the pokemon and save these 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.130
 images so that others can 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.960
 see them also has gone to the voice to the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.280
 3d vowels but what does it mean that 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 now we can hear the names of 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.470
 the pokemon on behalf of a person 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.000
 and curiously I think it's the same as 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.040
 puts the voice to poker is in the series 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.810
 there is also another added that I do not 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.180
 only the one that I like the most is the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.200
 of the challenges or challenges in English and is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.520
 neither more nor less than a lot of 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.220
 questions about the pokemon 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.300
 divided into 36 levels that we will go 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.370
 unblocking as we go forward 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.750
 answering questions 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.700
 these questions range from identifying a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 shortly before the already giotto singing young and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.110
 not until the screams are identified 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.460
 groups eggs the statistics or the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.530
 movements that could learn between 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.729
 other questions with which times to 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.390
 these batteries of questions have 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.250
 fun for a while 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.290
 I personally think that little weaning 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.820
 but it is an application as long as 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.990
 have the 3d models all 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.820
 pokémon with its respective tab 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.680
 statistical movements and skills and 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.030
 others with which at the time of doing 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.470
 equipment is fine although if 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.970
 we have internet is nothing more than a 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.369
 data collection of what we can 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.450
 find the only one here on the web 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.910
 negative point that this application has 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.290
 it's a little bit of price and that's what to pay 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.909
 15 euros for an application that does not 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.679
 includes no more mode is exaggerated 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.390
 many of the games of nintendo 3ds 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.830
 They are worth 40 euros so it's a price 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.870
 excessive because of the little content it adds 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.100
 the pokédex so I only recommend it 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.170
 for those who are looking forward to you 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.340
 you put to the test with the questions that 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.410
 want to enjoy the videos of all 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.580
 the pokémon good at the moment this is 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.470
 all about the little history of the blog 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.550
 as soon as he knows about the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.410
 international passwords for 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.940
 unlock unless you are in essex 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.200
 I assure you that I will make a video so that 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.970
 you can have already for the moment 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.400
 you only know the password for me 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.600
 is not in japan I would also like 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.580
 to be able to do a photo contest 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.959
 to be able to tell you but in the future 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.610
 very distant but good this already 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.380
 I will comment on another video that yes yes 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.880
 you want to participate in this contest and 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.920
 you can download the new pokédex 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.300
 I already have and the truth is that it is very 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.680
 well and the contests more where 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.330
 entertained so I recommend it 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.620
 enough to play 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.660
 others and also to participate in this 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.340
 photography contest that I will do in some 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.380
 next video and good as always 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.540
 native of second this video subscribe 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.990
