00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.990
Welcome Moodle is a learning management system that is used for the delivery of

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.190
online courses. This video will help you
know what to expect

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.650
and how to work your way around Moodle. First things first, logging in.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.300
You'll be able to access muddle through
your my.utep.edu account but

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.600
there's also a direct way by going to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.730
moodle.utepconnect.utep.edu

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.560
and using your UTEP username and password. Once you log-in you'll be taken to a

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.170
home page that has a few important

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.250
items for you to be aware of. The upper menu contains "My Courses"

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.010
which will this links to all the fully
online courses in which you are enrolled.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.120
"My Dashboard" gives you access to tools such as your profile,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.739
calendar, your messages (which is the
onsite email system),

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.920
and a private files area where you can
store documents,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.170
images, etc. As you scroll down the
Home Page you also see

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.379
a news area that will include any announcements you instructors posted.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.170
Further down, links your courses are also
available here,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.530
as well as, an area for upcoming events,
such as due dates

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.229
and a messages area. Once you enter a course you will see that on the left is your course

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.240
content and it might be organized by
week,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.950
my unit or by topic depending on the
preferences at the instructor.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.570
On the right are a series of blocks including navigation,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.479
and administration, as well as, some other blocks chosen by your instructor such as

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.340
latest news our recent activity.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.719
These blocks provide links to different
areas of the course

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.049
as well as, possibly announcements, due
dates, or other items your instructor wants you to

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:32.469
see.

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.710
Moodle gives you access to many tools
including assignments,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.890
forums a.k.a. discussion boards, tests,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.320
chat, and a grades area. Let's take a quick look at these.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.580
When you click a link to an assignment
you'll be taken to a page broken into

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.550
2 areas:

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.760
Assignment and Submission Status. The
assignment area will display the description or

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.380
instructions created by the instructor.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.729
Submission status area sure whether
you've submitted,

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.440
whether the instructor has begun or
completed grading, the due date

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.970
and the time remaining for you to submit on-time. To submit your assignment

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.030
you will click add submission. The subsequent page will provide you a page to

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.740
upload a file. Next let's take a look at forums

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.989
or discussion boards. Upon clicking a
link to a forum

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.400
you'll be taken to a page that contains
instructions for the discussion,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.930
as well as, a button that will allow you
to add a new discussion topic.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.230
If you're adding a new thread to a
discussion, you'll be able to use a basic

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.760
text editor and upload files if
necessary.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.860
You also have the option of choosing to
receive email notifications when some

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.200
response to your posts.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.900
The Moodle testing tools allow your
instructor to create a variety of

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.950
question types,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.850
choose time and sequence parameters,
randomized the questions and answers

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.230
choices, etc. When you click on a
test link you'll be taken to an initial

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.769
page

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.250
that will list parameters that you need to know about such as the number of attempts,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.470
the time limit, etc. You will then need to
click

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.720
"Attempt Quiz Now." Once you've actually begun the test will be provided a few

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.950
helpful blocks

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.360
that will display the question number, the
question point value,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.920
and the time remaining. Moodle also has a very basic chat tool.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.530
When you 1st enter a chat area you have a few options.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.280
Enter the chat room, use a more accessible interface

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.680
and view pass chat sessions. The 1st
option will

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.480
open a small simple chat window, think
instant messenger circa 2000.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.700
The 2nd option will show your chat
activity,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.120
as well as, the administration
and navigation menus. The final option will

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.600
provide you a log of all chat sessions
in which you

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.450
have participated. Finally let's talk about your grades area.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.390
the link is available on your
administration block under course

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.320
administration.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.680
The main grades area will display the
following information: in what unit,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.920
week or section this graded item is
located within the course.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.000
The name of the item, the grade you received, the grade range,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.750
the percentage achieved, and any general
feedback you're instructor provided.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.890
It may contain more or less data
depending on your instructors preferences.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.990
In the bottom right, under the table is a
course total,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.410
ie. your current grade in the course. Also note in the upper left to the page

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.940
above the table, is a drop down menu that will allow you to access your grades

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.190
from

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.900
all of your courses
