00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello to all guys welcome to this one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.420
 new video review tagged 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.179
 iphoneitalia.com in this video 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.269
 review we're going to take a look 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:14.240
 to the new uniposka touch line or 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.300
 a new line of the famous brand 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.449
 uniposka that launched into the in 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.580
 digital market and therefore of the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.410
 smartphones and tablets presenting one 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.420
 very interesting line of accessories 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.420
 for iphone and ipad 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:49.739
 then we first have a cover 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.570
 for very thin and little iphone 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.449
 cumbersome that also leaves a glimpse 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.420
 the apple behind in a plastic material 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.900
 however satin that very pleasant to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.009
 touch 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.240
 so we can how you are seeing 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.330
 protect our device without 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.180
 enlarge both its size and its size 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.149
 getting a good feeling to the touch 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.520
 cover is really very pretty if there 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.660
 hold in your hand even a few seconds there 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.030
 will seem to hold a 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.240
 completely new device 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.740
 we still have another accessory maybe 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.960
 one of the most interesting of the whole 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.330
 line that is this bracelet that does 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.410
 by usb lightning cable this 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.869
 lightning bracelet then one door 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.750
 to recharge an iphone or an ipad or a 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.780
 ipod touch and on the other side a door 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.700
 usb then for connection to a 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.250
 charger to a computer and so on 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.869
 therefore both for data transfer and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.910
 for energy transfer and current 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.830
 obviously the two sockets go one inside 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.899
 the other and close the bracelet 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.030
 we can obviously fall back e 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.640
 insert on our wrist to wear it 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.860
 always with us it will be comfortable we will have a 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.259
 bracelet is then if necessary the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.619
 we can use like a real e 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.900
 own travel charger 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.060
 in short, to be worn in a very long way 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.319
 always quiet with us for every 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.280
 in case you see it is like a classic 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.660
 bracelet that then opens and shows 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.540
 all its functions so we do it 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.670
 we can connect to our device 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.250
 is the other part to a computer to one 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.319
 battery etc. now I take for example 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.530
 my battery of 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.389
 power the external battery I make you 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.819
 see how charging works 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.150
 simply insert the cable to make 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.609
 see the boss works great and 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.180
 phone will start charging 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:54.569
 so there is nothing to do there is not 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.639
 I never have been a problem in my days of 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.230
 test with this case was never me 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.790
 said that maybe the cable is not 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.359
 recognized etc. so it is also 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.370
 we still have this certificate 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.650
 wall charger that provides 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.900
 two usb ports one for a tablet and one 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.799
 for an iphone so for a smartphone 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.090
 and so on and so with a surprise 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.010
 allows us to recharge more 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.510
 devices 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.949
 the material is always the same as the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.689
 then cover this material a lot 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.689
 so nice to the touch 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.560
 soft almost satin I would say 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.540
 and we still have a battery charger for 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.610
 car then that goes into the socket 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.490
 of the cigarette lighter that allows us to 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.440
 recharge our devices both with 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.810
 the cable supplied with the uniposka either 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.570
 with any other cable 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.080
 but let's get to the focal point of this 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.620
 line or the nib the uniposka 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.190
 touch 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.550
 this is a real tool 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.920
 drawing annotation for smartphones e 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.600
 tablet so both for the iphone and for 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.460
 other smartphones and tablets because the 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.170
 tip and rubber and fits 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.200
 to virtually any type of 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.580
 device we are trying now 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.320
 do not worry it has decreased the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.470
 brightness of the rest of the 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:15.600
 screen is just to let you see without 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.640
 distractions the nib in action on 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.560
 phone screen in this case 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.340
 we are using an application of 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.840
 any design in this case is 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.370
 but sketchbook you can use 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.650
 any application you can 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.940
 try it as you prefer with le 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.880
 applications you want 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.670
 the nib works perfectly on the 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.200
 display is not linked to 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.520
 a real application then 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.620
 if we wish we could also write a note 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.180
 a message and so on 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.750
 now I'll show you how the nib 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.450
 quite accurate even during the 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.720
 writing and drawing also allows us 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.830
 to perform checks without having to 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.280
 lay and use your fingers 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.500
 so very comfortable perfect I remind you 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.530
 that the product line 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.610
 that we are presenting to you is available 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.920
 in various colors 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.620
 we are testing the red color though 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.640
 there are so many for all 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.640
 tastes and needs 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.280
 now we also show you how 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.090
 works with the interface lines 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.870
 iPhone's 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.550
 so we can use it to write 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.900
 wanting then to let you see that 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.330
 works with any application 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.350
 works with in touch screen 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:35.169
 so it has no limits I remind you 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:39.450

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.900
 but I want to remember that the 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.270

 depth of the nib that 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.890
 obviously it is the spearhead of 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.900
