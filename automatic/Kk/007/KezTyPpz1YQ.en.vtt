right position so Brian you've got a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.780 
right position so Brian you've got a
couple<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.770> things<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
couple of things going on there the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.150 
couple of things going on there the
first<00:00:42.030> thing<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> fourth<00:00:42.690> position<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.040> is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
first thing the fourth position that is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.580 
first thing the fourth position that is
a<00:00:44.190> too<00:00:44.550> far<00:00:44.789> forward<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.239> too<00:00:45.420> far<00:00:45.450> back<00:00:45.690> is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
a too far forward or too far back is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.369 
a too far forward or too far back is
governed<00:00:47.160> by<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:47.670> thigh<00:00:48.059> length<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:49.050> what<00:00:49.230> we

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
governed by your thigh length so what we

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.420 
governed by your thigh length so what we
do<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.250> set<00:00:50.579> up<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:51.320> plumb<00:00:52.320> bob<00:00:52.350> off<00:00:52.800> that

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
do is we set up a plumb bob off that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.220 
do is we set up a plumb bob off that
knee<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.120> set<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.570> pedals<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
knee and we set up the pedals to the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.439 
knee and we set up the pedals to the
road<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.620> parallel<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> ground<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
road and parallel to the ground and the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.479 
road and parallel to the ground and the
plumb<00:00:57.660> bob<00:00:57.690> basically<00:00:58.230> drops<00:00:58.500> from<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
plumb bob basically drops from that

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.020 
plumb bob basically drops from that
patella<00:01:00.449> or<00:01:00.570> just<00:01:00.899> below<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.399> down<00:01:02.399> through

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
patella or just below it down through

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.359 
patella or just below it down through
your<00:01:03.510> foot<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.559> idea<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.070> that

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
your foot and the idea is that that

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.880 
your foot and the idea is that that
should<00:01:05.610> line<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:06.060> around<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:07.320> center<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.799> your

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
should line up around the center of your

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
should line up around the center of your
pedal<00:01:08.220> spindle<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> few

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
pedal spindle now there are a few

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.109 
pedal spindle now there are a few
variants<00:01:10.439> variations<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.610> some<00:01:11.880> people

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
variants variations on that some people

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.000 
variants variations on that some people
like<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.420> sit<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:13.140> bit<00:01:13.320> further<00:01:13.710> back

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
like to sit it a little bit further back

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.160 
like to sit it a little bit further back
off<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.939> centerline<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.659> some<00:01:15.810> people<00:01:16.049> like

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
off the centerline and some people like

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.080 
off the centerline and some people like
to<00:01:16.350> sit<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:16.979> bit<00:01:17.130> further<00:01:17.580> forward

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
to sit it a little bit further forward

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
to sit it a little bit further forward
of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> centerline<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.439> general<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.830> want

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
of the centerline but general you want

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.429 
of the centerline but general you want
that<00:01:20.189> plumb<00:01:20.549> line<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.360> drop<00:01:21.689> through<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
that plumb line to drop through the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.679 
that plumb line to drop through the
center<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.070> your<00:01:23.400> pedal<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.850> that'll<00:01:24.270> set<00:01:24.479> out

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
center of your pedal and that'll set out

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.999 
center of your pedal and that'll set out
the<00:01:25.290> four<00:01:25.650> ARF<00:01:25.950> position<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:26.909> seat<00:01:28.009> now

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the four ARF position of your seat now

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.190 
the four ARF position of your seat now
should<00:01:29.369> your<00:01:29.490> C<00:01:29.700> point<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.540> or<00:01:30.780> should<00:01:31.079> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
should your C point up or should it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.469 
should your C point up or should it
point<00:01:31.500> down<00:01:31.850> okay<00:01:32.850> well<00:01:33.060> my<00:01:33.270> recommendation

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
point down okay well my recommendation

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.580 
point down okay well my recommendation
is<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.470> seat<00:01:34.920> should<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.310> flat<00:01:35.850> okay<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.810> what

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
is the seat should be flat okay so what

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.249 
is the seat should be flat okay so what
we<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.189> set<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.840> spirit<00:01:39.840> level<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
we do is we set up a spirit level on the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.130 
we do is we set up a spirit level on the
seat<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.979> check<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.729> level<00:01:42.140> now

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
seat and just check that it's level now

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.020 
seat and just check that it's level now
if<00:01:43.259> you're<00:01:43.439> getting<00:01:43.710> numbness<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.790> groin

just<00:03:45.450> literally<00:03:45.900> either<00:03:46.110> blows<00:03:46.620> off<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:46.890> rim

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
just literally either blows off the rim

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.550 
just literally either blows off the rim
or<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.370> just<00:03:47.400> goes<00:03:47.730> bang<00:03:48.540> like<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> rifle<00:03:49.320> shot

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
or it just goes bang like a rifle shot

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.550 
or it just goes bang like a rifle shot
and<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.550> happens<00:03:51.000> all<00:03:51.210> really<00:03:51.630> quickly<00:03:51.960> now

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
and it happens all really quickly now

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.410 
and it happens all really quickly now
when<00:03:52.890> you're<00:03:53.070> riding<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.610> running<00:03:54.060> your<00:03:54.180> tire

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
when you're riding it running your tire

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.780 
when you're riding it running your tire
pressure<00:03:54.690> at<00:03:54.930> optimal<00:03:55.650> pressures<00:03:56.190> this

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
pressure at optimal pressures this

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.000 
pressure at optimal pressures this
doesn't<00:03:57.150> happen<00:03:57.300> when<00:03:57.990> you<00:03:58.110> get<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.290> puncher<00:03:58.800> or

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
doesn't happen when you get a puncher or

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.640 
doesn't happen when you get a puncher or
a<00:03:59.040> failure<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.480> actually<00:04:00.990> the<00:04:01.380> tire<00:04:01.620> just

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
a failure and actually the tire just

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.500 
a failure and actually the tire just
goes<00:04:02.040> down<00:04:02.310> naturally<00:04:02.580> you<00:04:03.000> don't<00:04:03.210> have<00:04:03.360> this

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
goes down naturally you don't have this

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.140 
goes down naturally you don't have this
massive<00:04:03.990> massive<00:04:04.350> failure<00:04:04.920> now<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.760> three

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
massive massive failure now the three

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.290 
massive massive failure now the three
things<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:07.040> govern<00:04:08.040> tire<00:04:08.490> pressure<00:04:08.850> are<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
things that govern tire pressure are the

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.540 
things that govern tire pressure are the
width<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.840> tire<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:10.380> tires<00:04:11.280> coming

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
width of the tire so tires coming

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.140 
width of the tire so tires coming
bearing<00:04:11.970> whips<00:04:12.230> 19<00:04:13.230> C<00:04:13.800> 21<00:04:14.790> C<00:04:15.209> 23<00:04:16.080> C<00:04:16.380> 25<00:04:17.070> C<00:04:17.400> the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
bearing whips 19 C 21 C 23 C 25 C the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.690 
bearing whips 19 C 21 C 23 C 25 C the
other<00:04:18.299> two<00:04:18.510> variables<00:04:19.049> are<00:04:19.440> road<00:04:19.890> surface<00:04:20.459> and

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
other two variables are road surface and

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.900 
other two variables are road surface and
rider<00:04:21.450> weight<00:04:21.919> so<00:04:22.919> let's<00:04:23.130> talk<00:04:23.310> about<00:04:23.370> tire

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
rider weight so let's talk about tire

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.870 
rider weight so let's talk about tire
width<00:04:24.180> first<00:04:24.570> now<00:04:25.290> generally<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.979> narrower

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
width first now generally the narrower

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.820 
width first now generally the narrower
tire<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.390> more<00:04:27.690> pressure<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.320> need<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.590> put

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
tire the more pressure you need to put

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.050 
tire the more pressure you need to put
in<00:04:28.950> it<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:30.360> for<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.720> 19<00:04:31.290> C<00:04:31.650> or<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.860> 21<00:04:32.250> C<00:04:32.520> tire<00:04:32.790> you

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
in it so for a 19 C or a 21 C tire you

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.330 
in it so for a 19 C or a 21 C tire you
would<00:04:33.180> put<00:04:33.420> more<00:04:33.720> pressure<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.230> it<00:04:34.350> then<00:04:35.010> for<00:04:35.310> a

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
would put more pressure in it then for a

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.590 
would put more pressure in it then for a
23<00:04:36.120> or<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.390> 25<00:04:37.380> C<00:04:37.800> tire<00:04:38.160> so<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.120> second<00:04:39.390> one<00:04:39.510> to

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
23 or a 25 C tire so the second one to

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.290 
23 or a 25 C tire so the second one to
talk<00:04:39.780> about<00:04:39.900> is<00:04:40.290> road<00:04:40.650> conditions<00:04:41.190> now<00:04:41.940> it's

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
talk about is road conditions now it's

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.120 
talk about is road conditions now it's
not<00:04:42.450> uncommon<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:43.260> see<00:04:43.470> on<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.830> wooden

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
not uncommon to see on the wooden

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.100 
not uncommon to see on the wooden
velodromes<00:04:44.730> which<00:04:44.940> are<00:04:45.090> very<00:04:45.420> very<00:04:45.600> smooth<00:04:45.930> to

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
velodromes which are very very smooth to

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.640 
velodromes which are very very smooth to
see<00:04:46.260> tire<00:04:46.620> pressures<00:04:47.010> around<00:04:47.160> 180<00:04:48.080> 160<00:04:49.080> even

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
see tire pressures around 180 160 even

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.860 
see tire pressures around 180 160 even
sometimes<00:04:50.010> 210<00:04:50.820> but<00:04:51.420> that's<00:04:51.600> only<00:04:51.750> because

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
sometimes 210 but that's only because

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.990 
sometimes 210 but that's only because
that<00:04:52.290> road<00:04:52.500> surface<00:04:52.920> is<00:04:52.950> very<00:04:53.100> very<00:04:53.820> very

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
that road surface is very very very

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.540 
that road surface is very very very
smooth<00:04:54.450> so<00:04:55.170> it's<00:04:55.290> not<00:04:55.410> uncommon<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.920> see<00:04:56.040> tire

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
smooth so it's not uncommon to see tire

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.600 
smooth so it's not uncommon to see tire
pressures<00:04:56.910> around<00:04:57.060> about<00:04:57.420> 80<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:58.340> 110<00:04:59.340> maybe

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
pressures around about 80 to 110 maybe

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.050 
pressures around about 80 to 110 maybe
120<00:05:00.420> psi<00:05:00.870> run<00:05:01.710> out<00:05:01.980> on<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.280> road<00:05:02.550> now<00:05:02.820> if<00:05:02.940> the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
120 psi run out on a road now if the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.090 
120 psi run out on a road now if the
roads<00:05:03.420> quite<00:05:03.810> smooth<00:05:04.170> you<00:05:04.860> could<00:05:05.010> obviously

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
roads quite smooth you could obviously

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.700 
roads quite smooth you could obviously
run<00:05:05.520> your<00:05:05.700> tires<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:06.030> little<00:05:06.330> bit<00:05:06.420> harder<00:05:07.110> but

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
run your tires a little bit harder but

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.920 
run your tires a little bit harder but
if<00:05:07.860> it's<00:05:08.040> quite<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.370> coarse<00:05:09.030> rough<00:05:09.420> right<00:05:09.690> then

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
if it's quite a coarse rough right then

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.020 
if it's quite a coarse rough right then
you<00:05:10.020> want<00:05:10.200> to<00:05:10.230> reduce<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.980> pressure<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:11.580> run

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
you want to reduce the pressure and run

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.110 
you want to reduce the pressure and run
them<00:05:12.180> a<00:05:12.300> little<00:05:12.630> bit<00:05:12.750> less<00:05:13.730> there's<00:05:14.730> a<00:05:14.760> lot<00:05:15.030> of

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
them a little bit less there's a lot of

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.310 
them a little bit less there's a lot of
people<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.450> think<00:05:15.600> that<00:05:15.720> obviously<00:05:15.990> the

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
people that think that obviously the

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.800 
people that think that obviously the
harder<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.190> tire<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:18.390> better<00:05:18.630> the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
harder the tire the better the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.290 
harder the tire the better the
performance<00:05:18.960> but<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.770> is<00:05:19.920> not<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.490> case<00:05:20.790> as

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
performance but this is not the case as

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.410 
performance but this is not the case as
the<00:05:21.780> road<00:05:21.990> becomes<00:05:22.260> rougher<00:05:22.920> the<00:05:23.400> tire<00:05:23.730> has<00:05:24.180> to

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
the road becomes rougher the tire has to

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.420 
the road becomes rougher the tire has to
yield<00:05:24.750> itself<00:05:25.230> around<00:05:25.530> that<00:05:25.680> road<00:05:25.890> and<00:05:26.190> if<00:05:26.310> the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
yield itself around that road and if the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.150 
yield itself around that road and if the
tyres<00:05:26.790> pumped<00:05:27.000> up<00:05:27.420> too<00:05:27.660> hard<00:05:27.960> it's<00:05:28.680> not<00:05:28.920> able

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
tyres pumped up too hard it's not able

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.580 
tyres pumped up too hard it's not able
to<00:05:29.310> do<00:05:29.460> that<00:05:29.640> job<00:05:29.910> correctly<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.380> end

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
to do that job correctly and the end

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.160 
to do that job correctly and the end
result<00:05:31.980> is<00:05:32.160> that<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.430> actually<00:05:32.670> ride<00:05:33.450> slow<00:05:33.870> on

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
result is that you actually ride slow on

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.710 
result is that you actually ride slow on
rough<00:05:34.650> surfaces<00:05:34.730> and<00:05:35.730> really<00:05:36.120> high<00:05:36.330> tire

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
rough surfaces and really high tire

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.860 
rough surfaces and really high tire
pressures<00:05:37.190> now<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.280> other<00:05:38.610> road<00:05:39.390> surface

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
pressures now the other road surface

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.750 
pressures now the other road surface
issue<00:05:40.080> is<00:05:40.380> when<00:05:40.590> the<00:05:40.740> roads<00:05:40.950> are<00:05:41.130> whipped<00:05:41.430> now

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
issue is when the roads are whipped now

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.760 
issue is when the roads are whipped now
I<00:05:41.790> would<00:05:42.300> generally<00:05:42.570> run<00:05:43.020> my<00:05:43.170> tyre<00:05:43.470> crusher

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
I would generally run my tyre crusher

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.120 
I would generally run my tyre crusher
law<00:05:44.160> on<00:05:44.460> wet<00:05:44.970> roads<00:05:45.210> and<00:05:45.690> that<00:05:46.110> enables<00:05:46.980> me<00:05:47.010> to

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
law on wet roads and that enables me to

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.760 
law on wet roads and that enables me to
get<00:05:47.340> more<00:05:47.580> traction<00:05:47.880> and<00:05:48.270> especially<00:05:48.780> if<00:05:49.410> I'm

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
get more traction and especially if I'm

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.680 
get more traction and especially if I'm
doing<00:05:50.070> a<00:05:50.160> lot<00:05:50.280> of<00:05:50.340> descending<00:05:51.000> down<00:05:51.180> mountains

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
doing a lot of descending down mountains

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.610 
doing a lot of descending down mountains
on<00:05:51.870> wet<00:05:52.200> roads

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
on wet roads

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.880 
on wet roads
I<00:05:52.740> would<00:05:52.920> definitely<00:05:53.550> run<00:05:53.760> my<00:05:54.150> tire<00:05:54.420> pressure

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
I would definitely run my tire pressure

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.010 
I would definitely run my tire pressure
lower<00:05:55.890> than<00:05:56.190> a<00:05:56.400> hundred<00:05:56.910> psi<00:05:57.180> to<00:05:57.720> give<00:05:57.870> me

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
lower than a hundred psi to give me

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.050 
lower than a hundred psi to give me
really<00:05:58.470> really<00:05:58.740> good<00:05:58.950> traction<00:05:59.280> on<00:05:59.610> those<00:05:59.880> wet

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
really really good traction on those wet

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.870 
really really good traction on those wet
roads<00:06:00.330> now<00:06:01.140> if<00:06:01.410> you<00:06:01.680> are<00:06:01.920> riding<00:06:02.250> a<00:06:02.460> really

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
roads now if you are riding a really

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.300 
roads now if you are riding a really
high<00:06:03.120> tire<00:06:03.720> pressure<00:06:04.050> on<00:06:04.350> wet<00:06:04.620> roads<00:06:04.830> and<00:06:05.220> you

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
high tire pressure on wet roads and you

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.340 
high tire pressure on wet roads and you
go<00:06:05.460> around<00:06:05.580> a<00:06:05.790> corner<00:06:06.000> there's<00:06:06.780> a<00:06:06.900> risk<00:06:07.230> that

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
go around a corner there's a risk that

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.680 
go around a corner there's a risk that
your<00:06:07.710> wheel<00:06:08.160> can<00:06:08.430> actually<00:06:08.760> jump<00:06:09.030> and<00:06:09.330> skip

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
your wheel can actually jump and skip

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.290 
your wheel can actually jump and skip
out<00:06:09.900> instead<00:06:10.470> of<00:06:10.700> instead<00:06:11.700> of<00:06:11.880> tracking

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
out instead of instead of tracking

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.480 
out instead of instead of tracking
through<00:06:12.780> the<00:06:12.900> corner<00:06:13.350> so<00:06:13.890> that's<00:06:14.040> why<00:06:14.280> it's

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
through the corner so that's why it's

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.130 
through the corner so that's why it's
really<00:06:14.820> important<00:06:15.510> to<00:06:15.630> keep<00:06:15.810> your<00:06:15.930> tire

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
really important to keep your tire

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.860 
really important to keep your tire
pressure<00:06:16.440> low<00:06:16.800> in<00:06:17.130> those<00:06:17.610> circumstances<00:06:18.030> now

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
pressure low in those circumstances now

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.420 
pressure low in those circumstances now
if<00:06:19.020> you're<00:06:19.200> a<00:06:19.230> lighter<00:06:19.560> rider<00:06:19.890> you<00:06:20.130> want<00:06:20.340> to

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
if you're a lighter rider you want to

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.670 
if you're a lighter rider you want to
run<00:06:20.610> your<00:06:20.760> tire<00:06:21.030> pressure<00:06:21.300> law<00:06:21.690> then<00:06:22.500> if

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
run your tire pressure law then if

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.720 
run your tire pressure law then if
you're<00:06:22.860> a<00:06:22.890> heavier<00:06:23.250> rider

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
you're a heavier rider

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.120 
you're a heavier rider
so<00:06:23.940> generally<00:06:24.450> heavier<00:06:24.780> riders<00:06:25.230> run<00:06:25.920> their

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
so generally heavier riders run their

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.440 
so generally heavier riders run their
tire<00:06:26.460> pressure<00:06:26.820> higher<00:06:27.270> than<00:06:28.080> lighter<00:06:28.470> riders

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
tire pressure higher than lighter riders

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.330 
tire pressure higher than lighter riders
okay<00:06:30.450> so<00:06:30.510> there's<00:06:30.930> a<00:06:30.990> lot<00:06:31.290> to<00:06:31.440> consider<00:06:31.590> around

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
okay so there's a lot to consider around

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.820 
okay so there's a lot to consider around
tire<00:06:32.790> pressure<00:06:33.240> and<00:06:33.570> you're<00:06:34.200> probably<00:06:34.380> asking

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
tire pressure and you're probably asking

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.490 
tire pressure and you're probably asking
the<00:06:35.250> question<00:06:35.640> well<00:06:35.970> what<00:06:36.360> do<00:06:36.630> I<00:06:36.690> run<00:06:36.960> my<00:06:37.229> damn

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
the question well what do I run my damn

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
the question well what do I run my damn
tires<00:06:37.919> it

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
tires it

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.310 
tires it
well<00:06:39.060> like<00:06:39.210> here's<00:06:39.419> a<00:06:39.479> good<00:06:39.630> rule<00:06:39.690> of<00:06:39.870> thumb

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
well like here's a good rule of thumb

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.380 
well like here's a good rule of thumb
I<00:06:40.350> generally<00:06:40.860> would<00:06:41.250> run<00:06:41.490> my<00:06:41.760> tie<00:06:42.120> pressure

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
I generally would run my tie pressure

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.560 
I generally would run my tie pressure
and<00:06:42.660> I<00:06:42.870> weigh<00:06:43.080> around<00:06:43.380> about<00:06:43.650> 67<00:06:44.640> to<00:06:44.790> 70<00:06:45.210> kilos

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
and I weigh around about 67 to 70 kilos

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.240 
and I weigh around about 67 to 70 kilos
depending<00:06:46.140> on<00:06:46.260> what<00:06:46.440> time<00:06:46.620> of<00:06:46.650> the<00:06:46.770> year<00:06:46.830> it<00:06:47.070> is

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
depending on what time of the year it is

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.610 
depending on what time of the year it is
I<00:06:47.430> generally<00:06:48.420> run<00:06:48.810> my<00:06:49.050> tire<00:06:49.320> pressure

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
I generally run my tire pressure

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.620 
I generally run my tire pressure
somewhere<00:06:50.010> between<00:06:50.190> eighty<00:06:51.090> and<00:06:51.330> a<00:06:51.600> hundred

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
somewhere between eighty and a hundred

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.340 
somewhere between eighty and a hundred
psi<00:06:52.320> and<00:06:52.920> that's<00:06:53.640> usually<00:06:54.090> for<00:06:54.300> either<00:06:54.540> a<00:06:54.690> 23

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
psi and that's usually for either a 23

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.180 
psi and that's usually for either a 23
or<00:06:55.530> 25<00:06:56.100> so<00:06:56.550> for<00:06:56.820> 25<00:06:57.480> C<00:06:57.840> I'd<00:06:58.500> run<00:06:58.770> it<00:06:58.890> somewhere

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
or 25 so for 25 C I'd run it somewhere

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:05.030 
or 25 so for 25 C I'd run it somewhere
around<00:06:59.310> 80<00:06:59.730> to<00:07:00.120> 85<00:07:00.600> maybe<00:07:01.110> 90<00:07:01.650> and<00:07:01.860> for<00:07:02.790> a<00:07:03.770> 23<00:07:04.770> C

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
around 80 to 85 maybe 90 and for a 23 C

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.830 
around 80 to 85 maybe 90 and for a 23 C
tire<00:07:05.340> I<00:07:05.640> would<00:07:05.910> run<00:07:06.030> it<00:07:06.180> around<00:07:06.540> about<00:07:06.690> a

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 
tire I would run it around about a

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.170 
tire I would run it around about a
hundred<00:07:07.260> sometimes<00:07:08.250> when<00:07:08.520> I'm<00:07:08.640> racing<00:07:08.790> on

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
hundred sometimes when I'm racing on

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.240 
hundred sometimes when I'm racing on
smooth<00:07:09.600> roads<00:07:09.630> I<00:07:10.110> would<00:07:10.380> take<00:07:10.560> it<00:07:10.680> up<00:07:10.800> 200<00:07:11.190> the

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
smooth roads I would take it up 200 the

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.400 
smooth roads I would take it up 200 the
10<00:07:11.460> and<00:07:11.670> that<00:07:11.850> would<00:07:12.000> be<00:07:12.150> the<00:07:12.270> maximum<00:07:12.600> now<00:07:13.260> if

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410 
10 and that would be the maximum now if

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.840 
10 and that would be the maximum now if
you're<00:07:13.530> a<00:07:13.560> heavier<00:07:13.920> re<00:07:14.160> you<00:07:14.370> can<00:07:14.520> run<00:07:14.700> your

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:14.850 
you're a heavier re you can run your

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.980 
you're a heavier re you can run your
pressure<00:07:15.060> a<00:07:15.150> little<00:07:15.300> bit<00:07:15.540> higher<00:07:15.750> than<00:07:15.930> that

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
pressure a little bit higher than that

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.230 
pressure a little bit higher than that
but<00:07:16.260> I<00:07:16.320> wouldn't<00:07:16.620> recommend<00:07:16.860> running<00:07:17.520> your
