00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
recently and this one pretty much looks

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.860 
recently and this one pretty much looks
identical<00:00:15.150> but<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.450> not<00:00:15.660> identical

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
identical but it's not identical

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.370 
identical but it's not identical
actually<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.740> little<00:00:17.010> bit<00:00:17.160> different<00:00:17.520> now

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
actually it's a little bit different now

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.359 
actually it's a little bit different now
how<00:00:19.380> do<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.560> explain<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.980> all<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
how do I explain to you all the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.529 
how do I explain to you all the
differences<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:20.939> sort<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
differences it's sort of like the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.980 
differences it's sort of like the
differences<00:00:21.930> between<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.500> Asus<00:00:22.980> triple<00:00:23.340> e

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
differences between the Asus triple e

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.109 
differences between the Asus triple e
909<00:00:24.990> o<00:00:25.019> 1<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.680> 1000<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.550> really<00:00:26.849> complicated

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
909 o 1 and 1000 it's really complicated

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.910

give you a walk-around of this thing
it's<00:02:22.850> probably<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.150> turn<00:02:23.300> off<00:02:23.420> now<00:02:23.600> but

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
it's probably a turn off now but

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.480

speakers<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.330> ironically<00:04:41.050> enough<00:04:41.200> are<00:04:41.760> very

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
speakers that ironically enough are very

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.310 
speakers that ironically enough are very
powerful<00:04:43.060> they<00:04:43.330> sound<00:04:43.600> pretty<00:04:43.780> good<00:04:43.870> I'm

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
powerful they sound pretty good I'm

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.960 
powerful they sound pretty good I'm
installing<00:04:44.620> some<00:04:44.950> software<00:04:44.980> there<00:04:45.490> as<00:04:45.610> you

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
installing some software there as you

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.940 
installing some software there as you
can<00:04:46.120> see<00:04:46.270> I<00:04:46.300> got<00:04:46.570> kind<00:04:46.810> of<00:04:46.840> bored<00:04:47.080> but<00:04:47.590> this<00:04:47.830> is

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
can see I got kind of bored but this is

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.890 
can see I got kind of bored but this is
an<00:04:48.070> awesome<00:04:48.280> device<00:04:48.550> I<00:04:48.850> really<00:04:49.330> like<00:04:49.510> this

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
an awesome device I really like this

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.960 
an awesome device I really like this
I<00:04:49.930> like<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.470> battery<00:04:50.860> not<00:04:51.370> only<00:04:51.520> does<00:04:51.640> it<00:04:51.700> last

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
I like the battery not only does it last

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.550 
I like the battery not only does it last
for<00:04:52.240> ridiculously<00:04:52.900> long<00:04:53.110> amounts<00:04:53.440> of<00:04:53.500> time

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
for ridiculously long amounts of time

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.320 
for ridiculously long amounts of time
but<00:04:54.070> it<00:04:54.220> does<00:04:54.370> act<00:04:54.640> as<00:04:54.790> like<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.060> perfect

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
but it does act as like the perfect

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.540 
but it does act as like the perfect
little<00:04:55.660> prop<00:04:55.930> for<00:04:56.530> your<00:04:56.620> wrists<00:04:57.040> it<00:04:57.190> works<00:04:57.370> out

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
little prop for your wrists it works out

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.910 
little prop for your wrists it works out
really<00:04:57.850> great<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.390> if<00:04:59.320> you<00:04:59.590> guys<00:04:59.680> want<00:04:59.860> to

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
really great and if you guys want to

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.310 
really great and if you guys want to
take<00:04:59.980> a<00:05:00.040> look<00:05:00.190> at<00:05:00.310> how<00:05:00.460> small<00:05:00.760> this<00:05:00.940> is<00:05:01.290> take<00:05:02.290> a

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
take a look at how small this is take a

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.260 
take a look at how small this is take a
look<00:05:02.470> at<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:02.650> and<00:05:02.830> you<00:05:03.220> can<00:05:03.340> even<00:05:03.520> hold<00:05:04.120> it

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
look at that and you can even hold it

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.340 
look at that and you can even hold it
from<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.450> battery<00:05:04.720> if<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:04.840> like<00:05:05.020> I<00:05:05.110> probably

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
from the battery if you like I probably

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.500 
from the battery if you like I probably
recommend<00:05:05.620> that<00:05:05.890> but<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.220> could<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:06.700> it's<00:05:07.450> a

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
recommend that but you could and it's a

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.820 
recommend that but you could and it's a
little<00:05:07.720> heavier<00:05:08.050> than<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.320> other<00:05:08.440> ones<00:05:08.710> but

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
little heavier than the other ones but

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.410 
little heavier than the other ones but
that's<00:05:09.370> because<00:05:09.460> it's<00:05:09.640> got<00:05:09.730> more<00:05:09.790> hardware

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
that's because it's got more hardware

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.060 
that's because it's got more hardware
inside<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:10.840> does<00:05:10.960> have<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.170> faster<00:05:11.530> processor

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
inside it does have the faster processor

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.040 
inside it does have the faster processor
this<00:05:12.610> processor<00:05:13.030> actually<00:05:13.240> is<00:05:13.510> faster<00:05:13.930> than

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
this processor actually is faster than

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.440 
this processor actually is faster than
the<00:05:14.200> the<00:05:14.410> atom<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:15.030> plenty<00:05:16.030> of<00:05:16.090> hard<00:05:16.270> drive

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
the the atom and plenty of hard drive

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.330 
the the atom and plenty of hard drive
space<00:05:16.600> plenty<00:05:17.350> of<00:05:17.440> RAM<00:05:17.650> it<00:05:17.890> does<00:05:18.070> give<00:05:18.220> you<00:05:18.280> the
