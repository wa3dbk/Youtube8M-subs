00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.559
 an apology all honestly but it's 

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:07.960
 that my throat is pretty bad and 

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:07.960

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.699

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.650
 a lot of exercise for a year so I do not 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.060
 they want to leave me alone in my house 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.460
 Welcome to the Lord is a new video 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.140
 just as heat that did not move my 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.380
 wait for the eyes 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.059
 I'm scared wey excuse me sorry 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.830
 I feel a little with my eyes with water 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.129
 is that I have to put drops I'm 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.660
 bad of my pretty little eyes but well 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.949
 welcome to a new video and in this 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.350
 occasion we are going to talk a little bit about 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.780
 guitar hero and rock band slips in 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.750
 the tears guitar hero and rock band las 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.390
 music sagas par excellence and 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.640
 they will park or whatever they want to fuck 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.410
 say they will arrive at the new consoles and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.910
 with them new things we are not going to talk 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.619
 first of guitar hero and then rock man 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.910
 and I'm going to give my opinion all this 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.220
 video in my opinion if you want 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.780
 contribute something with pleasure you can leave 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.340
 in the comment box always and 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.060
 when it is with respect because if you do not 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.980
 will block for being a rude 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:36.010
 but chopin falls well today and is here 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.050
 many sagas have to innovate not 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.870
 because you can not do the same thing 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.080
 every year 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.140
 but what about guitar hero came out the 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.820
 guitar 4 nobody liked it came out on 5 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.090
 etcetera etcetera 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.090
 all who came out were bad and they 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.820
 I liked music they were very bad 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.930
 good you can play I bought them in 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.520
 your day then you can play it comes out on the 6th 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.120
 we go in a little bit more the microphone 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.650
 I think that's not the best way out 6 and 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.680
 it was wonderful it was the best guitar 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.220
 hero after 3 or 1 2 3 and this or 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.230
 be the 6 should be 4 and was very good 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.180
 they should have followed that line and for 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.500
 what they do not want to innovate that 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.210
 I understand why people say nothing and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.600
 this is the same I do not buy it good 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.100
 they innovated they made three three buttons 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.320
 up and three down 6 not black and blue 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.920
 white and act this are you playing well and 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:39.160
 innovative I do not put it on but that 's fine 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.599
 videos instead of graphics there yes already 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.310
 I put the but why because it seems that 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.080
 are you playing flash or are you a guitar hero 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.430
 flash of the facebook you put the 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.590
 link of your song and there is playing 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.040
 with the with the keyboard is like software 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.980
 web and put and in the background is your video 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.470
 favorite of the song because that's how I feel 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.870
 what is the guitar hero iii web and what's more 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.830
 important in a music game that is 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.239
 Exactly the music was revealed 10 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.040
 guitar hero songs I'm not going to 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.650
 judge the game for 10 songs but it 's 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.260
 that 10 is a good rubbish 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.459
 You may like it good to like it or not but 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.840
 you must agree that they are 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.330
 songs that are not for guitar hero 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.349
 and in my career I do not know where the dc fuck 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.349
 but well 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.780
 mom 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.140
 well you do not want to play but you're 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:43.900
 songs are 10 o'clock listen to them believe me 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:46.299
 I heard them and they are all like that 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.760
 It's all you bored me and I do not want 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.489
 play that that already happened in the 4 things with 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.470
 songs for hipster for children well 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:59.349
 we do not want fast songs and things 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.829
 well and why not put them in cap cap with 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.389
 s activision because they want 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.069
 sell more they will not do with this 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.270
 kind of songs they already had a public and 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.550
 they are spoiling it 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.010
 and well let's talk about rock band that 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.420
 by the way rock band already is 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.580
 good game because he has the 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.500
 songs that you already downloaded everything 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.690
 that is if you bought a song is 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.840
 because you like it then you already have your 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.090
 repertoire of songs that you like in 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.200
 the game plus everything new that's going to 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.660
 come on the rock band that have not 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.640
 shown nothing but good if they already said 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.740
 that your instruments of the past 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.080
 generation can be used in the current 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.210
 that means that the gameplay is going to 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.540
 be the same or similar that I think 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.670
 it's going to be the same, that's good, 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.800
 that does is to apply the 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.600
 of youtube because you want to fix something 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.520
 that is not broken and you leave it worse 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.500
 help 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.090
 that's my opinion, not rock band 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.490
 is made by those who made guitar 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.280
 hero 1 and 2 steal one of you green 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.900
 day et cetera until the 4 activision is a 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.210
 new group is a new study to the wanted 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.970
 dj hero the guitar hero like from which 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.950
 he is doing well for me they go for 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.820
 with the left foot me in my case with 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.890
 these songs 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.990
 I feel that the direction of the game will go 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.330
 out there and not the truth is that I do not 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.740
 it pleases me I do not think it's buying it's not going to 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.620
 say that the game is bad because I do not 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.320
 but obviously I played in my case 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.250
 it strikes me I'm not going to buy it 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.200
 we learn to listen because there are 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.790
 that like in my video of the consoles that 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.560
 I said the new generation was ugly 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.510
 or not so much the consoles because the 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.180
 games were garbage and remastered 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.890
 remasters and nothing new and that 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.230
 I said and a boy came out saying that 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.570
 they were stupid and that I should play 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.950
 nintendo and playstation to see what they were 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.419
 good games and it was what I was 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.220
 saying no games right now 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.330
 they are good and they come tell me that those of 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.800
 before it was better and that I'm stupid 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.840
 because it says the opposite 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.550
 thing that I did not say we learn to listen 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.020
 please if you do not want to win a ban 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.199
 and they are saying why 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.039
 because they put pure nonsense good I'm 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.210
 leaving aside if they locate someone from 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.310
 comments that are half tortilla and 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.650
 do me my favor, not correct it 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:09.190
 so if he does not learn to listen but 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.360
 'guitar hero' for me died no longer me 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.949
 It draws attention to me before I liked 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.599
 enough of 'guitar hero' the crap 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.539
 that they steal because they are two games 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.280
 different is the same the same 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.169
 mechanical but they are very different 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.419
 'guitar hero' is easier is more art and 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.940
 rock band you have to give it more precision 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:27.340
 and it's much more complicated but it 's better 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.720
 I like it more is my opinion every 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.550
 who and yours please 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.409
 I repeat, leave it in the comment box 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.509
 with respect and we are going to debate between 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.099
 all but well what do you think you are 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.599
 they go to buy they steal because they have 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.880
 their instruments the most they will 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.229
 serve good things or they will buy and 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.060
 third they're going to have to buy everything 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:45.300
 again to have more songs or 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.940
 less good there 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.220
 I do not know I do not know the truth I do not I'm not going to 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.500
 buy unless 23 songs come 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:55.770
 I like them 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.259
 they are things more already they know the song the one of 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.970
 kind of songs that I like that eye 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:02.069
 of the i's that got a I like the 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:06.590
 from jake book to me I like that web like 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:09.760
 sing and everything is not that it is not for nothing 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.560
 and two minutes 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.510
 rowan I feel that it will not be good 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.520
 as always going to be a rock band 3 with 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.990
 better graphics and new songs but 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.350
 you are attentive download they will take you out 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.090
 more etcetera perfect me there I do not eat it 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.530
 but the truth is that I like it a lot 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.510
 let me know the comments that you think 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.520
 it comes out so we'll see you in a new video 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:31.260

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.330

 video video with what you cut them 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.610
 because sometimes he cut a lot he cut 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.660
 a lot and not because he says nonsense or something 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.370
 that I'm wrong 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.010
 I have to move my fringe to another side 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.910
 because if I do not I do not see is that we see 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:52.580
