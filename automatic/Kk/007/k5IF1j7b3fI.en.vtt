varieties of nephron cortical nephrons

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.319 
varieties of nephron cortical nephrons
and<00:00:59.360> juxta<00:01:00.260> medullary<00:01:00.590> nephrons<00:01:01.329> the

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
and juxta medullary nephrons the

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.660 
and juxta medullary nephrons the
structure<00:01:02.720> is<00:01:02.840> very<00:01:02.930> similar<00:01:03.309> with<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.460> main

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
structure is very similar with the main

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.240 
structure is very similar with the main
difference<00:01:05.089> being<00:01:05.299> how<00:01:05.590> superficially<00:01:06.619> the

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
difference being how superficially the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.760 
difference being how superficially the
glomerulus<00:01:07.820> sits<00:01:08.210> in<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.659> cortex<00:01:09.109> and<00:01:09.409> how

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
glomerulus sits in the cortex and how

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.219 
glomerulus sits in the cortex and how
deep<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.369> loop<00:01:10.549> of<00:01:10.729> Henle<00:01:11.090> dips<00:01:11.840> into<00:01:12.049> the

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
deep the loop of Henle dips into the

deep the loop of Henle dips into the
medulla<00:01:13.479> cortical<00:01:14.479> nephrons<00:01:14.869> are

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
medulla cortical nephrons are

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.709 
medulla cortical nephrons are
superficial<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.039> juxta<00:01:16.700> medullary<00:01:17.060> nephrons

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
superficial and juxta medullary nephrons

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.399 
superficial and juxta medullary nephrons
are<00:01:18.020> deeper<00:01:18.889> in<00:01:19.100> fact<00:01:19.939> they<00:01:20.270> lie<00:01:20.569> next<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.289> the

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
are deeper in fact they lie next to the

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.639 
are deeper in fact they lie next to the
medulla<00:01:21.770> which<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:22.999> meaning<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:23.649> juxta

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
medulla which is the meaning of juxta

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.599 
medulla which is the meaning of juxta
medullary<00:01:26.709> so<00:01:27.709> let's<00:01:27.979> start<00:01:28.369> at<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
medullary so let's start at the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.870 
medullary so let's start at the
beginning<00:01:29.770> here<00:01:30.770> we<00:01:30.799> have<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.280> glomerulus

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
beginning here we have the glomerulus

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.449 
beginning here we have the glomerulus
which<00:01:32.719> is<00:01:32.929> where<00:01:33.139> the<00:01:33.319> blood<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.590> filtered<00:01:34.069> and

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
which is where the blood is filtered and

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.449 
which is where the blood is filtered and
you<00:01:35.450> can<00:01:35.569> see<00:01:35.779> a<00:01:35.810> bald<00:01:36.200> capillaries<00:01:37.009> inside

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
you can see a bald capillaries inside

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.749 
you can see a bald capillaries inside
the<00:01:37.670> glomerulus<00:01:38.950> I'm<00:01:39.950> not<00:01:40.249> going<00:01:40.459> to<00:01:40.549> talk

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
the glomerulus I'm not going to talk

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.179 
the glomerulus I'm not going to talk
much<00:01:41.029> about<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.600> glomerulus<00:01:42.139> because<00:01:42.859> it<00:01:43.039> is

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
much about the glomerulus because it is

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.550 
much about the glomerulus because it is
covered<00:01:43.429> in<00:01:43.670> detail<00:01:43.939> in<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.719> next<00:01:45.049> video<00:01:45.380> in

covered in detail in the next video in
the<00:01:45.649> series<00:01:46.899> and<00:01:48.700> here<00:01:49.700> at

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the series and here at

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.289 
the series and here at
very<00:01:50.670> important<00:01:51.240> materials<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.759> afferent

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
very important materials the afferent

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.559 
very important materials the afferent
arteriole<00:01:54.960> which<00:01:55.950> brings<00:01:56.369> blood<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
arteriole which brings blood to the

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.469 
arteriole which brings blood to the
glomerulus<00:01:58.109> for<00:01:58.740> filtration<00:01:59.429> and<00:01:59.609> the<00:01:59.670> II

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
glomerulus for filtration and the II

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.319 
glomerulus for filtration and the II
front<00:02:01.109> arteriole<00:02:01.710> which<00:02:02.369> takes<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.939> filtered

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
front arteriole which takes the filtered

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:12.240 
front arteriole which takes the filtered
blood<00:02:03.539> away<00:02:03.780> from<00:02:04.109> the<00:02:04.500> glomerulus

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.750 

I<00:02:12.870> always<00:02:13.870> remember<00:02:14.170> which<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.710> which<00:02:14.920> by

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
I always remember which is which by

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.210 
I always remember which is which by
thinking<00:02:16.210> that<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:17.190> comes<00:02:18.190> before<00:02:18.670> E<00:02:19.270> and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
thinking that a comes before E and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.510 
thinking that a comes before E and
therefore<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:22.240> afferent<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.340> before<00:02:24.340> the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
therefore the afferent is before the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.480 
therefore the afferent is before the
efferent<00:02:25.440> now<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.500> filtrate<00:02:27.100> which<00:02:27.280> will

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
efferent now the filtrate which will

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.700 
efferent now the filtrate which will
eventually<00:02:27.730> become<00:02:28.090> urine<00:02:28.630> needs<00:02:29.290> things

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
eventually become urine needs things

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.100 
eventually become urine needs things
taken<00:02:30.190> out<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.850> also<00:02:31.360> needs<00:02:31.780> things

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
taken out of it and also needs things

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.970 
taken out of it and also needs things
put<00:02:32.770> into<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:34.660> do<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.350> travels<00:02:35.860> along

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
put into it to do this it travels along

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.110 
put into it to do this it travels along
this<00:02:36.430> series<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.120> tubes<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:39.220> first<00:02:39.550> part<00:02:39.880> is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
the proximal convoluted tubule which is

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.560 
the proximal convoluted tubule which is
often<00:02:44.020> referred<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.650> as<00:02:44.890> just<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.910> proximal

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
often referred to as just the proximal

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.300 
often referred to as just the proximal
tubule<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.780> big<00:02:50.110> loop<00:02:50.320> here<00:02:50.770> is<00:02:50.800> called<00:02:51.190> the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
tubule this big loop here is called the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.040 
tubule this big loop here is called the
loop<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.760> Henle<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:54.970> part<00:02:55.360> that<00:02:55.630> dips

note<00:03:23.740> that<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:24.280> tube<00:03:24.580> then<00:03:24.970> passes<00:03:25.510> by<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
note that the tube then passes by the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.030 
note that the tube then passes by the
glomerulus<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:27.190> arterioles<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.860> at

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
glomerulus and the arterioles this is at

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.740 
glomerulus and the arterioles this is at
this<00:03:30.250> point<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.120> juxtaglomerular

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750

this point that the juxtaglomerular
apparatus<00:03:32.490> lies<00:03:33.900> we<00:03:34.900> will<00:03:34.990> talk<00:03:35.170> more<00:03:35.200> about

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
apparatus lies we will talk more about

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.430 
apparatus lies we will talk more about
the<00:03:35.920> juxtaglomerular<00:03:36.520> apparatus<00:03:37.090> in<00:03:37.960> the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.880 
the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the
next<00:03:38.740> tutorial<00:03:40.080> this<00:03:41.080> is<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.320> distal

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
next tutorial this is a distal

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.240 
next tutorial this is a distal
convoluted<00:03:42.130> tubules<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.620> I've<00:03:44.620> labeled<00:03:44.890> this

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
convoluted tubules and I've labeled this

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.540 
convoluted tubules and I've labeled this
here<00:03:46.290> then<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.530> distal<00:03:47.980> tubules

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
here then the distal tubules

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.690 
here then the distal tubules
connects<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.420> collecting<00:03:49.930> duct<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.700> spoke

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
connects to the collecting duct I spoke

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.910 
connects to the collecting duct I spoke
about<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.360> collecting<00:03:52.810> duct<00:03:53.080> in<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.650> last

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
about the collecting duct in the last

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.130 
about the collecting duct in the last
tutorial<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.790> said<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:55.660> takes<00:03:55.900> the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
tutorial and said that it takes the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.280 
tutorial and said that it takes the
urine<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.280> renal<00:03:57.760> papilla<00:03:57.880> in<00:03:58.720> order<00:03:59.110> for

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
urine to the renal papilla in order for

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.010 
urine to the renal papilla in order for
it<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.410> flow<00:03:59.800> onward<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.610> out<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.510> kidney

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.810 

now<00:04:05.020> the<00:04:05.080> last<00:04:05.380> thing<00:04:05.800> to<00:04:05.920> talk<00:04:06.100> about<00:04:06.160> is<00:04:06.640> the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
now the last thing to talk about is the

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.570 
now the last thing to talk about is the
vasculature<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.990> nephron<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.650> this<00:04:09.400> is

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
vasculature of the nephron and this is

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.290 
vasculature of the nephron and this is
really<00:04:09.850> important<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.920> afferent<00:04:12.550> arteriole

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
really important the afferent arteriole

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.349 
really important the afferent arteriole
of<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:14.230> kidney<00:04:14.620> carries<00:04:15.430> blood<00:04:15.760> away<00:04:16.000> from

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
of the kidney carries blood away from

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.770 
of the kidney carries blood away from
the<00:04:16.840> glomerulus<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:17.730> then<00:04:18.730> it<00:04:18.850> supplies<00:04:19.299> to

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
the glomerulus and then it supplies to

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.430 
the glomerulus and then it supplies to
capillary<00:04:20.200> beds<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:22.600> first<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:23.230> the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
capillary beds the first is the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.280 
capillary beds the first is the
peritubular<00:04:24.130> capillaries<00:04:25.030> which<00:04:25.810> supplied

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
peritubular capillaries which supplied

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:35.940 
peritubular capillaries which supplied
blood<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.040> proximal<00:04:27.640> and<00:04:27.730> distal<00:04:27.930> tubules

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.270 

the<00:04:36.950> other<00:04:37.130> is<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.760> Vaser<00:04:38.030> recti<00:04:39.280> which

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
the other is the Vaser recti which

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.190 
the other is the Vaser recti which
supply<00:04:40.880> blood<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.960> loop<00:04:42.230> of<00:04:42.500> Henle

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
supply blood to the loop of Henle

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.260 
supply blood to the loop of Henle
these<00:04:45.200> two<00:04:45.560> sets<00:04:45.919> of<00:04:46.130> capillaries<00:04:46.700> will

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
these two sets of capillaries will

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.590 
these two sets of capillaries will
provide<00:04:47.600> water<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:48.139> solutes<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:50.120> be<00:04:50.240> secreted
