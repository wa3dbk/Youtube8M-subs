00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
holes on the corner of the shape and I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260 
holes on the corner of the shape and I
repeat<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.739> four<00:00:50.010> more<00:00:50.160> times<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.670> four<00:00:51.090> more

part<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.970> get<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.210> decorate<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:15.810> beads

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
part you get to decorate it with beads

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.260 
part you get to decorate it with beads
and<00:01:16.439> gemstones<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.250> any<00:01:17.460> extra<00:01:17.909> random

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and gemstones and any extra random

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.080 
and gemstones and any extra random
knickknacks<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:18.960> laying<00:01:19.200> around<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
knickknacks you have laying around I

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.940 
knickknacks you have laying around I
find<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.479> 6000<00:01:22.049> works<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> best<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.650> this

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
find that a 6000 works the best for this

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.370 
find that a 6000 works the best for this
since<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.490> dries<00:01:23.729> super<00:01:24.240> fast<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.080> secures

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
since it dries super fast and it secures

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.260 
since it dries super fast and it secures
the<00:01:25.619> beads<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.009> gemstones<00:01:26.520> pretty<00:01:26.850> well<00:01:27.060> on

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the beads and gemstones pretty well on

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.010 
the beads and gemstones pretty well on
to<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.509> plastic<00:01:29.090> now<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> try<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> use<00:01:30.750> glass

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
to the plastic now I try to use glass

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.810 
to the plastic now I try to use glass
beads<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.619> crystals<00:01:31.680> since<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:32.670> will

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
beads and crystals since they will

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.240 
beads and crystals since they will
sparkle<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.390> shine<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> lot<00:01:33.869> more<00:01:34.200> once<00:01:35.100> you're

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
sparkle and shine a lot more once you're

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.890 
sparkle and shine a lot more once you're
done<00:01:35.400> decorating<00:01:36.030> you're<00:01:36.210> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> connect

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
done decorating you're going to connect

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.899 
done decorating you're going to connect
them<00:01:37.049> all<00:01:37.229> together<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.040> all<00:01:38.460> you'll<00:01:38.670> need<00:01:38.850> is

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
them all together and all you'll need is

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.910 
them all together and all you'll need is
a<00:01:39.360> jump<00:01:39.720> ring<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.560> feed<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.890> through

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
a jump ring you can just feed it through

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
a jump ring you can just feed it through
the<00:01:41.250> small<00:01:41.520> holes<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.479> punched<00:01:42.899> out

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
the small holes that was punched out

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.039 
the small holes that was punched out
earlier<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.590> that's<00:01:44.009> pretty<00:01:44.399> convenient

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.109 

and<00:01:50.049> to<00:01:50.860> extend<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.250> necklace<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.820> use<00:01:52.090> a

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
and to extend the necklace I use a

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.030 
and to extend the necklace I use a
bigger<00:01:52.570> jump<00:01:52.930> ring<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.290> attach<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:54.009> a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
bigger jump ring to attach it to a

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.580 
bigger jump ring to attach it to a
larger<00:01:54.700> chain<00:01:55.030> which<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:55.780> think<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.290> makes<00:01:56.439> it

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
larger chain which I think it makes it

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.889 
larger chain which I think it makes it
look<00:01:56.649> way<00:01:57.100> more<00:01:57.460> expensive<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.360> for<00:01:58.780> the

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
look way more expensive and for the

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.990 
look way more expensive and for the
closure<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.680> just<00:02:00.009> went<00:02:00.220> ahead<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.670> attached

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
closure I just went ahead and attached

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.380 
closure I just went ahead and attached
on<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.299> pretty<00:02:01.659> little<00:02:02.049> toggle<00:02:02.530> at<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.890> end<00:02:03.070> and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
on a pretty little toggle at the end and

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.600 
on a pretty little toggle at the end and
tada<00:02:04.390> a<00:02:04.899> really<00:02:05.350> cute<00:02:05.680> statement<00:02:06.189> necklace

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
tada a really cute statement necklace

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.490 
tada a really cute statement necklace
that<00:02:06.880> cost<00:02:07.210> me<00:02:07.420> less<00:02:07.659> than<00:02:07.689> four<00:02:08.050> bucks<00:02:08.289> to

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
that cost me less than four bucks to

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.979 
that cost me less than four bucks to
make<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.759> I<00:02:09.819> also<00:02:10.030> tried<00:02:10.390> this<00:02:10.539> out<00:02:10.720> on<00:02:10.869> the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
make so I also tried this out on the

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.259 
make so I also tried this out on the
triangle<00:02:11.560> shape<00:02:11.920> with<00:02:12.160> some<00:02:12.580> spikes<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.209> I

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
triangle shape with some spikes and I

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.449 
triangle shape with some spikes and I
think<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.599> looks<00:02:13.780> super<00:02:14.110> fabulous<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.069> edgy

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
think it looks super fabulous and edgy

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.130 
think it looks super fabulous and edgy
so<00:02:16.060> there's<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.360> couple<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:16.780> other<00:02:16.930> shapes
