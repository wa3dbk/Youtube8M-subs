compare the ultra pixel camera on the
HTC<00:00:10.510> one<00:00:10.930> with<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.650> 8<00:00:11.889> megapixel<00:00:12.549> camera<00:00:12.969> on

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
HTC one with the 8 megapixel camera on

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.630 
HTC one with the 8 megapixel camera on
the<00:00:13.259> iPhone<00:00:14.259> 5<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:17.320> the<00:00:17.560> first<00:00:17.800> picture<00:00:18.280> I

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
the iPhone 5 for the first picture I

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.150 
the iPhone 5 for the first picture I
like<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.450> one<00:00:19.840> on<00:00:20.140> the<00:00:20.289> left<00:00:20.500> that<00:00:20.680> is<00:00:20.859> of<00:00:21.039> the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
like the one on the left that is of the

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.970 
like the one on the left that is of the
HTC<00:00:21.760> One<00:00:22.029> I<00:00:22.269> think<00:00:22.900> both<00:00:23.080> cameras<00:00:23.470> did<00:00:23.679> a<00:00:23.710> great

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
HTC One I think both cameras did a great

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.720 
HTC One I think both cameras did a great
job<00:00:24.010> capturing<00:00:24.640> details<00:00:25.830> but<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:27.039> iPhone<00:00:27.220> I

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
job capturing details but the iPhone I

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.630 
job capturing details but the iPhone I
believe<00:00:28.179> saturated<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.320> color<00:00:29.349> red<00:00:29.949> a<00:00:30.160> lot

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
believe saturated the color red a lot

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.540 
believe saturated the color red a lot
more<00:00:30.970> than<00:00:31.269> it<00:00:31.509> actually<00:00:31.720> was<00:00:32.050> while<00:00:32.680> HTC<00:00:33.340> One

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
more than it actually was while HTC One

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.170 
more than it actually was while HTC One
had<00:00:33.790> a<00:00:33.820> better<00:00:34.120> color<00:00:34.630> accuracy<00:00:35.220> so<00:00:36.220> HTC<00:00:36.940> One

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
had a better color accuracy so HTC One

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.470 
had a better color accuracy so HTC One
wins<00:00:37.780> this<00:00:38.020> one<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:42.040> this<00:00:42.430> one<00:00:42.490> I<00:00:42.940> like<00:00:43.240> the

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
wins this one and this one I like the

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.020 
wins this one and this one I like the
one<00:00:44.020> on<00:00:44.230> top<00:00:44.500> that<00:00:44.770> is<00:00:44.980> of<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.310> iPhone<00:00:45.730> 5

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
one on top that is of the iPhone 5

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.180 
one on top that is of the iPhone 5
mostly<00:00:46.630> because<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.680> one<00:00:47.830> on<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.040> bottom

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
mostly because the one on the bottom

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.730 
mostly because the one on the bottom
seems<00:00:49.180> to<00:00:49.330> have<00:00:49.510> some<00:00:49.840> kind<00:00:49.990> of<00:00:50.080> a<00:00:50.200> flair<00:00:50.470> to<00:00:50.710> it

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
seems to have some kind of a flair to it

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.460 
seems to have some kind of a flair to it
the<00:00:51.250> iPhone<00:00:51.610> 5<00:00:51.820> picture<00:00:52.270> has<00:00:52.690> better<00:00:52.990> colors

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
the iPhone 5 picture has better colors

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:01.380 
the iPhone 5 picture has better colors
and<00:00:54.240> no<00:00:55.240> glare<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:57.070> iPhone<00:00:57.400> 5<00:00:57.640> wins<00:01:00.150> in<00:01:01.150> this

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
and no glare so iPhone 5 wins in this

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.390 
and no glare so iPhone 5 wins in this
picture<00:01:01.780> we<00:01:01.990> focus<00:01:02.410> on<00:01:02.560> the<00:01:02.650> ground<00:01:02.890> grass<00:01:03.190> to

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
picture we focus on the ground grass to

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.760 
picture we focus on the ground grass to
see<00:01:03.640> what<00:01:04.000> kind<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.360> effect<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:05.260> background

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
see what kind of effect the background

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.149 
see what kind of effect the background
has<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:07.180> iPhone<00:01:07.509> 5<00:01:07.750> seems<00:01:08.109> to<00:01:08.259> kind<00:01:08.649> of<00:01:08.770> blur

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
has the iPhone 5 seems to kind of blur

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.310 
has the iPhone 5 seems to kind of blur
the<00:01:09.399> background<00:01:09.579> while<00:01:10.299> these<00:01:10.570> two<00:01:10.869> see<00:01:11.079> one

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
the background while these two see one

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.660 
the background while these two see one
does<00:01:11.649> blur<00:01:12.009> but<00:01:12.310> very<00:01:12.939> little<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:14.289> I<00:01:14.799> think<00:01:14.920> the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
does blur but very little so I think the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.139 
does blur but very little so I think the
HTC<00:01:16.479> one<00:01:16.750> wins<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:17.500> round<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:21.189> this<00:01:21.729> picture

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
I like the one on the top better do you

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.880 
I like the one on the top better do you
want<00:01:24.490> on<00:01:24.579> top<00:01:24.789> is<00:01:24.969> it<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.240> iPhone<00:01:25.749> it<00:01:26.409> seems<00:01:26.740> to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
want on top is it the iPhone it seems to

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.810

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.179 

this<00:01:38.000> picture<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.450> taken<00:01:38.720> in<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.530> low<00:01:39.890> light

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
this picture is taken in a low light

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.600 
this picture is taken in a low light
exposure<00:01:40.759> environment<00:01:41.689> I<00:01:42.250> like<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.369> picture

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
exposure environment I like the picture

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.260 
exposure environment I like the picture
on<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.820> left

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
on the left

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.010 
on the left
better<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:44.960> of<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.229> HTC<00:01:45.829> One<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:47.020> ultra

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
better that is of the HTC One the ultra

better that is of the HTC One the ultra
pixel<00:01:48.200> camera<00:01:48.560> sensor<00:01:49.009> really<00:01:49.399> does<00:01:49.880> capture

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
pixel camera sensor really does capture

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.810 
pixel camera sensor really does capture
the<00:01:50.479> light<00:01:50.689> in<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.110> picture<00:01:51.619> therefore<00:01:52.610> it

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
the light in the picture therefore it

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.510 
the light in the picture therefore it
looks<00:01:53.000> much<00:01:53.539> brighter

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.860 
One wins this one hey guys so I came to
the<00:02:15.310> conclusion<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.849> both<00:02:16.390> phones<00:02:16.690> have

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
the conclusion that both phones have

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.070 
the conclusion that both phones have
great<00:02:17.620> cameras<00:02:18.310> amazing<00:02:19.239> picture<00:02:19.569> quality

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
great cameras amazing picture quality

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.400 
great cameras amazing picture quality
but<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.590> believe<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.519> HTC<00:02:22.030> one<00:02:22.269> has<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:23.019> slightly

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
but I believe the HTC one has a slightly

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.640 
but I believe the HTC one has a slightly
better<00:02:23.650> camera<00:02:24.069> than<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.400> iPhone<00:02:24.910> 5

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
better camera than the iPhone 5

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.370 
better camera than the iPhone 5
I<00:02:26.680> also<00:02:27.519> conducted<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.150> survey<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.599> asked<00:02:29.049> 15

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
I also conducted a survey I asked 15

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.199 
I also conducted a survey I asked 15
people<00:02:29.590> which<00:02:30.280> cameras<00:02:30.670> they<00:02:30.819> thought<00:02:31.060> were

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
people which cameras they thought were

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.729 
people which cameras they thought were
better<00:02:31.360> by<00:02:31.720> showing<00:02:31.930> them<00:02:32.140> these<00:02:32.319> pictures
