00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
so so at it I ended up doing something

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.750 
so so at it I ended up doing something
similar<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.720> like<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.019> bantu<00:03:05.709> knot<00:03:06.099> on<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.489> ends

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
similar to like a bantu knot on the ends

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.550 
similar to like a bantu knot on the ends
initially<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.299> tried<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.870> just<00:03:08.109> roll<00:03:08.410> around

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560

like<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:11.470> ends<00:03:11.859> around<00:03:11.980> my<00:03:12.220> finger<00:03:12.700> but

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
like the the ends around my finger but

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.569 
like the the ends around my finger but
it<00:03:12.970> wasn't<00:03:13.569> wet<00:03:13.840> enough<00:03:14.140> okay<00:03:14.650> since<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.250> since

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
it wasn't wet enough okay since it since

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.089 
it wasn't wet enough okay since it since
I<00:03:15.670> said<00:03:15.879> slightly<00:03:16.329> damp<00:03:16.690> hair<00:03:16.959> I<00:03:17.260> didn't<00:03:17.980> want

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.770 
I said slightly damp hair I didn't want
to<00:03:18.250> make<00:03:18.370> my<00:03:18.549> hair<00:03:18.760> wet<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.390> didn't<00:03:19.599> have<00:03:19.750> the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
to make my hair wet and didn't have the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.619 
to make my hair wet and didn't have the
pilot<00:03:20.200> clump<00:03:20.530> up<00:03:20.769> on<00:03:21.069> my<00:03:21.310> hair<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.659> not
