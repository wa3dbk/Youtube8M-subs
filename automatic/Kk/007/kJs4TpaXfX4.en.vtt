this side now I experienced the same
thing<00:04:06.659> and<00:04:06.959> I<00:04:07.590> replaced<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.250> with<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.489> new<00:04:08.819> board

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
thing and I replaced it with a new board

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.589 
thing and I replaced it with a new board
and<00:04:09.470> everything<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.829> back<00:04:11.009> to<00:04:11.250> normal<00:04:11.669> so<00:04:12.389> that

and everything is back to normal so that

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.990 
and everything is back to normal so that
proves<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.259> me<00:04:13.439> that<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:14.129> service<00:04:14.459> manual<00:04:14.849> was

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
proves to me that the service manual was

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.390 
proves to me that the service manual was
correct<00:04:15.509> in<00:04:15.810> stating<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:16.889> it<00:04:17.099> was<00:04:17.220> this

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
correct in stating that it was this

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.360 
correct in stating that it was this
board<00:04:17.789> okay<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:19.650> again<00:04:19.949> when<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.190> disconnect

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
board okay so again when you disconnect

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.700 
board okay so again when you disconnect
it<00:04:20.789> it<00:04:21.120> will<00:04:21.239> get<00:04:21.359> six<00:04:21.690> blinking<00:04:22.200> lights<00:04:22.440> now

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
it it will get six blinking lights now

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.969 
it it will get six blinking lights now
so<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:23.430> replace<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.120> board<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:24.840> just<00:04:25.500> unclip

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
so I replace this board you just unclip

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.980 
so I replace this board you just unclip
these<00:04:26.130> ribbons<00:04:26.550> these<00:04:26.789> things<00:04:27.029> slide<00:04:27.389> out<00:04:27.659> and

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
these ribbons these things slide out and

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.480 
these ribbons these things slide out and
then<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.349> have<00:04:28.469> to<00:04:28.590> reconnect<00:04:29.099> these<00:04:29.279> with

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
then you have to reconnect these with

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.969 
then you have to reconnect these with
two<00:04:29.729> hands<00:04:30.270> one<00:04:30.810> on<00:04:30.930> top<00:04:31.139> one<00:04:31.320> on<00:04:31.380> bottom<00:04:31.440> each

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
two hands one on top one on bottom each

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.070 
two hands one on top one on bottom each
so<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.370> get<00:04:32.550> even<00:04:32.789> connection<00:04:33.479> on<00:04:33.570> top<00:04:33.840> and

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
so you get even connection on top and

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.899 
so you get even connection on top and
then<00:04:34.680> you're<00:04:34.860> good<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.039> go<00:04:35.159> guys<00:04:35.520> I'll<00:04:35.789> have
