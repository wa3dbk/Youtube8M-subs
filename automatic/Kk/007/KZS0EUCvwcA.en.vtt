00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.050
 a new study of the Cologne Institute for Quality and Efficiency in 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.810
 Health care said that when dentures for the rear 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.739
 molars 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:12.619
 a removable denture is as good as an implant 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.920
 All those who soon have to replace their missing molars need Franz 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.640
 what is there 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.009
 definitely do not support this prosthesis Dylan Trini Antonio 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.149
 So far, her thirty-one years fell on one side in the lower jaw 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.069
 already all molars 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:31.580
 March in which the shortened row of teeth 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.550
 but with the removable dentures she is not quite so far 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.749
 could not do it normally anymore with the prosthesis either 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:43.339
 So you know so well from the advertising to force as if the thing was 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:44.340
 also local 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.550
 Food leftovers are so despite the sick you go so they can eat anyway 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.220
 Do not order what you want because you can drive otherwise 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.880
 With that you'll have to get down the first quarter yet had a platform 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.710
 and there is no danger of taking and washing 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.890
 Now she has opted for implants 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.700
 And so it is growing in the market for implants 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.530
 their commitment has tripled in the last decade they are one 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.080
 seemingly perfect replacement for lost single teeth 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 a stable anchor for part and full time Heesen 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.310
 the conditions for implants are ideal for her the jawbone is thick 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.290
 enough of the facial nerves far enough away ounces are affordable too 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.140
 Telescope her supplies with grenades model Ghost plate 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.560
 is the price of effort as certainly as expensive as now 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.050
 a supply 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.880
 the bridge with second quarter 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.640
 In the case of our patients, healthy teeth would have been ground 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.050
 where they would not have had a worse survival rate than now where they are healthy 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.010
 stay 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.030
 and to bite Germany Finland Spain really the right choice 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.900
 met 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.380
 The success story of the implants has gotten a damper 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.869
 the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.819
 was recently commissioned implant-supported dentures with 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.879
 to compare removable dentures 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.439
 a literature review that only one of many bitten and behaved 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:23.849
 namely the shortened teeth so missing molars like Weiland 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.439
 Rania Antonio m 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.040
 Pekovic comes despite green study situation and outdated sources to the result 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.709
 Implant-supported dentures offer no additional benefit 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.700
 Professor Joachim Becker from the University Dental Clinic Dusseldorf can 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.499
 do not understand this result 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.609
 in this study, not only are they free 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.139
 LN situation today patient page numbers Brecht's teeth were missing 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.149
 then a feud associated with a missing and you can tell from it already 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.930
 This is 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.619
 is incredibly difficult 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.109
 to study a torture 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.419
 scientific 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:02:59.939
 To make data 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.519
 where one refers only to studies » 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.519
 the Reka Cordes has gained quite practical experience 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.939
 For 30 years she had a free floating bridge in her mouth 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.959
 broken together with the holder tooth despite bone buildup and long 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.709
 She has opted for implants for the treatment tent that is now 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.279
 three years ago 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.470
 what is it 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.880
 as if I had my own teeth in my mouth it is not a comparison to that 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.370
 Darrell's beautiful bridge it's an absolute 4% spectrum percent 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.560
 the quality of life is much higher, but in my situation where 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.399
 Heller of the grape 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:41.129
 APA jamming and percent hiking she had to dig up again and again 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.039
 percent 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:46.529
 You do not have that all SN It's like they do not have their own anymore 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:48.419
 covered there not more about it 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.150
 Nevertheless, there is a problem regarding the long term durability of a product 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:55.149
 Implant concerns 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.989
 the topics for the future is this is one in Canada 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.819
 and gum disease can also give periodontal disease 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.809
 that is the implant is solid 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.479
 «The patient needs Prof 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.369
 but of course we are not missing 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.979
 There may also be Luton in the implants 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:13.689
 that happens on that scientific studies must first clarify 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:17.699
 crucial to the long-term success of an implant treatment 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.400
 the strength of the jawbone the quality of the physician and the implants
