00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.830
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.270
 that you're fine 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.400
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.930
 new video on gta 5 pc for you 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.730
 show a new really nice mode 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.770
 but who is speaking I think especially of 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.610
 people who do the stunt so the mode 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.110
 ghost town 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.360
 in parentheses will allow you 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.710
 to be the only survivor if I can say 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.500
 in the city no other vehicle 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.239
 motorcycle car or even pedestrians do not spawn 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.980
 rats and that's why I told you 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.720
 that this mode will mostly serve hunter 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.220
 everyone has already had during a 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.019
 figure a car coming out of 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.030
 anywhere for you get in 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.920
 and there with this mode it's over and that I 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.479
 find that it's really cool after the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.949
 only small negative point that there is so 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.440
 is that there is no key to 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.699
 enable or disable mode so soon 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.570
 that he is installed in the game the city 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.250
 becomes deserted 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.049
 and if you ever want to come back to the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.250
 population and respect 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.260
 vehicles or pedestrians 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.240
 all you have to do is delete 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.500
 the mode in the game files and I 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.360
 think it's the only small point 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.760
 negative that there is not a touch 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.900
 to enable or disable the mode otherwise 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.130
 frankly it's a good little fashion 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.790
 as his name indicated to make a 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.710
 ghost town 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.240
 then I put the link of 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.070
 this mode in the description if ever 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.049
 you want to use it you can 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.700
 download but after attention of 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.799
 preferably use this mode 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.170
 in story mode and not in online mode 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.429
 story of not being spotted and 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.630
 So here we come to the end of this 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.049
 video I really hope she will you 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.759
 will have pleased 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.960
 do not hesitate to drop a little thumb 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.789
 blue if so and subscribe 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.109
 if it's not already done, I flew 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.460
 it is on these images I tell you all 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.460
