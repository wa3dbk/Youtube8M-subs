six of this year so my hair is not that
long<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:51.000> still<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> TWA<00:01:51.990> stage<00:01:52.670> it's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
long is still in the TWA stage it's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.550 
long is still in the TWA stage it's
probably<00:01:53.939> about<00:01:54.060> four<00:01:54.600> four<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.530> half

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
probably about four four and a half

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.359 
probably about four four and a half
inches<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:58.500> long<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.040> hair

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
inches so it's not as long as this hair

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.280 
inches so it's not as long as this hair
but<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.700> does<00:01:59.909> blend<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.450> well<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
but it does blend really well with it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.690 
but it does blend really well with it
i'll<00:02:02.219> try<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.490> get<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> closer<00:02:03.149> view<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.700> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
i'll try to get a closer view of it so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.960 
i'll try to get a closer view of it so
that<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.360> see<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
that you can see the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.210 
that you can see the
here<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:08.200> is<00:02:08.350> kind<00:02:08.560> of<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.740> pattern<00:02:09.100> a

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
here this is kind of the pattern a

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.940 
here this is kind of the pattern a
little<00:02:09.520> loosen<00:02:09.970> like<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.420> little<00:02:10.630> looser<00:02:10.950> when

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
little loosen like a little looser when

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.830 
little loosen like a little looser when
you<00:02:12.070> wash<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.820> does<00:02:13.090> get<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.450> little<00:02:13.600> bit

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
you wash it it does get a little bit

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.010 
you wash it it does get a little bit
tighter<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.640> when<00:02:16.000> it's<00:02:16.150> wet<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.780> little

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
tighter and when it's wet it's a little

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.020 
tighter and when it's wet it's a little
bit<00:02:17.140> longer<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.920> kind<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.220> stretches<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> little

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
bit longer it kind of stretches a little

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.290 
bit longer it kind of stretches a little
bit<00:02:19.120> longer<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.770> mean<00:02:21.550> if<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.790> want<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.150> to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
bit longer so I mean if you want it to

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.540 
bit longer so I mean if you want it to
look<00:02:22.480> longer<00:02:22.900> than<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:23.950> like<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.100> 16

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
look longer than this this is like a 16

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.840 
look longer than this this is like a 16
18<00:02:25.000> two<00:02:25.270> bundles<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.840> 16<00:02:26.170> 18<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.250> if<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.550> want

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
18 two bundles of 16 18 so if you want

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.120 
18 two bundles of 16 18 so if you want
it<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.120> look<00:02:28.270> longer<00:02:28.720> than<00:02:29.050> this<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.740> may<00:02:29.890> want

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
it to look longer than this you may want

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.370 
it to look longer than this you may want
to<00:02:30.190> do<00:02:30.370> like<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.790> two<00:02:31.090> strand<00:02:31.330> twist<00:02:31.660> on<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:31.870> dry

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
to do like a two strand twist on it dry

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.120 
to do like a two strand twist on it dry
or<00:02:32.410> something<00:02:33.190> or<00:02:33.840> do<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> blowout<00:02:35.500> on<00:02:35.920> it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
or something or do like a blowout on it

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.340 
or something or do like a blowout on it
and<00:02:36.250> then<00:02:36.370> do<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.700> two<00:02:36.850> strand<00:02:37.150> twists<00:02:37.600> and

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
and then do the two strand twists and

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.570 
and then do the two strand twists and
then<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.590> will<00:02:38.680> probably<00:02:38.890> look<00:02:39.100> it's<00:02:39.280> true

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
then it will probably look it's true

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.910 
then it will probably look it's true
length<00:02:39.850> but<00:02:40.450> when<00:02:40.630> it's<00:02:40.780> dry<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.380> it's<00:02:41.709> like

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
length but when it's dry and it's like

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.890 
length but when it's dry and it's like
this<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.520> comes<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:43.120> little<00:02:43.330> bit<00:02:43.660> past

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
this it comes a little bit past

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.360 
this it comes a little bit past
collarbone<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.860> little<00:02:45.850> bit<00:02:46.350> past<00:02:47.350> like<00:02:48.220> it

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
collarbone a little bit past like it

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.090 
collarbone a little bit past like it
comes<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.730> about<00:02:48.880> right<00:02:48.940> here<00:02:49.209> o<00:02:49.570> of<00:02:49.780> me<00:02:50.100> when

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
comes to about right here o of me when

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.340 
comes to about right here o of me when
it's<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.670> state<00:02:52.000> when<00:02:52.630> it's<00:02:52.810> wet<00:02:53.080> it

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
it's in this state when it's wet it

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.520 
it's in this state when it's wet it
comes<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.950> about<00:02:54.780> maybe<00:02:55.780> like<00:02:56.050> about<00:02:56.320> right

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
comes to about maybe like about right
