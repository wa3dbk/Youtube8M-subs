00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.930 
timeout but didn't take away my
challenge<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.800> i<00:02:17.100> think<00:02:17.400> they<00:02:17.550> kind<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.819> knew

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
challenge so i think they kind of knew

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
challenge so i think they kind of knew
that<00:02:18.090> there<00:02:18.180> was<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> situation<00:02:18.510> here<00:02:18.870> they

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
weren't sure on and tried to make it as

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.610 
weren't sure on and tried to make it as
best<00:02:20.550> they<00:02:20.670> could<00:02:20.880> from<00:02:21.690> your<00:02:21.870> vantage<00:02:21.930> point

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
