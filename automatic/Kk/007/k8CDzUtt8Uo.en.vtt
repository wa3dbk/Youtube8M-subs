do stick off this bottom in and take the
wire<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.360> slide<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.900> right<00:01:03.930> through<00:01:04.110> there

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.200 

take<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.650> point

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
take this point

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.310 
take this point
and<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> point<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.290> pierce<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
and the point is going to pierce the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.470 
and the point is going to pierce the
insulation<00:01:14.240> snug<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.270> down<00:01:15.450> nice<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:15.960> tight

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
insulation snug that down nice and tight

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:24.359 
insulation snug that down nice and tight
same<00:01:18.480> thing<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> second<00:01:19.290> one

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.050 

sure<00:01:24.939> let<00:01:25.119> fight<00:01:25.390> one<00:01:25.600> more<00:01:25.780> time

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:37.830 

we<00:01:29.939> put<00:01:30.939> that<00:01:31.060> down<00:01:31.119> right<00:01:31.299> over<00:01:31.600> top<00:01:31.780> of<00:01:31.840> it

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.240 

okay<00:01:38.549> now<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.909> get<00:01:40.060> these<00:01:40.240> two<00:01:40.479> wires<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:41.250> I'm

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
okay now to get these two wires in I'm

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.980 
okay now to get these two wires in I'm
going<00:01:42.399> to<00:01:42.460> loosen<00:01:42.670> these<00:01:42.880> up<00:01:42.939> these<00:01:43.390> caps<00:01:43.689> up

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
going to loosen these up these caps up

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.460 
going to loosen these up these caps up
I'll<00:01:44.470> take<00:01:44.680> one<00:01:44.890> off<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:50.020> they<00:01:50.110> can<00:01:50.259> see

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
I'll take one off so they can see

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.600 
I'll take one off so they can see
there's<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.770> pin<00:01:51.039> down<00:01:51.250> inside<00:01:51.640> there<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:54.220> wire

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
there's a pin down inside there the wire

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.010 
there's a pin down inside there the wire
will<00:01:54.759> go<00:01:54.789> down<00:01:55.030> inside<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.659> then<00:01:55.780> we're<00:01:55.929> going

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
will go down inside and then we're going

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.410 
will go down inside and then we're going
to<00:01:56.110> shut<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:57.280> tighten<00:01:57.700> this<00:01:57.789> down<00:01:57.850> on<00:01:58.210> it's

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
to shut and tighten this down on it's

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.859 
to shut and tighten this down on it's
going<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.659> secure<00:01:59.049> so<00:02:03.270> doesn't<00:02:04.270> matter<00:02:04.600> what

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
going to secure so doesn't matter what

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.870 
going to secure so doesn't matter what
doesn't<00:02:05.799> go<00:02:05.920> in<00:02:06.100> put<00:02:06.369> in<00:02:06.520> no<00:02:06.729> does<00:02:06.970> not<00:02:07.179> matter

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
doesn't go in put in no does not matter

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.240 
doesn't go in put in no does not matter
hopefully<00:02:09.880> down<00:02:10.149> in<00:02:10.390> there<00:02:10.680> kind<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.799> feel

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
hopefully down in there kind of feel

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.800 
hopefully down in there kind of feel
