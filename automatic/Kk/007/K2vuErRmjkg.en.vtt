which are not quite as enthralling at
least<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.470> my<00:00:25.619> opinion<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.550> hope<00:00:27.359> you'll<00:00:27.510> check

out<00:00:27.900> my<00:00:28.140> my<00:00:28.890> discussion<00:00:29.880> about<00:00:30.090> what<00:00:30.599> seems<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
out my my discussion about what seems to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.130 
out my my discussion about what seems to
be<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.380> hinted<00:00:31.949> romance<00:00:32.430> between<00:00:32.840> Bruce<00:00:33.840> Wayne

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
be a hinted romance between Bruce Wayne

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.959 
be a hinted romance between Bruce Wayne
and<00:00:34.410> Diana<00:00:34.680> Prince<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.399> photo

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and Diana Prince in that photo

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.639 
and Diana Prince in that photo
but<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> things<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.050> liked<00:00:37.290> about<00:00:37.380> it

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
but one of the things I liked about it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.110 
but one of the things I liked about it
so<00:00:37.770> much<00:00:37.950> was<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.399> really<00:00:38.610> were<00:00:38.820> called

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so much was that it really were called

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.569 
so much was that it really were called
the<00:00:39.690> DC<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.440> many<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.860> us<00:00:40.950> fell<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.340> love<00:00:41.460> with

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the DC that many of us fell in love with

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.299 
the DC that many of us fell in love with
in<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> first<00:00:42.090> place<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.660> missed<00:00:43.040> with<00:00:44.040> not

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
in the first place and I missed with not

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.479 
in the first place and I missed with not
only<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> movies<00:00:45.090> but<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.660> new<00:00:45.870> 52<00:00:46.340> for<00:00:47.340> some

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
only the movies but the new 52 for some

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.940 
only the movies but the new 52 for some
reason<00:00:47.850> DC<00:00:48.780> was<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.620> what'll<00:00:49.860> make

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
reason DC was like you know what'll make

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.590 
reason DC was like you know what'll make
people<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.489> our<00:00:50.640> comics<00:00:51.030> again<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.480> we

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
people like our comics again if we

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.229 
people like our comics again if we
totally<00:00:52.079> change<00:00:52.410> them<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
totally change them but I think that it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.200 
totally change them but I think that it
just<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.260> alienated<00:00:56.210> viewers

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
just you know really alienated viewers

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.580 
just you know really alienated viewers
to<00:00:57.570> an<00:00:57.660> extent<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.800> anyway<00:00:59.129> these<00:00:59.579> new<00:00:59.910> photos

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
to an extent but anyway these new photos

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.280 
to an extent but anyway these new photos
are<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.649> little<00:01:01.920> new<00:01:02.190> 52<00:01:02.670> ish<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.390> my<00:01:03.600> opinion<00:01:04.110> uh

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
are a little new 52 ish in my opinion uh

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.890 
are a little new 52 ish in my opinion uh
let's<00:01:05.159> start<00:01:05.339> with<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> cover<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.510> think

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
let's start with the cover here I think

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
let's start with the cover here I think
that<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.159> recently<00:01:08.369> talked<00:01:08.760> about

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
that we we just recently talked about

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.690 
that we we just recently talked about
how<00:01:09.119> wonderful<00:01:09.470> Wonder<00:01:10.470> Woman's<00:01:10.830> costume<00:01:11.400> is

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
how wonderful Wonder Woman's costume is

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.380 
how wonderful Wonder Woman's costume is
the<00:01:12.689> detail<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.500> authenticity<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.270> was

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the detail the authenticity that it was

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
the detail the authenticity that it was
really<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> best<00:01:15.900> costume<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> three<00:01:17.040> but

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
really the best costume of the three but

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.359 
really the best costume of the three but
then<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.630> cover<00:01:18.869> and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
on or the skort or whatever has like a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.780 
on or the skort or whatever has like a
blue<00:01:24.750> glitter<00:01:25.140> enos<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.369> sudden

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
blue glitter enos to it all of a sudden

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.520 
blue glitter enos to it all of a sudden
and<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.659> where<00:01:27.960> did<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.140> come

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
and it's just like where did that come

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.880 
and it's just like where did that come
from

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
from

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.590 
from
I<00:01:29.070> don't<00:01:29.520> think<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.909> Wonder<00:01:30.180> Woman<00:01:30.479> would

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
I don't think that Wonder Woman would

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.569 
I don't think that Wonder Woman would
wear<00:01:30.810> glitter<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.619> know<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> mean<00:01:32.159> maybe<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
wear glitter you know I mean maybe it

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.620 
wear glitter you know I mean maybe it
might<00:01:32.759> make<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.479> little<00:01:33.630> more<00:01:34.189> likable<00:01:35.189> for

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
might make it a little more likable for

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.840 
might make it a little more likable for
some<00:01:36.630> some<00:01:37.110> fans<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.710> non<00:01:37.860> comic-book<00:01:38.310> fans<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
some some fans or non comic-book fans I

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.060 
some some fans or non comic-book fans I
think<00:01:38.880> specifically<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.650> such<00:01:40.890> an

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
think specifically but it's just such an

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.039 
think specifically but it's just such an
odd<00:01:41.250> choice<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.030> seems<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.299> fly<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> face

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
odd choice and seems to fly in the face

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.810 
odd choice and seems to fly in the face
of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.409> seriousness<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.250> somebody<00:01:44.640> had

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
of the seriousness that somebody had

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.850 
of the seriousness that somebody had
been<00:01:44.939> applauding<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.869> know<00:01:45.990> us<00:01:46.259> included

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
been applauding and you know us included

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.039 
been applauding and you know us included
I<00:01:47.040> guess<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.909> supposed<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.210> mimic<00:01:48.450> maybe<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
I guess it's supposed to mimic maybe the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.380 
I guess it's supposed to mimic maybe the
glitter<00:01:49.320> enos<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.890> maybe<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
glitter enos of maybe it's just the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.600 
glitter enos of maybe it's just the
lighting<00:01:51.659> because<00:01:52.140> Batman<00:01:52.439> looks<00:01:52.860> kind<00:01:53.549> of

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
lighting because Batman looks kind of

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.240 
lighting because Batman looks kind of
shiny<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.689> does<00:01:54.840> Superman<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:56.040> with

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
shiny and so does Superman but with

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.730 
shiny and so does Superman but with
wonder<00:01:56.549> what<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.820> particular<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:58.469> don't

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
wonder what in particular I just don't

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.289 
wonder what in particular I just don't
think<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> costume<00:01:59.610> should<00:01:59.759> do<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.210> any

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
think the costume should do that in any

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.560 
think the costume should do that in any
light<00:02:00.619> because<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.490> seems<00:02:02.790> more<00:02:03.210> cosplay

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
light because it just seems more cosplay

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.550 
again which is nice because the filter
they<00:02:15.400> debuted<00:02:15.970> with<00:02:16.090> wasn't<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:17.019> flattering

they debuted with wasn't so flattering

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.949

gadot I would have put her in a way if

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.129 
gadot I would have put her in a way if
necessary<00:03:13.030> although<00:03:13.269> that<00:03:13.450> looks<00:03:13.689> kind<00:03:14.019> of

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
necessary although that looks kind of

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.470 
necessary although that looks kind of
wig<00:03:14.349> like<00:03:14.650> but<00:03:15.609> you<00:03:15.730> know<00:03:15.760> her<00:03:15.939> hair<00:03:16.120> has<00:03:16.299> to

look really good in this movie and I

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.970 
look really good in this movie and I
think<00:03:19.269> she<00:03:19.510> needs<00:03:19.629> a<00:03:19.780> copious<00:03:20.319> amount<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.859> it

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
think she needs a copious amount of it

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.710 
think she needs a copious amount of it
and<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.459> needs<00:03:21.639> to<00:03:21.819> kind<00:03:21.940> of<00:03:22.120> stay<00:03:22.269> together<00:03:22.449> I

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
and it needs to kind of stay together I

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.150 
and it needs to kind of stay together I
mean<00:03:22.959> she's<00:03:23.139> not<00:03:23.260> doing<00:03:23.650> like<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.799> Linda

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
mean she's not doing like a Linda

but this one I think that they have to
be<00:05:11.380> so<00:05:11.620> careful<00:05:11.950> that<00:05:12.160> doesn't<00:05:12.610> look<00:05:12.670> like

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
be so careful that doesn't look like

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
version of Mark Zuckerberg because that

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.430 
version of Mark Zuckerberg because that

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
comfortable he looks standing there that

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.490 
comfortable he looks standing there that
it<00:06:31.000> is<00:06:31.030> although<00:06:31.510> maybe<00:06:31.690> his<00:06:31.900> Lex<00:06:32.110> Luthor<00:06:32.410> is

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
it is although maybe his Lex Luthor is

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.680 
it is although maybe his Lex Luthor is
comfortable<00:06:33.010> wherever<00:06:33.430> he<00:06:33.610> goes<00:06:33.790> he<00:06:33.820> owns<00:06:34.360> the

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
comfortable wherever he goes he owns the

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.450 
comfortable wherever he goes he owns the
room<00:06:34.870> I<00:06:35.200> would<00:06:35.710> hope<00:06:35.860> that<00:06:35.890> would<00:06:36.190> maybe<00:06:36.310> be

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
room I would hope that would maybe be

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.850 
room I would hope that would maybe be

don't think any of us want to see a Lex

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:18.269 
don't think any of us want to see a Lex
Luthor<00:07:16.990> that<00:07:17.020> has<00:07:17.229> to<00:07:17.379> continually<00:07:17.830> tuck<00:07:18.129> his

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:18.279 
Luthor that has to continually tuck his

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:20.580 
Luthor that has to continually tuck his
hair<00:07:18.460> behind<00:07:18.639> his<00:07:18.969> ears<00:07:19.150> right<00:07:19.479> all<00:07:20.139> right<00:07:20.349> I

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590 
hair behind his ears right all right I

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.050 
hair behind his ears right all right I
don't<00:07:20.710> really<00:07:21.039> think<00:07:21.129> that's<00:07:21.490> what<00:07:21.639> we're

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
don't really think that's what we're

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.839 
don't really think that's what we're
interested<00:07:22.300> in<00:07:22.680> so<00:07:23.680> this<00:07:24.039> is<00:07:24.219> a<00:07:24.250> little<00:07:24.550> I

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:24.849 
interested in so this is a little I

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:26.399 
interested in so this is a little I
guess<00:07:25.120> it's<00:07:25.300> good<00:07:25.509> because<00:07:25.870> it'll<00:07:25.990> keep<00:07:26.199> our

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:26.409 
guess it's good because it'll keep our

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:28.230 
guess it's good because it'll keep our
expectations<00:07:27.099> manageable<00:07:27.819> and<00:07:28.029> then

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 
expectations manageable and then

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.490 
expectations manageable and then
hopefully<00:07:28.569> the<00:07:28.659> movie<00:07:28.900> will<00:07:29.020> just<00:07:29.199> blow<00:07:29.349> us

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.500 
hopefully the movie will just blow us

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.050 
hopefully the movie will just blow us
out<00:07:29.620> of<00:07:29.680> the<00:07:29.800> water<00:07:30.009> because<00:07:30.310> it's<00:07:30.460> so<00:07:30.550> amazing

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
out of the water because it's so amazing

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.850
