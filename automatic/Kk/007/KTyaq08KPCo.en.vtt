00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.950

 Chilean I slept 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.650
 it was a pretty rough day but the 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.019
 descent at the end of the day was 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.280

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.170

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.080
 So put me there landed a little while 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.520

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:43.180
 this change finally the last day 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.340
 gp 90 kilometers to get me up 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.050
 the laguna verde 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.260
 it was really good at first there 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.490
 had room and then on the end the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.770
 road and that it reflects so it's a 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.900
 way with earth is enough 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.730
 horrible I got there they were starting 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.250
 lightly raining with a heavy wind 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.660
 face but the refuge of laguna verde 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.820
 was really excellent there was a 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.520
 term inside the refuge 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:16.000
 and then I left for the 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:19.570
 Moulaye hut it was really horrible 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.290
 the bike pushes with with a lot of 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.840
 you in all 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.709
 I had I think about fifty 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.750
 kilos including 25 kg of fleet and I 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.569
 transported all this in two trips so 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.430
 I had to make the returns I spent the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.430
 evening at the shelter binds us 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.799
 refuge universidad d atacama 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:54.310
 the mountain is really very snowy 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.889
 kind we are giant dgc various bolivian 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.629
 I think they call it and the morning 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:01.750
 it's nice in the afternoon it's a 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.519
 horror and wind of unimaginable and the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.290
 mountain is very engaged more than that 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:10.780
 I was hoping and suddenly it makes 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.159
 the climb very very complicated and a 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.459
 group of Bolivians I believe they 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.470
 were three guides and a client they 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.220
 have put thirteen hours for the climb and 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.620
 10 hours for the descent 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.289
 23 + 23 hours of effort it's just 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.780
 it's just madness 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.250
 so I pretty much abandoned the idea of 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.160
 go up in water 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:39.639
 now the goal is to arrive in 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.960
 rise only and then there are my 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.699
 shoes that make me a little scared because 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.340
 that I see everyone with 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.409
 huge shoes and then it's true that 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.550
 the mountain is going to be cold and I like 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.090
 really small shoes I have not 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:56.919
 managed to rent something else so I hope 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:59.229
 that I can but I toes them and 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.780
 then here is normally I should I 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:07.000
 should climb in two 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:10.930
 three days it's going to be a big challenge 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.800
 Big big challenge claw I'm not 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.130
 sure to get to the so I hope it's okay 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.130
 go well 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.909
 I'm a refuge terros I arrived 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.400
 around 4 hours 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:04.610
 and then tomorrow is the big day 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.310
 it's climbing there are two teams that 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.150
 are mounted today they are 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.729
 arrested on the part placed after 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:18.139
 way too much snow apparently so 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:20.539
 not tomorrow I'll go see and then 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.669
 well as soon as it's more urgent mat 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.409
 whatever happens I'm going to beat my 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.300
 altitude record so it will always be 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.529
 it 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.699
 I will show you a little 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:32.229
 refuge because it's still 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:36.650
 class I'm all alone in there so 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:41.240
 so that's where I'm going to sleep 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.889
 that's all business for tomorrow and 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.099
 then we will go gently towards 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.099
 cooked 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.820
 we are not there as you see I am in 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.570
 train to do snow melt I 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:05.200
 went to look next there that makes 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:08.030
 well five minutes that's in the process of 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:12.140
 melt and I just realized 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.700
 that someone kindly left 12 liters 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.270
 of water whose refuge so I 'm getting 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.270
 shit for nothing
