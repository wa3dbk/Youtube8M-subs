distribution<00:01:06.450> your<00:01:07.320> nose<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.979> your<00:01:08.250> first

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
distribution your nose is your first

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.719 
distribution your nose is your first
line<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.270> immune<00:01:09.689> defense<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:11.220> very

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
line of immune defense and is very

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.700 
line of immune defense and is very
important<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.570> creating<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> pressure

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
important in creating the pressure

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.070 
important in creating the pressure
difference<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.180> allows<00:01:15.479> for<00:01:15.840> maximum

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
difference that allows for maximum

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.100 
difference that allows for maximum
oxygen<00:01:16.680> uptake<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:18.060> creation<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> nitric

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
oxygen uptake the creation of nitric

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.530 
oxygen uptake the creation of nitric
oxide<00:01:19.140> which<00:01:19.979> also<00:01:20.280> helps<00:01:20.790> oxygenate<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
oxide which also helps oxygenate the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.300 
oxide which also helps oxygenate the
body<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.500> much<00:01:22.680> more<00:01:22.890> efficient

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
body it's just a much more efficient

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.120 
body it's just a much more efficient
exchange<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.939> oxygen<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.570> carbon<00:01:24.630> dioxide<00:01:25.170> so

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.890 
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide so
there's<00:01:26.340> three<00:01:26.820> good<00:01:26.970> reasons<00:01:27.030> right<00:01:27.630> there

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
there's three good reasons right there

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.840 
there's three good reasons right there
it's<00:01:28.170> estimated<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.799> breathe<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.189> about<00:01:29.430> 20

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it's estimated we breathe in about 20

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.289 
it's estimated we breathe in about 20
billion<00:01:30.650> foreign<00:01:31.650> particles<00:01:32.250> every<00:01:32.640> day<00:01:32.820> so

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
billion foreign particles every day so

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.340 
billion foreign particles every day so
if<00:01:33.420> you're<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.720> breathing<00:01:34.140> through<00:01:34.320> your

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
if you're not breathing through your

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.730 
if you're not breathing through your
nose

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
nose

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.770

you're<00:01:34.950> completely<00:01:35.250> bypassing<00:01:36.240> your<00:01:36.360> first

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you're completely bypassing your first

line of immune defense you are a city

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.370 
line of immune defense you are a city
with<00:01:39.240> no<00:01:39.810> walls

you<00:01:40.799> are<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:41.850> very<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.299> vulnerable<00:01:42.840> you

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you are just very very vulnerable you

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.460 
you are just very very vulnerable you
get<00:01:43.500> about<00:01:43.680> 10<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:44.369> 20<00:01:44.729> percent<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:45.720> oxygen

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
get about 10 to 20 percent more oxygen

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.740 
get about 10 to 20 percent more oxygen
in<00:01:46.649> every<00:01:47.070> breath<00:01:47.329> multiply<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.509> by<00:01:48.570> about

a teenage boy I wasn't fat but I was a

stronger<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.430> sucked<00:02:30.819> in<00:02:31.000> my<00:02:31.120> belly<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.720> I

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
stronger so I sucked in my belly and I

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.930 
stronger so I sucked in my belly and I
puffed<00:02:32.500> out<00:02:32.680> my<00:02:32.860> chest<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.520> started<00:02:33.820> using

puffed out my chest and I started using

puffed out my chest and I started using
all<00:02:34.209> my<00:02:34.360> auxilary<00:02:34.750> breathing<00:02:35.290> muscles

breathing shallow chest breaths and I

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.140 
breathing shallow chest breaths and I
think<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.310> contributes<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:39.880> lot<00:02:39.940> of

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
think that that contributes to a lot of

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.410 
think that that contributes to a lot of
tension<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.019> upper<00:02:41.140> back<00:02:41.709> can<00:02:42.519> lead<00:02:43.300> to

tension in the upper back can lead to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.080 
tension in the upper back can lead to

in oxygen carrying capacity I found that

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.689 
in oxygen carrying capacity I found that
it's<00:04:44.930> best<00:04:45.139> done<00:04:45.380> in<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.800> morning<00:04:46.190> on<00:04:46.310> an

empty stomach because literally anything

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.040 
empty stomach because literally anything
that<00:04:49.160> requires<00:04:49.639> oxygen<00:04:49.940> in<00:04:50.539> the<00:04:50.630> body<00:04:50.810> even

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
that requires oxygen in the body even

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.439 
that requires oxygen in the body even
the<00:04:51.349> peristaltic<00:04:51.979> movement<00:04:52.759> of<00:04:52.940> like<00:04:53.210> the

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
the peristaltic movement of like the

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.480 
the peristaltic movement of like the
stomach<00:04:54.289> and<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.500> intestines<00:04:55.130> when<00:04:55.310> there's

stomach and the intestines when there's

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.140 
stomach and the intestines when there's
food<00:04:55.729> inside<00:04:56.229> takes<00:04:57.229> up<00:04:57.470> oxygen<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:58.310> reduces

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
food inside takes up oxygen and reduces

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.170

from your your breath holding abilities
so<00:05:02.479> I<00:05:02.509> like<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.810> do<00:05:03.110> one<00:05:03.470> minute<00:05:03.860> slow

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490
