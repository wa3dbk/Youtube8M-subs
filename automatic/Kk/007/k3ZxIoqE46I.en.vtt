Hello hairy people, my name is Jake and I am a body shaver.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.780
I started growing hair when I was very young about

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.640
13 years old it was tragic at that point.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.100
But I realized that very soon that I needed to keep all of this groomed.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.820
I get it. You have a lot of hair. You don't want it all the time. It's not always winter

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.140
You want to take some of that off.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.220
So today I'm going to show you a little bit about how to shave your back

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.500
probably one of the most difficult places to shave on the entire body.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.320
The first thing that you want to do is get an assistant

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.540
somebody you really trust maybe your best friend make sure that it's somebody you're very comfortable with.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.700
Today I'm bringing along my friend Danielle.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.840
Hey guys

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.440
Very comfortable with Danielle today she's gonna be shaving my back

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.000
If you have any long hairs

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.369
Maybe it's been a while since you shaved you're gonna want to trim.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.340
I prefer to use the Gillette STYLER but make sure that you use whatever tool you're most comfortable with.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.560
Now you want to get your back hair nice and hydrated

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.600
It'll make the shave a lot more comfortable and will make the razor glide a lot smoother

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.340
After we wet our hair, we're gonna apply some gel back there.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.759
Now I use this gel because it'll make shaving a lot more comfortable

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.020
So you don't feel those blades directly on your body.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.660
Now that we have our gel applied, it's time to get going, the main event.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.860
As you're shaving the best way to go in my opinion is to go from the spine out

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.860
and that goes all the way down the back especially the lower back

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.040
where I get this nice little patch I'm very excited to get rid of.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.960
You want to be both comfortable with your body and with your shave

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.700
so afterwards, we're gonna put on some moisturizer.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.780
You don't want a dry itchy back. It would be uncomfortable. So we're gonna go back there

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.620
have your assistant put on some moisturizer on your back. It'll make everything a lot nicer.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.080
So if we want to recap, Step 1: Get an assistant.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.660
Step 2: Trim if you don't usually shave.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.060
Step 3: Wet your hair.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.380
Step 4: Apply shave gel to help soften the hair.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.200
Step 5: Shave with a razor design for your body.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.760
Step 6: Dry and moisturize.

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.659
And there you have it just a few easy steps and you have a nice clean back

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.560
Oh and guys, don't forget to thank your assistant.
