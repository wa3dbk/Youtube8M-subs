00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:15.750
 fabregas is hello to all and to 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.730
 all these monsters too put 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.010
 today in this video I you 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.170
 learn to monetize the use of 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.269
 your ipod iphone or ipad 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.640
 so to do that I introduced you 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.710
 two small applications quickly 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.539
 so first of all at picwic which copy 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.360
 quick actually it's an application that 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.130
 in exchange for response to polls 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.950
 will allow you to win either a 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.629
 paypal transfer of 2 euros or 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.160
 gifts so that's the choice you'll make it to 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.180
 registration and you will be able to 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.670
 edit later 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.440
 so be aware that if you decide to 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.780
 change your mind for example you wanted 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.520
 initially a paypal transfer and that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.600
 do you want gifts and well 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.559
 you can make a change 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 directly so here I already answered 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.880
 to a survey so a poll corresponds 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.350
 visibly at 12% of your goal 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.180
 so here I'm going to proceed to the second 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.010
 just now so there are six questions 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.049
 it takes about three minutes 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.560
 so it's really fast to do 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.210
 very simple and so that's pretty much 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.290
 close everything for this application know 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.330
 as well as if you encounter 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.979
 problems with you can contact them 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.030
 creators via twitter they are very 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.920
 reagents and listened users 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.930
 so if you really have a problem you 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.470
 want to contact they will respond to your 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 Questions 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.750
 so that's it for aupic week 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.579
 then we will spend on absolute 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.360
 free so absolute free actually it's a 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.869
 an application in the same style as 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.680
 this trailer 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.720
 so you actually watch videos 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.299
 and you have a number of points 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.250
 awarded to each video you win 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.390
 also experience by downloading 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.479
 applications 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 so here I see that I am at 290 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.640
 points and level 9 in experience so the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.649
 video clash of clan i can not the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.209
 put back since I already watched but 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.150
 so that's pretty fast on average 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.280
 these ten points by video and an xp 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.689
 every downloaded application that you 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.819
 proposes 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:25.860
 Then you can exchange your 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.510
 number of points against gifts 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.150
 we will say knowing that it is not 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.900
 that gifts there are also two of 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.849
 paypal transfer 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.379
 so it's very simple you have 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.260
 good and credit for example so a 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:40.530
 purchase card for the playstation store 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.510
 from 20 euros worth 4000 points if we 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.950
 wants you can donate too if 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.030
 you want to be a little generous 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.310
 and to do a good deed 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.200
 well you make a good that's all 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.530
 simple you click it costs 5 points and 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.269
 this is donated for example to unicef ​​you 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.680
 can have trips go there must 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.840
 really be lands to have them 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.090
 because for a disneyland holiday its 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.120
 thirty thousand points that must put some 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.189
 time or close you have in others 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.129
 the paypal transfer so 1000 points 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:11.430
 for 5 euros 2000 points to say so 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.170
 it's pretty fast we'll say and that's it 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.700
 can not win a little bit 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.609
 money like that to buy 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.780
 applications or I do not know what 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.209
 you want to buy you buy this 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.590
 that you want so here is so if you 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.599
 do I want to give you my parent code 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.609
 which will allow you to earn 10 points 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.129
 and who will make me earn 10 points too 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.079
 of course that way it will allow you 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.930
 to have a small base of departure and 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.720
 bad is put in the circle of 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.459
 contributors of the absolute free so 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.099
 so that was all for this video 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.599
 I will certainly make you one because 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.949
 that I found other applications 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.479

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.819
 use I'm waiting to see just 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.199
