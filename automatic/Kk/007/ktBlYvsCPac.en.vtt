00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
was just garbage this whole thing

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.350 
was just garbage this whole thing
everything<00:01:54.570> from<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.259> point<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:57.030> very

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
everything from this point to the very

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.819 
everything from this point to the very
very<00:01:57.689> very<00:01:58.140> hand<00:01:58.500> was<00:01:59.329> pretty<00:02:00.329> horrible<00:02:00.829> even

very very hand was pretty horrible even
though<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> thought<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:03.030> match<00:02:03.270> itself<00:02:03.649> while

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
though I thought the match itself while

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.200 
though I thought the match itself while
it<00:02:04.829> was<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.340> look<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.030> might

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
it was going on look like it might

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.089 
it was going on look like it might

simple<00:03:08.239> versus<00:03:08.750> dolph<00:03:08.930> ziggler<00:03:09.020> this<00:03:09.500> was

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
simple versus dolph ziggler this was

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.560 
simple versus dolph ziggler this was
very<00:03:10.250> good<00:03:10.489> i<00:03:10.520> wouldn't<00:03:10.850> call<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.060> great<00:03:11.330> but<00:03:11.540> i

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
very good i wouldn't call it great but i

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.570 
very good i wouldn't call it great but i
would<00:03:11.750> call<00:03:11.959> it<00:03:12.050> very<00:03:12.290> good<00:03:12.530> thing<00:03:13.400> was<00:03:13.550> a

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
would call it very good thing was a

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.949 
would call it very good thing was a
little<00:03:13.730> bit<00:03:13.940> overbooked<00:03:14.360> though<00:03:14.630> i<00:03:14.660> do<00:03:14.870> think

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
little bit overbooked though i do think

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.780 
little bit overbooked though i do think
it<00:03:15.350> probably<00:03:15.800> needed<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.280> be<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.430> little<00:03:16.640> bit

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
it probably needed to be a little bit

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.630 
it probably needed to be a little bit
over<00:03:17.000> both<00:03:17.180> so<00:03:17.510> I'm<00:03:17.720> fine<00:03:18.019> with<00:03:18.170> that

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
over both so I'm fine with that

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.910 
over both so I'm fine with that
literally<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.730> job<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.510> there<00:03:21.019> you<00:03:21.140> go<00:03:21.170> we're

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
literally a job so there you go we're

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.550

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
the Royal Rumble itself which up i would

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
the Royal Rumble itself which up i would
say<00:03:24.769> up<00:03:24.920> until<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.459> very<00:03:25.489> end<00:03:26.620> was<00:03:29.019> okay<00:03:30.019> by

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.810 
see what we've kind of been getting from
our<00:07:08.170> selenium<00:07:08.680> which<00:07:08.770> is<00:07:08.950> very<00:07:09.550> long

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
our selenium which is very long

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.240 
our selenium which is very long
entrances<00:07:10.650> sometimes<00:07:11.650> the<00:07:11.800> entrance<00:07:12.160> is

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
entrances sometimes the entrance is

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.920 
entrances sometimes the entrance is
actually<00:07:12.580> being<00:07:12.730> longer<00:07:12.970> than<00:07:13.120> the<00:07:13.330> matches<00:07:13.720> I

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 
actually being longer than the matches I

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.990 
actually being longer than the matches I
think<00:07:14.680> that<00:07:14.830> would<00:07:14.920> be<00:07:15.040> a<00:07:15.070> mistake<00:07:15.220> personally
