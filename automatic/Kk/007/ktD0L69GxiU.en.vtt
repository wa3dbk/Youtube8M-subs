00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.730
 hello basic tool 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.240
 each nail art master 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.820
 is a case from its quality directly 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.910
 will depend on the result of your work and 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.939
 customer mood if differ by 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.910
 fit and today i will show you 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.689
 main types and tell you about the appointment 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.029
 each of them 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.560
 most brushes have a protective 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.560
 cap will not throw it away 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.829
 then it will be useful to us later, and we 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.059
 the keys will also be stored in this cap 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.350
 after removal before use 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:49.129
 you need to prepare the brush to work it 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:53.039
 need to moisten in water completely 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:56.820
 carefully and then remove excess water 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:01.020
 papercloth vloger to brush 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.439
 was wet but not wet long thin 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.560
 brush is designed to draw 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:11.549
 long longitudinal lines with a brush can 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.210
 work both on your own and on your own 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.490
 customer's finger needs a little bit 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.490
 tilt for convenience 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.810
 notice how we will recruit 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.640
 paint on the brush 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.940
 it is impossible for the paint to reach 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:39.050
 metal brush base for example 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:42.259
 one or two millimeters lower the brush in 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:47.600
 paint to pile was painted with all 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:50.800
 sides as you see me several times 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.800
 repeat these movements 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.420
 then you can remove excess paint about 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.220
 Today I used the usual palette 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.220
 file for papers 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.760
 note that the movement of the brush 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.230
 smooth blur put brush on 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.690
 attach the tip to the coating and without 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.690
 special pressure swipe down 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:34.470
 remind you not to rush 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:36.900
 finger at the same time, we slightly tilt in 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.140
 As a result, we get a smooth 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.690
 longitudinal line after each time 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.120
 rinse the brush and also 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.100
 wet cloth on her if you paint 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.370
 as a result of drawing it falls unevenly 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.990
 do not be discouraged can then slightly 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.210
 a little touch up 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.220
 now try to convey the effect 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.320
 bulk cells for this i will 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.090
 use a contrast color 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.090
 our case is white 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.849
 important when working with this brush do not rush 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.790
 make very smooth movements 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.239
 as you see the brush has hairs 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.599
 which interfere with work 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.120
 his hairs can be gently removed 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.530
 but note that scissors 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.720
 must not be angled 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.069
 perpendicular to the base 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.430
 perpendicular to the hairs of the brush in order 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.430
 so that we have a brush tip 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.430
 sharp little 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.280
 now after trimming the tip 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.879
 brushes I draw the second longitudinal 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.879
 line 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:02.019
 next brush hair she is more 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:05.010
 a short brush is called an nl number 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.930
 six she is meant to hold 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.230
 cross and diagonal lines on 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.040
 client's nails brush is prepared 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.379
 also 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.979
 also we paint as in 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.440
 the previous version of the diagonal 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:24.639
 do not forget to turn 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.009
 customer's finger if the paint on the brush 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:33.009
 ended add 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:38.410
 and we paint and also here I draw 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:40.660
 white paint design hope you now 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.150
 it will be easier to decide on the choice of brush 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.639
 for design all your questions 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.289
 please leave under the video all 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.530
