00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
secrets that lie inside the human body

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.670 
secrets that lie inside the human body
and<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.700> a<00:01:06.729> way<00:01:07.000> of<00:01:07.300> looking<00:01:07.570> inside<00:01:08.290> your

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
and it is a way of looking inside your

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.040 
and it is a way of looking inside your
body<00:01:08.860> that<00:01:09.250> only<00:01:09.880> before<00:01:10.330> doctors<00:01:10.810> have<00:01:10.960> been

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
body that only before doctors have been

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.330 
body that only before doctors have been
able<00:01:11.200> to<00:01:11.320> see<00:01:12.150> because<00:01:13.150> of<00:01:13.500> plastination<00:01:14.500> yeah

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
able to see because of plastination yeah

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.370 
able to see because of plastination yeah
my<00:01:15.550> right<00:01:15.790> yes<00:01:16.420> this<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.080> technique

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
my right yes this is the technique

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.020 
my right yes this is the technique
that's<00:01:17.619> being<00:01:17.830> used<00:01:18.100> we<00:01:18.250> are<00:01:18.399> actually<00:01:18.910> going

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
that's being used we are actually going

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.270 
that's being used we are actually going
to<00:01:19.119> be<00:01:19.180> able<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.540> look<00:01:19.840> at<00:01:20.080> real<00:01:20.649> human<00:01:21.009> bodies

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
to be able to look at real human bodies

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.670 
to be able to look at real human bodies
yes<00:01:21.700> it's<00:01:22.330> a<00:01:22.479> process<00:01:22.869> called<00:01:23.200> polymer

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
yes it's a process called polymer

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.770 
yes it's a process called polymer
impregnation<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:25.119> is<00:01:25.210> a<00:01:25.240> four-part

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
impregnation and it is a four-part

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.680 
impregnation and it is a four-part
process<00:01:25.930> that<00:01:26.619> is<00:01:26.950> non-toxic<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.300> there's<00:01:28.509> no

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
process that is non-toxic and there's no

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.090 
process that is non-toxic and there's no
odors<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.200> it<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.440> every<00:01:29.770> one<00:01:29.920> of<00:01:29.950> the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
odors to it and every one of the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.060 
odors to it and every one of the
specimens<00:01:30.580> will<00:01:31.090> last<00:01:31.300> virtually<00:01:31.899> forever<00:01:32.259> so

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
specimens will last virtually forever so

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.060 
specimens will last virtually forever so
one<00:01:33.310> specimen<00:01:33.759> can<00:01:34.090> educate<00:01:34.720> millions<00:01:35.680> of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
one specimen can educate millions of

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.070 
one specimen can educate millions of
people<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.490> generations<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:37.180> follow<00:01:37.450> what

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
people and generations to follow what

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.840 
people and generations to follow what
what<00:01:38.320> essentially<00:01:38.860> happens<00:01:39.340> in<00:01:39.460> very<00:01:39.670> basic

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
what essentially happens in very basic

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.469 
what essentially happens in very basic
terms<00:01:40.299> is<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:40.630> all<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.440> water<00:01:42.159> in<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:43.120> an

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
terms is that all of the water in in an

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.010 
terms is that all of the water in in an
organism<00:01:43.930> is<00:01:44.229> changed<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:45.360> say<00:01:46.360> silicone<00:01:46.840> or

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
organism is changed to say silicone or

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.350 
organism is changed to say silicone or
something<00:01:47.350> like<00:01:47.470> that<00:01:47.530> yes<00:01:48.460> we<00:01:48.820> use<00:01:49.000> a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
something like that yes we use a

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.570 
something like that yes we use a
four-part<00:01:50.020> process<00:01:50.140> we<00:01:50.740> dissection<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.430> then

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
four-part process we dissection and then

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.130 
four-part process we dissection and then
the<00:01:51.729> second<00:01:52.090> part<00:01:52.180> is<00:01:52.299> that<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.600> put<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.930> in<00:01:53.049> a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
the second part is that you put it in a

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.170 
the second part is that you put it in a
back<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.680> acetone<00:01:54.310> which<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:54.820> kind<00:01:55.000> of<00:01:55.030> like

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
back of acetone which is kind of like

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.120 
back of acetone which is kind of like
nail<00:01:55.299> polish<00:01:55.600> remover<00:01:55.960> oh<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.409> it<00:01:56.500> wicks<00:01:56.770> all

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
nail polish remover oh and it wicks all

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.039 
nail polish remover oh and it wicks all
the<00:01:57.310> water<00:01:57.520> molecules<00:01:58.030> out<00:01:58.299> of<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.540> body<00:01:58.750> and

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
the water molecules out of the body and

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.170 
the water molecules out of the body and
then<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.530> goes<00:01:59.680> into<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.100> second<00:02:00.640> bath<00:02:00.760> and<00:02:01.060> that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
then it goes into a second bath and that

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.640 
then it goes into a second bath and that
is<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.360> liquid<00:02:01.570> polymer<00:02:02.049> that<00:02:02.290> are<00:02:02.439> different

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
is a liquid polymer that are different

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.670 
is a liquid polymer that are different
plastics<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.369> those<00:02:03.850> plastics<00:02:04.780> infuse<00:02:05.350> where

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
plastics and those plastics infuse where

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.590 
plastics and those plastics infuse where
the<00:02:05.799> water<00:02:06.010> model<00:02:06.340> codes<00:02:06.549> were<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:07.450> is

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
the water model codes were so this is

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.479 
the water model codes were so this is
why<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.780> is<00:02:07.960> identical<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.769> what<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.130> was<00:02:09.280> with

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
why it is identical to what it was with

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.430 
why it is identical to what it was with
almost<00:02:09.729> barely<00:02:10.090> any<00:02:10.360> shrinkage<00:02:10.660> at<00:02:10.989> all<00:02:11.170> and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
almost barely any shrinkage at all and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.650 
almost barely any shrinkage at all and
then<00:02:11.920> after<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.730> air<00:02:12.910> dries<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.510> that

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
then after that it air dries and that

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.420 
then after that it air dries and that
takes<00:02:13.870> approximately<00:02:14.470> 18<00:02:14.920> months<00:02:15.220> per

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
takes approximately 18 months per

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.370 
takes approximately 18 months per
specimen<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.680> objects<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:19.170> we're<00:02:20.170> going<00:02:20.260> to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
specimen the objects that we're going to

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.009 
specimen the objects that we're going to
be<00:02:20.470> able<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.890> see<00:02:21.330> how<00:02:22.330> are<00:02:22.480> they<00:02:22.600> going<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.870> be

be able to see how are they going to be

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.340 
be able to see how are they going to be
displayed<00:02:23.380> we<00:02:24.310> have<00:02:24.549> about<00:02:24.760> twenty<00:02:25.350> full-body

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
displayed we have about twenty full-body

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.560 
displayed we have about twenty full-body
specimens<00:02:26.980> from<00:02:27.160> top<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.549> bottom<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.150> each

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
specimens from top to bottom and each

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.390 
specimens from top to bottom and each
one<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.870> those<00:02:28.959> shows<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.709> different

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
one of those shows you a different

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.100 
one of those shows you a different
system<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:30.970> body<00:02:31.090> might<00:02:31.450> be<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.690> internal

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
system of the body might be the internal

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.870 
system of the body might be the internal
organs<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.769> will<00:02:32.920> show<00:02:33.100> you<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.400> heart<00:02:33.640> it

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
organs that will show you the heart it

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.920 
organs that will show you the heart it
might<00:02:34.000> be<00:02:34.120> something<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.480> shows<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
might be something that shows you the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.690 
might be something that shows you the
stomach<00:02:35.440> or<00:02:35.829> it<00:02:35.920> might<00:02:36.070> just<00:02:36.100> show<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.430> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
stomach or it might just show you the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.910 
stomach or it might just show you the
skeletal<00:02:37.510> system<00:02:37.630> or<00:02:37.959> all<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.290> muscles<00:02:38.680> even

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
skeletal system or all the muscles even

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.610 
skeletal system or all the muscles even
the<00:02:39.459> circulatory<00:02:39.970> system<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:41.020> it's<00:02:41.200> divided

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
the circulatory system so it's divided

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.330 
the circulatory system so it's divided
up<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.920> then<00:02:42.040> there

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
up and then there

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.190 
up and then there
about<00:02:42.459> twenty-two<00:02:43.330> hundred<00:02:43.569> additional

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
about twenty-two hundred additional

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.309 
about twenty-two hundred additional
organs<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.879> will<00:02:46.030> see<00:02:46.269> maybe<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.810> kidney

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
organs so you will see maybe a kidney

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.259 
organs so you will see maybe a kidney
inside<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.160> actual<00:02:48.489> body<00:02:48.700> where<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.000> is

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
inside of the actual body where it is

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.300 
inside of the actual body where it is
and<00:02:49.510> then<00:02:49.870> you'll<00:02:50.019> also<00:02:50.200> see<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.709> by<00:02:50.860> itself

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
and then you'll also see it by itself

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.490 
and then you'll also see it by itself
isolated<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.239> case<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.959> can<00:02:53.170> study

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
isolated in a case so that you can study

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.240 
isolated in a case so that you can study
it<00:02:53.739> more<00:02:53.769> loosely<00:02:54.129> and<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:55.510> very<00:02:56.250> linked

wheel chair so that's our goal
fantastic<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:24.970> think<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.450> one<00:03:25.750> of<00:03:25.930> the

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
fantastic and I think that one of the

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.440 
fantastic and I think that one of the
specimens<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.680> shows<00:03:27.099> for<00:03:27.370> example<00:03:27.549> the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
specimens that shows for example the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.309 
specimens that shows for example the
lungs<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:29.019> someone<00:03:29.379> who<00:03:29.500> smokes<00:03:30.030> has<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.329> very

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
lungs of someone who smokes has a very

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.410 
lungs of someone who smokes has a very
strong<00:03:32.709> effect<00:03:33.040> on<00:03:33.310> certain<00:03:33.549> people<00:03:33.940> we<00:03:34.239> are

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
strong effect on certain people we are

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.030 
strong effect on certain people we are
hoping<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.110> has<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.260> strong<00:03:35.530> effect<00:03:35.799> on

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
hoping that it has a strong effect on

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
difficult but the process is always good

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.420 
difficult but the process is always good
for<00:04:01.359> people<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.109> be<00:04:02.290> very<00:04:02.799> cautious<00:04:03.099> about

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
as well and that's the beauty of this

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.729 
as well and that's the beauty of this
before<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.599> medical<00:04:10.599> would<00:04:10.840> only<00:04:11.079> be<00:04:11.380> able<00:04:11.470> to

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
before the medical would only be able to

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.440 
before the medical would only be able to
see<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.130> with<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.819> body<00:04:13.090> that<00:04:13.180> had

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
see this with a body that had

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.120 
see this with a body that had
formaldehyde<00:04:14.109> and<00:04:14.410> that's<00:04:14.769> a<00:04:14.889> very<00:04:15.069> short

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
formaldehyde and that's a very short

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.039 
formaldehyde and that's a very short
process<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.880> it's<00:04:16.000> very<00:04:16.299> toxic<00:04:16.599> to<00:04:17.019> our

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
process and it's very toxic to our

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.140 
process and it's very toxic to our
medical<00:04:17.410> doctors<00:04:17.919> to<00:04:18.070> do<00:04:18.190> that<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.789> this<00:04:18.970> is<00:04:19.120> a

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
medical doctors to do that so this is a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.000 
medical doctors to do that so this is a
way<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.389> is<00:04:19.690> completely<00:04:20.139> non-toxic<00:04:20.380> and

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
way that is completely non-toxic and

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.190 
way that is completely non-toxic and
completely<00:04:21.430> harmless<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:22.030> anyone<00:04:22.780> conduce

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
completely harmless and anyone conduce

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.810 
completely harmless and anyone conduce
anybody<00:04:23.860> can<00:04:24.039> do<00:04:24.160> it<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:24.460> get<00:04:24.610> really

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
anybody can do it and you get really

and they all have medical backgrounds
the<00:04:47.919> reason<00:04:48.250> why<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.430> asked<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.120> if<00:04:49.419> if<00:04:50.080> it<00:04:50.260> was

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
the reason why I asked you if if it was

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.920 
the reason why I asked you if if it was
difficult<00:04:50.950> or<00:04:51.340> not<00:04:51.400> to<00:04:51.700> bring<00:04:51.909> the<00:04:52.180> expo<00:04:52.630> here

difficult or not to bring the expo here
to<00:04:53.500> Moscow<00:04:53.860> is<00:04:53.919> because

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
to Moscow is because

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.900 
to Moscow is because

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
developed the method of plastination

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.890 
developed the method of plastination
Gotha<00:05:00.460> von<00:05:00.790> Hagens<00:05:01.210> he<00:05:01.480> had<00:05:01.630> a<00:05:01.660> problem

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
which was different in the sense that it

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.280 
which was different in the sense that it
was<00:05:07.810> more<00:05:08.350> about<00:05:08.530> art<00:05:08.860> I<00:05:09.190> think<00:05:09.550> yes<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:10.720> it

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
was more about art I think yes and it

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.470

unhappy were there any problems of that

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.340 
unhappy were there any problems of that

still<00:05:47.500> find<00:05:47.770> it<00:05:47.950> quite<00:05:48.160> macabre<00:05:48.850> why<00:05:49.090> is<00:05:49.150> the

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
still find it quite macabre why is the

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.930 
still find it quite macabre why is the
the<00:05:49.870> attitude<00:05:50.410> in<00:05:50.530> the<00:05:50.620> 21st<00:05:51.250> century<00:05:51.340> still

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.240 
there
I<00:05:52.450> think<00:05:53.170> that<00:05:53.290> most<00:05:53.440> people<00:05:53.800> find<00:05:54.040> that

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
I think that most people find that

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.280 
I think that most people find that
because<00:05:54.760> they<00:05:55.000> haven't<00:05:55.210> actually<00:05:55.480> seen<00:05:56.050> the

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
because they haven't actually seen the

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.930 
because they haven't actually seen the
exhibition<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:57.220> if<00:05:57.370> you<00:05:57.460> just<00:05:57.700> see<00:05:57.850> an

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130
