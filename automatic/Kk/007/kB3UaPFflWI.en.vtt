00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:16.049
 It is a long time no longer Takaya no horse racing book 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:19.700
 The recommended horse this time is from the column 3 special of Saturday in Niigata 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.120
 I would like to raise the monkey bars bell strike 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:29.670
 I have a child 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:36.300
 We used long-term rest gauge two times, but both order of arrival is another one 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.380
 Because I have been resting for a while in my leg for about 2 years , it was a pity to want big hope 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.570
 Though 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.910
 In the last time I was changed to Tozaki jockey 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.680
 No. 2 I was supported by the popularity 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.400
 I had thought that if kana since from before the race there is that place a little to take the Well 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.980
 But 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.460
 From beginning to end 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.440
 Equivalent is in the know 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.530
 The end has stalled but still that 0.7 seconds difference 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:08.710
 Well because I had good luck of force 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:10.210
 One end from Yeah Well, this time the race even though I think that showed me again two and a half months 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.210
 Though it opened 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.270
 I'm totally different in how I adjusted 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.760
 Before that, the meeting had two runs before 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.850
 Meet time and Well work to stop Google 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.090
 Well he's a bit happy when he says 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.200
 Though it was a moderated relay 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.060
 This time is that 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.850
 On the wood course 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.890
 From 5 Ha Long 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.640
 Sambo 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.260
 Mashitae it can live a say outright chase 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.050
 And that it only Well that feet also anxiety also lost 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.730
 Ah 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.200
 Really finished home 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:49.259
 I think I know I feel it 's different 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.310
 That's the benefit of 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.030
 Even though it's a model of the administration called Lisa All press 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.060
 Previously that tree sirman b number 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.159
 In the name of Japan 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.509
 I have had my own weight, but I'm getting married 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.509
 The name has changed 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:13.360
 She can easily get on that 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.170
 Nakayama night but such a thing is I'm a little rude I went 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.230
 Though we did not think it was over for a while, we thought 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:26.680
 It has been chucked at Aoyama stuff in Niigata Grand Prize Scripture 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:29.960
 In Although the last week of the oil special is a little grumpy Hada' Tan called Shonan Marche 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.910
 Give me a good governor 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.319
 Although I have won my first victory in Japan 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:41.920
 This time is that Isa all press is the first but 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:45.350
 I the horse was difficult day to put the compromise in the Tozaki jockey 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.760
 I think I'm looking forward to Well if by us or very thought 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.870
 Only this time Hano 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:58.209
 14th frame of Senboku's breath but I pulled it 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.200
 Well , I think that I could still race even if I made a wall in front of the black mug 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.340
 Oh dear 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.720
 It also ne of one 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.260
 I'd like to see the sights, but will you ride on tools now ? 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:13.420
 6 Pledge I though I expect I win or lose because it is horse racing 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.420
 It 's the same kind of riding of the family nephew 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.020
 I think I want to 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.380
 Finally, I'd such about that Oaks my favorite is 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.560
 It becomes now of another table to Toka same stables but Ninomiya of injection 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.940
 Chat queen 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.660
 Was Komei 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.910
 At the time of movement prize 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.960
 From one week ago 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.970
 I stayed in Kurito, but my body was greatly reduced. 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.190
 It was 428 kg but 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:49.670
 Horse Guinea at a super slow pace 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:54.020
 I think I've been catching up quite a bit from the second rear on the way 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.640
 That's why I just liked the result of that race 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.550
 How about 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:05.060
 I think it is premature to evaluate the 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:09.380
 Ad a 436 kg as of last week 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:14.880
 Because we have to adjust the then Well good at it 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:19.170
 I think they will not decrease at least like last time 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:25.250
 Because it was during that originally wonder if that strength is busy 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.250
 It means that that comfortably can run Tokyo this time Nikki visible chat on radio 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.630
 I aim for a bit and feel like it's interesting 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.630
 that's all
