00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
late I've tried to pull see if I could

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.320 
late I've tried to pull see if I could
get<00:00:25.860> a<00:00:25.890> vacuum<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.670> did<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.240> last

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
get a vacuum and I did this in the last

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.710 
get a vacuum and I did this in the last
video<00:00:28.070> and<00:00:29.070> let's<00:00:29.279> say<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.520> got<00:00:29.759> no<00:00:30.119> vacuum<00:00:30.390> at

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
video and let's say I got no vacuum at

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.840 
video and let's say I got no vacuum at
all<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.050> couldn't<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.680> anything<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.950> made

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
all I couldn't get anything and I made

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.090 
all I couldn't get anything and I made
sure<00:00:36.120> my<00:00:36.390> filter<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:37.020> clean<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> made<00:00:37.860> sure<00:00:38.040> my

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
sure my filter was clean I made sure my

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.660 
sure my filter was clean I made sure my
line<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.820> clean<00:00:40.309> yeah

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
line was clean yeah

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.440 
line was clean yeah
perhaps<00:00:42.480> I've<00:00:42.950> disconnected<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.730> line<00:00:44.760> from

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
perhaps I've disconnected the line from

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.889 
perhaps I've disconnected the line from
the<00:00:45.690> inlet<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.410> pump<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.969> if<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
the inlet of the pump and if it's a

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.250 
the inlet of the pump and if it's a
gravity<00:00:49.379> flow<00:00:52.489> system<00:00:53.489> where<00:00:53.999> it's<00:00:54.179> about<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
gravity flow system where it's about the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.419 
gravity flow system where it's about the
same<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.920> higher<00:00:56.719> than<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.559> burner<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.190> tank

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
same or higher than the burner the tank

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.729 
same or higher than the burner the tank
is<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.999> the<00:01:00.210> same<00:01:00.480> level<00:01:00.989> or<00:01:01.109> higher<00:01:01.379> than<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
is at the same level or higher than the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.830 
is at the same level or higher than the
burner<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.570> I<00:01:03.570> could<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:04.050> water<00:01:04.320> out<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
burner and I could get water out of the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.370 
burner and I could get water out of the
pipe<00:01:06.840> coming<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.409> by<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.190> way<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> hose

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
out of the pump is and this is an old

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.410 
out of the pump is and this is an old
sensitive<00:02:23.630> pump<00:02:24.910> most<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.060> them<00:02:26.180> are<00:02:26.240> mini

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
sensitive pump most of them are mini

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.230 
sensitive pump most of them are mini
pumps<00:02:26.810> now<00:02:27.370> some<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.520> many<00:02:28.700> pumps<00:02:29.030> have

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
pumps now some of the many pumps have

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.980

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
of this sensor and pump it's not the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.110 
of this sensor and pump it's not the
same<00:02:54.560> one<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:54.860> was<00:02:55.160> working<00:02:55.520> on<00:02:55.610> before<00:02:55.970> but

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
same one I was working on before but

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.660 
same one I was working on before but
it's<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.330> same<00:02:56.510> pump<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.380> let's<00:02:58.250> take<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.459> look

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
it's the same pump and let's take a look

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.140 
it's the same pump and let's take a look
at<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.910> screen<00:02:59.590> all<00:03:00.590> these<00:03:00.980> this<00:03:01.370> model<00:03:01.850> had

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
at the screen all these this model had

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.640 
at the screen all these this model had
screens<00:03:02.840> in<00:03:03.250> okay<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:05.720> pull<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.019> screen<00:03:06.440> out

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
screens in okay you pull a screen out

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.000 
screens in okay you pull a screen out
and<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:08.660> can<00:03:08.810> look<00:03:08.989> close<00:03:09.290> at<00:03:09.530> this<00:03:09.739> thing

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
and you can look close at this thing

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.300 
and you can look close at this thing
this<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.700> screens<00:03:11.030> fine<00:03:11.590> now<00:03:12.590> this<00:03:13.040> screen

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
this the screens fine now this screen

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.330 
this the screens fine now this screen
could<00:03:13.549> be<00:03:13.700> plugged<00:03:14.000> up<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:15.799> they<00:03:15.890> get<00:03:16.040> plugged

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
could be plugged up and they get plugged

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.530 
could be plugged up and they get plugged
up<00:03:16.519> with<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.730> real<00:03:17.000> kind<00:03:17.360> of<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.540> hard<00:03:17.840> stuff<00:03:18.230> and

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
up with a real kind of a hard stuff and

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.150 
up with a real kind of a hard stuff and
it's<00:03:20.540> best<00:03:20.900> actually<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.530> replace<00:03:21.950> these

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
it's best actually to replace these

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.340 
it's best actually to replace these
screens<00:03:22.580> if<00:03:22.880> they're<00:03:23.180> plugged<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.690> can<00:03:23.959> clean

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
screens if they're plugged you can clean

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.470 
screens if they're plugged you can clean
them<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:24.680> it's<00:03:24.860> it's<00:03:25.610> kind<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.000> chore<00:03:26.330> to

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
them but it's it's kind of chore to

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.690 
them but it's it's kind of chore to
clean<00:03:26.750> but<00:03:27.410> that's<00:03:28.070> one<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.430> next<00:03:28.549> things

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
clean but that's one of the next things

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.240 
clean but that's one of the next things
you're<00:03:29.000> going<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.180> look<00:03:29.330> at<00:03:29.570> as<00:03:30.230> well<00:03:31.010> while

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
you're going to look at as well while

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.729 
you're going to look at as well while
we're<00:03:31.459> here<00:03:31.750> that's<00:03:32.750> actually<00:03:33.049> your<00:03:33.440> pump

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
we're here that's actually your pump

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.560 
we're here that's actually your pump
right<00:03:34.040> there<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.519> rest<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.910> this<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:35.209> just<00:03:35.360> an

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
right there the rest of this is just an

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:43.600 
right there the rest of this is just an
open<00:03:36.340> chamber<00:03:38.049> so<00:03:39.580> check<00:03:40.580> that<00:03:40.610> screen<00:03:42.519> like<00:03:43.519> I

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
open chamber so check that screen like I

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.800 
open chamber so check that screen like I
said<00:03:43.820> you're<00:03:44.000> probably<00:03:44.180> not<00:03:44.510> going<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.690> know

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
said you're probably not going to know

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.039 
said you're probably not going to know
for<00:03:44.840> sure<00:03:45.049> whether<00:03:45.350> there<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.769> screen<00:03:46.220> on<00:03:46.430> it

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
for sure whether there is a screen on it

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.630 
for sure whether there is a screen on it
until<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.260> take<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.560> apart<00:03:48.890> some<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.459> them

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
until you take it apart some of them

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.250 
until you take it apart some of them
have<00:03:49.760> just<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:50.030> little<00:03:50.239> chopper<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:50.989> kind<00:03:51.200> of

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
have just a little chopper that kind of

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.330 
have just a little chopper that kind of
chops<00:03:51.590> up<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:54.350> crap<00:03:54.650> that's<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.100> there

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
chops up the the crap that's in there

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.850 
chops up the the crap that's in there
and<00:03:56.090> they<00:03:56.209> say<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:56.720> works<00:03:56.989> it<00:03:57.200> seems<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.680> so

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
and they say that works it seems to so

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.819 
and they say that works it seems to so
anyway<00:04:00.860> look<00:04:01.489> at<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.760> screen<00:04:02.120> now<00:04:02.680> when<00:04:03.680> you

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
anyway look at the screen now when you

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.100 
anyway look at the screen now when you
put<00:04:04.250> this<00:04:04.430> back<00:04:04.700> on<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.450> guess<00:04:05.690> it's<00:04:05.989> going

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
put this back on that guess it's going

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.300 
put this back on that guess it's going
to<00:04:06.170> be<00:04:06.319> trashed<00:04:06.819> in

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.950 

you're<00:04:10.430> probably<00:04:10.550> not<00:04:10.850> gonna<00:04:10.970> have<00:04:11.300> it<00:04:11.330> I<00:04:11.750> used

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
you're probably not gonna have it I used

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.480 
you're probably not gonna have it I used
to<00:04:12.020> carry<00:04:12.320> them<00:04:12.470> in<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.620> truck<00:04:12.890> but<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:13.250> know

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
to carry them in a truck but you know

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.120 
to carry them in a truck but you know
these<00:04:14.210> are<00:04:14.360> old<00:04:14.390> old<00:04:14.780> pumps

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
these are old old pumps

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.720 
these are old old pumps
I<00:04:16.660> just<00:04:17.660> put<00:04:17.840> silicone<00:04:18.290> on<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.620> I'd<00:04:19.370> clean<00:04:19.700> up

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
I just put silicone on it I'd clean up

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.300 
I just put silicone on it I'd clean up
the<00:04:20.030> surfaces<00:04:20.510> real<00:04:20.720> good<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.230> put<00:04:21.859> silicone

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
the surfaces real good and put silicone

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.210 
the surfaces real good and put silicone
on<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.870> truth<00:04:23.870> be<00:04:24.050> told<00:04:24.080> I<00:04:24.470> usually<00:04:24.920> don't<00:04:25.040> even

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
on it truth be told I usually don't even

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.790 
on it truth be told I usually don't even
scrape<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.610> gasket<00:04:26.030> off<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:26.480> just<00:04:27.320> get<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.500> lined

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
scrape the gasket off I just get a lined

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.890 
scrape the gasket off I just get a lined
up<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.130> same<00:04:28.160> way<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.670> was<00:04:28.790> before<00:04:28.900> but

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
up the same way it was before but

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.830 
up the same way it was before but
silicone<00:04:30.350> on<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.650> put<00:04:30.980> her<00:04:31.040> together<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:32.210> it

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
silicone on it put her together and it

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.590 
silicone on it put her together and it
seems<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.230> work<00:04:33.260> so<00:04:33.890> there's<00:04:34.880> no<00:04:35.000> pressure<00:04:35.270> on

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
seems to work so there's no pressure on

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.600 
seems to work so there's no pressure on
this<00:04:35.840> there's<00:04:36.440> only<00:04:36.710> just<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:39.610> pressure

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
this there's only just the pressure

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.210 
this there's only just the pressure
whatever<00:04:41.030> pressure<00:04:41.450> would<00:04:41.690> be<00:04:41.870> on<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.260> supply

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
whatever pressure would be on the supply

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.980 
whatever pressure would be on the supply
line<00:04:43.520> from<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.940> tank<00:04:46.240> okay<00:04:47.240> just<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:47.720> show<00:04:47.930> you
