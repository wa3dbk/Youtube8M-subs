cautious<00:00:53.070> though<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.940> celiac

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
cautious though if you have celiac

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.200 
cautious though if you have celiac
disease<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.489> think<00:00:56.699> three

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
disease like I do because I think three

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.270 
disease like I do because I think three
or<00:00:57.239> four<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.780> their<00:00:57.930> flavors<00:00:58.410> has<00:00:58.680> barley

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
or four of their flavors has barley

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.520 
or four of their flavors has barley
which<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.699> um<00:01:00.109> causes<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> gluten<00:01:01.500> sensitivity

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530

teas just because they aren't then I

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.820 
teas just because they aren't then I
would<00:05:54.690> highly<00:05:54.960> recommend<00:05:55.320> checking<00:05:55.500> this<00:05:55.710> out

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
would highly recommend checking this out

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.990 
would highly recommend checking this out
these<00:05:56.039> are<00:05:56.190> a<00:05:56.220> little<00:05:56.340> bit<00:05:56.460> more<00:05:56.580> on<00:05:56.910> the

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
these are a little bit more on the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.700 
these are a little bit more on the
pricey<00:05:57.240> side<00:05:57.419> but<00:05:57.630> they<00:05:57.870> come<00:05:58.080> with<00:05:58.320> a<00:05:58.350> lot

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
pricey side but they come with a lot

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.460 
pricey side but they come with a lot
more<00:05:59.030> teabags<00:06:00.030> at<00:06:00.300> each<00:06:00.419> little<00:06:00.750> container

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
more teabags at each little container

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.650 
more teabags at each little container
and<00:06:01.770> I<00:06:01.860> like<00:06:02.070> that<00:06:02.310> they're<00:06:02.490> in<00:06:02.639> a<00:06:02.940> little<00:06:03.419> tin

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
and I like that they're in a little tin

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.240 
and I like that they're in a little tin
can<00:06:03.930> because<00:06:04.289> they<00:06:04.380> just<00:06:04.590> keep<00:06:04.740> a<00:06:04.919> little<00:06:05.070> bit

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
can because they just keep a little bit

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.500 
can because they just keep a little bit
better<00:06:05.400> I<00:06:05.520> think<00:06:05.700> and<00:06:05.970> they're<00:06:06.090> a<00:06:06.120> lot<00:06:06.300> more

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
better I think and they're a lot more

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.810 
better I think and they're a lot more
fresh<00:06:06.810> the<00:06:07.350> next<00:06:07.590> one<00:06:07.710> is<00:06:07.860> from<00:06:08.039> EU<00:06:08.310> this<00:06:08.760> is

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
fresh the next one is from EU this is

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.760

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
their de-stress Beauty tea and I

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.440 
their de-stress Beauty tea and I
discovered<00:06:11.220> this<00:06:11.340> line<00:06:11.580> and<00:06:11.880> freaked<00:06:12.360> out

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
discovered this line and freaked out

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.800 
discovered this line and freaked out
because<00:06:13.050> it's<00:06:13.380> skin<00:06:13.919> care<00:06:14.190> plus<00:06:14.729> tea<00:06:15.240> combined

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
because it's skin care plus tea combined

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.330 
because it's skin care plus tea combined
