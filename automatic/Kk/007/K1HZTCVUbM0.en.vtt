00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
with playing performing really well that

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.439 
with playing performing really well that
issue<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.800> change<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.429> it<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.969> make<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.300> game

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
next week if you lose it may break your

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.669 
next week if you lose it may break your
heart<00:01:15.179> it<00:01:15.330> might<00:01:15.539> lag<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.140> next<00:01:16.380> week<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
heart it might lag in the next week and

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:17.810 
heart it might lag in the next week and
also<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.159> game<00:01:17.340> has<00:01:17.490> something<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> do

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
also in that game has something to do

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.609 
also in that game has something to do
with<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.030> happened<00:01:18.330> next<00:01:18.570> week<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.350> think

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
with what happened next week and I think

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.830 
with what happened next week and I think
over<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> long<00:01:20.340> haul<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.789> thinking<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.450> way

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
over the long haul of thinking it's way

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.229 
over the long haul of thinking it's way
more<00:01:22.170> valuable<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.429> disciplined<00:01:23.940> about

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:24.239 
more valuable to be disciplined about

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:27.710 
more valuable to be disciplined about
that<00:01:24.830> that<00:01:25.830> kind<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.429> thinking<00:01:26.759> than<00:01:27.330> what<00:01:27.569> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that that kind of thinking than what is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.749 
that that kind of thinking than what is
normally<00:01:27.959> accept<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.399> don't<00:01:29.700> think

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
normally accept that we just don't think

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.380 
normally accept that we just don't think
that<00:01:30.000> way<00:01:30.330> so<00:01:30.840> what<00:01:31.739> we<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.039> is<00:01:32.190> every<00:01:32.220> game<00:01:33.149> we

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that way so what we do is every game we

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.999 
that way so what we do is every game we
play<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.929> it's<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.170> championship<00:01:34.830> game

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
play like it's a championship game

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.380 
play like it's a championship game
you're<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.369> continue<00:01:35.789> to<00:01:35.940> hear<00:01:36.209> that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you're going to continue to hear that

you're going to continue to hear that
what<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.080> means<00:01:37.410> is<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:38.190> want<00:01:38.399> to<00:01:38.489> bring

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
what that means is we want to bring

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.120 
what that means is we want to bring
everything<00:01:39.330> we<00:01:39.599> possibly<00:01:39.899> have<00:01:40.319> to<00:01:40.530> play<00:01:40.950> the
