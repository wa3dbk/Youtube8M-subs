stroke but I had really high blood
pressure<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.379> about

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
pressure and I was in there for about

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.740 
pressure and I was in there for about
five<00:01:04.860> hours<00:01:04.890> whilst<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.850> waited<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.540> to
