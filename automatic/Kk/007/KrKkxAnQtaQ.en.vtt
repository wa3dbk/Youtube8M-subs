00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
actually be two cards in well are things

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.170 
actually be two cards in well are things
quite<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> cool<00:00:53.039> idea<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:54.030> you've

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
quite a cool idea with this is if you've

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.090 
quite a cool idea with this is if you've
got<00:00:54.360> something<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.870> an<00:00:55.140> oyster<00:00:55.260> card<00:00:55.530> or<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
got something like an oyster card or a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.360 
got something like an oyster card or a
bank<00:00:56.850> card<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.390> works<00:00:57.510> off<00:00:57.809> touch<00:00:58.250> with<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
bank card that works off touch with the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
bank card that works off touch with the
card<00:00:59.609> being<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.090> close<00:01:00.420> you'd<00:01:00.719> probably<00:01:00.899> if

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
card being so close you'd probably if

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.389 
card being so close you'd probably if
you<00:01:01.140> push<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.530> against<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.010> will<00:01:02.190> probably

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you push it against it will probably

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.039 
you push it against it will probably
register<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.390> use<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.750> if<00:01:03.960> you

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
register it so you can use that if you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.960 
register it so you can use that if you
do<00:01:04.170> need<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.530> card<00:01:04.769> they're<00:01:05.339> easily<00:01:05.519> slide

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
do need your card they're easily slide

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.270 
do need your card they're easily slide
it<00:01:06.119> out<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.450> such<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.350> does<00:01:07.530> run<00:01:07.740> down<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> back

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
it out as such it does run down the back

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.950 
it out as such it does run down the back
of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> phone<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.210> would<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.720> be

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
of the phone so you would have to be

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.060 
of the phone so you would have to be
careful<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> don't<00:01:10.650> go<00:01:10.770> around<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
careful that you don't go around of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.500 
careful that you don't go around of
marking<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:11.610> phone<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.970> haven't<00:01:12.210> use<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
marking your phone I haven't use the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.630 
marking your phone I haven't use the
case<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:12.930> long<00:01:13.049> enough<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.380> test<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.860> so

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
case for long enough to test that so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940 
case for long enough to test that so
that's<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.060> unique<00:01:15.750> feature<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that's the unique feature of that so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.289 
that's the unique feature of that so
you've<00:01:17.100> got<00:01:17.130> good<00:01:17.460> protection<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:18.090> doesn't

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
you've got good protection it doesn't

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.210 
you've got good protection it doesn't
have<00:01:18.390> too<00:01:18.600> much<00:01:18.780> bulk<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.770> case<00:01:20.040> in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
have too much bulk this case in

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
have too much bulk this case in
particular<00:01:20.340> looks<00:01:20.850> really<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.450> nice<00:01:21.600> on

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
particular looks really really nice on

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.899 
particular looks really really nice on
the<00:01:21.900> white<00:01:22.080> phone<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:23.100> definitely<00:01:23.340> kind<00:01:23.759> of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
