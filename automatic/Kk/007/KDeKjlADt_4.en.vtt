00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.060 
rock climbing and actually climbers
nowadays<00:01:49.370> are<00:01:49.550> starting<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.090> realize<00:01:50.660> that

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
nowadays are starting to realize that

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.200 
nowadays are starting to realize that
practicing<00:01:52.070> on<00:01:52.220> boulders<00:01:52.640> is<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.880> lot<00:01:53.180> easier

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
practicing on boulders is a lot easier

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.020 
practicing on boulders is a lot easier
and<00:01:53.630> improve<00:01:54.440> faster<00:01:54.680> rather<00:01:55.490> than<00:01:55.730> just

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
and improve faster rather than just

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.900 
and improve faster rather than just
tying<00:01:56.570> into<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:57.170> rope<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.680> just<00:01:58.010> trying<00:01:58.700> the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
tying into a rope and just trying the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.180 
tying into a rope and just trying the
root<00:01:59.150> over<00:01:59.780> again<00:02:00.080> you<00:02:00.440> can<00:02:00.620> practice<00:02:01.040> the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
root over again you can practice the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.760 
root over again you can practice the
moves<00:02:01.370> on<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.790> ground<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.710> perfect<00:02:03.710> your

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
moves on the ground and perfect your

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.760 
moves on the ground and perfect your
movements<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.730> technique<00:02:05.530> what<00:02:06.530> is<00:02:06.650> the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
movements and technique what is the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.139 
movements and technique what is the
difference<00:02:07.130> between<00:02:07.190> what<00:02:07.610> climbing<00:02:08.000> and

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
difference between what climbing and

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.670 
difference between what climbing and
bouldering<00:02:10.060> bouldering<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.239> bit<00:02:11.480> more

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
bouldering bouldering is a bit more

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.640 
bouldering bouldering is a bit more
explosive<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.819> see<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.239> log<00:02:14.510> on<00:02:14.750> dinos<00:02:15.290> we

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
explosive so you see a log on dinos we

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.860 
explosive so you see a log on dinos we
call<00:02:15.890> him<00:02:15.980> Dino<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.489> means<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:17.090> they<00:02:17.480> do

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
call him Dino so it means but they do

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.989 
call him Dino so it means but they do
all<00:02:18.170> points<00:02:18.650> off<00:02:18.800> troll<00:02:19.219> and<00:02:19.519> then<00:02:19.700> catch

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:19.999 
all points off troll and then catch

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:21.989 
all points off troll and then catch
something<00:02:20.329> else<00:02:20.510> like<00:02:20.749> up<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.379> meter<00:02:21.680> away

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
something else like up to a meter away

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:25.539 
something else like up to a meter away
sometimes<00:02:22.999> more<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.980> makes<00:02:25.189> for<00:02:25.370> better

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
sometimes more and it makes for better

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.720 
sometimes more and it makes for better
viewer<00:02:26.030> viewing<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.109> actually<00:02:27.680> now<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:28.189> kids

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
viewer viewing and actually now the kids

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.369 
viewer viewing and actually now the kids
like<00:02:28.999> it<00:02:29.030> better<00:02:29.359> because<00:02:29.599> they<00:02:29.870> don't<00:02:30.049> put<00:02:30.349> on

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379
