00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.840
 hello in this video we're going to see the stem 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.630
 the stem is a cylindrical organ that 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.660
 grows opposite to the root is 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.029
 say from the ground upwards it 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.430
 responsible for holding the leaves the flowers 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.500
 and the fruits of the plant also 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.140
 transports the crude sap of the roots 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.210
 to the leaves and the elaborated sap of 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.210
 leaves to all parts of the plant 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.770
 the apex is the upper end of the 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.129
 Stem the knots are lumps from 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.670
 where the leaves are born the internodes are 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.160
 pieces of stem located between the knots 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.679
 the yolks are the parts of the vegetable that 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.129
 sprout and grow and there are several types 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:04.409
 the apical bud or terminal is located 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.619
 on the tip of the stem of a branch and makes 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.420
 that they go lengthening the axillary bud or 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.350
 side are responsible for that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.350
 the leaves appear 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.280
 two 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.049
 ah 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.170
 There are two types of stems by which 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.780
 we can classify the vegetables in the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.719
 herbaceous vegetables the stems are thin 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.840
 and green and they usually do not tend to be very 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:35.509
 high this type of plants do not usually 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.319
 live a long time usually a year 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.079
 or maybe two in the woody vegetables 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.299
 stems are thick and stiff these 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.909
 plants can reach a lot of height 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.610
 even exceed 100 meters as the 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.099
 redwood trees are usually plants 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.520
 longevas being able to live longer than 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.520
 1000 years 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.250
 Well, this is all about the stem 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.009
 I encourage you to see more videos without notes 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.780
 dotcom and remember do not study much 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.780
 just learn 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.280
 but
