00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
going and growing because demand is very

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.429 
going and growing because demand is very
very<00:01:05.760> much<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> easy<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
very much but is it easy to do that

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.630 
very much but is it easy to do that
because<00:01:07.560> you've<00:01:07.799> got<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.010> get<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> landing

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
because you've got to get the landing

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.960 
because you've got to get the landing
right<00:01:08.820> sorted<00:01:09.270> out<00:01:09.360> yes<00:01:10.110> well<00:01:10.439> basically<00:01:10.970> what

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
right sorted out yes well basically what

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.250 
right sorted out yes well basically what
we're<00:01:12.119> trying<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260
