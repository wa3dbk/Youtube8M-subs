pretty cool so anyway those are the two

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.530 
pretty cool so anyway those are the two
figures<00:01:10.350> then<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.280> also<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.299> right

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
figures then we also have this right

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.200 
figures then we also have this right
here<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.920> mobile<00:01:14.430> bubble<00:01:15.060> launcher

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.990 
and it's got one bubble already on it
and<00:01:18.439> obviously<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.619> very<00:01:19.799> easy<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.520> use<00:01:20.729> you

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and obviously it's very easy to use you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.469 
and obviously it's very easy to use you
just<00:01:21.030> push<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.020> part<00:01:22.409> down<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.479> although

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
just push that part down and although

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.170 
just push that part down and although
these<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:25.049> hard<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> white<00:01:26.180> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
these are hard to see on the white you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.069 
these are hard to see on the white you
do<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.540> four<00:01:28.140> extra<00:01:28.680> bubbles<00:01:29.430> over<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:30.079> go

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
do have four extra bubbles over here go

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.899 
do have four extra bubbles over here go
ahead<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.470> set<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> way<00:01:32.670> over

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
ahead and set that out of the way over

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
ahead and set that out of the way over
here<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.560> we'll<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> look

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
here don't in it and we'll take a look

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.740 
here don't in it and we'll take a look
at<00:01:36.350> this<00:01:37.350> which<00:01:37.979> i<00:01:38.220> think<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.549> kind<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.909> really

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
at this which i think is kind of really

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.710 
at this which i think is kind of really
interesting<00:01:40.409> looking<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:41.790> nice<00:01:41.970> piece

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
interesting looking a really nice piece

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.410 
interesting looking a really nice piece
this<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.490> obviously<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.610> kind<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.090> cloth

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
this is obviously it's kind of a cloth

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840 
this is obviously it's kind of a cloth
piece<00:01:45.869> home<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> beard<00:01:47.159> burger<00:01:47.579> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
piece home with the beard burger and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.780 
piece home with the beard burger and
then<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.930> side<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.189> see<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.610> does

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
then on this side as you can see it does

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.060 
then on this side as you can see it does
open<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.290> go<00:01:52.560> ahead<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.829> give<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.040> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.620 
have a couple of Krabby Patties here
which<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.799> basic<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.850> three<00:02:00.060> pieces<00:02:00.299> put

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
which really basic just three pieces put

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.440 
which really basic just three pieces put
together<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.180> kind<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
together for that and this is kind of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.469 
together for that and this is kind of
interesting<00:02:03.979> this<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.040> actually<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> sticker

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
interesting this is actually a sticker

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.770 
interesting this is actually a sticker
on<00:02:06.509> here<00:02:06.869> however<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:08.520> comes<00:02:08.879> already<00:02:09.209> put<00:02:09.569> on

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
on here however it comes already put on

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.380 
on here however it comes already put on
the<00:02:09.899> piece<00:02:10.129> which<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.280> thought<00:02:11.430> was<00:02:11.610> very

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the piece which I thought was very

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.600 
the piece which I thought was very
but<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> sticker<00:02:14.680> but<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.310> don't<00:02:15.460> have

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
but it is a sticker but you don't have

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.270 
but it is a sticker but you don't have
to<00:02:15.700> put<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:15.910> on<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.750> that's<00:02:17.050> kind<00:02:17.350> of<00:02:17.410> odd<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.250> me

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
to put it on so that's kind of odd to me

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.240 
to put it on so that's kind of odd to me
you<00:02:19.060> can<00:02:19.180> also<00:02:19.300> close<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.930> up<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.740> close<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
you can also close this up you close the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.700 
you can also close this up you close the
bottom<00:02:21.610> part<00:02:21.880> first<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.570> then<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> top<00:02:23.380> part

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
bottom part first and then the top part

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.160 
bottom part first and then the top part
so<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.610> can<00:02:24.790> kind<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.150> fold<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.660> up<00:02:25.810> like<00:02:25.990> that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
so you can kind of fold it up like that

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.240 
so you can kind of fold it up like that
just<00:02:26.440> kind<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.830> cool

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
just kind of cool
