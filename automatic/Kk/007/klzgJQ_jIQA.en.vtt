00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.110
 first we need to change the name 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.650
 go in the config 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.909
 in my opinion and a heart can't edit 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.729
 and decided here new in the seller buy 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.250
 marina. 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:33.479

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:45.649
 you can also save the tutorial on the server 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.950

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:00.070

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.750
 repeated on servu 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:08.240
 we can go and check 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:12.380

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.560

 farther behind the place 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:10.630
