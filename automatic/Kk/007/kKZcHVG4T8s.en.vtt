stuck<00:00:17.010> anyway<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:18.029> had<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> question<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.410> week

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
stuck anyway I had a question this week

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.920 
stuck anyway I had a question this week
about<00:00:19.710> negatives<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.580> their<00:00:21.210> benefits<00:00:21.720> and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
about negatives and their benefits and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.890 
about negatives and their benefits and
negatives<00:00:22.859> yeah<00:00:23.430> um<00:00:23.609> two<00:00:24.449> being<00:00:24.660> incorporated

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
negatives yeah um two being incorporated

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.960 
negatives yeah um two being incorporated
a<00:00:25.260> program<00:00:25.619> now<00:00:25.800> always<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.369> negatives<00:00:26.789> cuz

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
a program now always like negatives cuz

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.390 
a program now always like negatives cuz
you<00:00:27.060> could<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.330> more<00:00:27.570> weight<00:00:28.160> elicits<00:00:29.160> more

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
you could do more weight elicits more

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.209 
you could do more weight elicits more
damage<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> muscle<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.410> allows<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:32.009> also

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
damage to the muscle and allows you also

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.000 
damage to the muscle and allows you also
to<00:00:32.579> do<00:00:33.329> an<00:00:33.450> intense<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.320> an<00:00:34.500> intensity

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
to do an intense and it's an intensity

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.950 
to do an intense and it's an intensity
technique<00:00:35.520> we're<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> end<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.630> set<00:00:36.840> when

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
technique we're at the end of a set when

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.840 
technique we're at the end of a set when
you<00:00:37.020> can't<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> positive<00:00:38.160> since<00:00:38.700> you're

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
you can't do a positive since you're

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.819 
you can't do a positive since you're
stronger<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.450> negative<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.290> come<00:00:40.649> down

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
stronger on the negative you come down

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.180 
stronger on the negative you come down
nice<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.219> slow<00:00:41.790> that's<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.050> bro<00:00:43.410> side<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
nice and slow that's the bro side of it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.760 
nice and slow that's the bro side of it
basically<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.120> allows<00:00:45.239> me<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.750> add<00:00:46.530> an

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
basically it allows me to add an

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.880 
basically it allows me to add an
intensifier<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:48.210> my<00:00:48.360> set<00:00:48.660> now<00:00:49.079> Shawn<00:00:49.440> he's

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
intensifier to my set now Shawn he's

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.760 
intensifier to my set now Shawn he's
educated<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.660> Shawn<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.350> were<00:00:52.530> your

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
educated in this so Shawn what were your

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.740 
educated in this so Shawn what were your
thoughts<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:53.219> negatives<00:00:53.640> well<00:00:54.300> when<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.510> talk

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
thoughts on negatives well when we talk

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.639 
thoughts on negatives well when we talk
about<00:00:54.780> negatives

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
about negatives

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.099 
about negatives
it's<00:00:55.920> an<00:00:56.070> intensity<00:00:56.550> technique<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.840> when<00:00:58.020> you

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
it's an intensity technique and when you

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's an intensity technique and when you
talk<00:00:58.289> about<00:00:58.320> techniques<00:00:59.309> such<00:00:59.520> as<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.730> when

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
talk about techniques such as this when

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.369 
talk about techniques such as this when
you<00:01:00.000> talk<00:01:00.120> about<00:01:00.180> your<00:01:00.420> training<00:01:00.629> when<00:01:01.289> we

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you talk about your training when we

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.869 
you talk about your training when we
talk<00:01:01.530> about<00:01:01.559> progressive<00:01:02.160> overload<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.640> just

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
talk about progressive overload we just

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.189 
talk about progressive overload we just
were<00:01:03.090> discussing<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> gym<00:01:04.080> this

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
were discussing this in the gym this

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.219 
were discussing this in the gym this
morning<00:01:04.290> yeah<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.850> more<00:01:06.390> sets<00:01:06.630> you

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
morning yeah you can do more sets you

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.890 
morning yeah you can do more sets you
can<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.530> more<00:01:07.890> reps<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.060> lift<00:01:09.210> heavier

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
can do more reps you can lift heavier

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.780 
can do more reps you can lift heavier
weight<00:01:10.170> these<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:10.979> all<00:01:11.070> methods<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
weight these are all methods of

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.420 
weight these are all methods of
increasing<00:01:12.000> volume<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:13.530> intensity<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
increasing volume or intensity with the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.670 
increasing volume or intensity with the
weight<00:01:14.750> negatives<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.869> another<00:01:16.110> intensity

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
weight negatives are another intensity

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
weight negatives are another intensity
technique<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.700> are<00:01:17.729> controlling<00:01:18.390> time<00:01:18.600> under

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
technique we are controlling time under

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.499 
technique we are controlling time under
tension<00:01:18.900> yeah<00:01:19.619> aka<00:01:20.189> Tut<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> longer<00:01:21.479> period

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
tension yeah aka Tut for a longer period

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.050 
tension yeah aka Tut for a longer period
of<00:01:21.900> time<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> same<00:01:23.130> resistance<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
of time with the same resistance to it

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
of time with the same resistance to it
so<00:01:24.210> you're<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.170> Mark<00:01:25.439> said

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
so you're going to do like Mark said

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.190 
so you're going to do like Mark said
more<00:01:26.310> muscular<00:01:26.759> damage<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.360> elicit<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
more muscular damage and elicit a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.109 
more muscular damage and elicit a
greater<00:01:28.470> growth<00:01:28.770> response<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:30.030> you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
greater growth response and when you

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.450 
greater growth response and when you
have<00:01:30.360> loaded<00:01:31.229> negatives<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.070> static<00:01:32.430> hold

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
have loaded negatives in a static hold

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.550 
have loaded negatives in a static hold
you<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.090> which<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.329> could<00:01:33.479> employ<00:01:33.900> -<00:01:34.200> yeah

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
you know which you could employ - yeah

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890 
you know which you could employ - yeah
you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.119> some<00:01:36.360> science<00:01:36.630> relating

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
you can you know some science relating

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.190 
you can you know some science relating
to<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.320> glycogen<00:01:37.619> uptake<00:01:38.040> workout<00:01:38.790> so

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
to that and glycogen uptake workout so

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200 
to that and glycogen uptake workout so
it's<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.290> really<00:01:40.470> cool<00:01:40.740> way<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.009> add<00:01:41.670> intensity

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
it's a really cool way to add intensity

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
it's a really cool way to add intensity
to<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> workout<00:01:42.869> where<00:01:43.079> maybe<00:01:43.590> you're<00:01:43.740> not

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to the workout where maybe you're not

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.340 
to the workout where maybe you're not
ready<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.460> step<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.509> weight<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.110> next

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
ready to step up that weight to the next

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.319 
ready to step up that weight to the next
level<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> few<00:01:48.060> more

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
level but if you can do a few more

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.960 
level but if you can do a few more
controlled<00:01:48.750> negatives<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.759> going

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
controlled negatives then that's going

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.210 
controlled negatives then that's going
to<00:01:51.030> prepare<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.740> it's<00:01:52.740> gonna<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.100> gonna

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
to prepare you it's gonna that's gonna

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.649 
to prepare you it's gonna that's gonna
add<00:01:53.490> your<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> add<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.570> your

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
add your it's going to add to your

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.170 
add your it's going to add to your
ability<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.310> increase<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.549> weight<00:01:56.790> next

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
ability to increase that weight next

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.420 
ability to increase that weight next
time<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.659> know<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:57.990> incorporating<00:01:58.770> negatives

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
time you know so incorporating negatives

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.730 
time you know so incorporating negatives
as<00:01:59.640> an<00:01:59.850> intensity<00:02:00.329> technique<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> solid<00:02:01.590> a

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
as an intensity technique is a solid a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.550 
as an intensity technique is a solid a
solid<00:02:02.219> way<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> continue<00:02:02.700> making<00:02:02.939> gains

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
solid way to continue making gains

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.350 
solid way to continue making gains
absolutely<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.070> look<00:02:05.280> at<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:06.210> as

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
absolutely and I look at it like just as

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.150 
absolutely and I look at it like just as
I<00:02:06.479> look<00:02:06.630> at<00:02:06.780> extended<00:02:07.229> sester<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.799> look<00:02:08.009> at

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
I look at extended sester to look at

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.580 
I look at extended sester to look at
four<00:02:08.819> straps<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.270> look<00:02:09.629> at<00:02:09.750> drop<00:02:09.959> sets<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.440> an

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
four straps just look at drop sets as an

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.380 
four straps just look at drop sets as an
intensity<00:02:10.979> technique<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.879> does<00:02:12.180> have

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
intensity technique right it does have

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.559 
intensity technique right it does have
its<00:02:12.540> place<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:12.989> power<00:02:13.170> lift

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
its place for power lift

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.989 
its place for power lift
has<00:02:13.989> its<00:02:14.290> place<00:02:14.499> for<00:02:14.799> hypertrophy<00:02:15.489> yeah<00:02:15.819> it

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:15.999 
has its place for hypertrophy yeah it

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.580 
has its place for hypertrophy yeah it
has<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.299> place<00:02:16.540> everywhere<00:02:17.019> actually<00:02:17.319> you

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
has this place everywhere actually you

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.410 
has this place everywhere actually you
know<00:02:17.709> what<00:02:17.859> one<00:02:18.010> other<00:02:18.189> thing<00:02:18.459> if<00:02:19.209> you're

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
know what one other thing if you're

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.989 
know what one other thing if you're
building<00:02:19.599> your<00:02:19.900> form<00:02:20.400> doing<00:02:21.400> negative<00:02:21.849> only

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
building your form doing negative only

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.899 
building your form doing negative only
sets<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.829> probably<00:02:23.829> the<00:02:24.010> best<00:02:24.249> way<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.459> do<00:02:24.760> it

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
sets is probably the best way to do it

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.149 
sets is probably the best way to do it
meaning<00:02:25.480> like<00:02:25.599> if<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.709> do<00:02:26.829> a<00:02:26.859> bench

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
meaning like if you if you do a bench

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.349 
meaning like if you if you do a bench
press<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.609> you're<00:02:27.819> having<00:02:27.939> trouble<00:02:28.150> with

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
press and you're having trouble with

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.420 
press and you're having trouble with
your<00:02:28.540> bench<00:02:28.749> most<00:02:29.499> of<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.680> time<00:02:29.859> people's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
your bench most of the time people's

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.360 
your bench most of the time people's
issue<00:02:30.670> isn't<00:02:31.030> on<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:32.230> positive<00:02:32.769> part<00:02:33.189> of<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
issue isn't on the positive part of the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.819 
issue isn't on the positive part of the
motion<00:02:33.819> it's<00:02:34.359> on<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.689> negative<00:02:35.109> they<00:02:35.200> go<00:02:35.560> down

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
motion it's on the negative they go down

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.979 
motion it's on the negative they go down
in<00:02:36.219> the<00:02:36.670> wrong<00:02:36.819> range<00:02:37.269> of<00:02:37.480> motion<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:37.810> if

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
in the wrong range of motion so if

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.300 
in the wrong range of motion so if
you're<00:02:38.109> trying<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.319> build<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.680> motor<00:02:38.889> pattern

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
you're trying to build a motor pattern

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.429 
you're trying to build a motor pattern
which<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.879> all<00:02:40.030> practice<00:02:40.629> and<00:02:40.780> habit<00:02:41.109> yeah<00:02:41.409> I

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
which is all practice and habit yeah I

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.229 
which is all practice and habit yeah I
need<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.799> work<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.219> negative<00:02:42.760> when<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.090> was

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
need to work that negative when I was

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.509 
need to work that negative when I was
rebuilding<00:02:43.599> my<00:02:43.840> flat<00:02:44.139> bench<00:02:44.379> press<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.950> just

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
rebuilding my flat bench press I just

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.909 
rebuilding my flat bench press I just
practiced<00:02:45.969> heavy<00:02:46.180> negatives<00:02:46.719> I<00:02:47.169> was<00:02:47.709> doing

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:47.919 
practiced heavy negatives I was doing

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.860 
practiced heavy negatives I was doing
two<00:02:48.189> and<00:02:48.310> three<00:02:48.459> rep<00:02:48.639> sets<00:02:48.879> with<00:02:49.450> weight<00:02:49.689> that

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
two and three rep sets with weight that

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.270 
two and three rep sets with weight that
I<00:02:49.900> could<00:02:50.169> probably<00:02:50.409> do<00:02:50.620> 10<00:02:50.859> reps<00:02:51.099> with

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
I could probably do 10 reps with

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.819 
I could probably do 10 reps with
normally<00:02:51.609> but<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.790> was<00:02:52.000> doing<00:02:52.299> 5<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.169> 10<00:02:53.379> second

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
normally but I was doing 5 to 10 second

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.979 
normally but I was doing 5 to 10 second
negatives<00:02:54.280> where<00:02:54.519> I<00:02:54.760> was<00:02:55.120> really<00:02:55.389> feeling<00:02:55.659> and

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
negatives where I was really feeling and

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.839 
negatives where I was really feeling and
understanding<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:57.040> range<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.430> motion<00:02:57.760> and

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
understanding the range of motion and

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.099 
understanding the range of motion and
motor<00:02:58.030> pattern<00:02:58.389> I<00:02:58.629> needed<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.989> establish

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
motor pattern I needed to establish

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.259 
motor pattern I needed to establish
fucking<00:02:59.769> your<00:02:59.889> elbows<00:03:00.250> yeah<00:03:00.489> about<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.849> come

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
fucking your elbows yeah about it come

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.599 
fucking your elbows yeah about it come
back<00:03:01.389> to<00:03:01.449> me<00:03:01.719> thank<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.739> rely<00:03:02.980> actually

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
back to me thank you can rely actually

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.759 
back to me thank you can rely actually
did<00:03:03.790> those<00:03:04.090> wood<00:03:04.810> lighter<00:03:05.019> weight<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.319> wasn't

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
did those wood lighter weight I wasn't

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.080 
did those wood lighter weight I wasn't
going<00:03:05.980> for<00:03:06.129> hypertrophy<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:06.639> was<00:03:06.760> going<00:03:06.939> for

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
going for hypertrophy I was going for

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.520 
going for hypertrophy I was going for
more<00:03:07.180> brain<00:03:07.419> pattern<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.959> lot<00:03:08.169> of<00:03:08.260> people<00:03:08.469> don't

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
more brain pattern a lot of people don't

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.229 
more brain pattern a lot of people don't
realize<00:03:08.739> right<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.340> lot<00:03:09.639> of<00:03:09.760> what<00:03:09.849> we<00:03:09.969> do<00:03:10.120> is

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
realize right a lot of what we do is

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.759 
realize right a lot of what we do is
brain<00:03:10.510> pattern<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.019> that's<00:03:11.139> why<00:03:11.349> negatives

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
brain pattern and that's why negatives

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.949 
brain pattern and that's why negatives
can<00:03:11.889> be<00:03:12.010> extremely<00:03:12.639> valuable<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.419> that's<00:03:13.689> why

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
can be extremely valuable and that's why

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.750 
can be extremely valuable and that's why
my<00:03:14.290> daughter<00:03:14.560> who's<00:03:15.340> learning<00:03:15.579> how<00:03:15.699> to

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
my daughter who's learning how to

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.339 
my daughter who's learning how to
kettlebell<00:03:16.209> swing<00:03:16.449> at<00:03:16.599> squat<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:16.989> early<00:03:17.169> age

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
kettlebell swing at squat and early age

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.819 
kettlebell swing at squat and early age
their<00:03:18.189> ability<00:03:18.609> I<00:03:18.639> think<00:03:18.729> it<00:03:19.000> was<00:03:19.150> like<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:20.650> was

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
their ability I think it was like it was

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.069 
their ability I think it was like it was
like<00:03:21.060> 10,000<00:03:22.060> reps<00:03:22.239> for<00:03:22.449> adults<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:22.930> like<00:03:23.049> a

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
like 10,000 reps for adults in like a

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.990 
like 10,000 reps for adults in like a
hundred<00:03:23.349> reps<00:03:23.739> for<00:03:23.979> like<00:03:24.159> kids<00:03:24.459> yeah<00:03:24.729> it's

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
hundred reps for like kids yeah it's

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.789 
hundred reps for like kids yeah it's
crazy<00:03:25.629> so<00:03:26.019> if<00:03:26.139> you<00:03:26.199> could<00:03:26.349> start<00:03:26.530> brain

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
crazy so if you could start brain

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.589 
crazy so if you could start brain
patterning<00:03:27.370> your<00:03:27.489> kids<00:03:27.699> it's<00:03:27.879> all<00:03:28.030> conjecture

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
patterning your kids it's all conjecture

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.270 
patterning your kids it's all conjecture
there's<00:03:29.079> so<00:03:29.259> much<00:03:29.379> there's<00:03:29.769> so<00:03:29.829> much<00:03:30.009> we<00:03:30.159> don't

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
there's so much there's so much we don't

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.099 
there's so much there's so much we don't
know<00:03:30.400> about<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.939> right<00:03:30.970> but<00:03:31.329> you're<00:03:31.930> looking

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
know about it right but you're looking

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.890 
know about it right but you're looking
at<00:03:32.439> mapping<00:03:33.340> your<00:03:33.879> brain<00:03:34.180> into<00:03:34.509> proper

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
at mapping your brain into proper

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.360 
at mapping your brain into proper
patterns<00:03:35.319> of<00:03:35.409> movement<00:03:35.500> that's<00:03:36.069> why<00:03:36.250> if

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
patterns of movement that's why if

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.039 
patterns of movement that's why if
you've<00:03:36.549> been<00:03:36.639> doing<00:03:36.879> bad<00:03:37.030> form<00:03:37.419> for<00:03:37.629> so<00:03:37.780> long

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
you've been doing bad form for so long

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.439 
you've been doing bad form for so long
it's<00:03:38.680> so<00:03:39.009> difficult<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.699> get<00:03:39.879> the<00:03:40.000> right<00:03:40.030> form

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
it's so difficult to get the right form

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.119 
it's so difficult to get the right form
and<00:03:40.659> like<00:03:41.049> he<00:03:41.169> was<00:03:41.290> saying<00:03:41.409> negatives<00:03:41.919> can

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
and like he was saying negatives can

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.920 
and like he was saying negatives can
help<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.430> achieve<00:03:42.549> that<00:03:42.939> better<00:03:43.150> form<00:03:43.479> right

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
help you achieve that better form right

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.809 
help you achieve that better form right
and<00:03:44.169> so<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:44.560> may<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:45.009> know<00:03:45.129> that<00:03:45.159> there's<00:03:45.759> a

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
and so it may you know that there's a

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.939 
and so it may you know that there's a
10,000<00:03:46.509> rep<00:03:46.689> number<00:03:47.379> that<00:03:47.650> we<00:03:47.739> talked<00:03:47.919> about

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
10,000 rep number that we talked about

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.039 
10,000 rep number that we talked about
in<00:03:48.340> terms<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.639> in<00:03:48.849> graining<00:03:49.329> a<00:03:49.419> motor<00:03:49.629> pattern

based on a regular repetition where you

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.640 
based on a regular repetition where you

one to two second positive what if you

one to two second positive what if you
were<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.900> what<00:03:59.379> if<00:03:59.469> you<00:03:59.560> were<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.769> double<00:04:00.099> or

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:00.219 
were to what if you were to double or

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.569 
were to what if you were to double or
triple<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.759> time<00:04:01.479> for<00:04:02.259> each<00:04:02.469> negative<00:04:02.799> who's

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
triple that time for each negative who's

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.399 
triple that time for each negative who's
to<00:04:03.699> say<00:04:03.849> it<00:04:03.939> wouldn't<00:04:04.180> occur<00:04:04.389> much<00:04:04.719> faster<00:04:05.259> I

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
to say it wouldn't occur much faster I

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:06.300 
to say it wouldn't occur much faster I
believe<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:05.829> does

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
believe it does

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.679 
believe it does
I<00:04:06.340> believe<00:04:06.819> if<00:04:06.969> you<00:04:07.060> slow<00:04:07.299> down<00:04:07.509> your

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
I believe if you slow down your

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.360 
I believe if you slow down your
repetitions<00:04:08.319> if<00:04:08.469> you're<00:04:08.590> trying<00:04:08.799> to<00:04:08.919> learn<00:04:09.069> a

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
repetitions if you're trying to learn a

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.580 
repetitions if you're trying to learn a
motor<00:04:09.849> pattern<00:04:10.209> you'll<00:04:10.449> solidify<00:04:10.959> it<00:04:11.019> two<00:04:11.500> to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
motor pattern you'll solidify it two to

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.029 
motor pattern you'll solidify it two to
three<00:04:11.620> times<00:04:11.769> about<00:04:12.250> 10,000<00:04:12.969> reps<00:04:13.180> versus

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:14.039 
three times about 10,000 reps versus

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.379 
three times about 10,000 reps versus
three<00:04:15.039> type<00:04:15.219> your<00:04:15.459> reps<00:04:15.849> are<00:04:16.000> three<00:04:16.209> times

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
three type your reps are three times

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.539 
three type your reps are three times
slower<00:04:16.780> yeah<00:04:17.079> I<00:04:17.380> mean<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:17.889> could<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.489> I

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
slower yeah I mean that could and I

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.189 
slower yeah I mean that could and I
could<00:04:18.729> cut<00:04:18.969> it<00:04:19.000> in<00:04:19.150> half<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.599> don't<00:04:19.630> know<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:19.930> mean

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
could cut it in half I don't know I mean

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.500 
could cut it in half I don't know I mean
it's<00:04:20.739> all<00:04:20.949> conjecture<00:04:21.159> but<00:04:21.729> make<00:04:22.389> some

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
it's all conjecture but make some

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.240 
it's all conjecture but make some
logical<00:04:22.960> sense<00:04:23.169> right<00:04:23.349> it's<00:04:23.469> logical<00:04:24.039> right

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
logical sense right it's logical right

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.620 
logical sense right it's logical right
because<00:04:24.580> you're<00:04:24.760> going<00:04:24.940> you're<00:04:25.120> feeling<00:04:25.510> out

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
because you're going you're feeling out

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.100 
because you're going you're feeling out
and<00:04:25.870> you're<00:04:26.139> allowing<00:04:26.349> your

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
and your muscle fibers to better

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.670 
and your muscle fibers to better
understand<00:04:29.599> the<00:04:29.750> mote<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.199> motion<00:04:30.560> that

understand the mote the motion that

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.589 
understand the mote the motion that
you're<00:04:30.800> asking<00:04:31.189> them<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.370> undergo<00:04:31.939> you're

you're asking them to undergo you're

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.300 
you're asking them to undergo you're
allowing<00:04:33.050> it's<00:04:33.560> like<00:04:33.770> basically<00:04:34.099> if<00:04:34.219> you're

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
allowing it's like basically if you're

trying to memorize a set of numbers

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.149 
trying to memorize a set of numbers
you're<00:04:35.930> letting<00:04:36.289> your<00:04:36.409> mind<00:04:36.680> see<00:04:36.979> those

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
you're letting your mind see those

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.529 
you're letting your mind see those
numbers<00:04:37.490> for<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.669> longer<00:04:38.090> period<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.479> time

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
numbers for a longer period of time

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.020 
numbers for a longer period of time
before<00:04:39.199> you<00:04:39.439> hide<00:04:39.620> them<00:04:39.800> right<00:04:40.189> so<00:04:40.430> it's<00:04:40.789> gonna

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
before you hide them right so it's gonna

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.790 
before you hide them right so it's gonna
click<00:04:41.599> faster<00:04:42.199> you're<00:04:42.409> going<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.590> you're

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
click faster you're going to you're

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.170 
click faster you're going to you're
going<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.949> ingrain<00:04:43.370> that<00:04:43.580> motor<00:04:43.789> pattern

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
going to ingrain that motor pattern

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.059 
going to ingrain that motor pattern
faster<00:04:44.840> than<00:04:44.990> you<00:04:45.080> would<00:04:45.259> with<00:04:45.710> normal

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069 
faster than you would with normal

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.070 
faster than you would with normal
repetitions<00:04:46.639> there<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.479> go<00:04:47.599> so<00:04:47.780> there's<00:04:47.960> the

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
repetitions there you go so there's the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.689 
repetitions there you go so there's the
answer<00:04:48.199> negatives<00:04:48.800> they're<00:04:48.919> not<00:04:49.069> bad<00:04:49.340> they're

answer negatives they're not bad they're

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.050 
answer negatives they're not bad they're
good<00:04:50.599> but<00:04:51.349> use<00:04:51.560> them<00:04:51.830> why<00:04:52.340> right<00:04:52.639> reasons
