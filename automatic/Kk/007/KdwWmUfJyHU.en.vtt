00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.950
 Counter Lucas Barrios still to the ball 2 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.660
 Meusburger back against him the screens 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.840
 Sudbury seems he can now after 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.840
 puts the ball in the second post 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.370
 and there we are not smaller 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.750
 May be a super 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.480
 There we were sitting as headquarters of the farm lives 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.150
 Chair Judge said a thyssenkrupp share without at least 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.030
 this series was 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.370
 Patrick Owomoyela 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.020
 and now Matt's Hummels looks on the left 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.610
 Now we have to wait for the husband 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.660
 that in the first game as it right foot with the ball in front of goal 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.470
 Gottwald still the leg 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.870
 wonderful flank 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.050
 Barrios 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.050
 and limited with a splendor parade 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.740
 Diego Benaglio 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.380
 his team 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350
 mind you 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.450
 from the right attack side 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.150
 Google, it seems from the web 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.600
 and there is another great future ahead this time it was Max Moritz 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.130
 the top 500 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.770
 the counterattack is not enough routine 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.680
 because of 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.900
 thus no danger Hamar 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.340
 that's 27 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 Roberts on it 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.470
 3 against Sebastian Kehl 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.940
 and this is 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.619
 the part is going to be now 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.449
 that's good 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.229
 that will be necessary too 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.039
 now there are more 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.039
 Now you know 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:28.310
 That is obvious 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.310
 red card »if I go on like this 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.599
 Sheridan 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.599
 Of course it will be difficult 50 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.629
 they did not seem to care 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:19.509
 it is 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.829
 the player wants to lure us 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.829
 this is IT 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.919
 sleep peacefully winter break 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.149
 cheaper as the report says 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:34.870
 who's on the gate today 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.029
 from Ben Ali »call 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.379
 they know where 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.859
 very close 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.169
 in the course of which will be so good 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.169
 almost to victory what are we 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.959
 that suits us 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.680
 and now the whole city 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.499
 actually is 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:50.499
 then they test us 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.110
