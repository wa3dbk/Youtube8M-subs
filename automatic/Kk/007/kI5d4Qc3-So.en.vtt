00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.940
 I have these pants before eternity 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.460
 bought in a secondhand shop 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.470
 She then 12 times and noticed that she 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.330
 unfortunately a bit too tight and me 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.009
 She still loved me so much 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.529
 she did not wear it anymore though 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.859
 she has kept eternal things 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.419
 and now I think it's time 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.490
 to make something out of it and me 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.960
 think it will look super cool though 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.310
 you just make a place out of it 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.910
 maybe you have something for you too 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.040
 fly around and want to join 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.170
 It is super easy and easy 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.290
 is very fast and I'll show you 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.820
 now this works for this 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.040
 Of course you need a pants shorts 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.850
 who like to change to a rock here 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.210
 would like a sewing machine years 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.140
 stock matching pins and pins 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.610
 schneider as a first step must 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.410
 of course, we put the pants on the left 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.930
 Turn page because we want to stay here 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.249
 make these remedies after and here 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.700
 we have to get started, so to speak 

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:10.679
 I fight so I separate all seams 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.679
 at this point a little bit 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:16.469
 to open up to the unbeaten 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.569
 I can do that with a sharp point 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.749
 because it's a lot easier 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:23.310
 think as with a trainer now 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:25.499
 I cut the chain near to 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.130
 another blow and so close 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:28.079
 as possible 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.369
 you can also approach the seam 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.590
 completely disconnect 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.950
 but that of course takes much longer 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.229
 and does not save so much the fabric 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.479
 Sewn at the second envelope will be then 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.880
 but again separated 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.530
 that's what the whole thing looks like now and that 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
 From this we will have to become one 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.639
 two front parts with each other 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.700
 sew on it we put these two 

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:53.429
 simply superimpose and fix 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.439
 you ever with a pin something 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.259
 we now have in principle is the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.479
 to take away and we do that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.850
 by putting the nato over the step 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.209
 is extending so that one straight 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.709
 line arises 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.200
 I draw this to me with a 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.909
 No one cuts one on it 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290
 that these then go at an angle 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.540
 becomes 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.519
 we reach that the skirt of a line 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.109
 you get the same then you do 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.180
 of course with the back 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:23.269
 but you have to pay attention to that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.760
 the line also approximately in 90 degrees 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.799
 angle on the rock meets with it 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.049
 not pointed at the back but also 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:35.420
 then look straight ahead with 2 3 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.340
 fix pins and now you can 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.069
 we recorded along our way 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.420
 line the rock go together 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.489
 Remember the seam at the beginning and at the beginning 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.189
 end with a few strokes to lock 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.470
 by going back and forth with it 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.819
 rock does not rise again 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.919
 You only need to reach the point 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.280
 take where he meets the middle sore 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.989
 that already exists then her animal 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.519
 maybe two more three stitches above it 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.599
 and thus creates a very clean 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.400
 transition as last step intersects 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.169
 just take off the overlapping fabric 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.790
 who wants to do it all, of course 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.250
 still with the overlack or one 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.980
 zigzag stitch enchanted or the seam 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.150
 Ironing apart then you turn the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.310
 Just rock around and ready and now 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.060
 I show you how the skirt dressed 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.060
 looks 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:45.450
 then give me in any case 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.030
 7 8 9 10 as many thumbs as possible 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.889
 up so one subscribed to my cello 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.170
 and say hello on facebook instagram 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:57.450
 thomas t shirt what i have on me 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.170
 also made and felt like that 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.120
 I totally work for you here 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.739
 somewhere where you can find this video 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.849
 if you are interested, have a look 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.659
 to make your own shirt 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.659
 until next time
