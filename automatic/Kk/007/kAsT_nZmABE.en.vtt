for<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.280> people<00:04:28.550> out<00:04:28.610> there<00:04:28.790> who<00:04:29.440> got<00:04:30.440> their

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
for the people out there who got their

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.520 
for the people out there who got their
head<00:04:30.770> crossed<00:04:31.120> why<00:04:32.120> Dean<00:04:32.420> does<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:32.870> if<00:04:33.440> you

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
head crossed why Dean does it if you

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.470 
head crossed why Dean does it if you
don't<00:04:33.710> have<00:04:33.950> to<00:04:34.010> put<00:04:34.130> back<00:04:34.250> on<00:04:34.400> properly<00:04:34.640> you

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
don't have to put back on properly you

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.600 
don't have to put back on properly you
get<00:04:35.630> no<00:04:35.780> signal<00:04:35.990> okay<00:04:36.710> basically<00:04:37.310> at<00:04:37.490> this

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
get no signal okay basically at this

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.030 
get no signal okay basically at this
point<00:04:37.910> in<00:04:38.150> here<00:04:38.360> there<00:04:38.510> is<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.750> antenna<00:04:39.440> plate

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
point in here there is a antenna plate

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.650 
point in here there is a antenna plate
which<00:04:40.340> boosts<00:04:40.670> the<00:04:40.790> signal<00:04:40.940> if<00:04:41.210> I<00:04:41.300> was<00:04:41.450> able<00:04:41.540> to

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
which boosts the signal if I was able to

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.750 
which boosts the signal if I was able to
pick<00:04:41.840> up<00:04:41.960> if<00:04:42.590> it's<00:04:42.800> not<00:04:42.860> snap<00:04:43.220> down<00:04:43.460> correctly

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
pick up if it's not snap down correctly

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.730 
pick up if it's not snap down correctly
the<00:04:44.150> contact<00:04:44.690> this<00:04:44.990> plate<00:04:45.260> will<00:04:45.440> not<00:04:45.590> touch

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
the contact this plate will not touch

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.650 
the contact this plate will not touch
the<00:04:45.950> board<00:04:46.160> therefore<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:46.970> phone<00:04:47.120> won't<00:04:47.510> get

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
the board therefore the phone won't get

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.370 
the board therefore the phone won't get
any<00:04:47.870> signal<00:04:48.110> or<00:04:48.500> will<00:04:48.800> get<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.130> very<00:04:49.370> bad<00:04:49.610> signal

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
any signal or will get a very bad signal

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.600 
any signal or will get a very bad signal
