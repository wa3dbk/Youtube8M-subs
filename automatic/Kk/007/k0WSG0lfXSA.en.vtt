more<00:00:47.199> exciting<00:00:47.769> we<00:00:48.280> focused<00:00:49.179> a<00:00:49.390> lot<00:00:49.749> on<00:00:50.010> their

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
more exciting we focused a lot on their

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.639 
more exciting we focused a lot on their
aerodynamic<00:00:51.449> aspect<00:00:52.449> of<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:52.809> because<00:00:53.199> it<00:00:53.410> does

aerodynamic aspect of it because it does

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.029 
aerodynamic aspect of it because it does
equate<00:00:54.249> to<00:00:54.519> fuel<00:00:55.239> efficiency<00:00:55.899> and<00:00:56.620> I<00:00:56.800> think

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
equate to fuel efficiency and I think

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.520 
equate to fuel efficiency and I think
this<00:00:57.159> is<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.370> beauty<00:00:57.879> about<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:59.079> we've<00:00:59.260> done

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
this is the beauty about what we've done

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
lot of this to come up with a product

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.520 
lot of this to come up with a product
that<00:01:05.280> looks<00:01:06.280> right<00:01:06.550> in<00:01:06.760> India<00:01:07.210> but<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:08.230> also

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
that looks right in India but it also

I'm<00:01:12.159> sure<00:01:12.550> that<00:01:12.850> this<00:01:13.060> design<00:01:13.540> it's<00:01:14.229> going<00:01:14.530> to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
I'm sure that this design it's going to

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.110 
I'm sure that this design it's going to
hit<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:14.890> market<00:01:15.130> it's<00:01:15.700> going<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:16.000> be

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
hit the market it's going to be

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.610 
hit the market it's going to be
something<00:01:16.390> completely<00:01:17.080> different<00:01:17.320> than

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
something completely different than

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.710 
something completely different than
everything<00:01:17.980> you<00:01:18.280> see<00:01:18.490> on<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.760> street<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.270> I

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
everything you see on the street and I

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.140 
everything you see on the street and I
think<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.680> brand's<00:01:21.130> equus<00:01:21.580> part<00:01:21.910> the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
think that the brand's equus part the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.020 
think that the brand's equus part the
nameplate<00:01:22.630> actor<00:01:23.110> sports<00:01:23.440> so<00:01:23.890> strong<00:01:24.340> that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
nameplate actor sports so strong that

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.720 
nameplate actor sports so strong that
it's<00:01:25.240> gonna<00:01:25.480> it's<00:01:25.810> going<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.200> help<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:26.590> lot<00:01:26.730> to
