00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
when they put this together so you can

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.760 
when they put this together so you can
use<00:04:59.920> this<00:05:00.480> as<00:05:01.480> a<00:05:01.980> as<00:05:02.980> a<00:05:03.280> defensive<00:05:03.790> tool<00:05:04.350> as<00:05:05.350> and

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
it's designed to be that way but it's

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.600 
it's designed to be that way but it's
also<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.360> really<00:05:07.690> nice<00:05:07.840> pen<00:05:08.260> to<00:05:08.740> use<00:05:09.010> as<00:05:09.250> a

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
also a really nice pen to use as a

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.180 
also a really nice pen to use as a
writing<00:05:09.910> instrument<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:11.320> a<00:05:11.410> lot<00:05:11.560> of<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.920> lot<00:05:12.100> of

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.880 
writing instrument and a lot of a lot of
tactical<00:05:12.550> pens<00:05:12.850> are<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.690> compromise<00:05:14.350> solution

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
tactical pens are a compromise solution

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.700 
tactical pens are a compromise solution
that<00:05:15.670> they<00:05:15.880> tend<00:05:16.150> to<00:05:16.210> lean<00:05:16.450> more<00:05:16.960> towards<00:05:17.500> the

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
that they tend to lean more towards the

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.740 
that they tend to lean more towards the
weapon<00:05:18.040> side<00:05:18.280> of<00:05:18.430> things<00:05:18.670> than<00:05:19.000> they<00:05:19.390> do<00:05:19.450> the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
weapon side of things than they do the

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.430 
weapon side of things than they do the
writing<00:05:20.530> and<00:05:20.800> usage<00:05:21.370> side<00:05:21.810> but<00:05:22.810> but<00:05:23.140> this

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
writing and usage side but but this

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.340 
writing and usage side but but this
seems<00:05:23.740> to<00:05:23.920> strike<00:05:24.130> a<00:05:24.190> nice<00:05:24.430> balance<00:05:24.910> and

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
seems to strike a nice balance and

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.620 
seems to strike a nice balance and
functions<00:05:26.350> in<00:05:26.500> in<00:05:27.160> both<00:05:27.400> both<00:05:28.030> capacities

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
functions in in both both capacities

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.600 
functions in in both both capacities
very<00:05:28.900> well<00:05:30.900> it's<00:05:31.900> got<00:05:32.020> a<00:05:32.050> nice<00:05:32.200> nice<00:05:32.920> clip<00:05:33.280> if

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
very well it's got a nice nice clip if

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.250 
very well it's got a nice nice clip if
you<00:05:33.760> want<00:05:33.910> to<00:05:33.970> clip<00:05:34.180> this<00:05:34.390> to<00:05:34.450> your<00:05:34.750> pocket<00:05:35.140> or

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.700 
your pants pocket
times<00:05:41.680> tends<00:05:42.100> to<00:05:42.220> work<00:05:42.340> pretty<00:05:42.400> well<00:05:43.710> pretty

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
times tends to work pretty well pretty

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.200 
times tends to work pretty well pretty
stiff<00:05:47.550> that's<00:05:48.550> probably<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.030> least

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
stiff that's probably the least

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.480 
stiff that's probably the least
attractive<00:05:49.900> feature<00:05:50.110> in<00:05:50.380> my<00:05:50.500> opinion<00:05:50.530> on<00:05:51.040> the

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
attractive feature in my opinion on the

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.940 
attractive feature in my opinion on the
pen<00:05:51.730> is<00:05:51.910> the<00:05:52.000> pocket<00:05:52.990> clip<00:05:53.350> but<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:53.650> does<00:05:53.800> the

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
pen is the pocket clip but it does the

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.400 
pen is the pocket clip but it does the
job<00:05:54.130> and<00:05:54.460> you<00:05:55.270> know<00:05:55.390> color<00:05:55.630> coordinates<00:05:56.200> well

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
job and you know color coordinates well

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.250 
job and you know color coordinates well
enough<00:05:56.680> with<00:05:56.920> the<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:57.370> black<00:05:57.780> metal<00:05:58.780> oh<00:05:59.020> ring
