was actually gorge and I condrey did
respond<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.340> confirm<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.000> good<00:01:36.299> so

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
respond and confirm that it was good so

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.090 
respond and confirm that it was good so
we<00:01:36.659> did<00:01:36.810> actually<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:37.259> slightly<00:01:37.770> more<00:01:37.979> would

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
we did actually know slightly more would

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.679 
we did actually know slightly more would
look<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> did<00:01:38.790> watch<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.150> video<00:01:39.420> and

now we're gonna get a full look at this

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.160 
now we're gonna get a full look at this
map<00:01:41.490> which<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.150> really<00:01:42.420> cool<00:01:42.659> actual

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
multiplayer gameplay which is really

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.700 
multiplayer gameplay which is really
exciting<00:01:45.119> you've<00:01:45.509> got<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:46.110> panoramic

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
exciting you've got like like panoramic

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.560 
exciting you've got like like panoramic
view<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> map<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:47.909> takes<00:01:48.329> place

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
view of the map right here takes place

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.440 
view of the map right here takes place
on<00:01:48.750> Atlas<00:01:49.439> M<00:01:49.740> kind<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.159> Chinese<00:01:50.549> damn<00:01:50.850> facility

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
on Atlas M kind of Chinese damn facility

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.899 
on Atlas M kind of Chinese damn facility
and<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.320> exactly<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.040> same<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.310> pipeline

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
and it is exactly the same as pipeline

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
and it is exactly the same as pipeline
you<00:01:54.060> would<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.509> love<00:01:54.659> except<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.409> looks

you would know and love except it looks

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.139 
you would know and love except it looks
completely<00:01:55.799> different<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> game

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
completely different but in the game

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.910 
completely different but in the game
mechanics<00:01:57.630> there's<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.990> lot<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.229> similarities

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
mechanics there's a lot of similarities

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.139 
mechanics there's a lot of similarities
you'll<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.219> right<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.579> one<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> new

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
you'll see right here one of the new

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.880 
you'll see right here one of the new
things<00:02:00.180> you'll<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.200> thing<00:02:01.439> such<00:02:01.649> as

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
things you'll see is this thing such as

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.590 
things you'll see is this thing such as
at<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.280> crane<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.180> which<00:02:03.299> looks<00:02:03.329> very

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
at the crane right here which looks very

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.209 
at the crane right here which looks very
interesting<00:02:03.899> there<00:02:04.500> appears<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.920> crane

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
interesting there appears to be a crane

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.580 
interesting there appears to be a crane
carrying<00:02:05.700> some<00:02:05.939> giant<00:02:06.329> tube<00:02:06.570> at<00:02:06.840> cylindrical

carrying some giant tube at cylindrical
structure<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.250> appears<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.060> actually

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
structure and appears you can actually

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.969 
structure and appears you can actually
hop<00:02:09.569> inside<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> player<00:02:10.500> does<00:02:10.709> right<00:02:10.950> here

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
hop inside as the player does right here

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.890 
hop inside as the player does right here
it<00:02:11.220> hops<00:02:11.400> inside<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.970> kind<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.510> nice<00:02:12.690> little

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it hops inside it kind of a nice little

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.690 
it hops inside it kind of a nice little

they work this is the EPM 3 laser weapon

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.059 
they work this is the EPM 3 laser weapon
and<00:02:41.480> that's<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.260> course<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.560> second<00:02:42.920> laser

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
and that's of course the second laser

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.990 
weapon has opposed to the em1 and you
can<00:02:45.830> see<00:02:45.920> even<00:02:46.099> more<00:02:46.340> lasers<00:02:46.670> going<00:02:46.910> on

can see even more lasers going on
there's<00:02:47.180> actually<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.540> Vulcan<00:02:47.959> kill<00:02:48.170> streak

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
there's actually the Vulcan kill streak

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.140 
there's actually the Vulcan kill streak
which<00:02:48.769> fires<00:02:49.010> huge<00:02:49.340> laser<00:02:49.610> beam<00:02:49.790> down<00:02:49.970> from

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
down which is an attachment module you

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.720 
down which is an attachment module you
can<00:02:53.510> add<00:02:53.780> four<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.230> think<00:02:54.290> maybe<00:02:54.829> 100<00:02:55.340> 200

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
points you can add three rotating lasers

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.530 
points you can add three rotating lasers
around<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.610> original<00:02:59.030> ones<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.329> lots<00:02:59.480> of

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
around the original ones and lots of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.330 
around the original ones and lots of

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
lasers in advanced warfare it's going to

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.490 
lasers in advanced warfare it's going to
be<00:03:01.400> epic<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:02.480> moving<00:03:02.690> into<00:03:02.930> more<00:03:03.349> the

capture<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.019> flag<00:03:06.049> being<00:03:06.470> played<00:03:06.799> and<00:03:07.010> then

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
capture the flag being played and then

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.190 
capture the flag being played and then
as<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.269> kind<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.599> advance<00:03:08.900> through<00:03:09.110> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
as you kind of advance through the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.479 
as you kind of advance through the
building<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.530> see<00:03:09.560> this<00:03:09.950> thing<00:03:10.220> flying

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
building you see this thing flying

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.800 
building you see this thing flying
across<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.910> screen<00:03:11.060> what<00:03:11.299> is<00:03:11.420> this<00:03:11.599> thing

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
across the screen what is this thing

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.809 
across the screen what is this thing
it's<00:03:12.049> actually<00:03:12.530> an<00:03:12.590> aerial<00:03:12.890> assault<00:03:13.489> drone<00:03:13.760> a

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
it's actually an aerial assault drone a

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.850 
it's actually an aerial assault drone a
killstreak<00:03:14.569> that<00:03:14.810> hasn't<00:03:15.140> been<00:03:15.260> shown<00:03:15.620> up<00:03:15.739> in

killstreak that hasn't been shown up in
early<00:03:16.130> builds<00:03:16.459> but<00:03:16.579> is<00:03:16.730> actually<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.180> full

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
early builds but is actually the full

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.180 
early builds but is actually the full
version<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.019> game<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.920> don't<00:03:19.100> actually

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
version of the game and I don't actually

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.129 
version of the game and I don't actually
know<00:03:19.430> what<00:03:19.730> its<00:03:19.880> role<00:03:20.090> is<00:03:20.299> specifically<00:03:20.870> what

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
know what its role is specifically what

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.690 
know what its role is specifically what
it<00:03:21.200> does<00:03:21.470> normally<00:03:22.010> but<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.190> know<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.400> one<00:03:22.670> of

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
it does normally but I know that one of

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.129 
it does normally but I know that one of
the<00:03:22.819> attachments<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.359> can<00:03:23.540> add<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:23.989> is

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
the attachments you can add to it is

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.020 
the attachments you can add to it is
that<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.590> lasts<00:03:24.829> longer<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.280> another<00:03:25.670> one<00:03:25.850> is

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
that it lasts longer and another one is

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.789 
that it lasts longer and another one is
you<00:03:26.329> can<00:03:26.480> add<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:26.690> natural<00:03:27.019> machine<00:03:27.350> gun<00:03:27.620> which

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
you can add a natural machine gun which

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.259 
you can add a natural machine gun which
you<00:03:27.920> will<00:03:28.040> see<00:03:28.069> a<00:03:28.220> little<00:03:28.549> bit<00:03:28.670> later<00:03:28.910> in<00:03:29.150> this

kind of a low-end assault killstreak
right<00:03:34.819> here<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.180> they're<00:03:35.720> moving<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:36.139> we<00:03:36.290> can

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
right here and they're moving on we can

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.979 
right here and they're moving on we can
see<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.889> ak-12<00:03:37.639> in<00:03:37.970> action<00:03:38.239> this<00:03:38.450> thing<00:03:38.750> has

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
see the ak-12 in action this thing has

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.259 
see the ak-12 in action this thing has
really<00:03:39.410> really<00:03:40.010> low<00:03:40.340> recourse<00:03:40.850> almost<00:03:41.120> like<00:03:41.209> a

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
really really low recourse almost like a

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:42.789 
really really low recourse almost like a
laser<00:03:41.480> beam<00:03:41.720> off<00:03:41.840> interesting<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.290> see<00:03:42.410> how

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
laser beam off interesting to see how

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.500 
laser beam off interesting to see how
actually<00:03:43.130> works<00:03:43.340> in<00:03:43.579> the<00:03:43.760> actual<00:03:43.970> multiplayer

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
actually works in the actual multiplayer

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.150 
actually works in the actual multiplayer
whether<00:03:44.690> it's<00:03:44.810> very<00:03:45.019> weak<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.440> compensate<00:03:45.950> for

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
whether it's very weak to compensate for

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.440 
whether it's very weak to compensate for
that<00:03:46.190> but<00:03:46.639> I<00:03:46.670> can<00:03:46.819> tell<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.060> now<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:47.420> thing

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
that but I can tell you now this thing

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.809 
that but I can tell you now this thing
is<00:03:47.660> very<00:03:48.170> very<00:03:48.530> accurate<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.220> up<00:03:49.430> interested

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
is very very accurate and up interested

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.729 
is very very accurate and up interested
see<00:03:50.000> as<00:03:50.389> I<00:03:50.420> said<00:03:50.750> how<00:03:50.959> actually<00:03:51.350> works<00:03:51.530> out

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
see as I said how actually works out

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.229 
see as I said how actually works out
whether<00:03:52.040> it's<00:03:52.250> actually<00:03:52.549> a<00:03:52.579> balanced<00:03:52.910> weapon

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
whether it's actually a balanced weapon

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.610 
whether it's actually a balanced weapon
whether<00:03:53.420> it's<00:03:53.569> very<00:03:53.780> very<00:03:54.019> strong<00:03:54.319> one<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.530> the

whether it's very very strong one of the
best<00:03:54.769> weapons<00:03:55.069> the<00:03:55.160> game<00:03:55.340> perhaps<00:03:55.549> and<00:03:55.940> if

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
best weapons the game perhaps and if

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.849 
best weapons the game perhaps and if
it's<00:03:56.540> definitely<00:03:56.840> assault<00:03:57.049> rifle<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.530> keep<00:03:57.709> an

actually<00:04:09.859> going<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.069> people<00:04:10.250> down<00:04:10.370> very

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
actually going to people down very

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.550 
actually going to people down very
similar<00:04:10.940> dragon<00:04:11.239> fire<00:04:11.450> in<00:04:11.660> black<00:04:12.139> ops<00:04:12.319> 2<00:04:12.410> is

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
similar dragon fire in black ops 2 is

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.750 
similar dragon fire in black ops 2 is
quite<00:04:12.769> literal<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.310> it's<00:04:13.430> probably<00:04:13.700> very

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
quite literal and it's probably very

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.550 
quite literal and it's probably very
weak<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:14.329> there<00:04:14.750> can<00:04:14.900> be<00:04:14.930> shut<00:04:15.139> down<00:04:15.169> easily

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
weak and there can be shut down easily

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.020 
weak and there can be shut down easily
out<00:04:15.769> imagining<00:04:16.190> because<00:04:16.340> it<00:04:16.459> is<00:04:16.519> very<00:04:16.549> low-end

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
out imagining because it is very low-end

out imagining because it is very low-end
killstreak<00:04:17.780> but<00:04:18.200> then<00:04:18.470> this<00:04:18.650> thing<00:04:18.889> is<00:04:18.979> mowing

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
killstreak but then this thing is mowing

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.979 
killstreak but then this thing is mowing
down<00:04:19.639> some<00:04:19.700> people<00:04:20.180> in<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.479> tunnels<00:04:20.810> right

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
down some people in the tunnels right

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.089 
down some people in the tunnels right
here<00:04:21.169> then<00:04:21.470> we<00:04:21.590> can<00:04:21.680> see<00:04:21.769> even<00:04:22.010> more

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
here then we can see even more

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.649 
here then we can see even more
killstreak<00:04:22.550> action<00:04:22.849> we<00:04:22.970> can<00:04:23.090> see<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.330> bombing

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
killstreak action we can see the bombing

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
Twitter if forum on Twitter I post a lot

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.430 
Twitter if forum on Twitter I post a lot
of<00:04:26.690> information

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
of information

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.710 
of information
about<00:04:28.010> stuff<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.550> one<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.120> them<00:04:29.240> was<00:04:29.390> that<00:04:29.570> we

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
about stuff and one of them was that we

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.480 
about stuff and one of them was that we
got<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:30.020> see<00:04:30.140> a<00:04:30.170> glimpse<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.620> these<00:04:30.890> which<00:04:31.310> is<00:04:31.340> a

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
got to see a glimpse of these which is a

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.760 
got to see a glimpse of these which is a
bombing<00:04:31.760> run<00:04:31.970> which<00:04:32.210> is<00:04:32.360> roughly<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.810> 700<00:04:33.590> point

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
bombing run which is roughly a 700 point

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.350 
bombing run which is roughly a 700 point
streak<00:04:34.040> i<00:04:34.160> believe<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.610> it's<00:04:34.910> essentially<00:04:35.300> a

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
streak i believe and it's essentially a

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.000 
streak i believe and it's essentially a
strafe<00:04:35.840> run<00:04:36.110> almost<00:04:36.290> like<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.560> stealth<00:04:36.890> bomber

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
strafe run almost like a stealth bomber

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.250 
strafe run almost like a stealth bomber
that<00:04:37.700> just<00:04:37.910> drops<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.300> long<00:04:38.690> series<00:04:39.080> of

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
that just drops a long series of

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.320 
that just drops a long series of
missiles<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.100> bombs<00:04:40.310> all<00:04:40.550> over<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:41.060> map<00:04:41.150> and

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
missiles and bombs all over the map and

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.570 
missiles and bombs all over the map and
come<00:04:41.450> like<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.600> carpet<00:04:42.050> bomb<00:04:42.260> fashion<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:42.890> it

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
come like a carpet bomb fashion and it

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.640 
come like a carpet bomb fashion and it
just<00:04:43.760> seems<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.120> bomb<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.540> lot<00:04:44.870> of<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.260> map<00:04:45.470> and

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
just seems to bomb a lot of the map and

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.780 
just seems to bomb a lot of the map and
you<00:04:45.710> can<00:04:45.890> definitely<00:04:46.190> get<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.340> lot<00:04:46.400> of<00:04:46.550> damage

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
you can definitely get a lot of damage

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.090 
you can definitely get a lot of damage
done<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.300> then<00:04:48.050> even<00:04:48.230> more<00:04:48.410> we<00:04:48.620> can<00:04:48.740> see<00:04:48.920> of

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
done and then even more we can see of

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.500 
done and then even more we can see of
this<00:04:49.220> guy<00:04:49.400> boosting<00:04:49.970> around<00:04:50.150> there's<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:50.390> lot

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
this guy boosting around there's a lot

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.150 
this guy boosting around there's a lot
of<00:04:50.540> lasers<00:04:50.900> even<00:04:51.110> more<00:04:51.380> lasers<00:04:51.770> going<00:04:52.040> on

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
of lasers even more lasers going on

of lasers even more lasers going on
right<00:04:52.280> here<00:04:52.310> there's<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.670> lot<00:04:52.850> of<00:04:52.880> emphasis<00:04:53.450> on

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
right here there's a lot of emphasis on

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.030 
right here there's a lot of emphasis on
the<00:04:53.690> laser<00:04:53.870> weapons<00:04:54.290> in<00:04:54.440> this<00:04:54.560> trailer<00:04:54.800> it's

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
the laser weapons in this trailer it's

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.380 
the laser weapons in this trailer it's
really<00:04:55.280> cool<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.490> can't<00:04:55.730> wait<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:55.910> try<00:04:56.180> them<00:04:56.300> out

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
really cool I can't wait to try them out

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.540 
really cool I can't wait to try them out
myself<00:04:56.570> you<00:04:57.320> can<00:04:57.440> see<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.890> lots<00:04:58.400> of

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
myself you can see the lots of

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.250 
myself you can see the lots of
multicolored<00:04:59.120> lasers<00:04:59.510> coming<00:04:59.780> from<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.230> left

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
multicolored lasers coming from the left

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.870 
multicolored lasers coming from the left
hand<00:05:00.650> side<00:05:00.710> of<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:00.980> screen<00:05:01.040> those<00:05:01.640> are<00:05:01.850> the

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
hand side of the screen those are the

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.050 
hand side of the screen those are the
EPM<00:05:02.360> one<00:05:02.690> there's<00:05:03.050> also<00:05:03.230> a<00:05:03.440> red<00:05:03.950> e-m1<00:05:04.340> laser<00:05:04.790> in

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
EPM one there's also a red e-m1 laser in

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.150 
EPM one there's also a red e-m1 laser in
there<00:05:05.210> which<00:05:05.360> is<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.570> basic<00:05:05.960> one<00:05:06.170> and<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:07.040> one

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
there which is the basic one and the one

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.530 
there which is the basic one and the one
that<00:05:07.280> this<00:05:07.400> guy's<00:05:07.610> firing<00:05:08.030> right<00:05:08.180> here<00:05:08.330> on<00:05:08.420> the

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
that this guy's firing right here on the

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.540 
that this guy's firing right here on the
right<00:05:08.750> is<00:05:08.960> there<00:05:09.380> actually<00:05:09.740> yellow<00:05:10.100> and<00:05:10.340> this

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
right is there actually yellow and this

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.970 
right is there actually yellow and this
I<00:05:10.700> believe<00:05:10.910> is<00:05:11.090> a<00:05:11.330> variant<00:05:11.810> of<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.170> em1<00:05:12.470> I<00:05:12.710> know

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
I believe is a variant of the em1 I know

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.380 
I believe is a variant of the em1 I know
there<00:05:13.130> are<00:05:13.160> a<00:05:13.250> few<00:05:13.400> variances<00:05:13.880> of<00:05:13.940> red<00:05:14.180> laser

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
there are a few variances of red laser

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.060 
there are a few variances of red laser
which<00:05:14.570> is<00:05:14.690> basic<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.590> default<00:05:15.920> one

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
which is basic and the default one

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.710 
which is basic and the default one
there's<00:05:16.280> also<00:05:16.430> a<00:05:16.640> different<00:05:17.000> variant<00:05:17.510> from<00:05:17.660> a

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
there's also a different variant from a

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.450 
there's also a different variant from a
Supply<00:05:18.020> Drop<00:05:18.080> which<00:05:18.350> is<00:05:18.500> green<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.010> there's

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
Supply Drop which is green and there's

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.980 
Supply Drop which is green and there's
also<00:05:19.670> a<00:05:19.850> different<00:05:20.090> variant<00:05:20.540> which<00:05:20.630> is<00:05:20.750> blue

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
also a different variant which is blue

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.720 
also a different variant which is blue
and<00:05:21.170> as<00:05:21.650> we<00:05:21.860> can<00:05:21.980> see<00:05:22.100> right<00:05:22.280> here<00:05:22.430> there's<00:05:22.610> one

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
and as we can see right here there's one

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.100 
and as we can see right here there's one
that<00:05:22.970> is<00:05:23.060> yellow<00:05:23.360> as<00:05:23.510> well<00:05:23.690> as<00:05:23.870> lots<00:05:24.020> of

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
that is yellow as well as lots of

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.690 
that is yellow as well as lots of
different<00:05:24.320> colors<00:05:24.530> on<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:25.010> actual<00:05:25.220> laser

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
different colors on the actual laser
