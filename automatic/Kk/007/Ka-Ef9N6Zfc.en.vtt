00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
and again a trained we got caught on a

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.999 
and again a trained we got caught on a
stick<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.429> do<00:01:35.550> it<00:01:35.670> again<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.960> lost<00:01:37.229> because

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
stick to do it again and we lost because

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.490 
stick to do it again and we lost because
of<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> rain<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.960> said<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.080> couldn't<00:01:40.289> have<00:01:40.470> won

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
of the rain I said we couldn't have won

of the rain I said we couldn't have won
the<00:01:40.800> match<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.250> least<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.580> think<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.820> could

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the match but at least I think we could

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.910 
the match but at least I think we could
have<00:01:42.210> saved<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:43.229> could<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.470> had<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> draw

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
have saved it we could have had a draw

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.410 
have saved it we could have had a draw
but<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> Ryan<00:01:45.330> we<00:01:45.690> were<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.080> now

because of the ride we won two waxes

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.409 
because of the ride we won two waxes
because<00:04:16.590> of<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.829> Ryan<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.940> fifth<00:04:18.180> one

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
any rain we won that on their motors so

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.850 
any rain we won that on their motors so
I<00:04:23.639> think<00:04:23.730> the<00:04:24.000> final<00:04:24.150> result<00:04:24.630> was<00:04:25.320> a<00:04:25.380> fair
