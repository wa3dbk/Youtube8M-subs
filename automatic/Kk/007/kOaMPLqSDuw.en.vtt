00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.879
 kids today directory king and today I'm going to 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.500
 have a pretty short video on the 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.200
 that maybe we solve some doubt about 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.509
 some next dlc or something like that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.360
 well I do not know if you will remember but in the 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:22.119
 video that kevin sherwood climbed on the 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.830
 theme song luca where are we go had 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.560
 a fragment of the song I do not remember 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.080
 well there for the minute 1 in which 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.369
 several letters appeared that at the beginning 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.369
 they seemed a lot of sense 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.990
 well as you can see these are the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.060
 letters in question that appeared in the 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.530
 beat and that good at first the 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.449
 people 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.969
 use the hypothesis that they would have 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.899
 to see those related to DNA and 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.690
 it's true that I was doing very badly 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.850
 directed but it turns out that lately 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.489
 that ben sherwood through his account 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.350
 of twitter through its description of 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.870
 Youtube videos specifically in the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.320
 video of the song seems to be that 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.630
 gone adding small tracks minister 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.340
 ex so to speak in which we can 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.340
 Easily solve the unknown 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.610
 so kevin gave us all the letters 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.860
 what we need to decipher the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.410
 message and finally it's a time 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.440
 Looking for some sense it seems that 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.000
 a final conclusion has been reached 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.980
 I am all final it was very simple 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.480
 you just had to replace the letters 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.300
 that had given us kevin why 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.980
 there were hidden messages and in the end it seems 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.730
 be that we have a pretty phrase 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.730
 interesting 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.020
 the resulting phrase after changing all 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.990
 the letters if it makes sense says well let 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.090
 go and the beginning welcome well 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.490
 translated well into Spanish so 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.560
 basic English would be something like let it go 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.930
 and the beginning will again become 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.970
 the end this can create quite 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.890
 enough theory to the sunna for example 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.509
 it could be that we can go back over 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.820
 a tote no or do raid where that air 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.960
 that started everything and well I hope that I 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.700
 put it in the comments too 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.950
 can you tell me your theories what 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.769
 you think about the video I think I'm from the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.260
 few Spanish-speaking youtubers that has 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.950
 uploaded good that has come up what comes 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.690
 being the translation of the phrase and everything 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.110
 the price this and I hope you have it 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.110
 account 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.060
 the fund I have a game that has 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.060
 borrowed my colleague tim h 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.950
 it's pretty good 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.810
 It has been all for today I hope you have 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.959
 liked the video as always and even the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.959
 next 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.180
 today
