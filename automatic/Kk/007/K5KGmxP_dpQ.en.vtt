00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 Hello friends today, I want you 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.350
 show how to make such a sign from 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.200
 fabrics 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.990
 this is a cartoon sign 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.830
 he is called to leave the bill he is very easy 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.189
 very simple for work we need two 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.710
 square piece of fabric on one upper 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.869
 I will have a little yellowish 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.330
 such a shade and the bottom can be any 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.420
 color in the middle and thin synthetic winterizer 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.340
 or fleece but matching colors you 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.660
 you can pick up yourself but the songs 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.899
 orange yellow will fit reds 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.800
 here again, but I prepared the hand such 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:49.070
 the pieces here I have white tie 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:54.030
 blue is something like calico or is it on top 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.340
 here are 3 4 4 pieces of cloth upper this 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.370
 there will be a sign that is these here 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.260
 fingers will be like a zero toe glove 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.110
 mean we do 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.110
 combined all these three layers laid like 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.570
 we need to have these here 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.290
 fingers fell on this one 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.250
 a piece of cloth and shear it all together 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.760
 with paper 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:25.030
 needles all layers 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:28.770
 in the corners and the blue layer of the fabric all pinned up 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.770
 at may 10 on the palm 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.190
 now we just take all these lines 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.340
 in the picture just stitching on 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.340
 typewriter 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.660
 need to 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.730
 now all the paper we need to hit 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.600
 we break it from here and it remains with us 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.600
 only fabric 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.320
 and we will need to change the settings on 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.830
 typewriter translate into zigzag I have it on 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.010
 twos on this stitch length adjuster 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.460
 exhibiting 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.150
 mark buttonhole well that is 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:20.020
 stitch most often should be here too 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:25.380
 stitch width 5 millimeters i.e. 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.380
 there will be a wide zigzag frequent but wide 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.610
 let's see what happens here to me 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.970
 it seems you can still move the regulator 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.600
 make even thicker stitches 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.600
 I'm going to try now 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.080
 but 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.910
 here you see the contour a little more 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.750
 rarely sewn wild field rare to wear 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.910
 bullet thick 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.419
 I think what needs to be done here too 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.510
 thick zigzag because this canyon and 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.820
 it's pretty loose so I don't have 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.960
 began to bloom all this work i 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:43.710
 I will go around again in a circle these fingers 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:46.680
 thicker zigzag and now we need 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.800
 cut the whole contour with scissors 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.979
 the remaining fabric is careful not to 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.710
 cut the threads themselves fabric itself under 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.500
 the substrate does not touch the scissors 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.860
 neatly by control we cut our 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.860
 little fingers 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.180
 like these two characters for SIM cards for 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.950
 We had a toe can sew them 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.370
 on the suit to do so more 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:22.760
 A similar image can be on the backpack on 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.710
 helper sew and snook himself this to 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.230
 print it out you can 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.120
 I invite you to download the site 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.220
 subscribe to the channel because ahead 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.630
 there will still be a lot of interesting and topic 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.020
 fixes not closed 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:40.180
 well, everything else that I do you 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.180
