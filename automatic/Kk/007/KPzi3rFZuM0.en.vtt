 Milan 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.380
 new 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.370
 online newspaper - milano 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.880
 we are in milan in the university lecture hall 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.200
 where the 25th congress of biological medicine is being held 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.270
 msn daraio and it is a great pride for us also represents 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.610
 the completion of a journey that began 25 years ago 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.650
 when our restaurant is purely inherent to the agency territorial homeopathy 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.790
 many conferences on medicine 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.060
 ahhh 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.090
 I as vice president of the cultural research commission of 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.390
 Chamber of Deputies I hope that Italy, which has remained one of the nation's chains 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.390
 is the true and the directive is completely transposed 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.890
 also passes in Italy to get nickel that there is registration is the gazette 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.060
 such you must 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.640
 in order to form giving the new drugs is not for you 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.620
 it's definitely important 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.910
 first of all you see him behind me a Nobel prize villa for the 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.970
 medicine professor lots nauta my synonymous with spending there are two 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.190
 aspects the theoretical aspect that poses a great problem on the relationships between the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.069
 physics and biology 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.749
 the structure of the matter of water and magnetic waves but also of the 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.249
 practical applications 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:25.230
 iv. the message of the water is to make us understand that a liquid 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:29.349
 extraordinary, very present in the re video universe that is not liquid 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.959
 it has the physical properties that we expect and many of us think 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.989
 that can create internal structures as a kind of matter seeds that 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.900
 have very different properties and in particular that can hold the 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.069
 memory of some biological molecules 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.589
 these lives have found an experimental verification 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:53.289
 nlt measurements made in the laboratory segments of antibacterial DNA 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.829
 and can emit electromagnetic radiation that can be 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.749
 detect with diplomas what electric dipoles are called 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.239
 and the water molecules the water molecule is an electric dipole 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.979
 and then we went out when it is hit by radiation 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:15.719
 electromagnetic acts like an antenna receiving the water of matter 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:20.379
 some tooth moves exactly like a perfectly framed scam 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.909
 and this under the ribs allows you to do a set of extraordinary things 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.729
 it may be possible today to experience the experience of mountain pressure 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:36.289
 and identifying pathogens revealing the electromagnetic radiation that is 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:37.479
 put 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:42.609
 we see in this research the beginning of a shower design and find these signals 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.639
 that come from water nanostructures equally in the plasma of people who 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.520
 suffer from chronic diseases 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.530
 in particular those of the ark idv and of pathologies related to the timer from 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.430
 parkinson rheumatoid polyarthritis and also in psychiatric disorders such as 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.310
 starting from this stage we will be able to create diagnostic methods 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.310
 it is perhaps a day of treatments 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.650
 they will come out hepatic may benefit from this quest 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.039
 can understand its working mechanisms 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:18.410
 all this happens because the water can keep the information of the molecules 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:19.340
 biological 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.510
 and I think that in fact it has been the one that for many years has been found a little 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.400
 empirically from homeopathy 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.300
 problem the message is a problem the sims 3 version for king medicine 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.150
 alberobello it is clear that how many molecules are important but if I have to give 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.729
 an information the basella both spa brescia also aloud the dosage 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.090
 important the important thing is what I say 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.440
 today statement 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.750
 dr. a very long journey and finally the list goes above all 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.990
 in this congress 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.190
 of what concerns integration homeopathy and bass medicine 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.199
 dosages you can have an already now how to say 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.789
 some humane homeopathic medicines that protect all effects and are intelligent 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.029
 the most sex hyenas. he spat out the physical laws of the body that highly 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:11.349
 organized 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.259
 lowering the dosage of favor also in other parts of the world 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.510
 other researchers are coming 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.719
 to the same conclusions 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:25.589
 these homeopathic remedies are also water based systems 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.520
 to me it seems that when a remedy is composed for example of granules of 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.289
 lactose does not have the sheik lactose per se to cure the water a 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.240
 to transmit to him the previously destabilized properties is 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.900
 discharged from procession scilla tori and subsequently absorbed by the dose 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.849
 hotel aqua if an essential negative number 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:50.879
 to those who say no 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.879
 best wishes in the center of apple seen 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:56.110
 how to see if you have any ideas
