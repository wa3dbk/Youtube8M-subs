things to it anyway what I did was jack
up<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.399> car<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:33.300> jack<00:00:33.690> stands<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:35.149> then

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
up the car on jack stands and then

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.080 
up the car on jack stands and then
remove<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:38.930> sway<00:00:39.930> bar<00:00:40.140> or<00:00:40.470> torsion<00:00:40.950> bar<00:00:41.130> right

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
remove the sway bar or torsion bar right

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.960 
remove the sway bar or torsion bar right
here<00:00:42.740> do<00:00:43.740> you<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:44.220> that<00:00:44.370> how<00:00:44.580> to<00:00:44.610> turn<00:00:44.880> the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
here do you do that how to turn the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.110 
here do you do that how to turn the
wheels<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.720> right<00:00:46.700> undo<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.000> also

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
wheels to the right undo that and also

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.610 
wheels to the right undo that and also
jack<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:48.600> both<00:00:48.720> sides<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.110> cars<00:00:49.290> there's<00:00:49.530> no

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
jack up both sides of cars there's no

jack up both sides of cars there's no
torsion<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.430> bar<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.970> then<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.900> comes

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
torsion on the bar and then that comes

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.960 
torsion on the bar and then that comes
off<00:00:52.260> easy<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.040> turn<00:00:53.250> wheels<00:00:53.579> back<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
off easy and that turn wheels back to

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.170 
off easy and that turn wheels back to
the<00:00:54.060> left<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:55.260> steering<00:00:55.650> but<00:00:56.579> when<00:00:56.910> doing

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the left the steering but when doing

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.390 
the left the steering but when doing
that<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.360> was<00:00:57.780> careful<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.500> pinch<00:00:59.130> any

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
that I was careful to not pinch any

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.930 
that I was careful to not pinch any
parts<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:01.290> harrassing<00:01:02.010> will<00:01:02.220> bend<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.790> any

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
parts the harrassing will bend up any

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.660 
parts the harrassing will bend up any
parts<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.360> there<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.019> way<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.579> if<00:01:05.579> they

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
parts of there in the way so if they

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.389 
parts of there in the way so if they
turn<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.030> back<00:01:06.829> once<00:01:07.829> I<00:01:07.860> got<00:01:08.009> that<00:01:08.159> back<00:01:08.369> I

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
turn that back once I got that back I

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:11.060 
turn that back once I got that back I
was<00:01:08.670> able<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> suspension<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.680> roll

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
was able to get the suspension to roll

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.480 
was able to get the suspension to roll
out<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.460> way<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.890> get<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> strut<00:01:14.340> out

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490

three bullets were undone on top one
bolt<00:01:18.030> down<00:01:18.210> below<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:20.030> then<00:01:21.350> of<00:01:22.350> course<00:01:22.409> I'd

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
bolt down below and then of course I'd

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.580 
bolt down below and then of course I'd
do<00:01:22.920> your<00:01:23.250> upper<00:01:23.850> control<00:01:24.570> arm<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:25.110> ball

easy thank goodness well the tricky

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.390 
easy thank goodness well the tricky
parts<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.690> to<00:01:37.190> this<00:01:38.190> upper<00:01:38.700> arm<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:40.400> rubber

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
parts is to this upper arm is the rubber

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.359 
parts is to this upper arm is the rubber
spring<00:01:41.970> loads<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:43.260> it<00:01:43.920> states<00:01:44.159> quite<00:01:44.280> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
spring loads it and it states quite a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.910 
spring loads it and it states quite a
bit<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.549> force<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.150> used<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.360> jack

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
bit of force to get up so used to jack

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.469 
bit of force to get up so used to jack
jack<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.310> then<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.670> see<00:01:47.940> some<00:01:48.119> haywire

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
jack it up and then you see some haywire

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
jack it up and then you see some haywire
to<00:01:48.630> hold<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.350> my<00:01:49.439> way<00:01:49.650> well<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.070> got

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
to hold it up out of my way well I got

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.500 
to hold it up out of my way well I got
the<00:01:51.170> strut<00:01:52.170> out<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:53.210> didn't<00:01:54.210> want<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.390> put<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
the strut out I didn't want to put a

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.929 
the strut out I didn't want to put a
whole<00:01:54.659> bunch<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.869> force<00:01:55.080> down<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.939> possibly

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
whole bunch of force down and possibly

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.960 
whole bunch of force down and possibly
bend<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.240> steering<00:01:57.659> or<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:59.280> course<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> front

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
bend the steering or of course the front

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.580 
bend the steering or of course the front
drive<00:02:00.240> shaft<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.600> CV<00:02:00.960> joins<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.380> all<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
drive shaft and CV joins and all that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.620 
drive shaft and CV joins and all that
stuff<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:01.830> just<00:02:02.420> did<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.439> one<00:02:04.830> most

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
stuff so just did that and the one most

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.719 
stuff so just did that and the one most
difficult<00:02:06.630> part<00:02:06.869> was<00:02:06.930> getting<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.729> stupid

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
difficult part was getting the stupid

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.760 
difficult part was getting the stupid
wire<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.810> behind

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
wire it's in behind

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.050 
wire it's in behind
the<00:02:12.310> inner<00:02:13.300> fender<00:02:13.750> cover<00:02:14.020> it's<00:02:14.590> hard<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.220> move

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
the inner fender cover it's hard to move

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.880 
the inner fender cover it's hard to move
on<00:02:16.240> Boulder<00:02:16.630> but<00:02:16.780> there's<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.200> connection

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
on Boulder but there's the connection

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.610 
on Boulder but there's the connection
there<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:20.100> basically<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.930> on<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.110> inside

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
there and basically it's on the inside

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.950 
there and basically it's on the inside
towards<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.950> engine<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:24.640> gets<00:02:25.210> filthy<00:02:25.660> there

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
towards the engine it gets filthy there

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.090 
towards the engine it gets filthy there
anyway<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.320> don't<00:02:26.500> know<00:02:26.560> why<00:02:26.710> they<00:02:26.830> put<00:02:26.980> it

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
anyway I don't know why they put it

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.180 
anyway I don't know why they put it
there<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:29.140> was<00:02:29.230> plastic<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.950> basically

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
there and it was plastic so it basically

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.000 
there and it was plastic so it basically
broke<00:02:30.580> off<00:02:30.760> then<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.180> was<00:02:31.480> able<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:32.580> undo<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.760> so

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
broke off then I was able to undo it so

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.980 
broke off then I was able to undo it so
kind<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.190> pain<00:02:37.020> but<00:02:38.700> thankfully<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.960> got<00:02:40.960> a

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.570 
kind of a pain but thankfully I got a
