different<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.739> I'm<00:00:46.829> saying

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
different to what I'm saying

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.040 
different to what I'm saying
alright<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.700> let's<00:00:47.879> get<00:00:48.030> started<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
alright so let's get started so the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.380 
alright so let's get started so the
first<00:00:49.140> category<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.370> early<00:00:50.850> faction

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
first category is the early faction

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240 
first category is the early faction
strength<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.199> believe<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> icy<00:00:53.190> knee

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
strength and I believe that the icy knee

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.880 
strength and I believe that the icy knee
are<00:00:53.610> strong<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.449> area<00:00:54.660> because<00:00:55.500> they<00:00:55.710> are

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
are strong in this area because they are

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.060 
are strong in this area because they are
on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.640> island<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.120> Britain<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:58.559> order<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
on the island of Britain and in order to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.049 
on the island of Britain and in order to
be<00:00:59.250> conquered<00:00:59.730> they<00:01:00.030> an<00:01:00.359> army<00:01:01.050> would<00:01:01.230> need<00:01:01.469> to

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
be conquered they an army would need to

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
be conquered they an army would need to
invade<00:01:03.059> from<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> sea<00:01:03.960> which<00:01:04.530> means<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.129> if

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
invade from the sea which means that if

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.750 
invade from the sea which means that if
the<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.150> scene<00:01:06.630> he<00:01:06.720> had<00:01:06.750> an<00:01:07.049> okay<00:01:07.770> Navy<00:01:08.100> they

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the I scene he had an okay Navy they

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.000 
the I scene he had an okay Navy they
would<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.090> able<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> defend<00:01:09.720> themselves

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
would be able to defend themselves

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.649 
would be able to defend themselves
against<00:01:11.010> oncoming<00:01:11.670> invasion<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
against oncoming invasion and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.980 
against oncoming invasion and
historically<00:01:13.500> speaking<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.760> Celtic<00:01:15.659> tribes

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
historically speaking the Celtic tribes

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.100 
historically speaking the Celtic tribes
of<00:01:16.470> Britain<00:01:16.520> were<00:01:17.520> very<00:01:18.330> good<00:01:18.600> sailors

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
of Britain were very good sailors

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.870 
of Britain were very good sailors
because<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.130> way<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.549> they<00:01:20.670> got

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
because that is the way that they got

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.630 
because that is the way that they got
their<00:01:21.210> trade<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.869> economy<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
their trade and economy going and the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.630 
their trade and economy going and the
next<00:01:23.850> category<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.290> expansion<00:01:26.070> strength

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
next category is the expansion strength

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460 
next category is the expansion strength
and<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.000> believe<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> scene<00:01:28.080> II<00:01:28.110> are

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and I believe that the I scene II are

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.830 
and I believe that the I scene II are
moderately<00:01:29.159> strong<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.850> area<00:01:30.060> because

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
moderately strong in this area because

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.539 
moderately strong in this area because
they<00:01:31.049> will<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.470> unite<00:01:31.770> Britain<00:01:32.340> under

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
they will have to unite Britain under

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.300 
they will have to unite Britain under
one<00:01:33.299> banner<00:01:33.540> first<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.229> all<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:34.979> able<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
one banner first of all to be able to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.880 
one banner first of all to be able to
support<00:01:35.700> an<00:01:35.909> economy<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.869> big<00:01:37.170> enough<00:01:37.200> to

actually<00:03:35.400> believe<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.879> this<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.209> why<00:03:36.419> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
actually believe that this is why the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.990 
actually believe that this is why the
Romans<00:03:37.079> aimed<00:03:37.349> for<00:03:37.889> Britain<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.430> much<00:03:38.669> because

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
Romans aimed for Britain so much because

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.229 
Romans aimed for Britain so much because
of<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.959> vast<00:03:40.290> wealth<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:41.069> could<00:03:41.340> be<00:03:41.519> gained

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
of the vast wealth that could be gained

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.830 
of the vast wealth that could be gained
if<00:03:42.599> they<00:03:43.379> took<00:03:43.650> over<00:03:43.919> a<00:03:44.310> place<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:45.389> Britain

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
if they took over a place like Britain

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.770 
if they took over a place like Britain
so<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.769> next<00:03:46.919> category<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.730> trading<00:03:48.540> and

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
so the next category is the trading and

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.710 
so the next category is the trading and
profit-making<00:03:49.470> ability<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.819> faction<00:03:51.359> and

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
profit-making ability of the faction and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720 
profit-making ability of the faction and
I<00:03:51.870> believe<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.739> moderate<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.400> high

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
I believe that this is moderate to high

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.000 
I believe that this is moderate to high
for<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.239> IC<00:03:54.660> knee<00:03:54.720> because<00:03:55.290> they<00:03:55.620> were<00:03:55.680> famous

reaching<00:04:04.650> as<00:04:04.859> far<00:04:05.159> as<00:04:05.340> Greece<00:04:05.639> and<00:04:05.940> also<00:04:06.480> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
reaching as far as Greece and also the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.159 
reaching as far as Greece and also the
northern<00:04:07.319> tribes<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:08.190> Britain<00:04:08.449> also<00:04:09.449> traded

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
northern tribes of Britain also traded

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.800 
northern tribes of Britain also traded
with<00:04:10.409> Island<00:04:10.979> and<00:04:11.359> Scandinavian<00:04:12.359> countries

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
with Island and Scandinavian countries

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.259 
with Island and Scandinavian countries
so<00:04:13.319> I<00:04:13.379> believe<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.829> will<00:04:13.949> be<00:04:13.979> a<00:04:14.430> medium

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
so I believe it will be a medium

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.620 
so I believe it will be a medium

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
difficulty campaign to play as the IC

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.620 
difficulty campaign to play as the IC

knee function for Rome - which would be

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.530 
knee function for Rome - which would be
a<00:04:21.659> good<00:04:21.840> challenge<00:04:22.200> but<00:04:22.680> it's

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
a good challenge but it's

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.470 
a good challenge but it's
not<00:04:23.900> too<00:04:24.110> difficult<00:04:24.620> and<00:04:25.100> it<00:04:25.310> will<00:04:25.520> be<00:04:25.700> an<00:04:25.940> okay

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480
