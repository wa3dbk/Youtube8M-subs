very<00:00:55.620> good<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> really<00:00:58.320> cool<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
very good but I for a really cool one it

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.350 
very good but I for a really cool one it
mixes<00:01:01.579> ancient<00:01:02.579> sanctuary<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:05.360> tactical

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
mixes ancient sanctuary and tactical

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.260 
mixes ancient sanctuary and tactical
evolution<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.290> brings<00:01:08.280> ancient

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
evolution and that brings ancient

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.560 
evolution and that brings ancient
evolution<00:01:10.080> how<00:01:10.229> sick<00:01:10.680> does<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.159> sound<00:01:11.570> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
evolution how sick does that sound you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.310 
evolution how sick does that sound you
could<00:01:12.810> reverse<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.619> may<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:13.950> tactical<00:01:15.320> ancient

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
could reverse it may be tactical ancient

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.999 
could reverse it may be tactical ancient
but<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.740> doesn't<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.220> make<00:01:17.729> technical

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
but that doesn't really make technical

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.820 
but that doesn't really make technical
tactical<00:01:20.009> sanctuary<00:01:20.790> that's<00:01:21.299> not<00:01:21.479> bad<00:01:21.830> but

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
tactical sanctuary that's not bad but

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.590 
tactical sanctuary that's not bad but
yeah<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.369> why<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> ask<00:01:24.090> what<00:01:24.450> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
yeah that's why I want to ask what is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.450 
yeah that's why I want to ask what is
your<00:01:24.930> best<00:01:26.090> what<00:01:27.090> would<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.509> say<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.460> any

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
watching I pokin right here we have

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.840 
watching I pokin right here we have
figured<00:01:57.240> out<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:58.530> are<00:01:58.680> two<00:01:59.250> thousand

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
figured out and there are two thousand

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.950 
figured out and there are two thousand
and<00:02:00.000> fifty<00:02:00.840> four<00:02:01.049> different<00:02:01.380> possibilities

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
and fifty four different possibilities

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.990 
and fifty four different possibilities
that's<00:02:03.960> quite<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> lot<00:02:04.680> by<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.399> tell<00:02:05.579> me<00:02:05.759> more

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
that's quite a lot by for tell me more

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.749 
that's quite a lot by for tell me more
there<00:02:06.180> would<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.329> more<00:02:06.659> if<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.530> many<00:02:07.759> sets

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
there would be more if so many sets

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.760 
there would be more if so many sets
didn't<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.270> words<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.560> there's<00:02:10.739> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
didn't have words and it so there's a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.010 
didn't have words and it so there's a
couple<00:02:10.950> sets<00:02:11.310> with<00:02:11.489> drew<00:02:11.670> listen<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.120> think<00:02:12.180> s5

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
couple sets with drew listen I think s5

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.500 
couple sets with drew listen I think s5
there's<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.920> couple<00:02:14.100> sets<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.580> chaos<00:02:14.940> which<00:02:15.270> is
