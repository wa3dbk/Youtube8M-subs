00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.529
 or beautiful people 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.869
 because we are going to talk about how we can 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.910
 store things in the fridge so 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.130
 a little bit more green or green 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.619
 of course we are all exposed to 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.440
 plastic we have used it for generations 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.360
 and it 's difficult to suddenly adapt to the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.540
 green life and say good and now that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.250
 I use to store food 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.629
 On the fridge 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.149
 the green plastic that we use 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.040
 commonly this that we see here true if 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.659
 is that we always have at hand is for 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.879
 supposedly derived in another way from the 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.710
 oil of natural gas is not so 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.600
 a very green option and I know that the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.760
 We have first of all before passing 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.260
 to the products a little more green you 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.629
 I'll explain to you I'll give you a trick 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.429
 how to save how to make no 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.960
 stick to you because always when 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.679
 we are trying to save a food 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.310
 we break it in parts it hits us in the 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:13.060
 pantry 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.549
 and we can use it in a more 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.700
 easy then the trick is super easy 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.549
 are you going to save in 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.170
 free generator I keep it in the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.170
 freezer to keep 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.159
 go to use is very easy to take off 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.470
 all all these laws or all 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.990
 these parts of the plastic and it 's fine 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.579
 easy to cut and easy to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.280
 treat your food but good now 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.560
 we go to the second part of this 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.140
 videoblog how can we do to 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.659
 keep our food in the fridge 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250
 without having to use that plastic for 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.369
 of course I always tell them that when 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.899
 we are starting to create a green life 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.170
 do not go to your kitchen and throw everything 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.490
 because we have already spent a lot of money on 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.959
 all these elements then good 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.849
 little by little you run out of plastic 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.099
 then now you can look for the option 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:07.890
 green I found in the market some 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.840
 little bags that are green that have 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.239
 I'm going to teach you 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.340
 to do this done to save 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.640
 foods inside your fridge are 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.379
 revisable and are made of a material 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.660
 biodegradable as you can see perhaps a 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.910
 they are almost translucent but not 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.930
 so translucent with these with these 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.299
 sachets that the flames 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.719
 these are from any brand that 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.659
 I found but they speak them as a name 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:38.510
 as precious tags are reusable and 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:41.239
 they simply bring you something to be able to 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.019
 save inside the whole fridge and you're 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.420
 in these sachets are biodegradable 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.489
 as I'm telling you and you can use them 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.560
 to store any food and that 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.409
 this food also in any 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.950
 vegetable whatever you keep is what 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.299
 that is generating oba oba is going to oxidize 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.069
 where inside the fridge 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.500
 this also helps you to conserve now 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.329
 I found it another use because always 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.879
 They know that I like to find them 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.769
 different uses of things and what 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.799
 currently it is with the food inclusive 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.280
 use it as it used to before that 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.540
 plasil braun or that plastic wrap 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.819
 let's assume of course that I 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.980
 I had the food in a container of 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.010
 reusable plastic like this one simply 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.720
 What I do is use the bag depends 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.000
 of the 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.830
 grabbed the food truth you think that 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.310
 something to save and simply with a 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.560
 My friend, how are you guys seeing here? 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.670
 this league also what I do is put it 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:45.400
 around me the plastic container and 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.400
 see how I believe as I want here 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.620
 that food is known then as 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.120
 I found these bags 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.770
 different uses of course the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.470
 called everything but was supported by 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.910
 plastic me I do not buy them much 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.190
 but those that I already have reduces them 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.080
 prisoners and reduces them until they can no longer 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.870
 more not and it's always a good 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.580
 alternative have these these containers and 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.770
 They can use the different forms 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.020
 like what I'm using I 'm 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.420
 good but you liked these tips 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.250
 so you can save money and start 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.320
 that transition to be a little bit more 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.620
 green and stop using plastics 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.669
 conventional to which we are always 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.669
 used to see you in the next
