either way I'm going to use a couple of

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.550 
either way I'm going to use a couple of
strands<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:02.869> top<00:02:03.869> casing<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:07.049> then<00:02:07.170> for

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
strands for the top casing and then for

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.009 
strands for the top casing and then for
the<00:02:09.349> Eastside<00:02:11.420> markers<00:02:12.420> here<00:02:12.660> we're<00:02:12.870> going<00:02:12.959> to

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
the Eastside markers here we're going to

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.539 
the Eastside markers here we're going to
use<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.590> single<00:02:14.190> strip<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:15.019> red<00:02:16.549> holographic

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
use a single strip of red holographic

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.059 
use a single strip of red holographic
flash<00:02:18.299> abou<00:02:18.660> I'm<00:02:19.319> going<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.530> put<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> strip<00:02:19.980> of

this on each side you can also use the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:39.709 
this on each side you can also use the
red<00:02:24.060> holographic<00:02:24.630> tinsel<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.739> as<00:02:25.950> well

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.849 

there<00:02:40.719> we<00:02:40.840> go<00:02:41.189> once<00:02:42.189> we've<00:02:42.370> got<00:02:42.549> those<00:02:42.730> tied<00:02:43.030> in

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
there we go once we've got those tied in

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.860 
there we go once we've got those tied in
I'm<00:02:44.859> just<00:02:44.920> going<00:02:45.159> to<00:02:45.310> build<00:02:45.489> up<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.870> thorax

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
I'm just going to build up that thorax

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.449 
I'm just going to build up that thorax
here<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:47.319> kind<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.530> clean<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.859> up<00:02:48.010> get<00:02:48.250> rid<00:02:48.430> of

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
here just kind of clean it up get rid of

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.649 
here just kind of clean it up get rid of
any<00:02:48.670> lumps<00:02:49.260> or<00:02:50.260> bumps<00:02:50.319> that<00:02:51.250> may<00:02:51.489> have

any lumps or bumps that may have

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:58.589 
any lumps or bumps that may have
developed<00:02:52.659> when<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.079> tied<00:02:53.379> in<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.560> tinsel<00:02:57.599> I'm

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
developed when I tied in that tinsel I'm

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.879 
developed when I tied in that tinsel I'm
going<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.959> take<00:02:59.079> my<00:02:59.260> thread<00:02:59.469> all<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.680> way<00:02:59.829> to

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
going to take my thread all the way to

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.020 
going to take my thread all the way to
the<00:03:00.159> eye<00:03:00.629> I'm<00:03:01.629> going<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.840> pull<00:03:02.049> over<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:03.030> top

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
the eye I'm going to pull over the top

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:13.530 
the eye I'm going to pull over the top
casing<00:03:04.540> first<00:03:06.930> lash<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.170> down<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:12.489> wraps<00:03:12.760> and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
casing first lash it down to wraps and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.559 
casing first lash it down to wraps and
I'll<00:03:13.629> do<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> same<00:03:13.900> for<00:03:14.139> each<00:03:14.530> of<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:16.299> side

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
I'll do the same for each of the side

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:34.250 
I'll do the same for each of the side
pieces<00:03:17.079> here

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.180 

then<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.350> can<00:03:35.530> trim<00:03:35.800> out<00:03:35.950> all<00:03:36.190> those<00:03:36.459> pieces<00:03:36.819> of

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
then I can trim out all those pieces of

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:53.520 
then I can trim out all those pieces of
flashy<00:03:39.190> boo

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.960 

see<00:03:54.530> one<00:03:54.770> of<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:54.950> pieces<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.400> left<00:03:55.610> a<00:03:55.760> little

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
see one of the pieces I left a little

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.490 
see one of the pieces I left a little
bit<00:03:56.150> of<00:03:56.210> a<00:03:56.330> tag<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:56.840> here<00:03:58.750> try<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.810> prop<00:04:00.170> it<00:04:00.200> up

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
bit of a tag and here try to prop it up

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.710 
bit of a tag and here try to prop it up
so<00:04:00.740> I<00:04:00.800> can<00:04:01.210> get<00:04:02.210> under<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.510> with<00:04:02.660> my<00:04:02.840> thread

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
so I can get under it with my thread

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:14.930 
so I can get under it with my thread
there<00:04:05.720> we<00:04:05.810> go

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.539 

now<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.000> last<00:04:16.330> thing<00:04:16.480> to<00:04:16.750> do<00:04:16.900> is<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.140> add<00:04:17.260> the

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
now the last thing to do is to add the

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.520 
now the last thing to do is to add the
gills<00:04:19.080> I'm<00:04:20.080> just<00:04:20.290> going<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.470> use<00:04:20.650> some<00:04:20.920> white

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
Antron and I'm just going to kind of X

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:35.840 
Antron and I'm just going to kind of X
wrap<00:04:27.130> these<00:04:27.370> in<00:04:27.430> right<00:04:28.240> up<00:04:28.390> by<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.950> head

all around the thorax and I left that

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:56.370 
all around the thorax and I left that
Antron<00:05:39.160> long<00:05:39.460> so<00:05:40.000> it<00:05:40.180> doesn't<00:05:40.540> get<00:05:41.140> in<00:05:41.230> my<00:05:41.290> way

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380
