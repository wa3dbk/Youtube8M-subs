00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.470
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.990
 a little more days it is in 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.000
 I am back on the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.490
 experimental version of the 0.54 the 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.140
 By the way, loud plan from 25 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.580
 february so if i have the video today 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.890
 then rauszuhauen to create, so to speak 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.650
 Tomorrow I'm coming today 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.120
 stable version out and I have myself 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.950
 a second time on the experimental 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.790
 server hit me and i did 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.340
 I almost want to say a bit 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.920
 durchgequält because yes that does not work 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.149
 everything as stable as it should run on 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.410
 in any case, there are only now 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.630
 two updates for the experimental 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.850
 very many new content and content 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.620
 Above all, the trucks are buggy free 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.760
 but we'll get to that right now why me 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.350
 the video here at this heli 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.960
 crash site starter has following 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.940
 reason because you can also the m 65 4 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.250
 I think a jacket 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.840
 military-inspired jacket with but 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.590
 let me lie eight or six me 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.119
 do not know exactly 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.650
 In any case, this jacket seems 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.700
 for some reason only to these 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.320
 to find a crash 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.729
 at least on the experimental 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.490
 Of course, this version may be in the future 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.170
 change and I have the problem with 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.060
 I find such heli crashes 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.640
 either not at all or when 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.740
 I like this one finds then just lies 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.149
 shit there for that reason i have 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.399
 me also directly on the essential 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.319
 concentrated as in the case on the 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.890
 new vhs truck with the loading area 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.380
 on the back 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.450
 i have to say i have been forever after that 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.799
 I've searched tons of such 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.109
 found without loading area 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.929
 There was enough with the loading area 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.429
 However, not so often represented 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.170
 I then went straight to the back 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.369
 set in and I have then 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.049
 found there are no 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.329
 entry and ascension ambitions man 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.759
 So just sits there and so on 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.350
 the loading area directly one can otherwise 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.240
 do not do anything except get off 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.310
 you do not have no access from the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.899
 Inventory and in general you would have too 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.850
 no access to the vehicle inventory 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.029
 So it will not be possible for the time being 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.319
 to sway for the transport 

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:04.929
 of and which items to use but 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.090
 actually only in quotation marks for 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.289
 the player's transport and 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.539
 there is something about the truck 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.910
 actually not much to say 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.010
 because it's still a v3 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.530
 it truck 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.750
 so inside in the cockpit it is exactly 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.610
 the same as before he has the same 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.040
 Sound of this performance, of course, is clear 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.560
 it is also nothing from the driving behavior 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.670
 other and I have, however 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.140
 stated that on the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.000
 experimental version I do not know 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.500
 if that remains so that the trucks 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.520
 so much more power really has 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.710
 significantly more power 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.350
 I can easily get everyone 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.640
 I'm getting over it now 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.460
 Do not drive more than 8 km 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.480
 but three percent slope high 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.350
 I do not know why it is that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.030
 now really only on the first 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.980
 experimental version is so or in 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.040
 I have to say I'll have it, too 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.360
 even when turning in the meadow me 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.770
 placed directly on the side and had 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.360
 then unfortunately no chance more 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.810
 Sparkurs and a fashion too 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.390
 rescue 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.950
 what a pity you are now too 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.590
 can find now is completely new the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.420
 bullet proof vest i have to say that 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.280
 really makes a lot of looks visually 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.410
 pretty cool and you can do that 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.240
 even with such bags expand the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.030
 bags then have a total of ten slots 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.170
 and in combination with the vest though 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.540
 I'm not the west club 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.410
 Actually, it's a little bit 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.100
 You would like to mention jewelery 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.380
 one has now also the possibility 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.480
 along with a learning pet bottle and 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.959
 duct tape itself a muffler 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.480
 to build 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.100
 I then have the muffler 13 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.690
 tested different weapons altogether 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.730
 and I do not like it for 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.260
 outsider sounds so the test is 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.910
 now unfortunately only for ourselves if we 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.100
 of course, it can be that people are shooting 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.110
 which are right next to it that possibly 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.120
 completely different hear as testwahl to the 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.310
 sks and the mohsen since I have one 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.330
 first with the music 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.630
 shot a little bit around 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.930
 and yes the sound as you can yourself 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.930
 hear 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.680
 I have exactly the same test 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:09.190
 done with the sks i believe it 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.780
 is the same or already due 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.160
 whose sound files that the same 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.620
 are I hold the strong suspicion 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.910
 that for outsiders that's not too 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.230
 Listen, I've read that 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.150
 the silencer on some weapons even 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.070
 it does not work that way anyway 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.660
 According to everything I is not know at 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.730
 which maybe it is even at the 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.110
 sks and the music and we ourselves 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.730
 just listen to this silenced 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.070
 shot you can build this yourself 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.540
 muffler by the way not on the 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.870
 unfortunately stick gun 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.050
 pity that then for the time being last item 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.820
 the tailpipes one yes a little one 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.830
 sister it's a shotgun with 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.780
 point 22 Ammunition that means so much 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.000
 Damage does not make them comparable 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.160
 the sporta course trumpet is the 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.930
 written out of it and under the patch 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.830
 or under the changelog falls as 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.120
 fn trombone acoustic nothing special 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.220
 I believe and I think you can hear it too 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.050
 Well , that's probably something you can do with it 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.140
 not just about everything destroy 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.140
 can 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.810
 Of course I have the part with me too 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.810
 silencer tested 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.490
 The sound is the same as Peter's 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.350
 loosen and at the sks 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:22.050
 However, every switch does not 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:24.600
 it will be a long time since that was part of it 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.460
 Unfortunately broken wear is so high 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.050
 apparently what it looks like 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.539
 by the way, that's also practical 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.910
 collapse and then smoothly in 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.620
 backpack with it to transport 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.940
 I think it's really handy 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.080
 however, I do not believe that 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.460
 my favorite weapon will be western 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.340
 von mediziner was also at the 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.169
 coastal town sony or sony i know 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.030
 not exactly how it was pronounced 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.010
 the small mining station overhauled 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.580
 this is roughly similar to kamenz rough 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.289
 the mine 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.300
 a few excavators were added 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.520
 a few details and this huge one 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.260
 brick building which one actually 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.310
 do not enter but only 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.110
 beklettern it can be pretty okay yes 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.720
 you if you turn long run it looks 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.849
 okay , it's something new when you are 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.009
 also goes long and in itself 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:12.300
 Is not it worth it bond 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.830
 Nothing more than said you can hardly 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.930
 may enter from one there is only a 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.610
 Look a little bit nice of course 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.900
 but i think you should go if you are 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.699
 because you have to change something 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.440
 might want to on the map 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.479
 other things specialize as a building 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.400
 which one can not continue to use 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.800
 but I do not care about the 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.760
 city ​​for watching thank the goods 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.960
 my extended impressions to 0 45 who 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.889
 from you the first video not yet 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.690
 I've seen a few, too 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.430
 things wide already explained, the 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.970
 gladly again too experimental version 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.889
 look at 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.210
 Of course, I would be very, too 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.400
 strong over a thumb upwards 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.870
 if you liked it and remember 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.000
 please that this video only one 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.530
 experimental recording is and is 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.970
 to change all contents at any time 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.409
 that can be added a lot 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.909
 it can also be removed a lot 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:55.860
 I will know that naturally before 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:59.639
 not tomorrow from 25 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:02.070
 February is scheduled that this 0.45 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.750
 stable versions that means you 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.310
 could play anywhere you can 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.229
 you do not need to be up 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.639
 experimentally change but you 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.770
 You can easily do it too 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.270
 our server then gamble if it is 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.949
 I do not know that way, of course 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.810
 So thanks again for watching and 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:17.070
 maybe we'll see each other tomorrow 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.280
 at the set is 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.280
 ciao
