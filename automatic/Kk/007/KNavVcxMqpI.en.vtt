00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.830
 when a dancer executes his 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.250
 movements the muscles go into 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.250
 action 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.480
 the movement of the body starts to 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.060
 from a voluntary signal in the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.220
 brain whose stimulus travels through 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.160
 a motor neuron until you reach the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.270
 surface of muscle fibers 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.870
 constituted from units 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.489
 long cell phone calls arc meros 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.970
 formed in turn by thin sheets of 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.760
 actin and myosin structural proteins 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.530
 responsible for muscle contraction 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.989
 when the nervous stimulus reaches 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.470
 muscle occurs the release of a 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.730
 substance known as acetylcholine 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.160
 responsible for transmitting the signal of 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.130
 movement coming from the brain to 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.920
 muscle cells during this process 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.600
 large amounts of calcium ions are 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.330
 released into the sarcoma 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.680
 to activate the bonding forces between 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 the filaments of the proteins 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.860
 muscles generating a contraction 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.140
 the voluntary movements of the body 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.390
 they can be done continuously 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.430
 as long as there are substances 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.310
 essentials like calcium and a 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.780
 enough amount of energy 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.390
 available in cells in the form of 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.979
 adenosine triphosphate molecule formed to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.410
 starting from the metabolism of 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.210
 carbohydrates otherwise the 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.850
 muscle does not respond to the stimulus of 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.420
 movement presenting an episode of 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.420
 muscular fatigue 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 within the practice of dance the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.950
 performance of muscle function is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.649
 essential in order to keep the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.909
 muscles in good physical condition 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.429
 should be a priority for the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.799
 dancers to get a suitable 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.720
 muscle control are involved 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.880
 Many healthy habits like good 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.580
 hydration an optimal nutritional contribution 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.310
 of vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates and 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.380
 mostly proteins as well as a period 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.380
 ideal repose for recovery
