hello everybody we just ran a dragon

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.509 
hello everybody we just ran a dragon
tattoo<00:00:06.540> themed<00:00:06.899> puzzle<00:00:07.410> which<00:00:07.799> started<00:00:08.370> out

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
tattoo themed puzzle which started out

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.330 
tattoo themed puzzle which started out
as<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:09.030> 24<00:00:09.719> character<00:00:10.230> string<00:00:10.590> which<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:11.070> see

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
as the 24 character string which you see

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.240 
as the 24 character string which you see
here<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:12.269> lots<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.929> asked<00:00:13.500> us<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:14.009> show

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
here now lots of you asked us to show

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.210 
here now lots of you asked us to show
you<00:00:14.309> how<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.639> solve<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.599> here<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.289> are<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
you how to solve it so here you are the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.050 
you how to solve it so here you are the
text<00:00:17.609> looks<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.330> bit<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.770> base64<00:00:19.939> except<00:00:20.939> that

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
text looks a bit like base64 except that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.420 
text looks a bit like base64 except that
the<00:00:21.150> equal<00:00:21.630> sign<00:00:21.660> should<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.350> at<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.529> end<00:00:22.680> so

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
the equal sign should be at the end so

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.920 
the equal sign should be at the end so
the<00:00:23.850> first<00:00:24.060> thing<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.300> will<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.600> we're

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
the first thing we will do is we're

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.900 
the first thing we will do is we're
going<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.140> push<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.740> puzzle<00:00:26.220> text<00:00:26.580> through

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
going to push the puzzle text through

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.580 
going to push the puzzle text through
the<00:00:27.029> reverse<00:00:27.300> command<00:00:27.689> now<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.230> looks<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.500> bit

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the reverse command now that looks a bit

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.420 
the reverse command now that looks a bit
better<00:00:28.800> now<00:00:29.580> will<00:00:29.760> base64<00:00:30.660> decode<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.679> now

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
better now will base64 decode it and now

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.889 
better now will base64 decode it and now
we've<00:00:32.669> got<00:00:32.880> something<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.420> looks<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.719> bit

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
we've got something that looks a bit

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.860 
we've got something that looks a bit
like<00:00:33.960> scrambled<00:00:34.890> text<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.180> de<00:00:36.360> facto

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
like scrambled text and the de facto

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.290 
like scrambled text and the de facto
standard<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.410> casual<00:00:38.280> text<00:00:38.730> scrambling

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
standard for casual text scrambling

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.380 
standard for casual text scrambling
online<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.930> thing<00:00:40.410> called<00:00:40.440> rot13<00:00:41.399> where<00:00:42.270> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
online is a thing called rot13 where you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720 
online is a thing called rot13 where you
shift<00:00:42.690> each<00:00:42.930> letter<00:00:43.200> forward<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.680> back<00:00:43.860> by<00:00:44.070> 13

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
shift each letter forward or back by 13

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.670 
shift each letter forward or back by 13
characters<00:00:45.059> half<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.570> alphabet<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.320> we'll

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
characters half the alphabet so we'll

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
characters half the alphabet so we'll
use<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.129> TR<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> translate<00:00:48.329> command<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
use the TR the translate command and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.200 
use the TR the translate command and
we'll<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.710> very<00:00:49.980> shift<00:00:50.550> by<00:00:50.760> 13

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
we'll do that very shift by 13

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.869 
we'll do that very shift by 13
characters<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.930> bingo<00:00:52.559> we've<00:00:52.980> got<00:00:53.219> almost<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
characters and bingo we've got almost a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.540 
characters and bingo we've got almost a
URL<00:00:54.270> one<00:00:54.960> last<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.559> tweak<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> we'll<00:00:56.430> make

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
URL one last little tweak and we'll make

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.819 
URL one last little tweak and we'll make
that<00:00:56.579> dash<00:00:57.059> into<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.539> slash<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.649> with

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that dash into a slash and now with

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.620 
you get a sorry the contest is over page
but<00:01:08.490> you'll<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> link<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
but you'll see that the link to the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.719 
but you'll see that the link to the
second<00:01:10.080> stage<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.710> puzzle<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.280> still

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
second stage of the puzzle is still

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.200 
second stage of the puzzle is still
there<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.600> text<00:01:13.260> URL<00:01:13.680> let's<00:01:14.100> open<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
there it's a text URL let's open it the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.690 
there it's a text URL let's open it the
first<00:01:15.600> twenty<00:01:16.080> lines<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.650> some<00:01:17.009> important

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
first twenty lines are some important

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.420 
first twenty lines are some important
advice<00:01:17.820> from<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> G<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> dt<00:01:20.009> that's<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
advice from the G with the dt that's the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.550 
advice from the G with the dt that's the
girl<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.850> dragon<00:01:20.939> tattoo<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
girl with the dragon tattoo and the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
girl with the dragon tattoo and the
bottom<00:01:22.979> twenty<00:01:23.400> lines<00:01:23.610> are<00:01:23.909> her<00:01:24.270> ascii<00:01:24.840> art

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
bottom twenty lines are her ascii art

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050 
bottom twenty lines are her ascii art
signature<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.430> looks<00:01:26.610> as<00:01:26.729> though<00:01:26.759> that's

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
signature so it looks as though that's

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.670 
signature so it looks as though that's
where<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> data<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.229> hidden<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
where the data is going to be hidden and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.219 
where the data is going to be hidden and
that's<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.159> bit<00:01:29.310> i'm<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.939> save<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.960> here

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that's the bit i'm going to save so here

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
that's the bit i'm going to save so here
we<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.350> for<00:01:31.680> stage<00:01:31.920> 2<00:01:31.970> there's<00:01:32.970> our<00:01:33.150> text<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
we go for stage 2 there's our text and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.429 
we go for stage 2 there's our text and
those<00:01:34.439> 50<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.670> bees<00:01:35.970> should<00:01:36.630> stick<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.229> at

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
those 50 for bees should stick out at

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.899 
those 50 for bees should stick out at
you<00:01:37.650> 50<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.939> hex<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.509> PK<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.680> ASCII<00:01:41.189> p<00:01:41.670> k

you 50 for be in hex is PK in ASCII p k

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.510 
you 50 for be in hex is PK in ASCII p k

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.260 
stands for Phil cats Phil cats invented
pkzip<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.750> PK<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> magic<00:01:47.250> marker<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
pkzip so PK is the magic marker for the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.690 
pkzip so PK is the magic marker for the
headers<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.810> footers<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.259> zip<00:01:49.530> files<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.549> it's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
headers and footers of zip files so it's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.090 
headers and footers of zip files so it's
a<00:01:50.759> good<00:01:50.970> guess<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.960> supposed<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.979> be

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
a good guess that this is supposed to be

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.880 
a good guess that this is supposed to be
hexadecimal<00:01:54.060> only<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.020> will<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.320> said<00:01:55.680> and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
hexadecimal only so will you said and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.920 
hexadecimal only so will you said and
we'll<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.430> strip<00:01:56.759> out<00:01:56.909> any<00:01:57.149> non<00:01:57.479> hex

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
we'll just strip out any non hex

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.679 
we'll just strip out any non hex
characters<00:01:58.619> there<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.369> go<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.909> looks<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.450> lot

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
characters there you go that looks a lot

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.139 
characters there you go that looks a lot
like<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.960> zip<00:02:01.380> file<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.340> let's<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.820> string

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
like a zip file so now let's just string

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.080 
like a zip file so now let's just string
everything<00:02:03.479> onto<00:02:03.600> one<00:02:03.869> line<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.320> use<00:02:04.710> xxd<00:02:05.520> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
everything onto one line and use xxd to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.869 
everything onto one line and use xxd to
do<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.360> decoding<00:02:06.540> into<00:02:07.170> binary<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.879> bingo

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
do the decoding into binary and bingo

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.850 
do the decoding into binary and bingo
there's<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.360> file<00:02:09.780> name<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.349> see<00:02:10.560> inside

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
there's a file name you can see inside

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.979 
there's a file name you can see inside
the<00:02:11.069> zip<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.430> actually<00:02:11.790> twice<00:02:12.120> once<00:02:12.660> just

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
the zip it's actually twice once just

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.510 
the zip it's actually twice once just
before

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
before

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.670 
before
the<00:02:13.580> data<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.060> once<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.930> end<00:02:14.960> in<00:02:15.500> what's

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
the data and once the end in what's

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.370 
the data and once the end in what's
called<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> pkzip<00:02:16.730> central<00:02:17.390> directory<00:02:17.870> now

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
called the pkzip central directory now

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.560 
called the pkzip central directory now
it<00:02:18.440> looks<00:02:18.500> like<00:02:18.620> an<00:02:18.830> image<00:02:19.190> ends<00:02:19.820> gif<00:02:20.330> and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
it looks like an image ends gif and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.930 
it looks like an image ends gif and
remember<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.680> file<00:02:21.950> name<00:02:22.190> because<00:02:22.640> it's<00:02:22.850> a

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
remember that file name because it's a

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.750 
remember that file name because it's a
hint<00:02:23.180> for<00:02:23.660> later<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.500> let's<00:02:24.770> unzip<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.550> data

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
hint for later so let's unzip the data

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.270 
hint for later so let's unzip the data
and<00:02:26.060> see<00:02:26.270> what<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.540> get<00:02:26.720> right<00:02:27.200> ah<00:02:27.410> it's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
and see what we get right ah it's

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.400 
and see what we get right ah it's
encrypted<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.120> if<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.690> remember<00:02:29.960> the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
encrypted and if you remember the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.780 
encrypted and if you remember the
instructions<00:02:31.070> from<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.310> girl<00:02:31.580> with<00:02:31.760> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
instructions from the girl with the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.990 
instructions from the girl with the
dragon<00:02:32.000> tattoo<00:02:32.240> said<00:02:33.080> use<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.950> cypher<00:02:34.610> name

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
dragon tattoo said use the cypher name

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.270 
dragon tattoo said use the cypher name
from<00:02:35.390> stage<00:02:35.750> one<00:02:36.020> as<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.380> password<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:37.100> that's

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
from stage one as the password so that's

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.330 
from stage one as the password so that's
going<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.520> be<00:02:37.610> rot13<00:02:38.450> then<00:02:39.440> we<00:02:39.560> extracted<00:02:39.980> and

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
going to be rot13 then we extracted and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.910 
going to be rot13 then we extracted and
look<00:02:40.520> that's<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.850> raw<00:02:41.120> gift<00:02:41.690> data<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.260> it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
look that's the raw gift data and it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.610 
look that's the raw gift data and it
includes<00:02:43.490> an<00:02:43.840> interesting<00:02:44.840> image<00:02:44.990> comment

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
includes an interesting image comment

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.340 
includes an interesting image comment
namely<00:02:46.070> since<00:02:46.550> when<00:02:46.820> was<00:02:47.150> pink<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.750> shade<00:02:48.170> of

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
namely since when was pink a shade of

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.320 
namely since when was pink a shade of
gray<00:02:48.590> now<00:02:49.070> quite<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.580> lot<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:50.000> thought<00:02:50.180> that

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
gray now quite a lot of you thought that

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.090 
gray now quite a lot of you thought that
was<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.510> final<00:02:50.750> answer<00:02:51.110> it's<00:02:51.440> not<00:02:51.710> it's<00:02:51.980> just

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
was the final answer it's not it's just

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.220 
was the final answer it's not it's just
a<00:02:52.370> hint<00:02:52.700> that's<00:02:53.240> why<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.480> had<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.780> question

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
a hint that's why it had the question

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.810 
a hint that's why it had the question
mark<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.650> we'll<00:02:54.950> see<00:02:55.130> what<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.370> means<00:02:55.550> in<00:02:55.730> a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
mark and we'll see what it means in a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.090 
mark and we'll see what it means in a
moment<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.690> fact<00:02:56.960> let's<00:02:57.320> really<00:02:57.620> code<00:02:57.950> the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
moment in fact let's really code the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.260 
moment in fact let's really code the
image<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.460> this<00:02:58.550> time<00:02:58.790> we're<00:02:59.000> going<00:02:59.180> to

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
image and this time we're going to

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.660 
image and this time we're going to
display<00:03:00.050> it<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.620> looked<00:03:00.830> pretty<00:03:00.950> small<00:03:01.400> dint

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
display it it looked pretty small dint

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.520 
display it it looked pretty small dint
it<00:03:01.820> so<00:03:01.940> I'm<00:03:02.000> going<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:02.390> scale<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:02.750> up<00:03:02.990> six-fold

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
it so I'm going to scale it up six-fold

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.940 
it so I'm going to scale it up six-fold
and<00:03:03.830> there<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.790> have<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.330> pink<00:03:05.950> rectangle

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
and there you have it a pink rectangle

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.340 
and there you have it a pink rectangle
well<00:03:07.610> we<00:03:08.150> need<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.420> know<00:03:08.570> more<00:03:08.600> about<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.110> file

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
well we need to know more about the file

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.370 
well we need to know more about the file
so<00:03:09.680> now<00:03:09.920> I'll<00:03:10.070> open<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.490> in<00:03:10.640> binary<00:03:11.180> mode<00:03:11.480> VI<00:03:11.810> so

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
so now I'll open it in binary mode VI so

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.590 
so now I'll open it in binary mode VI so
we<00:03:12.470> can<00:03:12.650> actually<00:03:12.800> have<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.310> peek<00:03:13.610> inside<00:03:13.880> and

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
we can actually have a peek inside and

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.780 
we can actually have a peek inside and
there<00:03:15.350> at<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.500> start<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.070> see<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.280> great<00:03:16.550> big

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
there at the start you see a great big

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.890 
there at the start you see a great big
blob<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.150> control<00:03:17.870> at<00:03:18.080> that's<00:03:19.010> null<00:03:19.520> or<00:03:19.790> zero

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
blob of control at that's null or zero

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.420 
blob of control at that's null or zero
that's<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.110> color<00:03:21.410> palette<00:03:21.830> of<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.190> gift

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
that's the color palette of the gift

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.560 
that's the color palette of the gift
file<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.940> 0<00:03:23.780> 0<00:03:24.200> 0<00:03:24.320> is<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.220> RGB<00:03:25.850> code<00:03:26.120> for<00:03:26.330> black

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
file and 0 0 0 is the RGB code for black

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.449 
file and 0 0 0 is the RGB code for black
so<00:03:27.110> almost<00:03:27.440> all<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.830> colors<00:03:28.160> in<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.430> image

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
so almost all of the colors in the image

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.690 
so almost all of the colors in the image
is<00:03:28.760> set<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.060> black<00:03:29.380> except<00:03:30.380> that<00:03:30.920> two<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.520> them

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
is set to black except that two of them

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.460 
is set to black except that two of them
are<00:03:31.910> set<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.450> same<00:03:32.750> at<00:03:32.990> f1b<00:03:33.980> b.ed<00:03:34.790> fibbed<00:03:35.780> very

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
are set the same at f1b b.ed fibbed very

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.500 
are set the same at f1b b.ed fibbed very
droll<00:03:36.740> isn't<00:03:37.070> it<00:03:37.190> it's<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.370> digital<00:03:37.670> pump<00:03:38.270> and

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
droll isn't it it's a digital pump and

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.220 
droll isn't it it's a digital pump and
also<00:03:39.230> fibbed<00:03:39.680> just<00:03:40.250> happens<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.850> be<00:03:40.880> pink<00:03:41.240> so<00:03:41.959> a

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
also fibbed just happens to be pink so a
