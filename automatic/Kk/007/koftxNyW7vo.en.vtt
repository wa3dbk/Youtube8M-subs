00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
don't get why he did that but I mean the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.249 
don't get why he did that but I mean the
only<00:01:41.909> difference<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.450> he<00:01:42.509> gets<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.869> little<00:01:43.020> bit

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
only difference is he gets a little bit

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
gonna go straight up for the attack

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.370

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
gonna kind of be a thing there but he

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.640

mountain<00:03:11.070> he<00:03:11.190> also<00:03:11.280> has<00:03:11.490> intimidate<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.360> I

mountain he also has intimidate so I
don't<00:03:13.050> know<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.350> think<00:03:13.770> that's<00:03:14.070> kind<00:03:14.250> of

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
don't know I think that's kind of

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.890 
don't know I think that's kind of
standard<00:03:14.760> for<00:03:15.030> if<00:03:15.210> you're<00:03:15.330> gonna<00:03:15.510> make<00:03:15.630> out

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
standard for if you're gonna make out

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
but he does have the left over so he

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.730 
but he does have the left over so he
doesn't<00:03:18.690> have<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.930> mega<00:03:19.230> on<00:03:19.290> his<00:03:19.410> team<00:03:19.530> which<00:03:19.620> is

figure<00:04:26.520> that's<00:04:26.699> my<00:04:26.820> best<00:04:27.000> play<00:04:27.240> which<00:04:28.040> he'd

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
figure that's my best play which he'd

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.680 
figure that's my best play which he'd
all<00:04:29.160> switches<00:04:29.400> out<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.850> xcountry<00:04:30.330> which<00:04:30.570> I

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
all switches out to the xcountry which I

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.600 
all switches out to the xcountry which I
found<00:04:30.840> weird<00:04:31.110> but<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.560> guess<00:04:31.889> he<00:04:32.010> figured<00:04:32.520> out

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
found weird but I guess he figured out

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.969 
found weird but I guess he figured out
going<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:32.970> something<00:04:33.300> else<00:04:33.510> but<00:04:33.930> luckily<00:04:34.560> I'm

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
going to something else but luckily I'm

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.620 
going to something else but luckily I'm
able<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.400> make<00:04:35.580> up<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:35.970> just<00:04:36.210> take<00:04:36.389> him<00:04:36.510> out

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
able to make up and just take him out

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.770 
able to make up and just take him out
right<00:04:36.840> there<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.440> that's<00:04:37.710> nice<00:04:38.120> so<00:04:39.120> yeah

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
right there so that's nice so yeah

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.360 
right there so that's nice so yeah
that's<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.320> end<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.770> but<00:04:41.070> it<00:04:41.160> goes<00:04:41.250> in

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
that's the end of that but it goes in

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.860 
that's the end of that but it goes in
the<00:04:41.460> Gorgons<00:04:41.790> I<00:04:41.910> was<00:04:42.120> actually<00:04:42.300> trying<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.750> go

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
the Gorgons I was actually trying to go

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.909 
the Gorgons I was actually trying to go
to<00:04:43.020> Pharaoh<00:04:43.229> in<00:04:43.470> there<00:04:43.590> because<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:43.860> figured

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
to Pharaoh in there because I figured

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.520 
to Pharaoh in there because I figured
you'd<00:04:44.190> just<00:04:44.370> go<00:04:44.490> for<00:04:44.639> shadow<00:04:44.910> sneak<00:04:45.180> but

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
you'd just go for shadow sneak but

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
you'd just go for shadow sneak but
accidentally<00:04:46.530> click<00:04:46.680> shadow<00:04:46.919> claw<00:04:47.130> first<00:04:47.370> and

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
accidentally click shadow claw first and

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.520 
accidentally click shadow claw first and
that<00:04:47.669> went<00:04:47.820> through<00:04:48.090> but<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:49.199> works<00:04:49.350> out<00:04:49.470> for

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
that went through but it works out for

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.860 
that went through but it works out for
me<00:04:49.680> except<00:04:49.949> took<00:04:50.100> him<00:04:50.220> out<00:04:50.340> so<00:04:50.610> yay<00:04:51.090> bananas

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
me except took him out so yay bananas

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.800 
me except took him out so yay bananas
getting<00:04:52.080> onto<00:04:52.199> latios<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:53.449> mean<00:04:54.449> I<00:04:54.570> could

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
getting onto latios and I mean I could

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.030 
getting onto latios and I mean I could
have<00:04:54.930> stayed<00:04:55.110> in<00:04:55.139> there<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.500> try<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.740> go<00:04:55.919> for

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
have stayed in there and try to go for

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.830 
have stayed in there and try to go for
shadow<00:04:56.250> call<00:04:56.520> but<00:04:56.729> I<00:04:56.760> didn't<00:04:57.210> know<00:04:57.300> who<00:04:57.479> killer

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
shadow call but I didn't know who killer

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.870 
shadow call but I didn't know who killer
not<00:04:58.020> since<00:04:58.229> I<00:04:58.320> had<00:04:58.350> no<00:04:58.470> boosts<00:04:58.770> so<00:04:59.430> me<00:04:59.580> go<00:04:59.729> to

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
not since I had no boosts so me go to

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.460 
not since I had no boosts so me go to
ferrothorn<00:05:00.270> just<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:00.630> kind<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:00.840> sac<00:05:01.110> it<00:05:01.290> and

ferrothorn just to kind of sac it and

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.010 
ferrothorn just to kind of sac it and
then<00:05:01.590> maybe<00:05:01.830> you<00:05:02.700> turn<00:05:02.940> with<00:05:03.270> greninja<00:05:03.600> back

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
then maybe you turn with greninja back

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.080 
then maybe you turn with greninja back
into<00:05:04.590> Rotom<00:05:05.280> so<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.669> can<00:05:05.729> get<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.000> free

have to do he is presumably locked into
stone<00:05:30.900> edge<00:05:31.080> but<00:05:31.650> i<00:05:31.919> don't<00:05:32.340> really<00:05:32.550> know

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
stone edge but i don't really know

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.940 
stone edge but i don't really know
because<00:05:33.180> i've<00:05:33.720> only<00:05:33.990> seen<00:05:34.260> that<00:05:34.440> one<00:05:34.590> move<00:05:34.770> off

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
because i've only seen that one move off

because i've only seen that one move off
him<00:05:35.190> but<00:05:35.340> he<00:05:35.400> goes<00:05:35.550> into<00:05:35.789> la<00:05:36.030> Neos<00:05:36.270> which<00:05:37.050> does

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
him but he goes into la Neos which does

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.140
