00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
so now we can begin installation we need

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
so now we can begin installation we need
to<00:01:06.479> remove<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.990> control<00:01:07.320> arm<00:01:07.590> plate<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.100> to

do that we're going to want to lift the
machine<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.530> make<00:01:11.010> disconnecting<00:01:11.610> those

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
machine up to make disconnecting those

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.600 
machine up to make disconnecting those
control<00:01:12.119> arms<00:01:12.360> easier<00:01:13.040> once<00:01:14.040> you've<00:01:14.220> safely

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
control arms easier once you've safely

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.100 
control arms easier once you've safely
supported<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> machine<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:15.930> all

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
supported the machine and you have all

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
supported the machine and you have all
the<00:01:16.229> weight<00:01:16.350> off<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> rear<00:01:16.770> tires<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.790> want

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the weight off the rear tires you want

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.399 
the weight off the rear tires you want
to<00:01:18.030> move<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> shifter<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.020> way<00:01:19.110> back

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to move the shifter all the way back

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.320 
to move the shifter all the way back
into<00:01:19.710> high<00:01:20.009> gear<00:01:22.820> doing<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.240> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
into high gear doing this is going to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.940 
into high gear doing this is going to
give<00:01:24.450> us<00:01:24.479> necessary<00:01:25.049> clearance<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> remove

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
give us necessary clearance to remove

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.780 
give us necessary clearance to remove
the<00:01:26.070> control<00:01:26.460> arm<00:01:26.640> bolts<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:29.400> now<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:29.579> can

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the control arm bolts so now we can

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.490 
the control arm bolts so now we can
start<00:01:30.000> loosening<00:01:30.450> each<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.869> those<00:01:30.960> four<00:01:31.259> bolts

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
start loosening each of those four bolts

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.880 
start loosening each of those four bolts
and<00:01:31.920> removing<00:01:32.430> each<00:01:32.579> nut<00:01:32.909> from<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> backside

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
and removing each nut from the backside

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.560 
and removing each nut from the backside
we're<00:01:34.890> using<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.189> 15<00:01:35.579> millimeter<00:01:35.820> socket<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
we're using a 15 millimeter socket and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.260 
we're using a 15 millimeter socket and
ratchet<00:01:37.049> along<00:01:37.979> with<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> 15<00:01:38.640> millimeter<00:01:38.850> end

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
ratchet along with the 15 millimeter end

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.039 
ratchet along with the 15 millimeter end
wrench<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> backside<00:01:41.659> once<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.780> pulled

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
wrench for the backside once you pulled

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.060 
wrench for the backside once you pulled
all<00:01:43.290> four<00:01:43.560> nuts

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
all four nuts

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.700 
all four nuts
carefully<00:01:44.640> remove<00:01:44.790> each<00:01:45.119> bolt

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.170 

doing<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.830> will<00:01:50.040> disconnect<00:01:50.520> each<00:01:50.670> control

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
doing this will disconnect each control

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.000 
doing this will disconnect each control
arm<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.540> allow<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> pull<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.710> stock

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
make attaching the arms a little easier

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.509 
make attaching the arms a little easier
we'll<00:03:07.230> be<00:03:07.380> back<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.709> torque<00:03:07.950> these<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.160> little

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
we'll be back to torque these a little

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.990 
we'll be back to torque these a little
later<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.940> video<00:03:10.400> so<00:03:11.400> now<00:03:11.519> we<00:03:11.580> can<00:03:11.790> put<00:03:11.910> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
later in the video so now we can put the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.720 
later in the video so now we can put the
machine<00:03:12.300> back<00:03:12.330> on<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.750> ground<00:03:13.400> then<00:03:14.400> move<00:03:14.580> on

machine back on the ground then move on
to<00:03:14.760> installing<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.480> two<00:03:15.660> upright<00:03:16.080> arms<00:03:16.440> and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
to installing the two upright arms and

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.560 
to installing the two upright arms and
it's<00:03:17.250> important<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.790> note<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.030> there<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.390> a

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
left and right side to these so make

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.360 
left and right side to these so make
sure<00:03:20.280> you're<00:03:20.519> installing<00:03:20.850> them<00:03:21.150> correctly<00:03:22.370> we

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
sure you're installing them correctly we

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.250 
sure you're installing them correctly we

both<00:03:42.450> flanges<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.230> into<00:03:43.860> m8<00:03:44.220> nylock<00:03:44.640> nut<00:03:45.200> we

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
both flanges and into m8 nylock nut we

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.660 
both flanges and into m8 nylock nut we
just<00:03:46.410> want<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.620> leave<00:03:46.709> all<00:03:46.980> these<00:03:47.160> bolts<00:03:47.370> loose

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
just want to leave all these bolts loose

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.490 
just want to leave all these bolts loose
for<00:03:47.940> now<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.269> then<00:03:48.660> move<00:03:48.810> on<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:48.989> installing
