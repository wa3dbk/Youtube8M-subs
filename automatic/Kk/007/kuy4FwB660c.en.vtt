00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.500 
did the web announce announcement for us
and<00:00:58.059> our<00:00:59.050> web<00:00:59.830> traffic<00:01:00.190> hits<00:01:00.820> were<00:01:01.120> twelve

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
and our web traffic hits were twelve

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.350 
and our web traffic hits were twelve
thousand<00:01:02.290> strong<00:01:02.650> for<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.790> for<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.089> dream

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.450 
thousand strong for the for the dream
solo<00:01:04.780> series<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.350> I<00:01:05.650> think<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.950> reason<00:01:06.130> why

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
solo series and I think the reason why

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.550 
solo series and I think the reason why
is<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:06.820> we've<00:01:07.450> taken<00:01:07.480> the<00:01:07.960> American<00:01:08.380> Dream

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
is that we've taken the American Dream

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.649 
is that we've taken the American Dream
and<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:09.159> British<00:01:09.460> dream<00:01:09.729> and<00:01:09.970> we've<00:01:10.300> deployed

super excited one of the big differences
with<00:05:47.690> third<00:05:47.870> power<00:05:48.139> is<00:05:48.470> that<00:05:48.830> I<00:05:49.430> design

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
with third power is that I design

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.850 
with third power is that I design
amplifiers<00:05:50.419> a<00:05:50.510> sound<00:05:50.810> like<00:05:51.020> mixed<00:05:51.470> records

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
amplifiers a sound like mixed records

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.970

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
it up runs it through an e through pull

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.460 
it up runs it through an e through pull
techie<00:06:01.760> cues<00:06:02.060> or<00:06:02.300> something<00:06:02.660> like<00:06:02.780> that<00:06:02.840> runs

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
techie cues or something like that runs
