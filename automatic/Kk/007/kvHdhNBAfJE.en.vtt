00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.800
 What is this smell? 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.180
 It's a rotten smell. 

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:10.295
 why are you looking at me like that? 

00:00:10.295 --> 00:00:12.028
 This is not my smell. 

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:17.555
 Look 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.120
 This is a dead sheep 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.980
 How does he leave so in the way? 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.935
 It smells unbearable 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380
 Let's walk away from this place 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.240
 wait 

00:00:28.435 --> 00:00:30.435
 I can not afford that smell 

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:31.789
 neither am I 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.260
 But... 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.760
 But... 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.115
 but what? 

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:35.880
 What do you think? 

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:38.235
 How to benefit from the fur? 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.640
 The atmosphere is very cold in some neighboring countries 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.280
 There are many who want heating 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.115
 What 

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:48.424
 are you crazy? 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.160
 He was dead, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade eating dead meat 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 It's weird 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.560
 Let me 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.900
 Contact a friend of mine 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.820
 Hello Karim 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.560
 What is this smell? 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.855
 O Allah 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.220
 Did you smell the lamb? 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.260
 Sheep? 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.640
 I'm talking about the food that my wife was preparing 

00:01:18.794 --> 00:01:20.794
 Burned as usual. 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 Uh ... Haha 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.180
 listen to me 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.120
 Yes Yes.. 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.200
 There is talk about the Prophet peace be upon him in Bukhari 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.800
 The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed through a dead tree 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 He said: "Will you enjoy the fire?" 

00:01:38.814 --> 00:01:40.814
 They said: "She's dead." 

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:43.435
 He said: "It is forbidden to eat it." 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.320
 Ahabah means his skin 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.680
 It is possible to use the lamb's fur or skin 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.280
 Wonderful we have to take it for those who can clean it 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.080
 Huh? 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.880
 Friends, do you support Karim what he wants?
