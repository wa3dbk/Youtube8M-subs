 none 

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:03.460
 After Obama became president, 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.460
 I came out even though I could not 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.699
 About North Korea 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.699
 I'm talking about him and his shovel 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.179
 It is confronted with a special feature of planning. 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.760
 It's all in the American drama sector 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.310
 970309 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.740
 It's a written word. 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.989
 Kyungnam Bank is nothing. 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.559
 In the end, 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.569
 That's not what the military is doing. 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.100
 961101 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.290
 The reason the police are not mobilized 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.710
 Afghan experts have enough of a vision 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.739
 The discriminative regulatory approach and politicians. 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.060
 Two years ago, the new government of North Korea, 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.190
 That 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.690
 Group 16 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.510
 Now, when North Korea comes out of the world, 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.130
 It was the taxpayer who asserted it. 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.360
 Kim Hyo-seok has fun and put a lot of design ankle 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.939
 It is not the catch, but the reversal, of course, 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.840
 I can think of North Korea's support for now 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.380
 There is. Whether you are going to be around the world 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 When you do not know 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.340
 Also in Korea time he 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.400
 May American and 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.590
 I do not have a military guarantee for North Korea 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.219
 What North Korea is saying now 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.909
 I have heard that you are doing it. 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.290
 Falling from North Korea 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.710
 I looked at 8 this morning and said, 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.290
 There is. 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.490
 In fact, 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.410
 Because I'm rusty and I do not know 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.540
 When he entered the station, he was excluded, 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.380
 I came here today and have a briefing on the country 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.540
 I think you can claim that four or four. 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.140
 North Korea, of course, is not to mention international legal theory. 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.140
 It seems to me how to do it while keeping it. 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.070
 Now the heart 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.730
 To what extent do foreigners go up and spend the 7th year 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:19.259
 Go and tell us what the US is responsible for 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.549
 I do not know who is the first time in the presidential election 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:23.279
 The fact is 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:25.499
 a lot of people 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.629
 500,000 won at a time 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.849
 Sooyou Yoo, so now I write home for the first time 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:33.239
 I have it to me 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.499
 It is also the case when Kim Dae-jung is on the way down 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:38.150
 Did you 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.889
 Stand up and take your hand. 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.009
 Passing past Pohang 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.849
 It is if it is Michelle 1819 line going to one day. 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.849
 That is why the US government 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.109
 Even if the floods in North Korea are like work in the company 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.129
 I broke it. 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.089
 Social problem 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:59.349
 The reason I give the word that will be made as the leader 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:01.359
 In South Korea 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.119
 That information to North Korea 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.909
 I'm going to say that the United States is going to go to the field. 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.909
 Well, anyway. 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.829
 Index 2000 times 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.229
 Why did he do that? 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.059
 Doctors in Myanmar and China 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:20.199
 Looking at the opening of this document, 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.229
 In order 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.389
 Women who did medical treatment 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.339
 US Open 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:31.859
 The world is reported to be accurate in North Korea. 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.179
 I told you about it. 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:38.639
 I think they would have been able to talk to them and have production capacity. 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.409
 Pay the customs duty 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.409
 I have pointed out that it did not take place. 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:47.749
 Would it be 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:52.309
 Being sold in the United States and settling in Yonsei University, 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.309
 It is in the country. Our generation is selected 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.129
 Marines and Marines belonging to Busan come here all over the place 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.809
 I have it with me. 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:06.669
 According to the time it has been received, 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.859
 The government has since married. First thing. 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.560
 Blizzard World News Anchor first seen to see 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:14.519
 There is. 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.479
 The past education department 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.919
 It's not North Korea's missile. 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.020
 Buying Immigrant II is the way I can imagine that the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.919
 As a sponsor 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.020
 Mimi 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.620
 I asked you to make the fruit. 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.530
 After that incident, a few remaining US mba 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.600
 There was no operation across the desert on the way to studying abroad. 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.980
 There was. 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.719
 Finding theaters 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.839
 In the middle of 2000 

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:46.039
 I wrote a new book to go to the scratch house of the six-team system. 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.379
 That fool you 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:50.650
 This is a US soldier. 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.350
 They beat Japan and demanded sex. 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.240
 Is there anyone? 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.689
 Their ages 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.330
 The bruises are such excellent ones themselves. Last year's level 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.810
 Was there a dot 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.810
 Away 16 11 

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:07.800
 Because it does not. 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.080
 Preview 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.810

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.210
 It's sexual activity in the game. 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.490
 0 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.880
 When I got the press, I got it from the Navy headquarters. 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.059
 Carry out recognition 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:27.239
 There are not many consultations on the issue. 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.129
 What objection has popularity through investigating illegal 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:33.369
 I did it. 

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.589
 chimera
