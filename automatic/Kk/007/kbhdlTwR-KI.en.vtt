hey everyone today we're going to be
doing<00:00:07.340> a<00:00:07.640> unique<00:00:08.000> fishtail<00:00:08.630> braid<00:00:08.900> to<00:00:09.770> begin<00:00:10.160> I

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
doing a unique fishtail braid to begin I

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.970 
doing a unique fishtail braid to begin I
am<00:00:10.730> splitting<00:00:11.030> the<00:00:11.330> hair<00:00:11.510> in<00:00:11.660> half<00:00:11.900> and<00:00:12.320> then

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
am splitting the hair in half and then

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.980 
am splitting the hair in half and then
I'm<00:00:13.130> going<00:00:13.340> to<00:00:13.400> start<00:00:13.760> out<00:00:13.940> by<00:00:14.300> making<00:00:14.330> just<00:00:14.870> a

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
I'm going to start out by making just a

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.929 
I'm going to start out by making just a
regular<00:00:15.230> fishtail<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:16.279> if<00:00:16.550> you<00:00:16.670> don't<00:00:16.850> know

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
regular fishtail and if you don't know

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.960 
regular fishtail and if you don't know
how<00:00:17.090> to<00:00:17.119> do<00:00:17.420> that<00:00:17.650> I'm<00:00:18.650> taking<00:00:19.099> a<00:00:19.220> small<00:00:19.580> strand

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
how to do that I'm taking a small strand

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.569 
how to do that I'm taking a small strand
here<00:00:20.360> from<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:21.140> section<00:00:21.619> on<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:21.860> right<00:00:22.009> and

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:22.579 
here from the section on the right and

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.359 
here from the section on the right and
I'm<00:00:23.060> crossing<00:00:23.540> it<00:00:23.660> over<00:00:23.840> to<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:24.380> inside<00:00:24.980> of

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
I'm crossing it over to the inside of

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.540 
I'm crossing it over to the inside of
the<00:00:25.669> section<00:00:26.119> on<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:26.270> left<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:27.220> then<00:00:28.220> I'm

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
the section on the left and then I'm

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.519 
the section on the left and then I'm
going<00:00:28.790> to<00:00:28.880> take<00:00:29.180> a<00:00:29.239> small<00:00:29.480> strand<00:00:30.050> from<00:00:30.380> the

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
going to take a small strand from the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.950 
going to take a small strand from the
outside<00:00:31.070> of<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.340> left<00:00:31.579> section<00:00:32.270> and<00:00:32.750> I'm

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
outside of the left section and I'm

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.229 
outside of the left section and I'm
crossing<00:00:33.380> it<00:00:33.470> over<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.070> inside<00:00:34.579> of<00:00:34.940> the

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
crossing it over to the inside of the

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.569 
crossing it over to the inside of the
right<00:00:35.420> section<00:00:35.810> and<00:00:36.230> I'm<00:00:37.039> just<00:00:37.250> going<00:00:37.519> to

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
right section and I'm just going to

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.819 
right section and I'm just going to
repeat<00:00:38.000> that<00:00:38.449> down<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:38.899> few<00:00:39.500> times<00:00:41.829> starting

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
repeat that down a few times starting

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.950 
repeat that down a few times starting
this<00:00:42.949> braid<00:00:43.250> is<00:00:43.429> the<00:00:43.579> hardest<00:00:43.940> part<00:00:44.090> once<00:00:44.780> you

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
this braid is the hardest part once you

00:00:44.960 --> 00:01:00.040 
this braid is the hardest part once you
get<00:00:45.109> it<00:00:45.230> going<00:00:45.850> it<00:00:46.850> goes<00:00:47.030> pretty<00:00:47.269> easy

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.390 

okay<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.110> now<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.440> i<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.860> braided

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
okay so now that i have that braided

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.910 
okay so now that i have that braided
down<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.850> little<00:01:03.060> ways<00:01:03.360> i'm<00:01:03.720> going<00:01:04.050> to<00:01:04.290> take<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
down a little ways i'm going to take the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.910 
down a little ways i'm going to take the
outside<00:01:05.550> edges<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.270> these<00:01:06.420> strands<00:01:06.870> and<00:01:07.560> just

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
outside edges of these strands and just

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.280 
outside edges of these strands and just
pull<00:01:08.130> them<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> little<00:01:08.880> bit<00:01:09.120> and<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:10.110> is

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
pull them out a little bit and this is

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.010 
pull them out a little bit and this is
an<00:01:10.440> absolutely<00:01:11.130> necessary<00:01:11.910> but<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.600> does<00:01:12.810> make

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
an absolutely necessary but it does make

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.200 
an absolutely necessary but it does make
this<00:01:13.200> braid<00:01:13.560> look<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.490> bit<00:01:14.700> better<00:01:14.910> in

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
this braid look a little bit better in

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.310 
this braid look a little bit better in
my<00:01:15.420> opinion

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.010 

okay<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:19.610> now<00:01:19.850> we<00:01:20.210> are<00:01:20.270> going<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.690> switch<00:01:20.990> up

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
okay so now we are going to switch up

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.410 
okay so now we are going to switch up
this<00:01:21.350> braid<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:22.010> instead<00:01:22.850> of<00:01:23.000> bringing<00:01:23.150> the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
this braid and instead of bringing the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.330 
this braid and instead of bringing the
strands<00:01:23.840> over<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.320> top<00:01:24.560> we<00:01:24.890> are<00:01:25.010> going<00:01:25.190> to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
strands over the top we are going to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.040 
strands over the top we are going to
bring<00:01:25.520> them<00:01:25.670> underneath<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:26.450> we're<00:01:26.600> making<00:01:26.930> an

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
bring them underneath so we're making an

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.100 
bring them underneath so we're making an
inside-out<00:01:27.710> fishtail<00:01:28.250> braid<00:01:28.490> at<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:28.790> point

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
inside-out fishtail braid at this point

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.140 
inside-out fishtail braid at this point
so<00:01:30.110> I'm<00:01:30.380> grabbing<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:31.100> small<00:01:31.340> section<00:01:31.640> here

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
so I'm grabbing a small section here

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.790 
so I'm grabbing a small section here
from<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.570> surround<00:01:32.869> on<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.110> right<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.710> I'm

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
from the surround on the right and I'm

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.890 
from the surround on the right and I'm
bringing<00:01:34.159> it<00:01:34.250> underneath<00:01:34.700> over<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.720> other

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
bringing it underneath over to the other

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.280 
bringing it underneath over to the other
side<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:36.729> adding<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:37.850> into<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.390> inside<00:01:38.990> of

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
side and adding it into the inside of

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.499 
side and adding it into the inside of
that<00:01:39.560> left<00:01:39.860> strand<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.490> then<00:01:40.880> same<00:01:41.180> thing<00:01:41.210> on

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
that left strand and then same thing on

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.900 
that left strand and then same thing on
this<00:01:41.660> side<00:01:41.720> I'm<00:01:42.290> taking<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.220> small<00:01:43.460> strand<00:01:43.790> from

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
this side I'm taking a small strand from

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.150 
this side I'm taking a small strand from
the<00:01:44.060> outside<00:01:44.570> bringing<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.259> underneath<00:01:45.619> to

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
the outside bringing it underneath to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.090 
the outside bringing it underneath to
the<00:01:46.250> inside<00:01:46.810> these<00:01:47.810> first<00:01:48.140> couple<00:01:48.440> of<00:01:48.800> pieces

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
the inside these first couple of pieces

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.279 
the inside these first couple of pieces
that<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.520> do<00:01:49.850> aren't<00:01:50.420> really<00:01:50.690> going<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:51.020> show

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
that you do aren't really going to show

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.100 
that you do aren't really going to show
up<00:01:51.590> it's<00:01:51.950> being<00:01:52.310> braided<00:01:52.820> kind<00:01:53.210> of<00:01:53.300> behind<00:01:53.720> in

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
up it's being braided kind of behind in

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.279 
up it's being braided kind of behind in
the<00:01:54.200> back<00:01:55.030> but<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.270> further<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:56.660> go<00:01:56.930> down

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
the back but the further you go down

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.210 
the back but the further you go down
you're<00:01:57.740> going<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.009> see<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:58.490> pop<00:01:59.180> and<00:02:00.220> it'll

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
you're going to see this pop and it'll

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.580 
you're going to see this pop and it'll
leave<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:01.729> little<00:02:01.940> crisscross<00:02:02.360> section<00:02:03.229> there

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
leave a little crisscross section there

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.520 
leave a little crisscross section there
at<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.520> top<00:02:04.759> of<00:02:05.119> where<00:02:05.660> you<00:02:05.840> changed<00:02:06.350> up<00:02:06.500> the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
at the top of where you changed up the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.499 
at the top of where you changed up the
braid

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.110 

okay<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.769> can<00:02:11.799> kind<00:02:12.189> of<00:02:12.250> see<00:02:12.519> that<00:02:12.849> other

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
okay so you can kind of see that other

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.110 
okay so you can kind of see that other
braid<00:02:13.450> forming<00:02:13.989> now<00:02:14.200> underneath<00:02:17.939> just<00:02:18.939> keep

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
braid forming now underneath just keep

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.479 
braid forming now underneath just keep
going<00:02:19.150> down<00:02:19.780> until<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.620> get<00:02:20.829> it<00:02:20.950> about<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
going down until you get it about the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.460 
going down until you get it about the
same<00:02:21.730> length<00:02:22.120> as<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.780> did<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.079> regular

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
same length as you did the regular

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.180 
same length as you did the regular
fishtail<00:02:23.799> on<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.549> top

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.680 

okay<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:29.250> now<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.090> inside-out

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
okay so now that I have the inside-out

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.630 
okay so now that I have the inside-out
fishtail<00:02:31.170> braid<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.530> down<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.710> little<00:02:32.040> ways<00:02:32.310> i'm

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
fishtail braid it down a little ways i'm

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.190 
fishtail braid it down a little ways i'm
going<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.970> go<00:02:33.060> back<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.480> regular<00:02:33.660> fishtail

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
going to go back to a regular fishtail

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.530 
going to go back to a regular fishtail
and<00:02:34.710> I'm<00:02:35.130> not<00:02:35.160> going<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.670> stretch<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.210> these

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
and I'm not going to stretch out these

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.750 
and I'm not going to stretch out these
strands<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.200> think<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.500> adds<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.100> effect<00:02:38.190> if

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
strands I think it adds to the effect if

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.340 
strands I think it adds to the effect if
this<00:02:39.090> part<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.570> braid<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.960> little<00:02:40.230> bit

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
this part of the braid is a little bit

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.340 
this part of the braid is a little bit
skinnier<00:02:40.800> than<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.130> part<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.750> I'm<00:02:43.020> going

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
skinnier than this part so I'm going

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.500 
skinnier than this part so I'm going
back<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.740> regular<00:02:43.950> fishtail<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:45.120> grabbing

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
back to a regular fishtail and grabbing

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.180 
back to a regular fishtail and grabbing
a<00:02:45.600> Strad<00:02:45.870> from<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.140> outside<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.070> I'm

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
a Strad from the outside and I'm

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.530 
a Strad from the outside and I'm
crossing<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.730> over<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.540> other<00:02:48.840> side<00:02:49.350> and

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
crossing it over to the other side and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.390 
crossing it over to the other side and
again<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.810> isn't<00:02:52.110> going<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.650> look<00:02:52.860> like<00:02:52.890> much

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
again this isn't going to look like much

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.820 
again this isn't going to look like much
here<00:02:53.790> for<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> few<00:02:54.360> minutes<00:02:54.570> until<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.620> braid

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
here for a few minutes until the braid

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.740 
here for a few minutes until the braid
gets<00:02:56.070> going<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.700> then<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.030> will<00:02:57.150> see<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.480> pop

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
gets going and then you will see it pop

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:10.650 
gets going and then you will see it pop
out<00:02:57.930> again

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.690 

ok<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:11.720> again<00:03:12.050> i'm<00:03:12.620> done<00:03:12.830> with<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.129> section

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
ok so again i'm done with that section

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.400 
ok so again i'm done with that section
and<00:03:13.940> i'm<00:03:14.060> going<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.330> stretch<00:03:14.810> out<00:03:15.019> these

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
and i'm going to stretch out these

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:24.380 
and i'm going to stretch out these
strands<00:03:15.800> a<00:03:16.010> little<00:03:16.220> bit

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.170 

so<00:03:25.350> we<00:03:25.560> are<00:03:25.650> going<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.040> tight<00:03:26.280> arse<00:03:26.580> off<00:03:26.910> right

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
so we are going to tight arse off right

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.150 
so we are going to tight arse off right
here<00:03:27.540> if<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.900> have<00:03:28.080> longer<00:03:28.319> hair<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.890> course

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
here if you have longer hair of course

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.100 
here if you have longer hair of course
you<00:03:29.430> could<00:03:29.580> keep<00:03:29.760> going<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:30.510> start<00:03:30.810> with

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
you could keep going and start with

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.350 
you could keep going and start with
another<00:03:31.650> inside-out<00:03:32.370> fishtail<00:03:32.880> there<00:03:33.120> at<00:03:33.240> the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
another inside-out fishtail there at the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:43.080 
another inside-out fishtail there at the
bottom

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.150 

you
