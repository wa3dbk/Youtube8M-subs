and run it through the hair so I I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.270 
and run it through the hair so I I

before<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:26.280> let<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.820> dry<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.420> makes<00:01:27.630> sense

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
before I let it dry that makes sense

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.660 
before I let it dry that makes sense
because<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.680> last<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.159> first<00:01:29.369> time<00:01:29.640> I
