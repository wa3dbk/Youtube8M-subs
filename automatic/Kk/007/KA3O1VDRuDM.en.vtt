00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
YouTube for my first video this is the

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.899 
YouTube for my first video this is the
char<00:00:12.909> driller<00:00:13.299> pellet<00:00:14.139> grill<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:15.610> is<00:00:15.879> a

00:00:15.899 --> 00:00:15.909 
char driller pellet grill this is a

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:20.550 
char driller pellet grill this is a
smoker<00:00:16.330> and<00:00:17.040> it<00:00:18.040> is<00:00:18.220> electric<00:00:18.580> and<00:00:19.210> as<00:00:20.200> you<00:00:20.410> can

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
smoker and it is electric and as you can

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.090 
smoker and it is electric and as you can
see<00:00:20.700> here<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:23.140> have<00:00:23.440> a<00:00:23.830> temperature<00:00:24.820> setting

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
see here we have a temperature setting

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.420 
see here we have a temperature setting
so<00:00:27.100> you<00:00:27.220> can<00:00:27.520> control<00:00:28.000> the<00:00:28.539> temperatures<00:00:29.080> on

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
so you can control the temperatures on

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.630 
so you can control the temperatures on
your<00:00:30.430> meats<00:00:30.700> and<00:00:30.990> as<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.409> how<00:00:32.589> long<00:00:32.920> you<00:00:33.429> want

your meats and as to how long you want

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.489 
your meats and as to how long you want
them<00:00:33.789> to<00:00:33.909> cook<00:00:34.120> either<00:00:35.079> slow<00:00:35.589> or<00:00:37.230> even<00:00:38.230> fast

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499 
them to cook either slow or even fast

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.979 
them to cook either slow or even fast
for<00:00:38.739> that<00:00:38.829> matter<00:00:39.069> the<00:00:40.059> settings<00:00:40.510> on<00:00:40.839> this

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
for that matter the settings on this

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.040 
for that matter the settings on this
unit<00:00:41.409> go<00:00:42.010> from<00:00:42.249> smoke<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:43.800> 375<00:00:44.800> degrees<00:00:46.050> and

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
unit go from smoke to 375 degrees and

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.040 
unit go from smoke to 375 degrees and
even<00:00:47.170> higher<00:00:48.030> probably<00:00:49.030> more<00:00:49.329> realistically

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
even higher probably more realistically

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.950 
even higher probably more realistically
in<00:00:50.289> the<00:00:50.409> 500<00:00:50.949> range<00:00:51.420> however<00:00:52.420> I<00:00:52.780> personally

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
in the 500 range however I personally

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.959 
in the 500 range however I personally
cook<00:00:53.710> all<00:00:53.979> my<00:00:54.699> meats<00:00:54.969> slow<00:00:55.719> and<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.699> that<00:00:57.850> they

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
cook all my meats slow and so that they

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.889 
cook all my meats slow and so that they
can<00:00:58.149> get<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.539> lot<00:00:58.749> of<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:59.049> smoke<00:00:59.799> flavor<00:01:00.899> this

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
can get a lot of the smoke flavor this

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.880 
can get a lot of the smoke flavor this
