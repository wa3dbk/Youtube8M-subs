00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 what alas we are in creative crisis 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.110
 we absolutely don't know what 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.099
 talk then when I know what 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.099
 talk everything comes to him the stopgap 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.880
 ok i am very afraid of opening state 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.500
 we avoid the rules because the rules are 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.769
 that while we play we decide what is the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.439
 yours or why not open it open then 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.210
 so now we're going to read and go 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.540
 fundamental questions im the wicked 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.800
 quid wicked quizzes of rizzi are of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.329
 questions that have been written by man 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.620
 mysterious that lives between the camera 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.070
 which has a big question mark with 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.809
 two arms this man is written 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.940
 of the leaflet applications for 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.309
 try when we are ignorant of what it is 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.170
 clear and obvious as to forget 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.760
 the name of this pokÃ©mon that any 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.090
 coach this where you go to see the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.590
 but I know that he respects himself tonight 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.239
 call and own typing mistakes 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.879
 pausing gamer 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.290
 I think right because you take a break 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.820
 because you have to write in a comment 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.890
 the two post and see when you have 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.640
 made then according to this not to mention 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:18.360
 according to you no, he says he sees the moon 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:31.140
 however the various closed person does not 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:33.570
 it works here the toto effect is not 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.640
 game that is

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.530
 if I ask questions they harmonize by vol 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.750
 Well the answer to the insult fights 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.610

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.260
 so long we have seen so much voted 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.490
 only to win because then it is known 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.870

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.730

 the Spanishness of this one is different 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.790
 question is almost embarrassed by the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:28.739
 obviously this creates slides 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:31.540
 but as 1 el 1 this is not very old 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.160

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.250
