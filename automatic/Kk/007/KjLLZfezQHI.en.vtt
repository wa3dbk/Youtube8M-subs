the guy went 10 for 22 just a little bit
under<00:00:19.310> Pittman<00:00:19.789> set<00:00:20.029> I<00:00:20.359> mean<00:00:20.930> he<00:00:21.289> did<00:00:21.500> its<00:00:21.710> par

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.920 
under Pittman set I mean he did its par
I<00:00:23.920> think<00:00:24.920> we<00:00:25.039> had<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:25.310> do<00:00:25.430> a<00:00:25.460> better<00:00:25.760> job<00:00:25.850> I

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.900 

think<00:00:29.930> I<00:00:30.260> think<00:00:31.010> the<00:00:31.310> biggest<00:00:31.550> key<00:00:31.880> to

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
think I think the biggest key to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.849 
think I think the biggest key to
probably<00:00:32.629> you<00:00:32.809> know<00:00:32.930> winning<00:00:33.170> his<00:00:33.379> next<00:00:33.710> game

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:33.859 
probably you know winning his next game

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.760 
probably you know winning his next game
is<00:00:34.600> doing<00:00:35.600> another<00:00:35.899> great<00:00:36.170> job<00:00:36.410> on<00:00:36.620> those

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
is doing another great job on those

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.779 
is doing another great job on those
other<00:00:36.980> guys<00:00:37.219> like<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:38.719> far<00:00:39.050> Mars<00:00:39.409> and<00:00:39.829> gorges

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
other guys like the far Mars and gorges

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.930 
other guys like the far Mars and gorges
and<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.899> hard<00:00:42.199> tests<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:42.920> out<00:00:43.370> of<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.670> were

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
and the hard tests and out of the were

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.079 
and the hard tests and out of the were
you<00:00:44.629> know<00:00:44.780> pretty<00:00:45.589> much<00:00:45.679> let<00:00:46.100> Coby<00:00:46.609> and<00:00:46.760> Gasol

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089

do now

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.259 
do now
I<00:00:48.769> think<00:00:49.489> that's<00:00:49.639> how<00:00:49.760> we're<00:00:49.969> good<00:00:50.089> yeah<00:00:50.210> but

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
I think that's how we're good yeah but

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.789 
I think that's how we're good yeah but
cookie<00:00:50.569> hasn't<00:00:50.749> really<00:00:50.929> taken<00:00:51.049> over<00:00:51.229> game<00:00:51.589> yet

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
cookie hasn't really taken over game yet

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.599 
cookie hasn't really taken over game yet
like<00:00:52.179> I<00:00:53.179> think<00:00:53.989> that's<00:00:54.109> been<00:00:54.289> a<00:00:54.319> very<00:00:54.609> it's

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
like I think that's been a very it's

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.000 
like I think that's been a very it's
been<00:00:55.789> a<00:00:55.819> factor<00:00:56.350> you<00:00:57.350> haven't<00:00:57.559> sensed<00:00:57.769> it<00:00:57.889> him

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
been a factor you haven't sensed it him

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.490 
been a factor you haven't sensed it him
any

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
any

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.920

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
in no discomfort to him at all you can

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.270 
in no discomfort to him at all you can
tell<00:01:02.080> that<00:01:02.230> using<00:01:02.500> a<00:01:02.590> comfortable<00:01:03.040> out<00:01:03.100> there

you want I think it's more so a team
thing<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.380> I<00:01:15.070> think<00:01:15.400> we<00:01:15.490> doing<00:01:15.760> a<00:01:15.850> great<00:01:16.060> job

basically focusing on the Lakers but I

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.820 
basically focusing on the Lakers but I

think going through those guys different

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.140 
think going through those guys different
Kobe<00:01:53.830> shoots<00:01:54.009> better<00:01:54.340> than<00:01:54.580> all<00:01:54.670> those<00:01:54.910> guy

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
Kobe shoots better than all those guy

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.330

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
series do you think that's also only

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.650 
series do you think that's also only
going<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.370> be<00:04:04.460> the<00:04:04.610> difference<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.180> terms<00:04:05.420> of

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
going to be the difference in terms of

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.440 
going to be the difference in terms of
winning<00:04:06.440> 5050<00:04:07.130> balls<00:04:07.340> hustling<00:04:08.000> for<00:04:08.210> plays

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
winning 5050 balls hustling for plays

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.140 
winning 5050 balls hustling for plays
like<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:09.140> think<00:04:09.380> that's<00:04:09.500> like<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.740> main

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
like that I think that's like the main

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.220 
like that I think that's like the main
distinguishing<00:04:11.150> thing<00:04:11.600> going<00:04:11.900> indoor

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
distinguishing thing going indoor

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.130 
distinguishing thing going indoor
scissors<00:04:12.710> yeah<00:04:13.610> I<00:04:14.090> mean<00:04:14.330> considering<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:15.080> a

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
scissors yeah I mean considering that a

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.229 
scissors yeah I mean considering that a
lot<00:04:15.380> of<00:04:15.410> these<00:04:15.620> games<00:04:15.890> being<00:04:16.280> grind<00:04:16.640> out<00:04:16.910> games

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
lot of these games being grind out games

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.520 
lot of these games being grind out games
they<00:04:17.930> haven't<00:04:18.650> been<00:04:18.799> no<00:04:18.980> like<00:04:19.330> 116<00:04:20.330> so<00:04:20.750> 119<00:04:21.500> a

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
they haven't been no like 116 so 119 a

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.780 
they haven't been no like 116 so 119 a
110

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
110

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.540 
110
type<00:04:23.060> gamesman<00:04:23.750> all<00:04:24.410> games<00:04:24.830> are<00:04:25.070> pretty<00:04:25.280> much

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
type gamesman all games are pretty much

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.360 
type gamesman all games are pretty much
been<00:04:25.790> as<00:04:26.060> even<00:04:26.810> hundreds<00:04:27.230> under<00:04:27.950> hunt

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
been as even hundreds under hunt
