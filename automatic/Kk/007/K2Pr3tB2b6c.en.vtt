00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
moment in time I mean Caesar could have

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.920 
moment in time I mean Caesar could have
thought<00:03:42.100> of<00:03:42.160> stabbing<00:03:42.940> smoker<00:03:43.329> a<00:03:43.480> bit<00:03:43.690> later

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
thought of stabbing smoker a bit later

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.539

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.860 
and that would have been too late we
would<00:03:45.640> have<00:03:45.730> all<00:03:45.850> died<00:03:46.030> anyway<00:03:46.359> it's<00:03:46.600> just

completely<00:03:47.079> out<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.560> chance<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:48.790> a

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
completely out of chance and it's a

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.800 
completely out of chance and it's a
person's<00:03:49.870> life<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:51.820> allowed<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.390> straw<00:03:52.600> has

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810

up<00:05:02.050> living<00:05:02.259> and<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:03.610> know<00:05:03.729> what<00:05:03.909> if<00:05:04.120> that<00:05:04.300> was

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
up living and you know what if that was

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.510 
up living and you know what if that was
the<00:05:04.509> case<00:05:04.539> I'm<00:05:04.990> betting<00:05:05.409> her<00:05:05.830> orgasm<00:05:06.430> would

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
the case I'm betting her orgasm would

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.330 
the case I'm betting her orgasm would
have<00:05:06.639> lasted<00:05:07.060> like<00:05:07.620> half<00:05:08.620> an<00:05:08.770> hour<00:05:08.919> rather

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
have lasted like half an hour rather

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.140 
have lasted like half an hour rather
than<00:05:09.520> 10<00:05:09.759> minutes<00:05:09.940> and<00:05:11.520> by<00:05:12.520> that<00:05:12.699> time<00:05:12.759> we

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
than 10 minutes and by that time we

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.159 
than 10 minutes and by that time we
would<00:05:13.270> have<00:05:13.360> already<00:05:13.479> like<00:05:13.719> escape<00:05:14.020> the

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
would have already like escape the

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.659 
would have already like escape the
island<00:05:14.259> so<00:05:14.710> it'd<00:05:14.889> be<00:05:14.919> all<00:05:15.099> good<00:05:15.250> in<00:05:15.400> any<00:05:15.490> way

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
island so it'd be all good in any way

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.089 
island so it'd be all good in any way
because<00:05:16.389> the<00:05:16.509> tryouts<00:05:16.870> are<00:05:16.990> gonna<00:05:17.199> die<00:05:17.409> you

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
because the tryouts are gonna die you

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.680 
because the tryouts are gonna die you
know<00:05:18.219> she<00:05:18.789> would<00:05:18.879> have<00:05:18.969> gotten<00:05:19.029> stuff<00:05:19.389> somehow

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
know she would have gotten stuff somehow

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.649 
know she would have gotten stuff somehow
so<00:05:20.050> probably<00:05:20.289> just<00:05:20.440> an<00:05:20.500> extended<00:05:20.830> orgasm

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
so probably just an extended orgasm

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.469 
so probably just an extended orgasm

we've been seeing sanji smoking like the

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.010 
we've been seeing sanji smoking like the
whole<00:05:37.750> series<00:05:38.199> so<00:05:38.560> this<00:05:39.340> is<00:05:39.490> cool<00:05:39.759> saying<00:05:40.539> baby

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.300 
5 pretty cool character smoking and that
just<00:05:44.529> makes<00:05:44.650> me<00:05:44.740> think<00:05:44.800> that<00:05:45.009> she<00:05:45.190> doesn't

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
just makes me think that she doesn't

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.189 
just makes me think that she doesn't
even<00:05:45.460> more<00:05:45.759> perfect<00:05:46.089> match<00:05:46.449> for<00:05:46.719> sanji

even more perfect match for sanji

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.070 
even more perfect match for sanji
because<00:05:48.099> he<00:05:48.699> can<00:05:48.879> just<00:05:49.060> ask<00:05:49.210> her<00:05:49.539> to<00:05:49.659> marry<00:05:49.810> him

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
because he can just ask her to marry him

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.100 
because he can just ask her to marry him
and<00:05:50.610> it's<00:05:51.610> all<00:05:51.789> good<00:05:52.000> because<00:05:52.240> if<00:05:52.569> dopamine

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
and it's all good because if dopamine

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.540 
and it's all good because if dopamine
comes<00:05:53.409> and<00:05:53.620> tries<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.830> kill<00:05:54.339> all<00:05:54.460> the
