be sitting on a shelf for a while not
that<00:00:16.810> there<00:00:16.930> is<00:00:17.020> anything<00:00:17.200> really<00:00:17.470> wrong<00:00:17.890> with

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
that there is anything really wrong with

it
it<00:00:18.850> just<00:00:19.180> doesn't<00:00:19.390> have<00:00:19.660> the<00:00:19.689> same<00:00:19.810> features

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
it just doesn't have the same features

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.880 
it just doesn't have the same features
that<00:00:20.560> I've<00:00:20.710> got<00:00:20.890> on<00:00:21.130> my<00:00:21.279> new<00:00:21.400> 9xr<00:00:22.119> I<00:00:22.800> found<00:00:23.800> a

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
that I've got on my new 9xr I found a

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.370 
that I've got on my new 9xr I found a
couple<00:00:24.099> of<00:00:24.250> things<00:00:24.310> that<00:00:24.960> are<00:00:25.960> really<00:00:26.110> easy

couple of things that are really easy

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.620 
couple of things that are really easy
once<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:26.890> know<00:00:26.980> how<00:00:27.160> to<00:00:27.220> do<00:00:27.400> them<00:00:27.550> but<00:00:28.540> they

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
once you know how to do them but they

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.710 
once you know how to do them but they
weren't<00:00:28.779> that<00:00:28.960> easy<00:00:29.110> to<00:00:29.259> figure<00:00:29.439> out

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
weren't that easy to figure out

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.170 
weren't that easy to figure out
sorry<00:00:31.720> turnigy<00:00:32.169> but<00:00:32.349> an<00:00:32.739> online<00:00:33.579> manual<00:00:33.880> is

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
not just the best way to do things but I

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.610 
not just the best way to do things but I
did<00:00:36.340> I<00:00:36.670> did<00:00:36.850> finally<00:00:37.210> read<00:00:37.390> it<00:00:37.510> okay<00:00:38.380> so<00:00:38.440> we're

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
we can see it's set for my puddle twin

there's<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.660> thousand<00:00:44.170> videos<00:00:44.440> that<00:00:44.590> show<00:00:44.710> you

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
there's a thousand videos that show you

there's a thousand videos that show you
that<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:46.239> one<00:00:46.480> is<00:00:46.809> specifically<00:00:47.620> for<00:00:48.039> the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
that this one is specifically for the

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.509 
that this one is specifically for the
safety<00:00:48.879> switch<00:00:49.300> I<00:00:49.829> wanted<00:00:50.829> to<00:00:50.949> use<00:00:51.160> the

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
safety switch I wanted to use the

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.360 
safety switch I wanted to use the
throttle<00:00:52.269> cutoff<00:00:52.780> right<00:00:53.079> here<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.800> disable<00:00:54.190> my

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
throttle cutoff right here to disable my

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.169 
throttle cutoff right here to disable my
throttle<00:00:54.850> or<00:00:55.000> enable<00:00:55.660> it<00:00:55.750> so<00:00:56.199> that<00:00:56.440> I<00:00:56.620> can<00:00:57.179> not

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
throttle or enable it so that I can not

00:00:58.179 --> 00:00:59.939 
throttle or enable it so that I can not
have<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.449> worry<00:00:58.719> about<00:00:58.780> bumping<00:00:59.260> my<00:00:59.559> throttle

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
have to worry about bumping my throttle

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
my switch up throttle control is good

my switch up throttle control is good
here's<00:01:21.430> how<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:21.640> do<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:23.160> we<00:01:24.160> go<00:01:24.310> into<00:01:24.490> our

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
here's how you do it we go into our

here's how you do it we go into our
model<00:01:26.500> menus<00:01:29.550> we<00:01:30.550> zip<00:01:30.760> on<00:01:30.880> across<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.450> page<00:01:32.820> 10

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
the lower throttle switch when I say

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.020 
the lower throttle switch when I say
lower<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.230> mean<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.620> lower<00:01:41.770> position<00:01:42.460> that's

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
lower I mean the lower position that's

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.500 
lower I mean the lower position that's
exclamation<00:01:43.870> throttle<00:01:44.760> up<00:01:45.760> is<00:01:46.060> non

exclamation throttle up is non
exclamation<00:01:47.350> throttle<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.790> I<00:01:49.030> want<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.450> full

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
exclamation throttle and I want the full

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.240 
exclamation throttle and I want the full
down<00:01:50.230> value<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.030> throttle<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.110> not<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.380> servo

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
down value on a throttle is not a servo

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.070 
down value on a throttle is not a servo
it<00:01:54.460> doesn't<00:01:54.730> have<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:54.880> center<00:01:55.180> position<00:01:55.630> we<00:01:55.900> go

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
it doesn't have a center position we go

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.280 
it doesn't have a center position we go
zero<00:01:56.620> throttle<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.700> full<00:01:57.730> throttle<00:01:58.240> center<00:01:59.140> is

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
zero throttle to full throttle center is

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.100 
zero throttle to full throttle center is
still<00:01:59.500> half<00:02:00.100> throttle<00:02:00.550> so<00:02:01.330> we<00:02:01.420> want<00:02:01.600> fold<00:02:01.900> down

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
still half throttle so we want fold down

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.980 
still half throttle so we want fold down
on<00:02:02.290> our<00:02:02.440> trim<00:02:02.760> that's<00:02:03.760> where<00:02:03.940> it<00:02:04.030> lands<00:02:04.360> this

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
on our trim that's where it lands this

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.660 
on our trim that's where it lands this
one<00:02:05.230> happens<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.710> be<00:02:06.360> twin<00:02:07.360> motors<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.459> did

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
one happens to be twin motors so I did

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.160 
one happens to be twin motors so I did
the<00:02:09.759> same<00:02:09.910> thing<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.269> channel<00:02:10.599> 6<00:02:10.869> where<00:02:11.080> I've

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
the same thing on channel 6 where I've

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.020 
the same thing on channel 6 where I've
got<00:02:11.349> my<00:02:11.470> other<00:02:11.590> speed<00:02:11.920> control<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.640> that's

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
got my other speed control and that's

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.640 
got my other speed control and that's
because<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:13.569> differential<00:02:14.110> throttle<00:02:14.470> but

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
because I have differential throttle but

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.650 
because I have differential throttle but
that's<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.010> whole<00:02:15.070> another<00:02:15.250> video<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:16.510> in<00:02:16.600> any
