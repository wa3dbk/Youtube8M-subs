00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
grilles we're gonna go over a few more

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.140 
grilles we're gonna go over a few more
things<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.160> how<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.340> concept<00:03:14.760> actually<00:03:15.030> came

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
things and how the concept actually came

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.199 
things and how the concept actually came
up<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:17.670> concept<00:03:18.030> for<00:03:18.120> this

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
up so this is the the concept for this

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.789 
up so this is the the concept for this
is<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.540> Black<00:03:18.720> Widow<00:03:18.870> concept<00:03:19.350> black<00:03:19.560> widow
