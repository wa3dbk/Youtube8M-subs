00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
licks and my own improvisation but I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.070

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.910 
suggest that you should feel free to be
creative<00:02:52.110> with<00:02:52.950> worthless<00:02:53.700> lick<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.630> can

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920
