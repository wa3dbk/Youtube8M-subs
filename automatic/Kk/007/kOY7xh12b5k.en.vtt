00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hi liquid today I'm cooking 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.920
 without oven it's a challenge that badly in these 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.410
 shells of on my blog 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.490
 to cook a meal without fake I'm going so 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.380
 show you how we make 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.030
 chicken ballottine with foie gras with 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.309
 a small rocket salad and a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.269
 very nice dressing if you too 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.010
 you want to challenge me 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.390
 do not hesitate to go on my 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.529
 blog whose greece is showing right there and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.400
 then go for the ballottine of 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.400
 chicken go we go 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.050
 2 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.580
 we start by cutting out the supreme of 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.409
 chicken in the thickness so as to 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.720
 have a homogeneous thickness of about 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.430
 half a centimeter the chicken supreme 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.070
 it's just white people with a 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.840
 nicer name and then the scarified 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.970
 with the knife without cutting them 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.890
 completely in order to avoid that he 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.290
 curls up during cooking and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.270
 then we place them between two layers 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.840
 of film paper and we will beat them and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.580
 now let off steam the kids and that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.440
 it allows us to tenderize the meat 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.930
 then cut the liver slice 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.860
 fat in sticks about 1 cm 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.500
 thick 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 we have to pepper and let them 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.380
 side and then we start doing 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.810
 boil some water 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.450
 then we will cut the onion and for 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.700
 do that we slice it in two 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.530
 it is cut in the height in the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.420
 width and then we made small 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.979
 squares me I'm cheating a little bit I 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.070
 group in order to have really soon 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.200
 tiny little square then 1 6l the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.000
 chives added to the onion 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.000
 also add the grenade 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.009
 and we cut the radishes into slices and that 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.480
 will add some crunch in our life 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.670
 negative we add the olive oil on 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.590
 dirty we pepper and taste of course 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.819
 to adjust to his taste that's what 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.680
 it looks like and then we go to 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.780
 ballottine for that in place a stick 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.459
 of foie gras to in a supreme account a 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.400
 role on himself and then we go on the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.860
 dick with paper film lo 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.510
 we make knots on the sides for 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.489
 not that it breaks and then we go 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.290
 place in boiling water for 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.400
 keep the ballottine in the water 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.920
 boiling and make sure they are 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.840
 cooked in a homogeneous way 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.840
 on top of a bowl that keeps them 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.400
 and then we can go to dressage on 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.560
 put the rocket in the center of the plate 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.560
 we add the sauce 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.100
 on top of it, we like there are the little ones 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.570
 aperitif cakes these are poppy 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.150
 but you can use Parmesan cheese 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.920
 for example, we then cut 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.080
 ballottine once they are cooked 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.060
 in slices and we have them around 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.600
 the salad and finally we add the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.100
 germinated seeds 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.100
 and here are the kids treat you well
