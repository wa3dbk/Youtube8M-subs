about<00:00:26.320> three<00:00:26.529> to<00:00:26.650> four<00:00:26.829> minutes<00:00:27.160> or<00:00:27.340> till<00:00:27.759> they

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
about three to four minutes or till they

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.890 
about three to four minutes or till they
have<00:00:28.089> cook<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.429> makaras<00:00:30.939> takes<00:00:31.480> some<00:00:31.630> time<00:00:31.869> to

have cook the makaras takes some time to
get<00:00:32.199> crisp<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.930> do<00:00:38.050> not<00:00:38.140> want<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.620> mikanos<00:00:39.070> to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
get crisp we do not want the mikanos to

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.770 
get crisp we do not want the mikanos to
turn<00:00:39.400> brown<00:00:39.760> because<00:00:39.940> that<00:00:40.300> will<00:00:40.420> not<00:00:40.600> look

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
turn brown because that will not look

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.439 
turn brown because that will not look
good<00:00:40.989> in<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.290> keith<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.760> make<00:00:42.970> sure<00:00:43.000> you<00:00:43.269> keep

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
good in the keith so make sure you keep

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.319 
good in the keith so make sure you keep
stirring<00:00:43.510> it<00:00:44.170> occasionally<00:00:44.699> you<00:00:45.699> can<00:00:45.850> mix<00:00:46.180> it

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
stirring it occasionally you can mix it

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.450 
stirring it occasionally you can mix it
like<00:00:46.360> this<00:00:46.690> also<00:00:46.930> so<00:00:47.860> that<00:00:48.010> they<00:00:48.100> are<00:00:48.160> evenly

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
like this also so that they are evenly

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.400 
like this also so that they are evenly
getting<00:00:48.789> cooked<00:00:49.059> from<00:00:49.360> all<00:00:49.539> the<00:00:49.690> sides<00:00:49.870> you

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
getting cooked from all the sides you

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.069 
getting cooked from all the sides you
can<00:00:50.559> see<00:00:50.859> before<00:00:51.730> they<00:00:51.850> turn<00:00:52.090> more<00:00:52.539> Brown<00:00:52.870> I

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
can see before they turn more Brown I

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.080 
can see before they turn more Brown I
just<00:00:53.590> switch<00:00:53.739> off<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.070> flame<00:00:54.309> that<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.789> sign

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
just switch off the flame that is a sign

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.880 
just switch off the flame that is a sign
that<00:00:55.120> they<00:00:55.359> have<00:00:55.449> turned<00:00:55.660> crisp<00:00:56.050> or<00:00:56.620> if<00:00:56.769> you

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
that they have turned crisp or if you

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.560 
that they have turned crisp or if you
want<00:00:57.039> you<00:00:57.129> can<00:00:57.250> even<00:00:57.340> taste<00:00:57.699> one<00:00:57.969> in<00:00:58.120> check<00:00:58.359> and

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
want you can even taste one in check and

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.930 
want you can even taste one in check and
now<00:00:59.079> we<00:00:59.140> will<00:00:59.350> cool<00:00:59.590> them<00:00:59.739> slightly<00:01:00.039> and<00:01:00.460> blend

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
now we will cool them slightly and blend

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.250 
now we will cool them slightly and blend
them<00:01:01.090> in<00:01:01.239> a<00:01:01.269> mixer<00:01:01.690> till<00:01:01.899> they<00:01:02.019> are<00:01:02.109> of<00:01:02.230> course

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
them in a mixer till they are of course

powder see the Makana has gone into a
coarse<00:01:04.989> powder<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.560> now<00:01:06.070> we<00:01:06.130> move<00:01:06.460> forward<00:01:06.759> to

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
coarse powder and now we move forward to

the next step first take a deep pan

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.570 
the next step first take a deep pan
we'll<00:01:10.570> take<00:01:10.780> some<00:01:11.020> milk<00:01:11.200> in<00:01:11.410> it<00:01:11.560> this<00:01:12.160> is<00:01:12.220> full

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
we'll take some milk in it this is full

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.389 
we'll take some milk in it this is full
fat<00:01:12.820> milk<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.960> I<00:01:14.050> am<00:01:14.110> using<00:01:14.440> over<00:01:14.649> here<00:01:14.890> we

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
fat milk that I am using over here we

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.460 
fat milk that I am using over here we
are<00:01:15.460> going<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.670> heat<00:01:15.910> this<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:20.080> what<00:01:20.229> we<00:01:20.410> are

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
are going to heat this so what we are

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.050 
are going to heat this so what we are
doing<00:01:20.530> here<00:01:20.979> is<00:01:21.190> we<00:01:21.369> are<00:01:21.399> going<00:01:21.459> to<00:01:21.610> heat<00:01:21.880> the

doing here is we are going to heat the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.570 
doing here is we are going to heat the
milk<00:01:22.330> after<00:01:22.569> it's<00:01:23.170> hot<00:01:23.380> we'll<00:01:23.920> add<00:01:24.039> the<00:01:24.250> sugar

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
milk after it's hot we'll add the sugar

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.580 
milk after it's hot we'll add the sugar
and<00:01:24.759> mix<00:01:24.819> it<00:01:25.420> till<00:01:25.539> it<00:01:25.660> dissolves<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.289> then

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
and mix it till it dissolves and then

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.580 
and mix it till it dissolves and then
we'll<00:01:26.770> add<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.069> crushed<00:01:27.280> mcconnell's<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
we'll add the crushed mcconnell's the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.919 
we'll add the crushed mcconnell's the
reason<00:01:29.920> why<00:01:30.039> we<00:01:30.190> are<00:01:30.220> using<00:01:30.300> full<00:01:31.300> fat<00:01:31.509> milk<00:01:31.539> is

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
reason why we are using full fat milk is

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.080 
reason why we are using full fat milk is
here<00:01:32.140> because<00:01:32.289> normally<00:01:32.890> in<00:01:32.979> case<00:01:33.280> that<00:01:33.910> is

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
here because normally in case that is

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.999 
here because normally in case that is
what<00:01:34.270> is<00:01:34.390> used<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.840> gives<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.349> key<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.590> very

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
what is used and gives the key a very

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.430 
what is used and gives the key a very
nice<00:01:36.250> creaminess<00:01:36.789> and<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.479> very<00:01:37.869> nice<00:01:38.110> thick

add<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.440> sugar<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.250> we'll<00:01:54.399> wait<00:01:54.640> till<00:01:54.879> length

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
add the sugar so we'll wait till length

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.639 
add the sugar so we'll wait till length
this<00:01:56.170> took<00:01:56.410> 5<00:01:56.649> minutes<00:01:56.979> to<00:01:57.129> boil<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.640> now<00:01:57.670> I

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
this took 5 minutes to boil and now I

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.979 
this took 5 minutes to boil and now I
lack<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.860> sugar<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:03.179> just<00:02:04.179> keep<00:02:04.450> mixing<00:02:04.690> it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:04.989 
lack the sugar and just keep mixing it

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:07.050 
lack the sugar and just keep mixing it
continuously<00:02:05.679> till<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.399> sugar<00:02:06.550> has<00:02:06.849> melted

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
continuously till the sugar has melted

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.820 
continuously till the sugar has melted
completely<00:02:07.300> in<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:08.110> milk

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
completely in the milk

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.860 
completely in the milk
normally<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:11.069> Kiel<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:12.000> have<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.330> reduce<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
normally in Kiel you have to reduce the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.680 
normally in Kiel you have to reduce the
mill<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.349> almost<00:02:14.040> half<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.239> is<00:02:15.390> when<00:02:15.569> you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
mill to almost half and that is when you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.509 
mill to almost half and that is when you
get<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.989> thick<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.530> creamy<00:02:16.709> texture<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.340> a

get the thick and creamy texture of a

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.039 
get the thick and creamy texture of a
key<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.209> what<00:02:18.450> we're<00:02:18.569> going<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.720> do<00:02:18.840> here

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
key this is what we're going to do here

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.059 
key this is what we're going to do here
also<00:02:20.900> now<00:02:21.900> after<00:02:22.200> I've<00:02:22.260> added<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.650> sugar<00:02:22.830> I've

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
also now after I've added the sugar I've

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.890 
also now after I've added the sugar I've
cooked<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.760> high<00:02:24.209> flame<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.599> about

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
two minutes and then I reduce the flame

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.930 
two minutes and then I reduce the flame
to<00:02:27.989> medium<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.860> now<00:02:29.430> we<00:02:29.489> will<00:02:29.700> add<00:02:29.760> the

and<00:03:00.810> once<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.440> keep<00:03:01.560> cooking<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.069> will<00:03:02.340> get

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
and once you keep cooking it will get

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.309 
and once you keep cooking it will get
thicker<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.000> thicker<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.569> that's<00:03:04.049> what<00:03:04.230> you

powder we will give it a mix and cook it
for<00:03:31.380> one<00:03:31.709> more<00:03:31.889> minute

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
for one more minute

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.729 
for one more minute
you<00:03:32.940> must<00:03:33.150> think<00:03:33.389> it's<00:03:33.630> still<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.900> bit<00:03:34.200> thin<00:03:34.500> but

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
you must think it's still a bit thin but

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.740 
you must think it's still a bit thin but
once<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:35.669> cools<00:03:36.000> down<00:03:36.090> it's<00:03:36.389> going<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.569> thicken

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
once it cools down it's going to thicken

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.589 
once it cools down it's going to thicken
up<00:03:36.959> more<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:37.829> do<00:03:37.950> not<00:03:38.069> worry<00:03:38.250> about<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.639> now

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
up more so do not worry about that now

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.449 
up more so do not worry about that now
the<00:03:39.660> kheer<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.139> done<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.980> can<00:03:41.160> see<00:03:41.310> the
