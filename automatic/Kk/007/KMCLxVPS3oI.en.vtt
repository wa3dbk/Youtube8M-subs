00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.650
 to make the rib of today you go 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.830
 need two weeks keeps cutting 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:17.000
 slice of that two petal type inside 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.289
 travels two tablespoons of wheat flour 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.779
 1 is a cube of beef broth and 2 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.970
 chopped tomatoes 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.840
 It's okay, it's only half a show and 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:37.200
 a cup of coarse sugar-free coffee and 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.520
 a plate of coke a spoon of 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.820
 pepper in a holder to be able to show 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.710
 the tire scoop or at night we go 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.860
 make a black rib today 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.260
 the first step is to boil the rib in 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.110
 hot water for five minutes to take 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.110
 the excess fat that it is 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.760
 Now we're going to visit our 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.800
 ecosystem I did not put on Sunday the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.880
 ball close to the European 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.020
 treatment 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.490
 worth the time because it already okay 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.490
 so the prison sentence 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:29.960
 the chopped garlic died elite claimed squid 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.960
 with oil and meat for three minutes 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:38.450
 stir for a few more minutes after two 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:45.220
 minutes add the broth 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.220
 add a spoon add the coke 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.390
 Do you know what will happen to this? 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.390
 add oil 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.250
 add coffee 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.600
 richa 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:15.510
 I added wheat now it's a man 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:18.540
 full put two more cups of water 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.110
 that is the purchase of the meat, right? 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:32.810
 but as it was going to fall know who was already pre- 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:32.810
 here a finger says it's good 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.140
 and let it cook over low heat after 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.970
 than the opposition for 20 minutes because 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.430
 My idea is to put cassava after 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.579
 but the ideal is the following text the way 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.040
 here's what makes it close to 40 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.040
 minutes in lives and hair a little more
