the end here we're fighting black for
the<00:00:06.390> final<00:00:06.779> time<00:00:06.980> and<00:00:07.980> then<00:00:08.069> after<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.370> all

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
the final time and then after that all

the final time and then after that all
that's<00:00:09.300> left<00:00:09.480> down<00:00:09.690> there<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.110> green<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.530> then

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
that's left down there is green and then

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.870 
that's left down there is green and then
and<00:00:11.880> then<00:00:12.179> grey<00:00:12.509> himself<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:14.400> appears<00:00:14.460> as

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and then grey himself so it appears as

though we're nearing the end of this
part<00:00:16.830> can<00:00:17.039> be<00:00:17.100> kind<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.520> random<00:00:17.970> whether<00:00:18.180> you

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
part can be kind of random whether you

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330 
part can be kind of random whether you
actually<00:00:18.480> get<00:00:18.810> hit<00:00:18.840> or<00:00:19.080> not<00:00:19.160> sometimes<00:00:20.160> you

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
actually get hit or not sometimes you

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.429 
actually get hit or not sometimes you
get<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.550> like<00:00:21.029> those<00:00:21.240> things<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.930> points

straight<00:00:22.680> down<00:00:22.740> right<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.430> top<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.970> and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
straight down right on top of you and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.340 
straight down right on top of you and
you<00:00:24.150> literally<00:00:24.449> don't<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.779> any<00:00:24.990> time<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
you literally don't have any time to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.470 
you literally don't have any time to
react<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.859> before<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.340> get<00:00:26.609> hit<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:27.330> other

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
react to it before you get hit but other

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.390 
react to it before you get hit but other
times<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.080> pretty<00:00:28.349> easy<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.130> there

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
times it's pretty easy like it was there

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.730 
times it's pretty easy like it was there
that<00:00:30.359> he<00:00:30.420> likes<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.019> attack<00:00:31.410> where<00:00:31.679> he

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
that he likes to do this attack where he

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.139 
that he likes to do this attack where he
shoots<00:00:32.009> those<00:00:32.160> things<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.820> sort<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
shoots those things out and sort of the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.910 
shoots those things out and sort of the
circular<00:00:33.390> pattern<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.469> you're<00:00:34.590> supposed<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
circular pattern and you're supposed to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.799 
circular pattern and you're supposed to
like<00:00:35.100> jump<00:00:35.309> up<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.969> then<00:00:36.090> jump<00:00:36.329> over<00:00:36.660> him

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
like jump up here and then jump over him

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.470 
like jump up here and then jump over him
in<00:00:37.260> order<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> avoid<00:00:37.890> everything<00:00:38.480> but

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
in order to avoid everything but

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.850 
in order to avoid everything but
thankfully<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> killed<00:00:40.200> them<00:00:40.290> off<00:00:40.440> before<00:00:40.649> I

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
thankfully I killed them off before I

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.750 
thankfully I killed them off before I
had<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.100> worry<00:00:41.340> about<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:44.250> now<00:00:44.430> there's

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
had to worry about that so now there's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.400 
had to worry about that so now there's
only<00:00:44.850> one<00:00:45.149> guy<00:00:45.329> left<00:00:45.360> down<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.260> that's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
only one guy left down there and that's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.950 
only one guy left down there and that's
green<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.969> that's<00:00:48.180> who<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.750> fight

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960

green so that's who we have to fight
next<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.770> fight<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.129> green<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.670> really

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
it's kind of random but this is what I

it's kind of random but this is what I
meant<00:01:10.670> about<00:01:10.730> you<00:01:10.970> can<00:01:11.090> be<00:01:11.180> cheap<00:01:11.420> with<00:01:11.450> this

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
fight you can do a sit here trap them in

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.120 
fight you can do a sit here trap them in
a<00:01:14.060> corner<00:01:14.420> keep<00:01:15.020> walking<00:01:15.440> its<00:01:15.590> attacks<00:01:15.890> with

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
a corner keep walking its attacks with

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.670 
a corner keep walking its attacks with
the<00:01:16.310> fire<00:01:16.790> chaser<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.570> then<00:01:18.290> just<00:01:18.470> keep

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
the fire chaser and then just keep

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.920 
the fire chaser and then just keep
putting<00:01:18.860> damaging<00:01:19.430> on<00:01:19.580> but<00:01:20.240> that's<00:01:20.390> boring<00:01:20.630> so

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
putting damaging on but that's boring so

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.510 
putting damaging on but that's boring so
why<00:01:21.050> would<00:01:21.170> I<00:01:21.200> want<00:01:21.410> to<00:01:21.470> do<00:01:21.590> that

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.890 

is<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.730> more<00:01:26.910> fun<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.150> fight<00:01:27.750> him

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
is it's more fun to fight him

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.300 
is it's more fun to fight him
hand-to-hand<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.710> because<00:01:29.010> all<00:01:29.160> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
hand-to-hand it's because all the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.720 
hand-to-hand it's because all the
jumping<00:01:29.640> around<00:01:29.760> and<00:01:30.090> everything<00:01:31.730> he's

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
jumping around and everything he's

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.310 
jumping around and everything he's
actually<00:01:32.940> not<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.420> good<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.170> he

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
actually not that good at it like he

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.990 
actually not that good at it like he
seems<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.680> he<00:01:34.830> would<00:01:34.980> be<00:01:35.040> really<00:01:35.370> good<00:01:35.640> but

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
seems like he would be really good but

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.850 
seems like he would be really good but
he<00:01:36.480> can<00:01:36.630> only<00:01:36.660> attack<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.710> you're

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
he can only attack you like if you're

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.920 
he can only attack you like if you're
here<00:01:38.190> you're<00:01:38.400> pretty<00:01:38.640> much<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.330> vulnerable

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
smart way to do it but it's a lot more

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.820 
smart way to do it but it's a lot more
fun<00:02:05.070> than<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.759> know<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.840> trapping<00:02:07.770> them

boss<00:02:12.150> but<00:02:14.000> haha<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.600> was<00:02:15.660> awesome<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.530> then

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
boss but haha that was awesome and then

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.770 
boss but haha that was awesome and then
everything<00:02:17.340> slows<00:02:17.790> down<00:02:17.819> when<00:02:18.270> he<00:02:18.630> dies

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
everything slows down when he dies

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.010 
everything slows down when he dies
that's<00:02:19.080> pretty<00:02:19.350> cool<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:21.630> now<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.930> we

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
that's pretty cool so now that we

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.229 
that's pretty cool so now that we
finished<00:02:22.350> off<00:02:22.470> green<00:02:22.920> we<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.880> go<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.150> this

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
finished off green we can go in this

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.550 
finished off green we can go in this
door<00:02:24.480> here<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:24.959> looks<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.350> get<00:02:25.470> to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
door here and it looks like we get to

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.240 
door here and it looks like we get to
face<00:02:25.739> off<00:02:25.950> against<00:02:26.340> gray<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:28.590> he's<00:02:28.890> got<00:02:29.069> those

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
face off against gray and he's got those

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.180 
face off against gray and he's got those
for<00:02:29.550> gems<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.090> he<00:02:30.209> took<00:02:30.420> from<00:02:30.480> us

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
for gems that he took from us

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.940 
for gems that he took from us
whoa<00:02:32.880> they<00:02:33.750> appear<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.080> have<00:02:34.200> turned<00:02:34.380> on<00:02:34.590> him

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.320 

so<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> guess<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.520> don't<00:02:38.610> have<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.850> fight<00:02:39.060> gray

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
so I guess we don't have to fight gray

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.000 
so I guess we don't have to fight gray
after<00:02:39.690> all<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.990> gyms<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.290> taken<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.710> mind<00:02:40.920> of

point<00:03:33.300> where<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.870> guy<00:03:34.020> basically<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:34.740> sort

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
point where that guy basically just sort

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.920 
point where that guy basically just sort
of<00:03:35.340> stays<00:03:35.610> up<00:03:35.850> there<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.330> is<00:03:36.510> really

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
of stays up there and this is really

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.860 
of stays up there and this is really
easy<00:03:37.489> just<00:03:38.489> keep<00:03:38.730> fire<00:03:38.970> on<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.360> gyms<00:03:39.600> they

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
easy just keep fire on the gyms they

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.240 
easy just keep fire on the gyms they
don't<00:03:40.020> really<00:03:40.230> do<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.410> whole<00:03:40.530> lot<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.220> I

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.410 
don't really do a whole lot to you I
mean<00:03:41.459> none<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:41.640> them<00:03:41.880> are<00:03:42.030> really<00:03:42.150> that

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
mean none of them are really that

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.050 
mean none of them are really that
threatening<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:44.520> know<00:03:44.610> just<00:03:44.790> kind<00:03:45.000> of

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
threatening so you know just kind of

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.790 
threatening so you know just kind of
shoot<00:03:45.510> at<00:03:45.690> whichever<00:03:45.959> one<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.380> shooting<00:03:46.680> at

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
shoot at whichever one is shooting at

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.170 
shoot at whichever one is shooting at
you<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.280> it's<00:03:47.430> health<00:03:47.640> goes<00:03:47.850> down<00:03:48.000> pretty

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
you and it's health goes down pretty

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.449 
you and it's health goes down pretty
quickly<00:03:48.510> it's<00:03:49.110> sort<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.380> anti<00:03:49.709> climactic<00:03:50.190> it

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
quickly it's sort of anti climactic it

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.710 
quickly it's sort of anti climactic it
would<00:03:50.550> have<00:03:50.640> been<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.760> lot<00:03:51.060> harder<00:03:51.330> if<00:03:51.540> they

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
would have been a lot harder if they

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.060 
would have been a lot harder if they
would<00:03:51.870> have<00:03:51.959> kept<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.230> first<00:03:52.500> form<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.950> whole

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
would have kept the first form the whole

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.670 
would have kept the first form the whole
time<00:03:53.250> but<00:03:54.209> anyway<00:03:54.570> now<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.810> we've<00:03:55.050> done<00:03:55.410> that

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
time but anyway now that we've done that

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.650 
time but anyway now that we've done that
that's<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.190> final<00:03:56.550> stage<00:03:56.790> clear<00:03:57.239> so<00:03:57.510> we've

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
that's the final stage clear so we've

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.710 
that's the final stage clear so we've
we've<00:03:58.200> beaten<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.650> game<00:03:58.770> here<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.880> all<00:04:03.570> the

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
we've beaten the game here and all the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:11.870 
we've beaten the game here and all the
gems<00:04:03.959> get<00:04:04.200> destroyed<00:04:04.890> one<00:04:05.310> by<00:04:05.459> one<00:04:10.850> kind<00:04:11.850> of

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
gems get destroyed one by one kind of

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.910 
gems get destroyed one by one kind of
jump<00:04:12.120> around<00:04:12.360> they're<00:04:12.560> not<00:04:13.560> really<00:04:13.709> much<00:04:13.860> to

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
jump around they're not really much to

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.460 
jump around they're not really much to
do<00:04:14.330> so<00:04:15.330> i'm<00:04:15.450> pretty<00:04:15.540> much<00:04:15.660> all<00:04:15.900> that's<00:04:16.109> left<00:04:16.260> is

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
do so i'm pretty much all that's left is

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.949 
do so i'm pretty much all that's left is
to<00:04:16.530> watch<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.950> ending<00:04:17.220> sequence

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.360 

seems<00:04:20.959> we<00:04:21.109> got<00:04:21.139> our<00:04:21.380> little<00:04:21.410> spaceship<00:04:22.100> back

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
seems we got our little spaceship back

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.140 
seems we got our little spaceship back
and<00:04:23.500> i<00:04:24.500> think<00:04:25.310> that's<00:04:25.460> supposed<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.880> be<00:04:26.000> like

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
and i think that's supposed to be like

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.750 
and i think that's supposed to be like
some<00:04:26.389> ancient<00:04:27.200> destroy<00:04:27.770> or<00:04:28.010> something<00:04:28.580> i

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
some ancient destroy or something i

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.180 
some ancient destroy or something i
don't<00:04:29.510> know<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:29.930> some<00:04:30.020> big<00:04:30.500> ancient<00:04:30.950> evil

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
don't know it's some big ancient evil

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.250 
that we all want to stop we have
awakened<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.520> terrible<00:04:35.060> destructors<00:04:35.810> okay

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
it's the destructor not the destroyer

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.150 
you all even though I was controlled by
the<00:05:19.980> Empire<00:05:20.430> I'm<00:05:20.940> going<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:21.840> make<00:05:22.260> amends<00:05:22.770> for

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
the Empire I'm going to make amends for

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.500 
the Empire I'm going to make amends for
the<00:05:23.460> things<00:05:23.730> I<00:05:25.190> have<00:05:26.190> done<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.730> all<00:05:27.120> of<00:05:27.330> you

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
the things I have done to all of you

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.280 
the things I have done to all of you
yeah<00:05:28.500> so<00:05:28.680> basically<00:05:28.830> that's<00:05:29.250> green<00:05:29.670> story<00:05:30.290> he

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
yeah so basically that's green story he

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.290 
yeah so basically that's green story he
was<00:05:31.440> basically<00:05:31.650> with<00:05:32.220> us<00:05:32.400> he<00:05:32.730> was<00:05:32.850> part<00:05:33.120> of<00:05:33.180> the

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
was basically with us he was part of the

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.500 
was basically with us he was part of the
gunstar<00:05:33.690> heroes<00:05:33.870> team<00:05:34.520> but<00:05:35.520> got<00:05:36.000> brainwashed

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
gunstar heroes team but got brainwashed

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.400 
gunstar heroes team but got brainwashed
I<00:05:37.080> guess<00:05:37.290> by<00:05:37.500> the<00:05:37.560> Empire<00:05:37.980> so<00:05:38.750> he<00:05:39.750> sacrificed

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
I guess by the Empire so he sacrificed

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.260 
I guess by the Empire so he sacrificed
himself<00:05:40.650> in<00:05:41.160> order<00:05:41.430> to<00:05:41.580> stop<00:05:42.390> the<00:05:42.570> destructors

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
himself in order to stop the destructors

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.030 
himself in order to stop the destructors
and<00:05:45.270> now<00:05:45.420> we<00:05:45.870> got<00:05:46.020> our<00:05:46.140> pretty<00:05:46.500> interesting

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
and now we got our pretty interesting

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.100 
and now we got our pretty interesting
