now<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.550> looks<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:38.820> there's<00:02:39.000> two<00:02:39.180> different

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
now it looks like there's two different

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.080 
now it looks like there's two different
sizes<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.959> line<00:02:40.550> so<00:02:41.550> there's<00:02:41.730> no<00:02:41.880> way<00:02:42.030> to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
sizes of line so there's no way to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.570 
sizes of line so there's no way to
actually<00:02:45.709> there's<00:02:46.709> no<00:02:46.830> way<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:46.980> confuse<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
actually there's no way to confuse the

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
the two so go ahead and push them back

00:02:51.209 --> 00:03:07.059 
the two so go ahead and push them back
through

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.589 
filter our filter housing itself so you
just<00:06:02.740> push<00:06:02.949> it<00:06:02.979> in<00:06:03.219> try<00:06:03.639> to<00:06:03.699> pull<00:06:03.939> out<00:06:03.969> doesn't

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
just push it in try to pull out doesn't

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:07.499 
just push it in try to pull out doesn't
come<00:06:04.689> out<00:06:04.810> you're<00:06:05.080> good<00:06:06.060> you've<00:06:07.060> installed<00:06:07.360> it

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
come out you're good you've installed it

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.330 
come out you're good you've installed it
correctly<00:06:07.960> so<00:06:08.379> go<00:06:08.740> ahead<00:06:08.800> and<00:06:08.889> push<00:06:09.099> it<00:06:09.129> in

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
correctly so go ahead and push it in

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:46.290 
correctly so go ahead and push it in
it's<00:06:12.340> not<00:06:12.520> coming<00:06:12.759> out<00:06:12.909> we're<00:06:13.689> good<00:06:45.029> so<00:06:46.029> we've

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
it's not coming out we're good so we've

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.119 
it's not coming out we're good so we've
replaced<00:06:46.479> every<00:06:47.439> component<00:06:47.889> that<00:06:47.949> we're

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
replaced every component that we're

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.670 
replaced every component that we're
supposed<00:06:48.339> to<00:06:48.550> the<00:06:49.210> filter<00:06:49.539> housing<00:06:49.659> and<00:06:50.169> then

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
supposed to the filter housing and then

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.329 
supposed to the filter housing and then
the<00:06:51.270> water<00:06:52.270> line<00:06:52.539> to<00:06:52.569> the<00:06:52.810> ice<00:06:52.899> maker<00:06:53.620> so<00:06:54.129> right

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:54.339 
the water line to the ice maker so right

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:56.459 
the water line to the ice maker so right
now<00:06:54.430> we're<00:06:54.580> cycling<00:06:54.969> the<00:06:55.029> ice<00:06:55.149> maker<00:06:55.449> here<00:06:56.379> in

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:56.469 
now we're cycling the ice maker here in

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:57.779 
now we're cycling the ice maker here in
a<00:06:56.529> minute<00:06:56.710> one<00:06:56.800> nice<00:06:56.949> neat<00:06:56.979> cause<00:06:57.399> for<00:06:57.610> water

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:57.789 
a minute one nice neat cause for water

00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.999 
a minute one nice neat cause for water
the<00:06:58.509> solenoid<00:06:59.020> valve<00:06:59.259> the<00:06:59.529> water<00:06:59.680> valve<00:06:59.889> in

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:00.009 
the solenoid valve the water valve in

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:01.529 
the solenoid valve the water valve in
the<00:07:00.099> back<00:07:00.129> will<00:07:00.460> open<00:07:00.729> up<00:07:00.879> allow<00:07:01.180> water<00:07:01.419> to

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539 
the back will open up allow water to

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:04.439 
the back will open up allow water to
come<00:07:01.779> through<00:07:01.990> the<00:07:02.189> filter<00:07:03.189> here<00:07:03.460> go<00:07:04.270> through

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
come through the filter here go through

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:05.999 
come through the filter here go through
the<00:07:04.539> filter<00:07:04.839> and<00:07:04.930> then<00:07:05.080> go<00:07:05.560> down<00:07:05.740> to<00:07:05.919> the

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:06.009 
the filter and then go down to the

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:06.570 
the filter and then go down to the
icemaker

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
icemaker

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.059 
icemaker
now<00:07:07.240> we<00:07:07.300> might<00:07:07.509> have<00:07:07.569> to<00:07:07.750> cycle<00:07:08.439> a<00:07:08.589> couple

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:09.069 
now we might have to cycle a couple

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:10.679 
now we might have to cycle a couple
times<00:07:09.279> I'm<00:07:09.759> not<00:07:09.789> sure<00:07:10.089> if<00:07:10.180> there's<00:07:10.330> any<00:07:10.479> water

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:10.689 
times I'm not sure if there's any water

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:12.869 
times I'm not sure if there's any water
that's<00:07:11.409> in<00:07:11.589> the<00:07:11.680> filter<00:07:12.039> itself<00:07:12.159> there's<00:07:12.759> no

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:12.879 
that's in the filter itself there's no

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:14.909 
that's in the filter itself there's no
water<00:07:13.029> in<00:07:13.120> the<00:07:13.270> filter<00:07:13.569> and<00:07:14.139> we're<00:07:14.740> probably

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 
water in the filter and we're probably

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.909 
water in the filter and we're probably
right<00:07:15.430> now<00:07:15.870> basically<00:07:16.870> we<00:07:17.139> would<00:07:17.680> just<00:07:17.830> be

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 
right now basically we would just be

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:19.619 
right now basically we would just be
filming<00:07:18.219> up<00:07:18.310> the<00:07:18.430> filter<00:07:18.759> but<00:07:19.300> we<00:07:19.389> can<00:07:19.539> still

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:19.629 
filming up the filter but we can still

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:21.119 
filming up the filter but we can still
check<00:07:19.870> for<00:07:20.050> leaks<00:07:20.199> up<00:07:20.379> here<00:07:20.620> because<00:07:20.740> this<00:07:20.949> is

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:21.129 
check for leaks up here because this is

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:22.679 
check for leaks up here because this is
where<00:07:21.339> it'll<00:07:22.180> come<00:07:22.330> through<00:07:22.360> on<00:07:22.659> both

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:22.689 
where it'll come through on both

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:25.230 
where it'll come through on both
fittings<00:07:23.229> so<00:07:23.949> we're<00:07:24.550> just<00:07:24.580> going<00:07:24.759> to<00:07:24.849> wait<00:07:25.060> and

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
fittings so we're just going to wait and

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.480 
fittings so we're just going to wait and
once<00:07:25.719> we<00:07:25.810> hear<00:07:25.899> the<00:07:26.050> buzz<00:07:26.229> and<00:07:26.589> hear<00:07:27.219> the<00:07:27.310> water

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 
once we hear the buzz and hear the water

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.860 
once we hear the buzz and hear the water
come<00:07:27.729> through<00:07:27.759> the<00:07:27.969> filter<00:07:28.270> we'll<00:07:28.629> check<00:07:28.839> for

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:28.870 
come through the filter we'll check for

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.969 
come through the filter we'll check for
the<00:07:29.080> leaks<00:07:31.110> we<00:07:32.110> have<00:07:32.199> successfully<00:07:32.830> replaced

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:32.979 
the leaks we have successfully replaced

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:35.459 
the leaks we have successfully replaced

the filter housing reinstalled the
waterline<00:07:36.039> that<00:07:36.219> goes

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:36.490 
waterline that goes
