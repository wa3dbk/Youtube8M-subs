set up for charging this one right now
or<00:01:28.210> I<00:01:28.270> could<00:01:28.869> just<00:01:29.020> plug<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.320> in<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.500> run<00:01:29.740> 6

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
or I could just plug it in and run 6

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.690 
or I could just plug it in and run 6
volts<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:31.540> then<00:01:31.690> just<00:01:32.020> snap<00:01:32.260> these<00:01:32.500> up<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:33.010> do

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
volts and then just snap these up and do

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.510 
volts and then just snap these up and do
the<00:01:33.820> correct<00:01:34.119> wiring<00:01:34.420> these<00:01:34.659> in<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.869> series

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the correct wiring these in the series

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.410 
the correct wiring these in the series
diagram<00:01:36.520> which<00:01:36.700> I'll<00:01:36.850> show<00:01:36.970> you<00:01:37.090> here<00:01:37.240> in<00:01:37.330> a

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
diagram which I'll show you here in a

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.410 
diagram which I'll show you here in a
minute<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.680> you'll<00:01:38.799> have<00:01:38.979> 12<00:01:39.670> volt<00:01:39.909> capacity

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
minute and you'll have 12 volt capacity

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.890 
minute and you'll have 12 volt capacity
so<00:01:41.340> again<00:01:42.340> this<00:01:42.580> is<00:01:42.850> my<00:01:43.030> first<00:01:43.240> one<00:01:43.450> some<00:01:43.810> of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
so again this is my first one some of

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.230 
so again this is my first one some of
the<00:01:43.960> tools<00:01:44.170> I<00:01:44.350> used<00:01:44.619> I<00:01:45.220> don't<00:01:45.729> have<00:01:45.850> a<00:01:45.880> dremel

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
the tools I used I don't have a dremel

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.590 
the tools I used I don't have a dremel
yet<00:01:46.420> so<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:46.869> just<00:01:47.200> used<00:01:47.500> my<00:01:47.619> roto<00:01:48.369> saw<00:01:48.640> here<00:01:49.119> to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
yet so I just used my roto saw here to

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.140 
yet so I just used my roto saw here to
cut<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.810> plastic<00:01:50.580> had<00:01:51.580> to<00:01:51.670> go<00:01:51.820> out<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.030> buy

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
cut the plastic had to go out and buy

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.320 
cut the plastic had to go out and buy
some<00:01:52.420> wire<00:01:52.600> snips<00:01:52.960> I<00:01:53.350> did<00:01:53.979> buy<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.159> voltmeter<00:01:54.640> or

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
some wire snips I did buy a voltmeter or

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.240 
some wire snips I did buy a voltmeter or
multimeter<00:01:56.110> how<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.740> really<00:01:56.920> learn<00:01:57.040> how<00:01:57.100> to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
multimeter how to really learn how to

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.310 
multimeter how to really learn how to
use<00:01:57.430> it<00:01:57.549> too<00:01:57.759> much<00:01:57.909> but<00:01:58.689> this<00:01:58.990> might<00:01:59.200> be

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
use it too much but this might be

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.469 
use it too much but this might be
interesting<00:01:59.460> topic<00:02:00.460> for<00:02:00.670> discussion<00:02:00.790> would

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479

parts about an hour to do I only have

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.700 
parts about an hour to do I only have
about<00:02:23.610> twenty<00:02:24.300> five<00:02:24.750> thirty<00:02:25.080> dollars<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.620> the

about twenty five thirty dollars in the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.000 
about twenty five thirty dollars in the
project<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.370> was<00:02:26.460> for<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.910> new<00:02:27.300> battery

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
project and that was for the new battery

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.960 
project and that was for the new battery
just<00:02:29.010> bought<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> bunch<00:02:29.400> these<00:02:29.640> bullet

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
just bought a bunch these bullet

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.950 
just bought a bunch these bullet
connectors<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:31.730> supports<00:02:32.730> teen<00:02:32.880> gauge<00:02:33.120> wire

and<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:35.340> was<00:02:35.550> about<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:36.210> didn't<00:02:36.630> have<00:02:36.750> to

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
and that was about it I didn't have to

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.870 
and that was about it I didn't have to
use<00:02:37.110> inline<00:02:37.380> fuses<00:02:38.040> because<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.370> went<00:02:38.640> with<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
use inline fuses because I went with the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.420 
use inline fuses because I went with the
original<00:02:39.300> Power<00:02:40.200> Wheels<00:02:40.470> batteries<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:41.400> they

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
original Power Wheels batteries so they

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.780 
original Power Wheels batteries so they
have<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:43.370> whenever<00:02:44.370> they're<00:02:44.580> called

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
have the whenever they're called

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.210 
have the whenever they're called
self-correcting<00:02:45.660> breakers<00:02:46.080> whatever<00:02:46.530> self

self-correcting breakers whatever self
resetting<00:02:47.670> breakers<00:02:48.320> I'm<00:02:49.320> saying<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.710> wrong

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
resetting breakers I'm saying that wrong

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.760 
resetting breakers I'm saying that wrong
but<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.130> guys<00:02:50.220> know<00:02:50.400> what<00:02:50.430> I'm<00:02:50.610> saying<00:02:51.770> that's

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
but you guys know what I'm saying that's

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.260 
but you guys know what I'm saying that's
it<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:55.160> can't<00:02:56.160> wait<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:56.640> Ella<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:56.970> give<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.210> a

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
it so can't wait for Ella to give it a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.420 
it so can't wait for Ella to give it a
spin<00:02:58.640> okay<00:02:59.640> here's<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.970> test<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.960> just<00:03:01.530> one<00:03:01.890> six

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
spin okay here's a test of just one six

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.150 
spin okay here's a test of just one six
volt<00:03:02.700> battery<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.810> then<00:03:03.960> I'll<00:03:04.080> do<00:03:04.290> two<00:03:04.860> twelve

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
volt battery and then I'll do two twelve

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.520 
volt battery and then I'll do two twelve
so<00:03:05.460> here's<00:03:05.640> six<00:03:05.850> bolts

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.590 

[Applause]

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:22.920 

and<00:03:13.600> now<00:03:13.930> here's<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.620> 12-volt<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:22.300> looks<00:03:22.810> to

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
and now here's the 12-volt that looks to

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.380 
and now here's the 12-volt that looks to
be<00:03:23.050> about<00:03:23.140> twice<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.590> speed<00:03:24.010> maybe<00:03:24.340> not<00:03:25.180> sure

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
be about twice the speed maybe not sure

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.250 
be about twice the speed maybe not sure
though<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:26.680> here's<00:03:26.860> my<00:03:27.040> final<00:03:27.280> setup<00:03:28.260> we're

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
though so here's my final setup we're

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.780 
though so here's my final setup we're
gonna<00:03:29.500> put<00:03:29.620> some<00:03:29.770> covers<00:03:30.070> on<00:03:30.250> here<00:03:30.490> make<00:03:30.670> it

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
gonna put some covers on here make it

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.970 
gonna put some covers on here make it
all<00:03:30.880> clean<00:03:31.180> but<00:03:31.840> this<00:03:32.020> is<00:03:32.140> my<00:03:32.290> old<00:03:32.560> battery

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
all clean but this is my old battery

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.360 
all clean but this is my old battery
tied<00:03:33.850> in<00:03:34.060> series<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.840> new<00:03:35.020> battery<00:03:35.860> and
