00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hi everyone, and well back on AndroidMod, if you love customizing your device 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.500
 and change your style every week, you've definitely already tried the CyanogenMod theme chooser, 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.290
 which allows a complete aesthetic modification of the firmware thanks to the installation of 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.640
 simple packages. There are so many such themes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.109
 and for all tastes, and thanks to them you can upset your AOSP ROM with style 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.599
 Samsung rather than MIUI, a minimal rather than three-dimensional one. But sometimes it can happen 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.509
 that these are not well optimized and it can also be difficult to choose between 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.940
 hundreds of possibilities present on the Play Store, so today I want to show you those 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.719
 which I think are the best 5 ever. Enough with the premises and let's see them together, 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:41.500
 but first, intro! 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.899
 Well, let's start immediately with the fifth position and here I put Elixium UI, let's set it quickly. 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.420
 This theme does not change many parts of the firmware and is mainly limited to the background, ai 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.520
 menu and within applications. As you can see the navbar and the icons are 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.409
 those of Android Lollipop remain, as well as the tools in the secondary curtain, 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.680
 however the character of the writings has changed and the same is true for some applications of 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.299
 system that now have a black header. The Settings menu has a focused design 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.200
 on the contrast between black and white and as you can see the result is extremely minimal, too 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.899
 more than Lollipop stock. Therefore, a theme with a personalization 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.979
 still limited, but which has an elegant style and presents excellent possibilities for improvement. 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.990
 In fourth place we find Cosmos, completely different and with a lot of personalization 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.619
 more in-depth: you can see it from the navigation bar, whose buttons call up 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.579
 those of the pure Android but have some nuances. 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.409
 As for Elixium, also in this case the icons in the statusbar and those of the applications 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.820
 they do not change, however the changes are already seen in the secondary curtain: headers and tools 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.770
 they are different and, in my opinion, definitely better than the classic ones. Color 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.800
 prevalent is the dark gray with the white voices and the blue switches in the menus. 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.830
 A limitation that prevents this topic from occupying higher rankings 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.640
 it is the fact that some little symbols are not modified: this, as well as rendering the whole 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.670
 more inhomogeneous, leads to the hiding of such symbols when we hold for a long time 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.710
 on the respective item, which does not happen with others. 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.210
 However, apart from this small inconvenience that will hopefully be solved with the next ones 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.670
 updates, it's really a nice theme. 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.060
 Half of the ranking is occupied by Dark Material: a package that changes so 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.950
 radical Lollipop style. Here the personalization starts to become decidedly 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.910
 more complete and the status bar is touched in addition to the navbar. 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.250
 As the name suggests, it is a black theme, and could make the owners happy 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.880
 of smartphone with Amoled display. Once again the design of the instruments changes into the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.120
 secondary curtain and there is a partial modification of the icons of the system apps. This is 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.620
 in my opinion the only weak point because those that change are very few 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.550
 and, in addition to having a very different design than the others, they also have a resolution 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.050
 lower. Not setting them, in any case, personalization 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.390
 it is excellent and the menus are homogeneous and extremely well kept. 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.940
 Let's now move to the second position, here I have inserted Antares. Probably the theme 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.470
 more complete than I know and changes every single part of the firmware. From the bar 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.440
 navigation, to the state one, from the dropdown with the tools to the notifications, from the icons 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.340
 (all with the same style) to applications. Everything is modified and studied in the least 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.320
 details in this theme with polygons (if we can say so): even the boxes with 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.990
 the various sections in the settings. Furthermore, it is a unique feature I believe 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.690
 of its kind, the volume icon in the statusbar is in constant motion: one thing 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.210
 that it is hard to notice but that shows how much the developers have taken care of 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.350
 theme. The only reason why it occupies the second 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.180
 position is that, among all those that I am showing you, it is the only fee; it costs 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.700
 only 98 cents so I think it really deserves to be bought, however this 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.440
 makes him lose a few points. Before showing you the last package I open 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.750
 a very brief parenthesis because on the Play Store there is also another similar theme 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.729
 to Antares, a little less complete but free, called Hexagon. I don't show you but 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.580
 you find it in description with others. 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.400
 Well, we have therefore reached the top of the rankings and the theme that I found the best 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.270
 absolute is Lazy. In reality they are two, Dark and White, but the first has color choices 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.000
 which I liked better then I will show you this. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.569
 There is not much to say, it is simply perfect: everything is personalized and with one 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.810
 completely different style and much more colorful than that of Android stock. 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.400
 An example is the tools in the secondary drop-down, with the tiles that each presented 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.400
 features like changing color when activated, or changing the icon 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.009
 when a mode changes. Continuing with the applications that have very different colors 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.770
 from the classic ones, bright but above all well studied, to get to the menu with the 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.080
 settings on which the dev have really done a great job: you can see that all the 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.229
 symbols and buttons have been changed. 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.020
 Therefore, these in my opinion are the best, even if it always depends on everyone's tastes 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.110
 and, from this point of view, the theme chooser leaves free choice. 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.490
 Before finishing the video, however, I still have a small "bonus", let's call it that, 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.060
 which is simply a series of topics published a few days ago on XDA and which it could do 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.689
 happy Avengers lovers; these are four dedicated packages respectively 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:40.770
 in Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk, they are really well made and go to personalize 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.270
 different aspects of the device. 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.090
 Perfect, the links to download the themes I showed you and which I talked about you find them 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.409
 in description then this is all for today. As for you, which ones are yours 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.139
