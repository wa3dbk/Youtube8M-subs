00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.170
 ah 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.160
 ultrabooks are the new 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.380
 industry to maintain the interests of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.900
 consumers on portable computers 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.210
 lighter and more configurable 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.340
 powerful appliances are ideal for 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.290
 those who do not give up comfort and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.270
 practicality, but they also want 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.230
 possibility of accessing software 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.420
 heavier 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.820
 in this video we analyzed panels 5 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.710
 Taiwanese company laptop acer 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.080
 to the letter of the proposal for a 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.449
 ultrabook lightness and practicality 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.839
 combined with a high setting 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.839
 performance 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.370
 in the case of first impressions 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.370
 there is no denying that what most calls the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.369
 Attention abroad looks like 5 is the fact 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.770
 he is extremely light he does not arrive 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.869
 weighing one pound and 200 grams 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.450
 if one of the characteristics of the trabuco is 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.150
 the practicality without doubt the model of it 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.320
 to be right on this point 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.250
 ideal for carrying 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 schoolbag 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.369
 in the same way the power supply 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.920
 also takes up little space with curves 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.770
 smooth finishes and a flawless 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.670
 spaece 5 is elegant and beautiful to be 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.920
 displayed 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.630
 available in black color its design 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.840
 reveals what appears to be a 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.740
 of brushed steel being practically immune 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.539
 fingerprints on your carcass 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.610
 one of the differentiated resources of 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.380
 ultrabook from there will be the flip doctor 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.110
 it is a kind of support 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.030
 that allows you to hide and reveal 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.640
 the four connectors available on the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.869
 rear of the hdmi product 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.149
 vanderbilt and 2 o sbt 3.0 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.310
 in addition when opened it allows the 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.410
 better ventilation of the appliance 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.720
 the control can be actuated by means of 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.890
 a dedicated button located in the corner 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.349
 right on an ultrabook to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.480
 proposed is that the use of ssd 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.970
 allows for faster start 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.739
 in our tests on no occasion a 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.830
 it took more than 20 seconds to 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.260
 to enable all of its functions 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.300
 the model has a feature called e 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.550
 its connected instant that recognizes 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.590
 automatically access the networks already 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.200
 in a matter of seconds 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.510
 available 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.580
 the expected battery life for 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.620
 the ultrabook is something around six 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.520
 hours for use in circumstances 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.680
 normal 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.230
 in our tests the device arrived 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.190
 next to it with five hours and 27 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.590
 minutes 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.450
 since for the most intensive with 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.489
 running full hd videos 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.730
 the battery lasted about three hours and 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:59.629
 ten minutes with intel core processor 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.329
 i5 of 1.7 garrett and 4gb ram oeiras 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.099
 appears 5 smoothly performs all 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.740
 conventional functions of most 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.890
 users 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.990
 internet browsing the use of packages 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.970
 commercial applications and access to 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.530
 online games are not harmed in 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.290
 no question 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.100
 however if you are looking for the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.930
 games 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:25.590
 this is certainly not the best 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:27.990
 options may seem like a small detail 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.150
 but we are talking about a device that 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.180
 costs almost four thousand reais and 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.460
 consumer should rather require certain luxuries 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.290
 The absence of bakhit on the keyboard 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.240
 that your keys are not visible in the 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.440
 dark yet as a simple 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.930
 referential 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.330
 another negative point is the size of 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.510
 some keys like the arrows that have a 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.060
 reduced size and can easily 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.670
 confuse the user 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.950
 Okay, this is not exactly a problem anymore. 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.840
 What do you expect from a new computer? 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.880
 certainly comes with the most 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.940
 recent operating system 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.710
 This is not the case with this model 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.230
 windows 7 premium home as version 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.200
 standard with the end of the promotional period 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.940
 the model becomes outdated 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.040
 making the consumer needs 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.850
 spend a little more to update the 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.820
 software 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.890
 the high price of ultrabooks is not a 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.570
 exclusivity of the Brazilian market 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.640
 even abroad 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.880
 many of the appliances are marketed 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:31.110
 for values ​​above one thousand dollars, but the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.750
 average price of the likes 5 between 3403 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.280
 1,900 reais ends up being high for the 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.280
 Brazilian market patterns 

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:44.449
 there is no denying that the former looks like 5 is a 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.489
 Quality product 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.589
 your settings are sufficient for 

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:50.929
 meet the needs of majority use 

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:52.759
 of consumers and certainly this is a 

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:55.039
 product that you can consider between 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.889
 your possible contributions if you are 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.199
 thinking about buying an extremely light 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.029
 the model becomes a nice choice 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.459
 to be taken anywhere 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:06.769
 the battery life does not exceed the 

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:09.800
 between the market tops but not 

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:12.349
 leaves no user on hand but two 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.089
 factors weigh heavily against the product and 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.990
 can set the choice at the time of the 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.839
 purchase 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.490
 the first of them is the price in Brazil 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:21.529
 Another negative point is the fact that 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.599
 device is only available with 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:26.029
 windows 7 making the consumer 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.179
 have to shell out a little more if 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:31.969
 want to upgrade the operating system 

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:34.279
 in summary the ex looks 5 is a great 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.219
 product but does not prove to be an excellent 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:39.349
 purchase option 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:41.389
 but in case you can find it by 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.309
 a more affordable price and has no 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:45.709
 pretensions to migrate from windows 7 to 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:47.929
 windows 8 so early maybe it can 

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:50.389
 meet your needs 

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:53.529
