exotic<00:00:26.110> ear<00:00:26.529> clips<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.689> can<00:00:28.750> make<00:00:29.050> it<00:00:29.200> with<00:00:29.379> a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
exotic ear clips you can make it with a

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.159 
exotic ear clips you can make it with a
loose<00:00:29.710> chain<00:00:30.099> or<00:00:30.790> just<00:00:31.239> wear<00:00:31.540> it<00:00:31.689> like<00:00:31.840> a<00:00:31.899> gear

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
loose chain or just wear it like a gear

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.430 
loose chain or just wear it like a gear
clips<00:00:33.090> I'm<00:00:34.090> okay<00:00:34.390> with<00:00:34.690> both<00:00:34.870> of<00:00:34.899> the<00:00:35.140> style

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
clips I'm okay with both of the style

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.990 
clips I'm okay with both of the style
but<00:00:35.680> I<00:00:35.710> like<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.039> chain<00:00:36.399> one<00:00:36.579> better<00:00:37.379> already

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
but I like the chain one better already

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.770 
but I like the chain one better already
let's<00:00:40.000> get<00:00:40.239> right<00:00:40.450> to<00:00:40.510> it<00:00:40.780> I<00:00:41.879> am<00:00:42.879> using<00:00:43.179> the<00:00:43.449> 20

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
let's get right to it I am using the 20

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.939 
let's get right to it I am using the 20
gauge<00:00:43.989> wire<00:00:45.420> start<00:00:46.420> off<00:00:46.570> by<00:00:46.870> cutting<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.409> 5<00:00:47.710> inch

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
gauge wire start off by cutting a 5 inch

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.279 
gauge wire start off by cutting a 5 inch
wire<00:00:50.489> use<00:00:51.489> a<00:00:51.519> plier<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:51.969> grab<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.809> wire<00:00:53.019> at

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
wire use a plier and grab the wire at

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.360 
wire use a plier and grab the wire at
1.5<00:00:54.129> inch<00:00:54.460> from<00:00:55.179> any<00:00:55.420> ends<00:00:55.960> and<00:00:56.140> make<00:00:56.979> up<00:00:57.159> in

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
1.5 inch from any ends and make up in

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.940 
1.5 inch from any ends and make up in
like<00:00:57.879> so

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.280 

the<00:01:01.640> center<00:01:02.000> wire<00:01:02.270> needs<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.870> be<00:01:03.020> one<00:01:03.350> inch

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
the center wire needs to be one inch

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.960 
the center wire needs to be one inch
once<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:06.470> make<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.680> bend<00:01:07.070> you<00:01:07.550> should<00:01:07.760> notice

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
once you make the bend you should notice

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.820 
once you make the bend you should notice
that<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.480> look<00:01:08.690> kind<00:01:08.900> of<00:01:09.020> like<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.230> zigzag

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
that it look kind of like a zigzag

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.680 
that it look kind of like a zigzag
pattern<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:10.820> should<00:01:11.030> also<00:01:11.180> notice<00:01:11.540> that

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
pattern and you should also notice that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.930 
pattern and you should also notice that
one<00:01:12.080> end<00:01:12.380> of<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.560> wire<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:13.190> shorter<00:01:13.610> than<00:01:13.640> the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
one end of the wire is shorter than the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.140 
one end of the wire is shorter than the
other<00:01:14.680> then<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.710> short<00:01:16.160> end<00:01:16.310> of<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.640> wire<00:01:16.880> at

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
other then the short end of the wire at

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
other then the short end of the wire at
the<00:01:17.210> center<00:01:18.520> now<00:01:19.520> roll<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.450> short<00:01:20.720> end<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:21.110> the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
the center now roll the short end of the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.300 
the center now roll the short end of the
wire<00:01:21.500> into<00:01:22.160> a<00:01:22.190> swirl<00:01:23.650> this<00:01:24.650> technique<00:01:25.100> is

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
wire into a swirl this technique is

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.100 
wire into a swirl this technique is
similar<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.970> one<00:01:26.150> that<00:01:26.180> I<00:01:26.360> use<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.690> make

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
similar to the one that I use to make

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.020 
similar to the one that I use to make
the<00:01:27.290> toe<00:01:27.470> green<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:27.920> if<00:01:28.370> you<00:01:28.490> don't<00:01:28.700> want<00:01:28.880> any

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
the toe green and if you don't want any

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.330 
the toe green and if you don't want any
texture<00:01:29.510> on<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.870> wire<00:01:30.080> be<00:01:30.620> sure<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:31.010> check<00:01:31.040> the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
texture on the wire be sure to check the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.719 
texture on the wire be sure to check the
info<00:01:31.670> box<00:01:31.880> for<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.300> proper<00:01:32.690> tool<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:34.490> don't

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
info box for the proper tool you don't

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.640 
info box for the proper tool you don't
always<00:01:34.880> have<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.270> follow<00:01:35.630> exactly<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.530> way

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
always have to follow exactly the way

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.560 
always have to follow exactly the way
how<00:01:36.830> I<00:01:36.860> do<00:01:37.040> it<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.550> can<00:01:37.700> always<00:01:37.910> use<00:01:38.180> your

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
how I do it you can always use your

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.330 
how I do it you can always use your
imagination<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.560> come<00:01:39.800> up<00:01:39.950> with<00:01:40.130> your<00:01:40.280> own

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
imagination and come up with your own

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.469 
imagination and come up with your own
design<00:01:41.650> for<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.770> longer<00:01:43.130> ends<00:01:43.520> as<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:44.330> can

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
design for the longer ends as you can

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.180 
design for the longer ends as you can
see<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:45.050> bend<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.800> little<00:01:45.830> bit<00:01:46.550> off-center<00:01:47.450> I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
see I bend it a little bit off-center I

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.640 
see I bend it a little bit off-center I
add<00:01:49.190> a<00:01:49.220> small<00:01:49.700> Probie<00:01:50.300> to<00:01:50.810> give<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.290> more

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
add a small Probie to give it a more

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.300 
add a small Probie to give it a more
exotic<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.759> elegant<00:01:53.330> look<00:01:53.770> it's<00:01:54.770> harder<00:01:55.280> to

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
exotic and elegant look it's harder to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.700 
exotic and elegant look it's harder to
work<00:01:55.580> with<00:01:55.640> once<00:01:56.149> you<00:01:56.240> add<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.690> beads<00:01:56.899> so<00:01:57.320> it

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
work with once you add the beads so it

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.950 
work with once you add the beads so it
just<00:01:58.070> had<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.250> take<00:01:58.520> your<00:01:58.700> time<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.300> renew<00:01:59.810> ver

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
just had to take your time and renew ver

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.389 
just had to take your time and renew ver
around<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.530> beads<00:02:02.470> there<00:02:03.470> is<00:02:03.619> no<00:02:03.830> set<00:02:04.130> way<00:02:04.160> to

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
around the beads there is no set way to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.180 
around the beads there is no set way to
bend<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.970> wire<00:02:05.179> so<00:02:05.869> it's<00:02:06.200> just<00:02:06.380> float<00:02:06.770> as<00:02:06.979> you

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
bend the wire so it's just float as you

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.840 
bend the wire so it's just float as you
go<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:08.380> pay<00:02:09.380> special<00:02:09.619> attention<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:10.280> wrap<00:02:10.700> the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
go I pay special attention to wrap the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.930 
go I pay special attention to wrap the
wire<00:02:11.030> closer<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.020> B<00:02:12.430> because<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.700> closer

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
wire closer to the B because the closer

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.270 
wire closer to the B because the closer
towards<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.810> beads<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.319> more<00:02:15.560> professional

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
towards the beads the more professional

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.780 
towards the beads the more professional
and<00:02:16.430> clean<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.180> result<00:02:17.540> would<00:02:17.660> be

making few more advanced but I like the
length<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.790> wire<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.420> go<00:02:31.840> ahead<00:02:31.960> cut

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.240 
you can see here's a little opening hole
at<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.310> bottom<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.560> far<00:02:44.560> your<00:02:44.770> wire<00:02:44.980> should

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
at the bottom so far your wire should

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.950 
at the bottom so far your wire should
look<00:02:45.430> something<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.060> has<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.930> end

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
look something like this has to end

really simple you're basically taking

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.590
