00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.319
 finally motor has launched the 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.830
 update that many users 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.780
 they waited for android 5.1 lollipop if 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.879
 you want to know how it is installed besides 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.650
 a brief reviewed by this rom I invite you 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.650
 to which you stay watching this video 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.430
 Y 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.180
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.920
 welcome to a new video in this 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.380
 I come to show you the revised 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.710
 the official scent for motorola 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.770
 motorcycle model x 2013 that is based on 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.090
 android 5.1 lollipop in the person that 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.010
 I already expected this update a lot 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.690
 but motorola told us for a long time 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.750
 time that was not yet ready and that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.850
 It was not 100% functional but thanks to a 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.890
 user who was enrolled in the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.800
 betas program has already reached the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.750
 final version of the rom he has made a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.390
 backup and thanks to that we will be able to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.370
 install and why do I say backup and not rom 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.930
 because in itself it is not a rom but it is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.839
 a backup that you have to fail 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.240
 through a recovery if you want to know 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.460
 how do you install that you in the description 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.409
 you will be able to find a link which will 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.229
 It will take my blog in which we will 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.150
 to be able to find a detailed tutorial of 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.010
 the instructions that you must follow 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.560
 and the necessary files to be able 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.150
 flashing this backup in advance I tell you 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.159
 that you must have the module has 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.260
 unlocked number 2 you must have 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.110
 root and number 3 you must have a 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.670
 Personally installed recovery I'll 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.860
 I recommend you have 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.990
 Recover project because with this it does not give you 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.210
 no problem with clifford mod 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.180
 yes I had problems and in fact I 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.189
 caused looping so they did not start another 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.290
 very important aspect is that the first 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.080
 start takes around 15 minutes 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.630
 but once it starts it's 100% 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.640
 functional and once started you 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.130
 I recommend you make an equal bone that 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.680
 I take rest since by default to be a 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.110
 backup does not delete anything you do not 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.060
 you had previously but the truth is 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.920
 which is a 100% rom will work 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.330
 have all the news of the year what 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.759
 is materialized in the performance 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.660
 In addition to motorola applications 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.519
 that is an added value for me like that 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.410
 that nothing, I hope you liked it 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.750
 this video the truth is that it is a rom 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.540
 100% functional has not failed me at all 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.100
 if you already want to install android 51 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.110
 Well this is the best way you're going to 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.450
 to be able to do 90 is to flash nadal not 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.310
 You need to erase your device though 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.530
 I already recommend that you do it so that 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.120
 you have a better performance since 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.370
 we are installing an operating system 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.810
 from scratch so if you liked the video 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.700

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.670
