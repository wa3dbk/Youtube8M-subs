00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.270
 hello i dmitry file i am director 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.800
 group of companies neck + today we 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.349
 we are in saint petersburg in one of 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.230
 of our units I want to tell 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.200
 all owners of the brand chevrolet tahoe 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.560
 one more problem of failure 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.509
 air suspension and failure in general 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.680
 according to him the system initially when 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.860
 chevrolet tahoe was released 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.510
 production yes then 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.280
 the designers did not consider our climate 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.170
 our weather conditions and weather 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.539
 it turned out that the compressor on it 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.879
 swapping rear shock absorbers set 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.860
 here under the rear left wheel of the car and 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.660
 here through this filter and to this air 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.870
 gets into the rear booster compressor 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.430
 shock absorbers respectively all moisture and 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.800
 all the water that is right here is she 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.609
 gets inside the compressor 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.989
 according to the reception system 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:03.789
 falls into the back of the balloon that we 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.060
 We recommend doing here respectively 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.970
 this hose we bring the car interior 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.860
 so that the air that gets into 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.100
 rear shock absorber compressor 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.740
 walked clean and dry there and recommend 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.140
 do to all car brand owners 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.570
 chevrolet tahoe 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.509
 if you buy a new car then this 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.420
 this procedure must be done immediately 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.520
 It is quite inexpensive 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.990
 Well, absolutely not comparable with the price 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.120
 rear shock absorbers and rear 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.890
 booster compressors 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.170
 if we consider that upon failure 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.720
 pneumocylinder and fails 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.880
 compressor and vice versa, respectively when 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.440
 compressor failure right there 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.220
 rear air stops working 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.160
 shock absorbers 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.990
 because the system lacks pressure 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.510
 It leads to the fact that the shock absorber on the other have 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.970
 it just breaks here this gum on 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.140
 just breaks accordingly we 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.210
 We recommend doing this immediately. 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.610
 even when the car is new even when 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.300
 car only only take 1 factory 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.940
 be sure to immediately bring this one here 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.810
 hose must be brought to the salon 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.840
 it's not hard enough 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.100
 luggage compartment of the car 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.170
 disassembled removed rear trim 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.240
 air intake itself is output to the salon 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.600
 accordingly so that the air into the system 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.830
 got it clean dry and not wet it 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.300
 allows to increase service life 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.500
 operation of the compressor and practically 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.630
 rear shock absorbers out of order no longer 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.230
 comes out of course if you follow them 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.230
 service
