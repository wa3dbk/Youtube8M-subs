outstanding<00:00:45.920> feature<00:00:46.130> is<00:00:46.489> that<00:00:46.700> unlike<00:00:47.450> all

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
outstanding feature is that unlike all

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.350 
outstanding feature is that unlike all
the<00:00:47.780> other<00:00:47.930> TV<00:00:48.770> antennas<00:00:49.250> it<00:00:49.489> can<00:00:49.670> be<00:00:49.820> standing

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
the other TV antennas it can be standing

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.810 
the other TV antennas it can be standing
hanging<00:00:50.809> or<00:00:50.960> lying<00:00:51.290> flat<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.129> that's<00:00:52.730> very

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
hanging or lying flat so that's very

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.500 
hanging or lying flat so that's very
special<00:00:53.860> we've<00:00:54.860> seen<00:00:55.100> other<00:00:55.309> TV<00:00:56.059> antennas

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
special we've seen other TV antennas

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.979 
special we've seen other TV antennas
nowadays<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:57.260> usually<00:00:57.620> are<00:00:57.860> on<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:59.000> table<00:00:59.629> top

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
nowadays I usually are on the table top

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.470 
nowadays I usually are on the table top
and<00:01:00.199> this<00:01:00.739> one<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.340> can<00:01:01.520> actually<00:01:01.760> lay<00:01:02.210> flat

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
and this one you can actually lay flat

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.120 
and this one you can actually lay flat
or<00:01:02.949> hang<00:01:03.949> hang<00:01:04.520> on<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.699> wall<00:01:04.879> so<00:01:05.360> let's<00:01:06.200> take<00:01:07.100> a

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
or hang hang on the wall so let's take a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.310 
or hang hang on the wall so let's take a
look<00:01:07.399> at<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:07.729> on<00:01:08.660> the<00:01:08.810> side<00:01:09.020> it<00:01:09.289> just

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
look at this on the side it just

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.389 
look at this on the side it just
basically<00:01:09.800> shows<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.280> it's

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
basically shows you it's

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.070 
basically shows you it's
multi-directional<00:01:10.820> amplified<00:01:11.539> a<00:01:11.570> digital

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
fly antenna doesn't go in much detail

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.460 
fly antenna doesn't go in much detail
now<00:01:15.770> looking<00:01:16.159> at<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.400> box<00:01:16.659> we<00:01:17.659> see<00:01:17.689> a<00:01:17.869> few<00:01:18.200> key

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
now looking at the box we see a few key

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.370 
now looking at the box we see a few key
things<00:01:18.970> they<00:01:19.970> talk<00:01:20.420> about<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:21.380> coax<00:01:21.799> cable<00:01:22.010> in

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
things they talk about the coax cable in

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.749 
things they talk about the coax cable in
which<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.560> have<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:24.860> have<00:01:25.009> that<00:01:25.369> go<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.580> your

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.090 
hang it lay flat or stand up meaning
unlike<00:01:35.420> other<00:01:35.600> antennas<00:01:36.080> where<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.560> have<00:01:36.830> to

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
unlike other antennas where you have to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.450 
unlike other antennas where you have to
turn<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.700> antenna<00:01:38.030> or<00:01:38.509> adjust<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.439> knob<00:01:39.650> or

the rabbit ears this one you're not

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.130 
the rabbit ears this one you're not
supposed<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:42.259> need<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.500> do<00:01:42.619> anything<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:44.140> in

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
supposed to need to do anything and in

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.260 
supposed to need to do anything and in
addition<00:01:45.500> what<00:01:46.220> makes<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:46.790> thing<00:01:47.030> really

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
addition what makes this thing really

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.690 
addition what makes this thing really
powerful<00:01:47.869> is<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:47.990> it<00:01:48.259> says<00:01:48.439> it<00:01:48.590> has<00:01:48.710> 360

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
powerful is that it says it has 360

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.370 
powerful is that it says it has 360
degree<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.560> reception<00:01:51.560> means<00:01:52.189> no<00:01:52.460> miss<00:01:52.729> signal

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
degree of reception means no miss signal

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.660 
degree of reception means no miss signal
this<00:01:54.380> is<00:01:54.439> sold<00:01:54.829> as<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.009> multi<00:01:55.549> directional

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
this is sold as a multi directional

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.109 
this is sold as a multi directional
antenna<00:01:56.479> but<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:58.460> would<00:01:58.610> mean<00:01:58.850> it's

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
antenna but that would mean it's

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.069 
antenna but that would mean it's
omnidirectional<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:02.299> amplifier<00:02:02.780> it

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
omnidirectional and the amplifier it

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.229 
omnidirectional and the amplifier it
mentions<00:02:04.420> amplifies<00:02:05.420> weak<00:02:05.719> signals<00:02:07.090> which<00:02:08.090> is

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
mentions amplifies weak signals which is

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.950 
mentions amplifies weak signals which is
great<00:02:08.479> so

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
great so

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.600 
great so
and<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.350> guess<00:02:10.680> one<00:02:11.070> of<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.220> key<00:02:11.370> selling

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
and I guess one of the key selling

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.020 
and I guess one of the key selling
points<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.150> really<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.260> again<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.970> it

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
points is really you can again have it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.050 
points is really you can again have it
lying<00:02:15.360> flat<00:02:15.630> on<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.550> on<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.700> table<00:02:17.820> right

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
lying flat on the on the table right

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.610 
lying flat on the on the table right
next<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.420> TV<00:02:18.600> on<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> wall<00:02:19.950> or<00:02:21.050> stand<00:02:22.050> stand

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
next to the TV on a wall or stand stand

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.480 
next to the TV on a wall or stand stand
so<00:02:23.660> we'll<00:02:24.660> take<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.840> look<00:02:25.020> at<00:02:25.140> how<00:02:25.260> they<00:02:25.410> do<00:02:25.470> that

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
so we'll take a look at how they do that

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.130 
so we'll take a look at how they do that
they<00:02:26.850> also<00:02:27.000> mention<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.690> can<00:02:27.870> actually

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
they also mention that you can actually

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.810 
they also mention that you can actually
even<00:02:28.560> paint<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.840> getting<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.990> little<00:02:31.820> nice

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
even paint it so getting a little nice

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.230 
even paint it so getting a little nice
in<00:02:33.120> terms<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.660> aesthetics<00:02:34.530> here<00:02:34.770> so<00:02:35.400> let's

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
in terms of aesthetics here so let's

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
in terms of aesthetics here so let's
open<00:02:36.330> up<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.780> see<00:02:36.870> what's<00:02:37.050> included<00:02:51.260> alright

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
open up and see what's included alright

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.970 
open up and see what's included alright
so<00:02:52.760> here's<00:02:53.760> what<00:02:54.060> we've<00:02:54.240> got<00:02:54.410> we<00:02:55.410> open<00:02:55.710> it<00:02:55.830> we

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
so here's what we've got we open it we

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:04.880 
so here's what we've got we open it we
see<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:58.340> manual<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.700> here's<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.890> actual

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
see a manual and here's the actual

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.120 
see a manual and here's the actual
antenna<00:03:05.340> very<00:03:05.670> lightweight<00:03:06.770> roughly<00:03:07.770> square

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
antenna very lightweight roughly square

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.100 
antenna very lightweight roughly square
shaped<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:10.050> back<00:03:10.260> has<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:11.750> mounting<00:03:12.750> holes<00:03:12.960> for

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
shaped the back has a mounting holes for

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.340 
shaped the back has a mounting holes for
the<00:03:13.260> wall<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:14.940> guess<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:15.600> mountable

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
the wall so I guess it's mountable

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.600 
the wall so I guess it's mountable
either<00:03:16.560> way<00:03:16.800> or<00:03:17.310> even<00:03:18.830> horizontally<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.760> um

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
either way or even horizontally so um

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.340 
either way or even horizontally so um
has<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:24.000> RCA<00:03:24.450> logo<00:03:25.050> on<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.380> very<00:03:26.280> thin<00:03:27.350> very

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
has the RCA logo on it very thin very

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.550 
has the RCA logo on it very thin very
lightweight<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.660> has<00:03:30.660> your<00:03:30.780> coax<00:03:31.140> cable

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
lightweight and has your coax cable

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.130 
lightweight and has your coax cable
connector<00:03:32.550> here<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.090> guess<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:33.750> you're<00:03:33.930> not

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
connector here so I guess if you're not

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.230 
connector here so I guess if you're not
looking<00:03:34.470> for<00:03:34.500> amplification<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:36.060> thing

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
looking for amplification this thing

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.780 
looking for amplification this thing

use to connect to the back of the
antenna<00:04:24.510> see<00:04:25.510> these<00:04:26.380> two<00:04:26.650> holes<00:04:27.690> so<00:04:29.790> we'll<00:04:30.790> be

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
antenna see these two holes so we'll be

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.310 
antenna see these two holes so we'll be
setting<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.360> thing<00:04:31.420> up<00:04:31.720> so<00:04:32.020> in<00:04:34.080> part<00:04:35.080> two

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
setting this thing up so in part two

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.030 
setting this thing up so in part two
we'll<00:04:35.620> go<00:04:35.860> over<00:04:35.980> in<00:04:36.310> detail<00:04:36.720> some<00:04:38.040> tv-channel

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
we'll go over in detail some tv-channel

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.870 
we'll go over in detail some tv-channel
scanning<00:04:39.490> oh<00:04:39.840> useful<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.990> see<00:04:41.140> how<00:04:41.290> well<00:04:41.500> this

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
scanning oh useful to see how well this

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.070 
scanning oh useful to see how well this
antenna<00:04:42.880> performs<00:04:43.360> compared<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.900> other

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
antenna performs compared to other

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.940 
antenna performs compared to other
antennas<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.710> we've<00:04:45.180> tested<00:04:46.560> before<00:04:47.560> so

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
antennas that we've tested before so

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.500 
antennas that we've tested before so
let's<00:04:48.880> let<00:04:49.150> slip<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:50.070> antenna<00:04:51.330> stand<00:04:52.330> in

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
let's let slip the antenna stand in

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.300 
let's let slip the antenna stand in
place<00:04:53.010> goes<00:04:54.010> in<00:04:55.830> doesn't<00:04:56.830> click<00:04:57.010> or<00:04:57.130> anything

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
place goes in doesn't click or anything

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.650 
place goes in doesn't click or anything
so<00:04:57.760> I<00:04:58.060> guess<00:04:58.630> yes<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.740> stops<00:04:59.980> moving<00:05:00.660> that's

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
so I guess yes it stops moving that's

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
so I guess yes it stops moving that's
where<00:05:02.380> it<00:05:02.700> it's<00:05:03.700> firmly<00:05:04.000> seated

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.060 

alright<00:05:08.680> so<00:05:09.130> let's<00:05:09.910> connect<00:05:10.240> this<00:05:10.330> thing<00:05:10.390> up

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
alright so let's connect this thing up

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.140 
alright so let's connect this thing up
connect<00:05:12.070> it<00:05:12.160> with<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.400> amplifier<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.820> try<00:05:13.090> to

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
connect it with the amplifier to try to

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.500 
connect it with the amplifier to try to
get<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.450> most<00:05:13.570> channels<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:18.610> here<00:05:18.850> we<00:05:19.030> go

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
get the most channels and here we go

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.130 
get the most channels and here we go
so<00:05:20.070> amplifier<00:05:21.210> these<00:05:22.210> are<00:05:22.360> all<00:05:22.510> branded<00:05:23.310> RCA

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
so amplifier these are all branded RCA

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.670 
so amplifier these are all branded RCA
really<00:05:27.810> looks<00:05:28.810> nice<00:05:29.050> there's<00:05:29.350> a<00:05:29.410> little

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
really looks nice there's a little

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.750 
really looks nice there's a little
cautioned<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:31.690> warn<00:05:32.500> people<00:05:32.560> against<00:05:33.310> opening

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
cautioned to warn people against opening

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.060 
cautioned to warn people against opening
the<00:05:34.500> antenna<00:05:35.729> amplifier<00:05:36.960> so<00:05:37.960> this<00:05:38.710> is<00:05:38.860> how<00:05:38.979> you

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
the antenna amplifier so this is how you

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.270 
the antenna amplifier so this is how you
would<00:05:40.800> connect<00:05:41.800> this<00:05:43.260> amplifier<00:05:44.260> goes<00:05:44.650> into

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
would connect this amplifier goes into

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.090 
would connect this amplifier goes into
the<00:05:45.580> signal<00:05:49.080> you'll<00:05:50.080> receive<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.740> signal

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
the signal you'll receive the signal

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.070 
the signal you'll receive the signal
from<00:05:51.400> the<00:05:52.330> antenna<00:05:53.400> and<00:05:54.400> the<00:05:55.000> amplifier<00:05:55.390> sends

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
from the antenna and the amplifier sends

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.200 
from the antenna and the amplifier sends
it<00:05:56.200> to<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.360> TV<00:05:59.610> so<00:06:00.610> let's<00:06:00.880> take<00:06:01.120> this

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
it to the TV so let's take this

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:11.110 
it to the TV so let's take this
and<00:06:02.630> connect<00:06:03.050> it<00:06:03.169> up<00:06:07.660> is<00:06:09.430> in<00:06:10.430> Italy<00:06:10.669> it's

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
and connect it up is in Italy it's

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.350 
and connect it up is in Italy it's
labeled<00:06:11.600> here<00:06:11.979> antenna<00:06:12.979> so<00:06:13.940> it<00:06:14.030> dip<00:06:14.210> to

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
labeled here antenna so it dip to

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:24.460 
labeled here antenna so it dip to
antenna<00:06:14.780> input<00:06:21.340> so<00:06:22.340> then<00:06:22.930> we<00:06:23.930> connect<00:06:24.229> this<00:06:24.320> to

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
antenna input so then we connect this to

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:32.260 
antenna input so then we connect this to
the<00:06:24.590> back<00:06:24.740> of<00:06:24.889> TV<00:06:27.310> and<00:06:28.690> plug<00:06:29.690> this<00:06:29.840> in<00:06:30.050> so<00:06:31.270> let's

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
the back of TV and plug this in so let's

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.890 
the back of TV and plug this in so let's
take<00:06:32.419> a<00:06:32.449> look<00:06:32.600> at<00:06:32.720> part<00:06:32.930> 2<00:06:33.400> where<00:06:34.400> we<00:06:34.430> will

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
take a look at part 2 where we will

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.810 
take a look at part 2 where we will
double<00:06:35.900> this<00:06:36.130> do<00:06:37.130> some<00:06:37.340> channel<00:06:37.669> scans<00:06:39.820> and

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
double this do some channel scans and

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.020 
double this do some channel scans and
see<00:06:41.120> how<00:06:41.270> good<00:06:41.449> the<00:06:41.599> reception<00:06:42.110> is<00:06:42.289> a<00:06:42.940> lot<00:06:43.940> of

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
see how good the reception is a lot of

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.850 
see how good the reception is a lot of
the<00:06:44.150> channels<00:06:44.509> that<00:06:44.660> we're<00:06:44.810> located<00:06:45.289> in<00:06:45.440> are

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
the channels that we're located in are

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.180 
the channels that we're located in are
though<00:06:46.759> that<00:06:47.210> we<00:06:47.330> receive<00:06:47.720> are<00:06:48.050> up<00:06:48.770> in<00:06:48.949> San

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
though that we receive are up in San

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.400 
though that we receive are up in San
Francisco<00:06:49.599> so<00:06:50.599> this<00:06:50.780> would<00:06:50.960> be<00:06:52.120> possibly<00:06:53.410> 50

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
Francisco so this would be possibly 50

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.249 
Francisco so this would be possibly 50
to<00:06:54.560> 60<00:06:54.949> miles<00:06:55.160> away
