 Americanization extremely annoys me 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.100
 extremely we have our own culture 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.539

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.360
 put on sort of like considering the mass 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.580
 information before that come to us from 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.680
 different sources somehow lie negative 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.990
 some very small but there is why 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.900
 need to invade in general 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.460
 the sovereignty of other states this one 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.540
 the moment is probably for me so very 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.920
 important america great country all great 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.860

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.600

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.149
 I really like Germany more 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:01.659
 than america that is the approach itself 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.390
 life is much better 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.090
 constructively than in america america 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.769
 seen on the side I was there once 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.739

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.959
