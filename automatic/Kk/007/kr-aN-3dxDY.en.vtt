00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.030
 Hello dear friends, I am Max Norman 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.680
 today we will discuss such a machine as 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.780
 comet then we have the middle tank of the seventh 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.940
 the level of the British development branch 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.890
 Immediately I will say for myself 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.470
 rendered four British cars in general 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.030
 branches heavy among medium tanks only 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.920
 four cars that seems to me 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.600
 probably the best of these branches and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.940
 most worthy to be in 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.000
 hangar I'll take to this tank roofs 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.010
 comets and level 10 9 heavy tanks 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.769
 British branch development of heavy tanks 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.809
 This here they are on ti4 machines that can 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.600
 bring pleasure to the rest of the tanks 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.700
 seems to me not so interesting 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.860
 what if you're going to download something 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.380
 better start with medium tanks i think 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.360
 that cars are very decent about what am I 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.860
 I want to tell specifically the comet's tank 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.930
 first we have a very good weapon 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.979
 very dpn and with a good break and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.140
 good dynamics 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.660
 what is the dynamics of guns guys really 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.729
 I actually came up with this let's say designation 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.200
 not so long ago, I take Kadievich to us 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.840
 tool that quickly come down 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.700
 let's quickly bring in your dpm in 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.410
 enemy tank and capable of quickly 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.750
 it comes down to me seems pretty 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.000
 good designation of the dynamism of the instrument 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.920
 so here comets with just such an instrument 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.679
 we also have a good one 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.050
 dynamics also times there are quite good towers and 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:49.649
 In general, I would have taken this car to 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.630
 machines such absolute balance 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.310
 tank that is it is very good 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.560
 balanced machine that is on 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.660
 seventh level does not have any 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.700
 imbalance and it does not have something 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.310
 bad or something good straight 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.580
 super super that is, we have a decent 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.160
 let's say good dynamics good armor 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.080
 about the turret nice guns 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.959
 A good review is such a car 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.849
 Fifty Fifty if you can talk how to 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.810
 minus is probably the biggest minus is 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.340
 something that doesn't always work out 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.200
 minus just because if you get to 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.090
 bad team player only then you 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.129
 don't feel like gebo honor 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.870
 British comedian and in all the rest 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.940
 cases it seems to me the machine is just 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.709
 wonderful 2000 experience I am stable 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.319
 I take out on this tank does not seem it 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.330
 very nice so here and tanchiki and we 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.340
 talked now I want a little bit 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.060
 discuss this fight hit the map 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.739
 south 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.709
 Rick got a not very competent team 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.050
 initially the chance of winning was 46 i didn't 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.400
 always true to his so yes and you 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.260
 never believe it because 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.180
 so much and change may so much 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.069
 strongly dependent on the mood of the players 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.140
 that excel seems to me lately 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.980
 it is generally useless especially percentage on 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.890
 victory so here is the ledge 169 due to 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.050
 decide theta foursome soak here too 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.940
 Here in such situations , you can see 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.810
 British comedian pluses 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.720
 This is the perfect mix of Britt for example 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.209
 American Pershing and German 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.489
 antennas why i say it is a mixture 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.170
 the names of these machines we have are excellent 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.750
 a tool that leans down very 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.720
 good at 12 degrees we have a very 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.549
 good let's say towers which is fast 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.860
 spinning and which has scolded higher on 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.739
 how pier and we have a good dpm 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.900
 like a panther and let's say such a pretty 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.489
 average silhouette in size regarding 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.280
 masking guys won't say anything i don't 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.080
 I know the coefficient here I did not look there 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.840
 no on any sites I can not say 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.910
 what say the machine is pretty or 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.060
 can badly disguise in the usual 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.930
 Kuzey I stand and in principle, plus or minus 200 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.109
 meters no one sees mean from you 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.200
 decided to pave us a bad racher 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.600
 they are not really so fashionable but oh well 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.269
 that means all of our config tanks have accumulated 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.960
 in squares e3 nf3 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.180
 g3 sutured 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.340
 not yet where needed i decide that now 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.130
 will need to go back to d in bases 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.800
 because I see there 110 see there 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.410
 Isa and I see that there is generally not everything 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.720
 too well and dry well, our spreads have 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.210
 him good statistics let's say there is 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.370
 there is the ability to play and in general 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.790
 it motivated me to 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.800
 so far not to rush on there need their bases 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.510
 and her husband is still standing up a little and 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.910
 shoot at the enemy necha do 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.460
 so that would seem part 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.800
 have a bran yes guys called a has 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.440
 good spend it 100 44 millimeter i 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.300
 I'll take it to those tanks that are still 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.310
 have not so much but understand 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.990
 often make your way through we know what 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.180
 breakthrough also greatly affected 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.820
 data rate and accuracy 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.730
 that is why many are looking at 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.500
 waffentrager up to level 10 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.230
 who put on with a cardboard tower and 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.840
 many say god and she punches everybody 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.730
 thomas 7 to any angles yes because 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.330
 guys he has good information good 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.700
 accuracy 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.670
 allowing you to quickly salute the enemy 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.100
 tank that is in fact probably now 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.870
 not those packs that were before now 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.780
 right all the players who 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.940
 above there are 5 thousand fights everyone knows where 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.410
 who punch and nobody shoot 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.360
 offhand this is not the same 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.700
 that was earlier now 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.700
 have learned everything are looking guides are all looking 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.860
 video on breaking through there various headings 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.400
 everyone really understands where to punch 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.230
 same isa 7 where to punch it t29 what in 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.040
 the tower does not need to collect it too 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:42.520
 and in principle it makes our game 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.310
 at least some more precisely does not make of our 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.280
 the game is exactly what I am always who 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.560
 It remains always appreciated in the games are the names 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.020
 weight stilago nasty that is if you 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.990
 know how to play bends and in our game to 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.350
 Unfortunately, very many things all the same 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.350
 It does not affect the skill but how we know the tank 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.340
 breakthrough that is, Moscow understand that at 8 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.940
 level there and 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.220
 and there are t-44 and maybe 44 on the chest and pol 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.940
 whatever whatever there may have been a skill well 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.280
 at least 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:17.920
 think so we have tampers 685 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.350
 but when the first find 75 there that on 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.130
 level below but still falls into the same 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.770
 battle levels 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.420
 life is really a lot 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.030
 really decides there is no skill and 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.520
 it still upsets me but if 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.410
 you will want to lead at least a little bit 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.750
 If you try, I think that 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.010
 on the comet you get a game with something on 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.320
 any other machines 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.900
 so here enemy t20 cornered 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:45.760
 as a pig now he's bursting and in 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:47.380
 overall will end his red hp and petipa 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.910
 I'm still very good at commerce I 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.980
 good shot no very much 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.990
 pleased with this fight of course our 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.280
 ended now there come out later 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.410
 will take away artillery on this we 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.720
 finish and go to the results 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.210
 combat by results but in principle 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.700
 nothing special 2346 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.390
 experience playing sign you on steam master 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:09.310
 and almost 4,000 damage 1 guys sex can I 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.500
 on your team, notice that you played 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.050
 seventh level not at eight in battle with 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.940
 I promptly inserted eights most is 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.190
 pretty good I hope the result 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.900
 you liked in general how it if 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.880
 this is so subscribe to my channel i 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.460
 still a lot of interesting 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.169
 video content and good graphics can 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.010
 See it all enjoy in 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:29.410
 free time 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.240
 video comes out very often so if 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.760
 will probably never sign 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.590
 suffer from boredom 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.390
 until six until everyone will look like 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.650
 pledge put huskies guys 

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.760
 subscribe everyone bye 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.760
 lived well in the forest
