a 300 attack and just overall by the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
stats once they're upgraded you can see

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.590 
stats once they're upgraded you can see
they<00:00:53.289> look<00:00:53.530> very<00:00:53.559> very<00:00:54.190> promising<00:00:54.640> rate<00:00:55.449> of

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
they look very very promising rate of

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.200 
they look very very promising rate of
fire<00:00:55.839> is<00:00:56.079> very<00:00:56.230> good<00:00:56.769> for<00:00:57.100> any<00:00:57.399> hand<00:00:57.760> cannon<00:00:58.120> I

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
fire is very good for any hand cannon I

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.750 
fire is very good for any hand cannon I
believe<00:00:58.480> it's<00:00:58.659> one<00:00:58.839> of<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.019> best<00:00:59.260> impact<00:01:00.249> very

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
believe it's one of the best impact very

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.649 
believe it's one of the best impact very
high<00:01:01.030> range

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
high range

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.630 
high range
unfortunately<00:01:02.620> low<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.190> you<00:01:03.249> can't<00:01:03.489> do

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
unfortunately low and you can't do

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.700 
unfortunately low and you can't do
anything<00:01:03.850> about<00:01:04.059> that<00:01:04.470> stabilities<00:01:05.470> high

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
anything about that stabilities high

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.399 
anything about that stabilities high
reload<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.640> high<00:01:06.790> but<00:01:07.090> unfortunately<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.140> mag

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
reload is high but unfortunately the mag

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.249 
reload is high but unfortunately the mag
size<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.920> lower<00:01:09.520> than<00:01:09.790> average<00:01:09.939> fan<00:01:10.780> fire<00:01:11.049> you

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
size is lower than average fan fire you

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.889 
size is lower than average fan fire you
can<00:01:11.409> fire<00:01:11.590> this<00:01:11.740> weapon<00:01:11.920> in<00:01:12.159> continuous

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
can fire this weapon in continuous

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.050 
can fire this weapon in continuous
continuously<00:01:13.899> sorry<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:15.340> it's<00:01:15.490> automatic

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
continuously sorry and it's automatic

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.190 
continuously sorry and it's automatic
and<00:01:16.240> then<00:01:16.299> we<00:01:16.450> have<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.659> smart<00:01:16.990> drift

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
and then we have the smart drift

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.709 
and then we have the smart drift
controls<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.920> ballistics<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.790> feel<00:01:19.360> like<00:01:19.509> the

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
controls the ballistics I feel like the

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.260 
controls the ballistics I feel like the
second<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.590> third<00:01:20.649> don't<00:01:21.130> do<00:01:21.460> as<00:01:21.700> much<00:01:22.240> as

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
second and the third don't do as much as

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.090 
second and the third don't do as much as
the<00:01:22.630> first<00:01:22.899> the<00:01:23.200> first<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.590> definitely<00:01:24.009> the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
the first the first is definitely the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.310 
the first the first is definitely the
most<00:01:24.250> balanced<00:01:24.969> for<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.390> least<00:01:25.960> amount<00:01:26.170> of

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
most balanced for the least amount of

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.959 
most balanced for the least amount of
recoil<00:01:26.469> then<00:01:26.860> we<00:01:26.950> have<00:01:27.040> hipfire<00:01:27.399> this<00:01:27.610> weapon

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
recoil then we have hipfire this weapon

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.630 
recoil then we have hipfire this weapon
has<00:01:28.090> bonus<00:01:28.630> accuracy<00:01:29.200> while<00:01:29.530> frying<00:01:29.890> from<00:01:30.399> the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
has bonus accuracy while frying from the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.060 
has bonus accuracy while frying from the
hip<00:01:30.909> you<00:01:31.390> definitely<00:01:32.049> notice<00:01:32.289> it<00:01:32.680> when<00:01:32.890> you're

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
hip you definitely notice it when you're

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.270 
hip you definitely notice it when you're
actually<00:01:33.310> shooting<00:01:34.240> with<00:01:34.869> hipfire<00:01:35.500> so<00:01:35.950> if

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
actually shooting with hipfire so if

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.920 
actually shooting with hipfire so if
you're<00:01:36.490> just<00:01:36.520> wondering<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.180> do<00:01:37.450> notice<00:01:37.780> that

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
you're just wondering you do notice that

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.620 
you're just wondering you do notice that
a<00:01:38.079> law<00:01:38.289> single<00:01:39.009> point<00:01:39.189> sling<00:01:39.490> move<00:01:40.240> faster

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
a law single point sling move faster

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.880 
a law single point sling move faster
with<00:01:40.750> this<00:01:40.869> weapon<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.289> switch<00:01:41.439> weapons

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
with this weapon and switch weapons

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.429 
with this weapon and switch weapons
faster<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.579> tried<00:01:43.210> this<00:01:43.420> out<00:01:43.630> but<00:01:43.899> it<00:01:44.020> actually

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
faster I tried this out but it actually

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.889 
faster I tried this out but it actually
wasn't<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:45.009> great<00:01:45.399> you<00:01:45.640> hardly<00:01:46.149> notice<00:01:46.479> your

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
wasn't that great you hardly notice your

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.080 
wasn't that great you hardly notice your
guy<00:01:47.020> actually<00:01:47.259> strafing<00:01:48.100> left<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.640> right<00:01:48.820> at

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
guy actually strafing left and right at

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.660 
guy actually strafing left and right at
all<00:01:49.810> it<00:01:50.079> seems<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.740> same<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.189> me<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.549> then

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
all it seems the same to me and then

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.609 
all it seems the same to me and then
high-caliber<00:01:52.240> rounds<00:01:52.420> and<00:01:52.930> then<00:01:53.350> we<00:01:53.469> have

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
high-caliber rounds and then we have

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.560 
high-caliber rounds and then we have

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
that stability it's almost double the

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.779 
that stability it's almost double the
stability<00:01:56.079> bar<00:01:56.229> which<00:01:56.439> is<00:01:56.619> great<00:01:57.130> as<00:01:57.369> little

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
stability bar which is great as little

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.099 
stability bar which is great as little

definitely<00:03:00.290> one<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.680> most<00:03:00.859> fun<00:03:01.370> weapons

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
definitely one of the most fun weapons

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.770 
definitely one of the most fun weapons
to<00:03:02.150> use<00:03:02.359> in<00:03:02.569> PvP<00:03:03.019> five-four<00:03:03.769> but<00:03:04.609> I<00:03:05.150> don't<00:03:05.659> know

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
to use in PvP five-four but I don't know

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.140 
to use in PvP five-four but I don't know
I<00:03:06.079> feel<00:03:06.530> like<00:03:06.590> it's<00:03:06.889> just<00:03:07.129> good<00:03:07.489> in<00:03:07.730> certain

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
I feel like it's just good in certain

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.140 
I feel like it's just good in certain
situations<00:03:09.340> personally<00:03:10.340> if<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.609> compare<00:03:10.970> this

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
situations personally if I compare this

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.300 
situations personally if I compare this
to<00:03:11.359> the<00:03:11.480> hawkmoon<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.139> do<00:03:12.200> think<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.829> hawkmoon

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
to the hawkmoon I do think the hawkmoon

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.830 
to the hawkmoon I do think the hawkmoon
is<00:03:13.430> better<00:03:13.670> for<00:03:13.939> a<00:03:13.970> number<00:03:14.239> of<00:03:14.329> reasons<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:14.720> I

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
is better for a number of reasons but I

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.839 
is better for a number of reasons but I
won't<00:03:15.079> go<00:03:15.230> into<00:03:15.349> detail<00:03:15.799> about<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.639> will

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
won't go into detail about that I will

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.270 
won't go into detail about that I will
do<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.329> comparison<00:03:18.019> video<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.620> both<00:03:18.889> of<00:03:19.099> them

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
do a comparison video of both of them

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.229 
do a comparison video of both of them
very<00:03:19.639> very<00:03:20.389> soon<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.489> but<00:03:22.489> yeah<00:03:22.699> for<00:03:23.090> me<00:03:23.209> I

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
very very soon and but yeah for me I

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.539 
very very soon and but yeah for me I
just<00:03:23.510> feel<00:03:23.660> like<00:03:23.840> it's<00:03:24.049> good<00:03:24.319> for<00:03:24.620> close<00:03:24.829> range

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
just feel like it's good for close range

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.939 
just feel like it's good for close range
long<00:03:25.970> range<00:03:26.239> it's<00:03:26.569> a<00:03:26.690> little<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.620> know<00:03:27.769> it

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
long range it's a little you know it

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.430 
long range it's a little you know it
lacks<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.519> little<00:03:28.549> bit<00:03:28.940> of<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.329> that<00:03:30.109> range

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
lacks a little bit of that that range

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.500 
lacks a little bit of that that range
it's<00:03:30.980> kind<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:31.220> obvious<00:03:31.459> by<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.819> stat<00:03:32.239> it's

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
it's kind of obvious by the stat it's

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.750 
it's kind of obvious by the stat it's
really<00:03:33.199> really<00:03:33.500> low<00:03:33.680> which<00:03:33.889> is<00:03:33.919> unfortunate

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
really really low which is unfortunate

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.899 
really really low which is unfortunate
and<00:03:34.879> the<00:03:35.329> mag<00:03:35.659> size<00:03:36.079> too<00:03:36.409> really<00:03:37.220> disappointed

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
and the mag size too really disappointed

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.119 
and the mag size too really disappointed
the<00:03:38.000> mag<00:03:38.239> size<00:03:38.480> is<00:03:38.659> 8<00:03:38.840> but<00:03:39.139> I<00:03:39.169> guess<00:03:39.409> it<00:03:39.769> kind<00:03:40.069> of

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
the mag size is 8 but I guess it kind of

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.280 
the mag size is 8 but I guess it kind of
does<00:03:40.340> make<00:03:40.579> up<00:03:40.760> for<00:03:40.940> that<00:03:40.970> because<00:03:41.599> it

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
does make up for that because it

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.009 
does make up for that because it
actually<00:03:42.319> has<00:03:42.829> a<00:03:42.859> pretty<00:03:43.280> quick<00:03:43.699> reload<00:03:44.359> time

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
actually has a pretty quick reload time

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.309 
actually has a pretty quick reload time
which<00:03:45.290> is<00:03:45.470> great<00:03:45.799> but<00:03:46.459> again<00:03:46.659> the<00:03:47.659> mag<00:03:47.930> size

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
which is great but again the mag size

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.439 
which is great but again the mag size
and<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.919> real<00:03:49.190> nothing<00:03:49.760> reload<00:03:50.150> sorry<00:03:50.359> the

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:50.449 
and the real nothing reload sorry the

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.990 
and the real nothing reload sorry the
rate<00:03:50.659> of<00:03:50.780> fire<00:03:51.019> just<00:03:51.409> make<00:03:51.680> this<00:03:51.889> weapon<00:03:52.190> feel

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
rate of fire just make this weapon feel

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.909 
rate of fire just make this weapon feel
like<00:03:53.209> it's<00:03:53.389> wasting<00:03:53.840> ammo<00:03:54.139> so<00:03:54.409> quickly<00:03:54.829> and

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
like it's wasting ammo so quickly and

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.619 
like it's wasting ammo so quickly and
that's<00:03:54.979> exactly<00:03:55.579> why<00:03:55.699> I<00:03:55.760> don't<00:03:56.120> use<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:56.419> in

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
that's exactly why I don't use this in

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.409 
that's exactly why I don't use this in
PvE<00:03:56.989> it's<00:03:57.739> because<00:03:58.159> you're<00:03:58.879> constantly

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
PvE it's because you're constantly

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.180 
PvE it's because you're constantly
shooting<00:03:59.989> you<00:04:00.079> don't<00:04:00.290> want<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.500> be<00:04:00.590> reloading

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
shooting you don't want to be reloading

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.589 
shooting you don't want to be reloading
and<00:04:01.370> pretty<00:04:01.849> much<00:04:01.970> you're<00:04:02.120> just<00:04:02.150> constantly

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
and pretty much you're just constantly

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.780 
and pretty much you're just constantly
reloading<00:04:03.379> with<00:04:03.530> this<00:04:03.739> weapon<00:04:03.979> and<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.579> just

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
reloading with this weapon and it just

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.140 
reloading with this weapon and it just
feels<00:04:05.000> like<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.930> mag<00:04:06.260> is<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.129> small<00:04:07.790> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
feels like the mag is so small and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.149 
feels like the mag is so small and
you're<00:04:08.329> wasting<00:04:08.780> ammo<00:04:09.109> so<00:04:09.500> quickly<00:04:09.889> and<00:04:10.040> it's

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
you're wasting ammo so quickly and it's

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.720 
you're wasting ammo so quickly and it's
true<00:04:10.459> you<00:04:10.489> are<00:04:10.639> wasting<00:04:11.090> ammo

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
true you are wasting ammo

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.660 
true you are wasting ammo
quickly<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.690> definitely<00:04:13.620> would<00:04:13.769> prefer<00:04:14.099> to

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
quickly so I definitely would prefer to

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.129 
quickly so I definitely would prefer to
use<00:04:14.790> different<00:04:15.090> web<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.420> weapons<00:04:15.840> other

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
use different web that weapons other

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.500 
use different web that weapons other
than<00:04:16.290> this<00:04:16.500> in<00:04:16.769> PvE<00:04:17.130> but<00:04:17.549> for<00:04:17.729> PvP<00:04:18.120> as<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.389> can

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
than this in PvE but for PvP as you can

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.140 
than this in PvE but for PvP as you can
see<00:04:18.690> it's<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.260> beast<00:04:19.470> of<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.709> weapon<00:04:20.040> now<00:04:20.609> moving

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
see it's a beast of a weapon now moving

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.070 
see it's a beast of a weapon now moving
into<00:04:21.770> PvE<00:04:22.770> as<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:24.000> can<00:04:24.120> see<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.570> just<00:04:24.810> takes

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
into PvE as you can see it just takes

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.650 
into PvE as you can see it just takes
this<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.800> Vanguard<00:04:26.250> taiga<00:04:26.669> strike<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:27.479> the

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
this is the Vanguard taiga strike so the

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.379 
this is the Vanguard taiga strike so the
enemies<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.139> level<00:04:28.470> 24<00:04:29.010> it<00:04:29.880> actually<00:04:30.180> doesn't

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
enemies of level 24 it actually doesn't

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.480 
enemies of level 24 it actually doesn't
do<00:04:30.720> crazy<00:04:31.169> amounts<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.770> damage<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.370> was

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
do crazy amounts of damage I was

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.700 
do crazy amounts of damage I was
expecting<00:04:33.210> it<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.449> be<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.780> little<00:04:34.110> bit<00:04:34.380> more

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
expecting it to be a little bit more

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.750 
expecting it to be a little bit more
headshots<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:36.150> do<00:04:36.510> get<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:37.710> nice<00:04:38.340> bonus

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
headshots you do get a nice bonus

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.870 
headshots you do get a nice bonus
especially<00:04:39.540> when<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:39.720> hit<00:04:39.900> fire<00:04:40.169> but

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
especially when you hit fire but

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.250 
especially when you hit fire but
compared<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:41.970> hawk<00:04:42.360> moon<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:42.840> things<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.229> that

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
compared to hawk moon and things of that

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.770 
compared to hawk moon and things of that
nature<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:43.830> think<00:04:43.860> it<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.699> could<00:04:45.030> do<00:04:45.210> better<00:04:45.449> on

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
nature I think it it could do better on

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.750 
nature I think it it could do better on
that<00:04:45.960> part<00:04:46.260> for<00:04:46.440> sure<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.949> lot<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.370> people<00:04:47.520> are
