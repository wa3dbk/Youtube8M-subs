00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
bearing in mind this bike is has been a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.930 
bearing in mind this bike is has been a
bit<00:03:33.680> Muhammad<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.800> tampered<00:03:35.250> with<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.610> as<00:03:35.760> her

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
bit Muhammad a tampered with it as her

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.540 
bit Muhammad a tampered with it as her
performance<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.540> Austin<00:03:37.250> beat<00:03:38.250> it's<00:03:38.400> got

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
performance it's Austin beat it's got

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.120 
performance it's Austin beat it's got
bigger<00:03:38.760> carb<00:03:39.150> as<00:03:39.360> well<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.650> be<00:03:40.860> honest

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
bigger carb as well and so to be honest

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.950 
bigger carb as well and so to be honest
and<00:03:41.280> bring<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.520> sprocket<00:03:41.760> ratio<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.750> might

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
and bring a sprocket ratio so it might

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.300 
and bring a sprocket ratio so it might
seem<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.290> little<00:03:43.410> bit<00:03:43.590> faster<00:03:44.010> than<00:03:44.040> what<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
seem a little bit faster than what the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.460 
seem a little bit faster than what the
standard<00:03:44.670> one<00:03:44.850> would<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.810> be<00:03:45.930> honest<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.260> just

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
standard one would to be honest so just

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.990 
standard one would to be honest so just
