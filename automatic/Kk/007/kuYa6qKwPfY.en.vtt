button<00:00:38.170> leaver<00:00:38.739> whatever<00:00:39.809> go<00:00:40.809> out<00:00:41.019> from<00:00:41.440> the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
button leaver whatever go out from the

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.820 
button leaver whatever go out from the
torch<00:00:41.890> into<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.970> piston<00:00:43.690> that<00:00:44.260> should<00:00:44.500> extend

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
torch into a piston that should extend

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.810 
torch into a piston that should extend
and<00:00:45.100> now<00:00:46.440> they<00:00:47.440> shall<00:00:47.620> for<00:00:47.890> piston<00:00:48.370> so<00:00:48.610> there

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
and now they shall for piston so there

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.399 
and now they shall for piston so there
you<00:00:48.910> go<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:51.720> you<00:00:52.720> want<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.140> have<00:00:53.260> your

you go and then you want to have your

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.119 
you go and then you want to have your
extending<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:57.039> that's<00:00:57.280> just<00:00:57.750> staggering

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
extending and that's just staggering

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.040 
extending and that's just staggering

above and a repeater and that should
also<00:01:31.420> just<00:01:31.959> extend<00:01:32.410> fine

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
also just extend fine

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
torches are off on the side and then

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:23.840 
torches are off on the side and then
locks<00:02:16.020> like<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.780> mumbo<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.350> just<00:02:22.590> oh<00:02:22.850> my

now let's turn around and block block
block<00:03:02.570> there<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.630> go<00:03:04.580> now<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.760> should<00:03:05.880> work

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
block there you go now that should work

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.460 
block there you go now that should work
two<00:03:07.680> repeaters<00:03:08.100> on<00:03:08.370> for<00:03:08.989> one<00:03:09.989> more<00:03:10.020> Teeter<00:03:10.380> on

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
two repeaters on for one more Teeter on

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.390 
two repeaters on for one more Teeter on
for<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.130> these<00:03:11.459> repeaters<00:03:12.560> would<00:03:13.560> all<00:03:13.770> be<00:03:14.160> on

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
for and these repeaters would all be on

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.950 
for and these repeaters would all be on
three

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.860 

so<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.930> should<00:03:21.170> work<00:03:22.540> sorry<00:03:23.540> for<00:03:23.780> that

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
so that should work sorry for that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.450 
so that should work sorry for that
slight<00:03:24.230> interruption<00:03:24.590> there<00:03:25.130> um<00:03:25.840> tell<00:03:26.840> ya

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
slight interruption there um tell ya

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.220 
slight interruption there um tell ya
those<00:03:28.460> repeaters<00:03:29.000> on<00:03:29.150> three<00:03:29.450> ticks<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.050> that

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
those repeaters on three ticks and that

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.010 
those repeaters on three ticks and that
you<00:03:30.380> don't<00:03:30.560> extend<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.370> almost<00:03:31.910> feature<00:03:32.210> will

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
you don't extend and almost feature will

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.000 
you don't extend and almost feature will
almost<00:03:33.460> got<00:03:34.460> to<00:03:34.550> do<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.730> bottom<00:03:35.000> part<00:03:35.180> still

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
almost got to do the bottom part still

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:44.140

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:26.529 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:35.909 

next<00:04:29.110> extending<00:04:30.110> or<00:04:30.259> pulsing<00:04:31.330> we<00:04:32.330> have<00:04:32.419> this

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:47.260

and this this new yeah this and two

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:56.670 
and this this new yeah this and two
blocks<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:52.400> this<00:04:52.699> and<00:04:53.300> this<00:04:54.159> torch<00:04:55.159> torch<00:04:55.819> and

blocks and this and this torch torch and

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:07.420 
blocks and this and this torch torch and
these<00:04:57.680> repeaters<00:04:59.710> think<00:05:03.849> that<00:05:04.849> one<00:05:05.120> is<00:05:05.360> on<00:05:06.430> 43

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
these repeaters think that one is on 43

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:19.900 
these repeaters think that one is on 43
44<00:05:08.319> so<00:05:09.319> for<00:05:12.430> 344

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.880 

let's<00:05:20.450> watch<00:05:20.720> it<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.170> there<00:05:21.410> you<00:05:21.500> go<00:05:21.560> now<00:05:21.830> we

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
let's watch it and there you go now we

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.200 
let's watch it and there you go now we
still<00:05:22.160> have<00:05:22.370> to<00:05:22.550> get<00:05:23.420> in<00:05:23.600> one<00:05:24.050> more<00:05:25.090> thing<00:05:26.090> to

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
still have to get in one more thing to

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.000 
still have to get in one more thing to
jig<00:05:26.450> and<00:05:27.410> we<00:05:27.710> do<00:05:27.890> that<00:05:29.170> going<00:05:30.170> out<00:05:30.410> of<00:05:30.740> a

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
jig and we do that going out of a

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.570 
jig and we do that going out of a
repeater<00:05:33.760> yeah<00:05:34.760> like<00:05:34.970> this<00:05:35.330> into<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:35.930> piston

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
repeater yeah like this into a piston

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.030 
repeater yeah like this into a piston
and<00:05:37.580> that<00:05:38.450> piston<00:05:38.870> is<00:05:38.960> going<00:05:39.140> to<00:05:39.200> fire<00:05:39.440> over<00:05:40.010> a

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
and that piston is going to fire over a

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:46.320 
and that piston is going to fire over a
torch<00:05:40.610> once<00:05:40.910> again<00:05:42.040> with<00:05:43.040> a<00:05:43.280> repeater<00:05:44.000> and

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:55.180 

some<00:05:47.330> more<00:05:47.540> stuff<00:05:49.150> right<00:05:50.150> all<00:05:50.630> right<00:05:54.010> gets<00:05:55.010> a

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
some more stuff right all right gets a

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.580 
some more stuff right all right gets a
block<00:05:55.370> down<00:05:56.230> toward<00:05:57.230> you<00:05:58.360> torch<00:05:59.360> and<00:05:59.690> torch

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
block down toward you torch and torch

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.410 
block down toward you torch and torch
that<00:06:01.610> now<00:06:02.050> they'll<00:06:03.050> say<00:06:03.290> yeah<00:06:04.420> repeater

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
that now they'll say yeah repeater

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:13.840 
that now they'll say yeah repeater
