00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
he brought up that Gen X and the

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.660 
he brought up that Gen X and the
University<00:00:50.410> of<00:00:50.470> Missouri<00:00:50.800> was<00:00:51.040> want<00:00:51.310> to<00:00:51.460> do<00:00:51.640> a

study<00:00:52.239> on<00:00:52.530> sorted<00:00:53.530> semen<00:00:54.040> and<00:00:54.220> I<00:00:54.370> saw<00:00:54.670> game<00:00:55.000> for

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
study on sorted semen and I saw game for

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.650 
study on sorted semen and I saw game for
that<00:00:55.480> because<00:00:55.870> o<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.820> all<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.180> drought<00:00:58.450> and

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
stuff going on I truly believe the

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.670 
stuff going on I truly believe the
females<00:01:01.120> are<00:01:01.329> going<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.660> be<00:01:01.780> at<00:01:01.899> a<00:01:01.989> premium<00:01:02.200> in

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
females are going to be at a premium in

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.170 
females are going to be at a premium in
the<00:01:02.829> more<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.250> them<00:01:03.399> we<00:01:03.579> can<00:01:03.790> get<00:01:03.969> on<00:01:04.149> the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
the more of them we can get on the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.929 
the more of them we can get on the
ground<00:01:04.560> bred<00:01:05.560> heifer<00:01:06.040> may<00:01:06.250> be<00:01:06.460> worth<00:01:06.700> more

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
ground bred heifer may be worth more

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.910 
ground bred heifer may be worth more
dollars<00:01:07.390> than<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.630> fat<00:01:07.930> steer<00:01:08.320> here<00:01:08.590> before

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
dollars than a fat steer here before

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.610 
dollars than a fat steer here before
very<00:01:09.159> long<00:01:09.390> highs<00:01:10.390> only<00:01:10.780> way<00:01:11.140> that<00:01:11.440> you<00:01:11.590> can

very long highs only way that you can

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.920 
very long highs only way that you can
really<00:01:12.010> utilize<00:01:12.370> the<00:01:12.880> best<00:01:13.120> genetics<00:01:13.690> out

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
really utilize the best genetics out

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.050 
really utilize the best genetics out
there<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:14.500> can<00:01:14.710> go<00:01:14.890> out<00:01:15.070> there<00:01:15.370> and<00:01:15.520> spend<00:01:15.850> all

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
there you can go out there and spend all

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.440 
there you can go out there and spend all
the<00:01:16.210> money<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:16.600> want<00:01:16.810> on<00:01:17.080> hurdles<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.850> he

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
the money you want on hurdles but he

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.160 
the money you want on hurdles but he
still<00:01:19.780> can't<00:01:20.170> afford<00:01:20.799> this<00:01:21.130> then<00:01:21.640> what<00:01:21.940> it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
still can't afford this then what it

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.410 
still can't afford this then what it
would<00:01:23.170> take<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.470> get<00:01:23.860> comparable<00:01:24.549> genetics

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
would take to get comparable genetics

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.649 
would take to get comparable genetics
out<00:01:25.690> of<00:01:25.840> an<00:01:25.960> AI<00:01:26.140> sire<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:28.150> when<00:01:28.510> you

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
out of an AI sire and really when you

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.450 
out of an AI sire and really when you
step<00:01:28.960> down<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.470> study<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.979> long-term

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
step down and study the long-term

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.550 
step down and study the long-term
benefits<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.360> cows<00:01:31.600> going<00:01:32.080> back<00:01:32.290> into

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
benefits of the cows going back into

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.859 
benefits of the cows going back into
charity<00:01:33.130> stuff<00:01:33.460> like<00:01:33.729> that<00:01:33.760> it's<00:01:34.299> it's

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
charity stuff like that it's it's

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.840 
charity stuff like that it's it's
probably<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.710> lot<00:01:36.100> cheaper<00:01:36.130> than<00:01:36.610> what<00:01:36.790> people

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
probably a lot cheaper than what people

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.080 
probably a lot cheaper than what people
really<00:01:37.390> think<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:38.220> I'll<00:01:39.220> tell<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.700> working
