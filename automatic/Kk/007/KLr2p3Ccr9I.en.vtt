00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.660 
bitcoins and guess what is no bankers in
Bitcoin<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.870> every<00:03:13.440> deal<00:03:13.650> is<00:03:13.680> transparent

and there's no banks it's a virtual
currency<00:03:18.329> more<00:03:19.230> on<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.530> one<00:03:19.709> later<00:03:21.440> but<00:03:22.440> now

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
currency more on that one later but now

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.970 
currency more on that one later but now
we've<00:03:22.769> seen<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.070> stuff<00:03:23.519> around<00:03:24.890> Saturn<00:03:25.890> in

well<00:03:32.700> slept<00:03:32.970> well<00:03:33.239> politics<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:34.019> course<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:35.400> I

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
well slept well politics of course and I

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.460 
well slept well politics of course and I
suspect<00:03:36.180> that's<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.600> latter<00:03:36.840> phase<00:03:37.230> of

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
suspect that's the latter phase of

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.500 
suspect that's the latter phase of
Saturn<00:03:37.890> in<00:03:37.980> Scorpio<00:03:38.070> will<00:03:38.670> have<00:03:38.940> political

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
Saturn in Scorpio will have political

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.410 
Saturn in Scorpio will have political
ramifications<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> lesser<00:03:41.700> extent

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
ramifications and to a lesser extent

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.920 
ramifications and to a lesser extent
economic<00:03:43.320> but<00:03:43.530> certainly<00:03:44.070> political<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.630> I

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
economic but certainly political and I

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.020 
economic but certainly political and I
suspect<00:03:46.140> also<00:03:46.590> but<00:03:47.280> at<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.519> time<00:03:47.579> of<00:03:47.820> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
suspect also but at this time of the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.930 
suspect also but at this time of the
full<00:03:48.209> moon<00:03:48.269> in<00:03:48.540> Scorpio<00:03:48.989> coming<00:03:49.410> up<00:03:49.820> we<00:03:50.820> are

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
full moon in Scorpio coming up we are

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.340 
full moon in Scorpio coming up we are
seeing<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:53.010> rise<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.880> deep<00:03:54.090> dark<00:03:54.510> feminine

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
seeing the rise of a deep dark feminine

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.620 
seeing the rise of a deep dark feminine
I<00:03:56.540> still<00:03:57.540> believe<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:59.180> females<00:04:00.180> women

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
I still believe that females women

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.590 
I still believe that females women
should<00:04:01.049> run<00:04:01.200> all<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.530> churches<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:03.030> ideally

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
should run all the churches and ideally

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.710 
should run all the churches and ideally
all<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:04.019> military<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:06.120> government's

all the military and the government's

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.509 
all the military and the government's
then<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.769> world<00:04:07.950> would<00:04:08.070> be<00:04:08.190> different

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.500 

certainly<00:04:11.519> there's<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.540> love<00:04:13.010> increasingly

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
certainly there's a love increasingly
