00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.750 
you compared to Junior dos Santos and I
don't<00:03:53.739> think<00:03:53.889> people<00:03:54.130> are<00:03:54.250> necessarily

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
don't think people are necessarily

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
about the way the first round ended with

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.750 
about the way the first round ended with
Josie<00:05:01.350> although<00:05:01.710> landing<00:05:02.160> those<00:05:02.280> two<00:05:02.490> blows

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
Josie although landing those two blows

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.940

after<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.420> first<00:05:03.630> round<00:05:03.900> what<00:05:04.560> was<00:05:04.650> your<00:05:04.800> take

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
after the first round what was your take

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.980 
after the first round what was your take
on<00:05:05.160> it<00:05:05.220> I<00:05:05.490> believe<00:05:05.970> that<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.240> point<00:05:06.630> should<00:05:06.840> have

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
on it I believe that a point should have

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.660 
on it I believe that a point should have
been<00:05:07.140> taken<00:05:07.470> away<00:05:07.560> in<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:08.100> moment<00:05:08.250> certainly

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
been taken away in the moment certainly

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.330 
been taken away in the moment certainly
you<00:05:08.910> can<00:05:09.090> look<00:05:09.240> back<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:10.440> wonder<00:05:10.980> if<00:05:11.220> a

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
you can look back and I wonder if a

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.950 
you can look back and I wonder if a
point<00:05:11.520> is<00:05:11.640> taken<00:05:11.880> away<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:12.300> mean<00:05:12.510> does<00:05:12.930> that

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
point is taken away I mean does that

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.570 
point is taken away I mean does that
change<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.530> pattern<00:05:14.010> at<00:05:14.160> all<00:05:14.220> does<00:05:14.430> that

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
change the pattern at all does that

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.010 
change the pattern at all does that
change<00:05:14.910> what<00:05:15.240> they're<00:05:15.390> telling<00:05:15.600> each<00:05:15.870> of

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
change what they're telling each of

change what they're telling each of
their<00:05:16.140> fighters<00:05:16.500> in<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.650> corner<00:05:17.010> all<00:05:17.280> kind<00:05:18.270> of

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
their fighters in the corner all kind of
