out<00:00:48.950> there

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.160 

and<00:00:53.220> you<00:00:53.520> try<00:00:53.700> to<00:00:53.760> work<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.240> in<00:00:54.450> the<00:00:54.570> same<00:00:54.870> style

of the up-and-down motion it does become
hard<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.650> get<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> rod<00:00:59.190> tip

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
hard because you do get the rod tip

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.830 
hard because you do get the rod tip
against<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> water

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
this I can still get the bait to walk

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.550 
this I can still get the bait to walk
back<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.490> forth<00:02:17.760> beside<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.510> boat<00:02:18.660> jerk

baits<00:02:19.800> have<00:02:19.980> always<00:02:20.130> been<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.460> problem<00:02:20.820> on

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
baits have always been a problem on

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.240 
baits have always been a problem on
figure<00:02:21.930> eight<00:02:22.080> because<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.620> can't<00:02:22.920> replicate

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
figure eight because you can't replicate

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.440 
figure eight because you can't replicate
the<00:02:23.819> action

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
the action

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.809 
the action
you<00:02:24.599> have<00:02:24.780> during<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.290> retreat<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.610> see

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
you have during the retreat you can see

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.300 
you have during the retreat you can see
though<00:02:27.030> with<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.390> longer<00:02:27.690> rod<00:02:28.080> laver<00:02:28.830> peach

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
though with this longer rod laver peach

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.820 
though with this longer rod laver peach
this<00:02:29.519> beta<00:02:29.819> widen<00:02:30.330> beside<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.870> boat<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.560> get

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
this beta widen beside the boat and get

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.320 
this beta widen beside the boat and get
those<00:02:31.980> figure<00:02:32.400> eight<00:02:32.519> fish<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.090> always

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
those figure eight fish that have always

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.960 
those figure eight fish that have always
been<00:02:33.890> elusive<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:35.129> us<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.519> glide<00:02:35.730> thing

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
been elusive for us with the glide thing

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.000 
been elusive for us with the glide thing
so<00:02:36.629> again<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.050> one<00:02:37.200> thing<00:02:37.379> I'll<00:02:37.530> say<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.739> no

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
so again the one thing I'll say is no

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.890 
so again the one thing I'll say is no
matter<00:02:38.160> how<00:02:38.400> tall<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.910> are<00:02:38.940> straight<00:02:39.720> from

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
matter how tall you are straight from

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.809 
matter how tall you are straight from
this<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.349> mean<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.010> can<00:02:41.160> go<00:02:41.280> down<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.519> my<00:02:41.640> knees

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
this I mean you can go down to my knees

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.500 
this I mean you can go down to my knees
like<00:02:41.849> this<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:43.530> now<00:02:44.370> I'm<00:02:44.519> much<00:02:44.790> shorter<00:02:45.300> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
like this and now I'm much shorter and

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
if you take this rod and you work it to

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.070 
if you take this rod and you work it to
the<00:02:48.390> side<00:02:50.060> okay<00:02:51.060> instead<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.599> going<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.930> up

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
the side okay instead of going the up

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.759 
the side okay instead of going the up
and<00:02:52.290> down<00:02:52.470> motion<00:02:52.739> just<00:02:53.700> work<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.180> side

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
and down motion just work it to the side

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.050 
and down motion just work it to the side
and<00:02:55.769> make<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.099> they<00:02:56.280> walk<00:02:56.549> back<00:02:56.849> and<00:02:57.000> forth

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
and make that they walk back and forth

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.600 
and make that they walk back and forth
and<00:02:57.840> get<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.380> boat<00:02:58.560> leaving<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.280> little

and get to the boat leaving a little
extra<00:02:59.910> live<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:02.880> simply<00:03:03.269> twitch<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.720> along<00:03:03.930> and

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
extra live it simply twitch it along and

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.559 
extra live it simply twitch it along and
you<00:03:04.560> can<00:03:04.709> make<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.099> bait<00:03:05.310> move<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.360> make

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569
