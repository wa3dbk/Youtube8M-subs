 we leave it with the child's paper and we're going 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.360
 to let rest now for one hour 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.360
 before turning it over 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.390
 on the way back 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:13.060

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.349
 already granted 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.090

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.200
 30 minutes have passed, let's see how 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.200

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.459
 they have already met a little bit now 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.560

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.730

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.780
 to fry the potatoes and cold in a 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.780
 Fryer that goes much faster 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.470
 has spent half an hour more and now 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.380
 we have to turn it around 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:39.030
 see how they are already golden brown 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.030

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:50.300
 the potatoes as you see are already fried 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.000
 slightly fried and are medium 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.070
 centimeter approximately we have them to the 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.400

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.400
 oven 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.800
 and they will finish cooking together with the 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.100
 roasted and that has a pint that you 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.100
