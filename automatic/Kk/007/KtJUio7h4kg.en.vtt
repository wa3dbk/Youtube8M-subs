called<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.859> theory<00:00:17.010> now<00:00:17.880> most<00:00:18.180> humans

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
called the theory now most humans

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.910 
called the theory now most humans
conceived<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.260> theory<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.619> Danny

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
conceived with this theory is that Danny

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.120 
conceived with this theory is that Danny
Phantom<00:00:20.130> was<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.490> grownup<00:00:20.910> version<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.270> Timmy

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
Phantom was a grownup version of Timmy

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.640 
Phantom was a grownup version of Timmy
he's<00:00:23.130> actually<00:00:23.369> new<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.880> me<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.420> Danny<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.199> 14

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
he's actually new to me and Danny is 14

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.740 
he's actually new to me and Danny is 14
initial<00:00:26.160> while<00:00:26.369> Timmy<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.849> 10<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.420> saying<00:00:27.689> I

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
initial while Timmy is 10 so saying I

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.150 
initial while Timmy is 10 so saying I
use<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> grown-up<00:00:28.260> version<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.710> Timmy<00:00:28.980> doesn't

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
use a grown-up version of Timmy doesn't

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.890 
use a grown-up version of Timmy doesn't
really<00:00:29.340> add<00:00:29.490> up<00:00:29.519> according<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> theory

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
really add up according to the theory

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.190 
really add up according to the theory
now<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.980> way<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:32.369> theory<00:00:32.780> starts<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.989> don't

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
now the way this theory starts I don't

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.810 
now the way this theory starts I don't
really<00:00:34.500> agree<00:00:34.649> with<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.579> only

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
really agree with just because the only

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.340 
really agree with just because the only
way<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.059> theory<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.420> valid<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
way this theory is valid is if you

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.750 
way this theory is valid is if you
believe<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> crazy<00:00:37.860> accusation<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.670> is

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
believe the crazy accusation that is

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.340 
believe the crazy accusation that is
made<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> beginning<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> series

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
made in the beginning of the series

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.920 
made in the beginning of the series
while<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.340> guess<00:00:41.610> every<00:00:41.969> theory<00:00:42.210> has<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> crazy

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
while I guess every theory has a crazy

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410 
while I guess every theory has a crazy
accusation<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.550> order<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> be

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
accusation but in order for this to be

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.240 
accusation but in order for this to be
valid<00:00:45.450> yet<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.020> believe<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.620> made-up<00:00:46.860> detail

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
valid yet to believe a made-up detail

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.650 
valid yet to believe a made-up detail
that<00:00:47.430> could<00:00:47.670> not<00:00:47.820> happen<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> end<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that could not happen to the end of the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.069 
that could not happen to the end of the
show<00:00:49.250> anyways<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> pressure<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.660> tuning

was the theory guys kind of a weird
theory<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.789> don't<00:04:33.060> only<00:04:33.180> think<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:33.660> much

theory and I don't only think it's much
of<00:04:34.139> a<00:04:34.410> theory<00:04:34.740> just<00:04:34.830> because<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.789> think<00:04:36.330> it's

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
of a theory just because I think it's

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.379 
of a theory just because I think it's
more<00:04:36.840> of<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.280> seeing<00:04:38.280> similarities<00:04:39.270> between

more of a seeing similarities between
the<00:04:39.600> shows<00:04:39.810> just<00:04:40.280> because<00:04:41.280> um<00:04:41.699> they're

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
the shows just because um they're

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.850 
the shows just because um they're
created<00:04:42.630> by<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.780> same<00:04:42.990> guy<00:04:43.139> and<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.410> can't
