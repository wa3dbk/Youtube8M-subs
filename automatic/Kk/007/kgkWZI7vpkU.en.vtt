 apply the cat magazines apply 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.270
 How did we start then an angel? 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.540
 we took our eternal stick on the part 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.380
 smooth our mold and we will scratch the whole 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.369
 Our Piece Piece 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.530
 so stay this way and then we will 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.850
 cut off leaving no centimeter 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.189
 to cut gilmar and you 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.869
 we love to have security on the hour 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.689
 of cut as cloth 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.509
 after we cut it I chose 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.990
 to have been in my preference is to give 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.420
 by to take all brands 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.290
 that the fabric has and comes with the term 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.790
 Stick with the rough part down 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:51.380
 second hot iron for 3 to 5 seconds and 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.380
 Shoot again the very hot beque 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.540
 it will stay this way that totally 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.290
 necklace 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.930
 after we made this passage 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.439
 I remember the line I made mine. 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.560
 and I'm going to remove the film that he 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.760
 has 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.069
 getting this part of a brilliant it 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.830
 bright and easy to handle it in 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.920
 Colo in hand does not disturb and then I go. 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.950
 I've set up my work here. 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.980
 I've already removed the stickers 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.090
 for another nine years and I will start 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.459
 mount obeying my mold're here 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.700
 So, whatever you have inside, I'm putting 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:41.380
 inside and so I'm riding then 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.500
 I'll put the different colors here 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.230
 not to get a thing much worse 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.090
 copied is very much the same 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.660
 This is cool, you 're just mixing the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.459
 the chances and will put the 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.190
 I like the eggs here. 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.010
 underneath the pocket to give an impression 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.580
 that they are guarding the sheep 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:11.579
 That's why the pocket is helpful and come with 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:19.870
 iron again hot for 3 to 5 seconds 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:23.650
 and it is completely stuck together 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.319
 This I go to the details that I have 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.709
 on the apron that is the flax that is the scratch 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.670
 with the pen is of fabric so I come 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:37.540
 with the little eyes with you with the glue is 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:45.370
 fabric puts a drop and I go 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:48.730
 putting legal articulation is super 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.430
 fun then appreciated exactly there 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.639
 have to be careful to dry well 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.579
 to be able to handle otherwise it falls 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:01.269
 and then I come with the thin pen and I go 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.480
 making the missing details is the 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.819
 little mustache 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.150
 the rest of the mouth and that's when 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.900
 forming my rabbit 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.930
 well here comes the butt that is the most 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.579
 important at work to leave more 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.829
 beautiful but it is 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.900
 exempting one more work from this young woman 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:29.409
 israel exactly I picked up a skein're 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.960
 fold the middle and put it in the needle 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:35.409
 so it will look like this a bit more 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.949
 short and argolinha had underneath and 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:41.500
 Come on the same fabric, then I'll get 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.870
 in colorful fabric 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.360
 I'll go until the end when I 'm arriving. 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:54.099
 next to my ball I put 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:57.849
 needle and will form the first point and 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:05:03.849
 so on and on then I'll go back here 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:05.099
 step behind looks and do another 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:07.930
 little dot 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:10.029
 you can set the distance you 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.930
 want the fulfillment of the point that you 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.919
 want to 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:21.250
 okay but the ideal is to make more or less 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:24.819
 everyone is alike so I put it here and 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.000
 This I step behind is doing more 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.000
 one 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:37.240
 to support childhood and so on 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.629
 you use the colors of the 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.580
 lines that you used your bunny 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.199

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.789
