 illegal exchange

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.329
 share his experience of travel and 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.970
 everything else 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.159
 people as well as my debts 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.739
 day to day experiences 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.870
 harley-davidson in the traffic of sÃ£o paulo 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.480
 so we thought this theme was cool on 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.769
 common to harley days in common and people 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.329
 to be able to put everything together in one helping the other 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.629
 as in the beginning when I was 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.889
 starting there I starting even more 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:30.560
 when I had type 4 written the 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:35.019
 Beautiful motofog ps from Brasilia helped me 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.019
 With lucas de campinas, he helped me. 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:43.010
 It's more expensive, a lot of people over there. 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.569
 helping those two who tagged me 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.569
 enough will help me in the dissemination of the 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.450
 escape in the city and then I think 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.280
 this exchange is interesting is all that 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.319
 you can to help other people 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.900
 They do cool things, I think it's cool. 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.750
 Disclosure is your opinion there. 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.579
 below in the comments you think 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.930
 You think it's cool if you think 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:11.000
 that's not cool 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:13.219
 I'll take everything into consideration is the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.590
 I wanted to say the following, I think. 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:18.489
 that much more than making videos 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.060
 showing the day to day 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.190
 gives the idea that I am always I want me 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.870
 propose to generate content 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.940
 I think this business of generating 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:33.310
 content is cool and the dodo blog 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.319
 scapin from the escape club came to meet 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.319
 this is because he has a lot of legal content 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.599
 so I can get we can to 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:43.900
 people can combine to get a 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:46.479
 common content and develop and 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.639
 develop on the blog develop here in 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.860
 up the bike in practice 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.810
 anyway there's a lot of cool stuff that can 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.069
 get out of there a lot of cool even though 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.860
 You can go out there and and that's what I want 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:03.039
 smelling content to you think the 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.740
 world is like this today I think the bid 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.419
 the social media internet of all has 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.280
 lots of information rolling there a lot 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:14.169
 information then is the the the the general legal 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.720
 content and not simply do for 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.880
 do it for us 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.949
 every comment you make sometimes 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.440
 I ask myself something I do not know I have 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.389
 that in order to answer this, no 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.599
 generates content because I go back to 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.659
 know and anything I can say 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.759
 For you that sometimes for me I do not even 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:35.710
 I know I'm I'm making a 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.880
 Such an important thing can be important. 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.070
 For you, I may be generating a 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.729
 content for you 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.669
 So that's what's cool, that's what makes 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.949
 business is cool I call here 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.870
 camera and do-it-yourself is cool too 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.630
 You'll see how a motorcycle is riding in the 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.990
 corridor as the law passed did not 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.310
 Passes like this passes and everything else but the 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.569
 content that I think is a business 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.330
 cool 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.610
