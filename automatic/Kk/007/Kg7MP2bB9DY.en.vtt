comes<00:06:12.890> once<00:06:13.190> he<00:06:13.280> rubs<00:06:13.460> his<00:06:13.580> velvet<00:06:13.760> off<00:06:14.030> but

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
comes once he rubs his velvet off but

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.360 
comes once he rubs his velvet off but
it's<00:06:15.440> pretty<00:06:15.530> cool<00:06:15.740> to<00:06:15.890> shoot<00:06:16.010> a<00:06:16.100> buck<00:06:16.250> that

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370
