00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
way to utilize this is to eat the

so that you can boom-boom eat the

are<00:02:16.209> quite<00:02:16.540> different

these steps are about managing your

these steps are about managing your

the next obliterate or frost strike is a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
an obliterate if you have both an

an obliterate if you have both an

obliterate and a frost strike able to be

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
used but it's almost never worth it to

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.930 
used but it's almost never worth it to
wait<00:02:52.840> for<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.200> runes<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.680> recharge<00:02:54.040> if<00:02:54.280> you

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
wait for the runes to recharge if you

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.190 
wait for the runes to recharge if you
could<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.209> go<00:02:55.330> ahead<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.780> frost<00:02:56.080> strike

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
could just go ahead and frost strike

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.170 
could just go ahead and frost strike
with<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.860> this<00:02:57.099> is<00:02:57.160> because<00:02:57.519> holding<00:02:58.000> the

with it and this is because holding the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.360 
with it and this is because holding the
buff<00:02:58.450> prevents<00:02:59.170> other<00:02:59.380> Auto<00:02:59.709> attacks<00:03:00.130> from

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
doesn't stack so getting this buff means

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.589 
doesn't stack so getting this buff means
use<00:03:05.230> one<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.500> those<00:03:05.650> two<00:03:05.860> strikes<00:03:06.220> now<00:03:06.910> but<00:03:07.510> on

use one of those two strikes now but on

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.690 
use one of those two strikes now but on
