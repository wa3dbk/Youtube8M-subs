00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 Hello dear viewers and 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.890
 our channel subscribers are my name 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.930
 Igor I am an expert on plants and today 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.330
 he will tell you about such an interesting product 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.250
 which is called the hall is not for all of us 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.529
 like smoke from nearby fires when 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.539
 on the adjacent plot something is burning well 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.820
 apart from such negative factors here 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.760
 bonfires with strings you can create 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.640
 free very valuable fertilizer product 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.140
 it laid it a product which 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.119
 is obtained by burning 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.730
 plant residues namely 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.800
 plant scientists stress 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.050
 found that the ash contains more 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.040
 half of all elements of the table 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.620
 Mendeleev 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.600
 but most of all it is silicon calcium 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.910
 potassium phosphorus is exactly what you need 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.039
 plant mger very much there and other 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.559
 elements and iron and gray boron and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.930
 manganese and zinc and copper everything is there 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.000
 that the plants just really need not 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.070
 think that only kids can burn 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.620
 pruning shrubs 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.989
 you can burn almost all battles 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.699
 beet and potato tops when they 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.049
 dry up can be beautifully burned because 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.390
 that they also contain everything enough 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.890
 many nutrients of course 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.900
 the mineral composition of ash is very strong 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.270
 depends on the products you are 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.880
 burned let's say if you squeeze birch 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 logs then there will be about 40 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.110
 percent calcium 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.540
 12 13 percent potassium 5-6 percent 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.119
 phosphorus and only two or three percent 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.430
 magnesium and if we say we will burn 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.130
 straw one the composition if you're in this 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.990
 zone will already be 20 30 percent in total 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.689
 everything will be about the gorgeous hall 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.509
 valuable product that fits all 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.270
 plants but with one exception in it 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.909
 virtually no nitrogen nitrogen is very necessary 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.170
 plants especially during the growing season 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.299
 therefore it is clear that the hall needs 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.850
 be sure to use along with 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.280
 nitrogen fertilizer but keep in mind that 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.750
 it is not necessary to bring the hall along with 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.740
 nitrogen fertilizers and such 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.960
 using 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.610
 nitrogen quickly turns into me you 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.710
 evaporates that is instead of 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.000
 feed on ozone in fact you are it 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.009
 air will be used 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.049
 in the same way it is not necessary to use the hall 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.789
 simultaneously with phosphate 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.590
 fertilizer on the first hall already contains 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.550
 sufficiently large amount of phosphorus a 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.250
 Secondly 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.989
 the hall has an alkaline reaction and this 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.970
 phosphorus will not be just plants 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.590
 digest one more plus the hall and in 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.970
 Differences from many mineral fertilizers 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.730
 is that it does not contain 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.290
 absolutely no chlorine and therefore 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.790
 Of course the hall needs first 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.220
 use for those cultures that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.900
 very sensitive to chlorine potatoes 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.560
 cucumbers zucchini 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.540
 carrot earthlings to raspberry strawberries here 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.670
 it's all just does not like chlorine therefore 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.110
 the hall is best for them and approach is not enough 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.660
 who knows what is going on, not only 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.580
 fertilizer first making ash soil 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.700
 it improves its structure 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.739
 loosens the soil secondly for crap 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.120
 alkaline reaction and reduces 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.950
 soil acidity if it is you 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.000
 excess here is just the hall for that 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.819
 fits very well 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.799
 norms making ash depends of course on 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.440
 composition of your soil how often and 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.650
 much you use organic 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.260
 fertilizer but here if you have soil 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.329
 some peat loam 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.060
 acidic environment is recommended to make 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.310
 from about 700 grams to one and a half 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.040
 kilogram per square meter a lot 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.600
 enough is wood ash and if you 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.340
 you burn that straw then this 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.900
 the norm should be done twice more 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.140
 that is, from one and a half kilogram to three 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.519
 kilograms per square rooms there if 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.709
 you use name just like 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.109
 fertilizer fireplace phosphate then 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.720
 Approximately 100 150 recommended 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.030
 gram room per square meter what is 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.720
 100 150 grams hall and now in such a faceted 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.670
 a glass about 100 grams hall and 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.060
 Means 100 150 grams this respectively 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.440
 1 cup and a half cup of ash for 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.959
 the growing season is very good 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.579
 apply liquid dressing to the hall 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.920
 for this, take a glass of ash and dilute 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.300
 about in a bucket of water with these 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.520
 solution to such checks 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.070
 Water the plant throughout the 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.630
 growing season of course when 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.220
 making the hall and when used as 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.080
 fertilizer keep in mind that some 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.910
 Thank you for that, plants are not at all 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.340
 some plants say 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.860
 We used to just live in an acidic environment is 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.570
 Of course, coniferous plants are practically all. 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.450
 because they grow in the forest they love 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.810
 acidic soil is rhododendrons and there 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.340
 fire and this azaleas are just for them 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.740
 but many others of course the plant but 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.080
 here for them in any case do not make 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.690
 Zulu because it makes the environment more 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.940
 neutral and these plants such soil 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.620
 the hall is no longer suitable quite effectively 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.630
 can be used as a means of dealing with 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.150
 pests and diseases of many cultures 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.540
 for this you need a hall 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.250
 grind make it such a powder 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.560
 then moisten the leaves of the plants and already 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.020
 this powder how to sprinkle plants 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.450
 help get rid of many pests 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.820
 diseases well very good to use for 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.860
 onion door drives for potatoes and for 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.480
 strawberries by the way say around 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.720
 strawberries if you will come 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.110
 ash plot then it will be good 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.190
 an obstacle for slugs and snails 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.970
 who love to eat berries 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.430
 strawberries if you make an infusion of ash 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.560
 tobacco soap in equal 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.720
 quantities it all take something very 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.260
 can effectively fight powdery 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.070
 dew 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.150
 with aphids on what culture like currants 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.940
 like gooseberry 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.440
 but where can I get such a room sometimes? 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.600
 but you are actually easy 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.850
 use for this brazier and grill 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.650
 shish kebabs say at the festival all that 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.960
 there remains little by little collect 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.720
 collect throughout the season and 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.790
 then by the spring when the hall just 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.440
 necessary plants you will have 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.840
 right amount of this gorgeous 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.700
 product call can be stored in dry 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.110
 indoors it is advisable not to give and 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.419
 get wet because it can 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.820
 lose your properties in this case 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.620
 worst in the dry state it is stored 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.030
 long enough without losing its properties 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.030
 spring will use it 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.540
 so today he talked about how 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.340
 correctly get and use such 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.930
 great cheap free 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.620
 the actual product which is called 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.960
 hall 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.940
 Well, I say goodbye to this, see 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.580
 our video plots even better subscribe 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.710
 on our video channel on youtube here I am 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.540
 I wish to use such fertilizers 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.580
 Chemistry is natural and healthy. 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.580
 for plants fertilizer all the best to you
