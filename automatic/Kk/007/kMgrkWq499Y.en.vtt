get good pin action or pin carry and you

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.860 
get good pin action or pin carry and you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
away from the head pin altogether so

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.820 
away from the head pin altogether so
getting<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.480> right<00:02:32.510> angle<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:33.170> attack<00:02:33.320> into

getting the right angle of attack into
the<00:02:34.160> pocket<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.700> important<00:02:35.210> to<00:02:35.510> get

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
consistent get the best pin carry leave

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.840 
consistent get the best pin carry leave
easier<00:02:38.480> spares<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.080> convert<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.800> all<00:02:40.580> that
