00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.990
 280 rt in chemistry she 280 normal so 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.539
 for now I have that one because 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.369
 that simply the other I do not have 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.650

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.970
 small bug on the sites with the con on can 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.400
 download a word of all three 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.859
 hours so that's just ion you can 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.460
 see that it is very well honed click 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.340
 you start you turn on the console 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.380
 greenstar rely on the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.880
 control that is near the little ones 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.670
 keyboards you can reverse walk 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.680
 forward reverse 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.489
 it's really very well done after which 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.080
 the turn signals then work the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.360
 lights it's a just crazy thing 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.450
 lighting 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.079
 then after we can assemble the wheels 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.270

 cadets world xi and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.670
 then on buttons will it go back 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.510
 because 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.510
 going 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.160

 we see the fan running and where 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.010
 finally it's just too well done 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.850
 but it's just great that stuff 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.110

 the league died of green star it is 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.380
 already light on the road we can really 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.040
 do it all manually 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.500
 act iv stronghold mashiro strong 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.130
 finally he's just 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.130
 merchant lachaud 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.190
 tractors 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.640
 inside the counters run 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.500
 past 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.890
 dynamic and that they are really very 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.000
 funny 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.069

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.569
 tractors 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.270
 it's really going to be detractors with the 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.110
 wages 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.870
 serve in 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.130
 behind to undergo 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.770
 gold die 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.579

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.419

 all the buttons are clear and all that 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.229
 but it's just after we see going 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.760
 the pressure and all this mess 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.520
 finally it's really very very very good
