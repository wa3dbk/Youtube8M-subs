00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
prayer time this definitely reminded me

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.970 
prayer time this definitely reminded me
of<00:02:47.230> making<00:02:47.500> literally<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> motion<00:02:48.970> picture<00:02:49.390> and

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
of making literally a motion picture and

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.000 
of making literally a motion picture and
and<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.459> it's<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.480> very<00:02:53.349> beautiful<00:02:53.980> very

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
and that it's like very beautiful very

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.100 
and that it's like very beautiful very
clear<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.630> think<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.049> a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
clear and and I think that it's a

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.569 
clear and and I think that it's a
wonderful<00:02:56.440> aspect<00:02:56.829> that<00:02:56.920> they<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.370> they've

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
wonderful aspect that they that they've

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.460 
wonderful aspect that they that they've
added<00:02:57.849> to<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.060> video<00:02:58.269> game<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.840> basics<00:02:59.319> of

added to the video game the basics of

added to the video game the basics of
motion<00:03:00.010> capture<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.760> we<00:03:01.420> have<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.780> series

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
motion capture is that we have a series

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.110 
motion capture is that we have a series
of<00:03:02.260> cameras<00:03:02.709> placed<00:03:02.980> around<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.459> room<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.030> they

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
records movement and we cover the actors

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.650

with<00:03:14.769> all<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.040> these<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.430> we<00:03:16.090> can<00:03:16.269> tell<00:03:16.450> where

performance capture comes in is similar

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.410 
performance capture comes in is similar
but<00:03:24.910> on<00:03:25.030> a<00:03:25.150> far<00:03:25.359> more<00:03:25.600> subtle<00:03:26.470> level<00:03:26.769> we<00:03:27.430> had<00:03:28.180> a

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
but on a far more subtle level we had a

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.879 
but on a far more subtle level we had a
helmet-mounted<00:03:28.720> camera<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.500> use<00:03:29.650> that<00:03:29.680> as

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
helmet-mounted camera and use that as

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.530 
helmet-mounted camera and use that as
reference<00:03:30.370> for<00:03:30.430> key<00:03:30.700> framing<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.299> have<00:03:31.420> to

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
reference for key framing you have to

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.270 
reference for key framing you have to
mark<00:03:31.750> her<00:03:31.840> up<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.079> face<00:03:32.319> there's<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.099> lot<00:03:33.250> of

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
mark her up to face there's a lot of

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.759 
mark her up to face there's a lot of
micro<00:03:33.700> movements<00:03:33.849> that<00:03:34.209> get<00:03:34.420> captured<00:03:34.769> and

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
micro movements that get captured and

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.650 
micro movements that get captured and
that<00:03:35.950> goes<00:03:36.130> through<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> similar<00:03:36.819> process<00:03:36.970> but

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
that goes through a similar process but

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.440 
that goes through a similar process but
it's<00:03:38.260> usually<00:03:38.530> requires<00:03:39.160> far<00:03:39.760> more<00:03:39.819> cameras

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
it's usually requires far more cameras

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.539 
it's usually requires far more cameras
to<00:03:40.840> pick<00:03:40.870> up<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.410> smaller<00:03:41.680> dots<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.489> the

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
to pick up the smaller dots and the

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.819 
to pick up the smaller dots and the
smaller<00:03:43.269> ranges<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:43.810> movement<00:03:44.169> also<00:03:44.500> with

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
smaller ranges of movement also with

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.729 
smaller ranges of movement also with
ours<00:03:45.069> it<00:03:45.400> required<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:46.180> soundproof<00:03:46.870> studio<00:03:47.380> its

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
ours it required a soundproof studio its

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.770 
ours it required a soundproof studio its
giant<00:03:48.160> head<00:03:48.340> where<00:03:48.579> we<00:03:48.730> shot<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:49.510> we<00:03:49.630> could

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
giant head where we shot so we could

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.409 
giant head where we shot so we could
have<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:51.040> actors<00:03:51.400> voices<00:03:51.430> synced<00:03:52.269> up<00:03:52.359> with

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
have the actors voices synced up with

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.059 
have the actors voices synced up with
their<00:03:52.690> movement<00:03:53.139> and<00:03:53.380> just<00:03:53.650> get<00:03:53.799> a<00:03:53.829> more

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
their movement and just get a more

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.530 
their movement and just get a more
believable<00:03:54.370> performance<00:03:55.150> out<00:03:55.269> of<00:03:55.299> them<00:03:55.450> that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
believable performance out of them that

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.270 
believable performance out of them that
was<00:03:55.660> really<00:03:55.900> important<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.319> us<00:03:56.410> well<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.069> was

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
was really important to us well I was

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.699 
was really important to us well I was

the<00:04:00.099> most<00:04:00.310> natural<00:04:00.700> performance<00:04:01.269> an<00:04:01.419> actor

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
the most natural performance an actor

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.030 
the most natural performance an actor

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
technology that you're pretending is not

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.320 
technology that you're pretending is not
there<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.930> it's<00:04:56.290> a<00:04:56.380> whole<00:04:56.560> other<00:04:56.590> thing<00:04:57.330> it

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
there so it's a whole other thing it

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.750 
there so it's a whole other thing it
takes<00:04:58.570> some<00:04:58.750> adjusting<00:04:59.230> to<00:04:59.380> get<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.770> example

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
takes some adjusting to get to example

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.650 
takes some adjusting to get to example
just<00:05:00.970> a<00:05:01.030> simple<00:05:01.389> thing<00:05:01.600> like<00:05:03.240> see<00:05:04.240> this<00:05:04.419> thing

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
just a simple thing like see this thing

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.000 
just a simple thing like see this thing
right<00:05:04.870> in<00:05:04.990> front<00:05:05.110> of<00:05:05.200> your<00:05:05.260> face<00:05:05.320> it's<00:05:05.800> very

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
right in front of your face it's very

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.680 
right in front of your face it's very
hard<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.250> focus<00:05:06.520> on<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.060> other<00:05:07.210> actor<00:05:07.630> if

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
hard to focus on the other actor if

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.120 
hard to focus on the other actor if
that's<00:05:07.900> there<00:05:08.139> and<00:05:08.380> like<00:05:08.530> this<00:05:08.800> character

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
that's there and like this character

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.180 
that's there and like this character
smokes<00:05:09.840> so<00:05:10.840> just<00:05:11.139> technically<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:11.919> can't

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
smokes so just technically you can't

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.530 
smokes so just technically you can't
bring<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.430> cigarette<00:05:12.820> up<00:05:13.000> because<00:05:13.150> you<00:05:13.240> smack

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
bring a cigarette up because you smack

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.940 
bring a cigarette up because you smack
into<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:13.900> camera<00:05:14.169> so<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.440> have<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:14.650> find<00:05:14.860> a

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
into that camera so you have to find a

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.320 
into that camera so you have to find a
way<00:05:14.979> that<00:05:15.220> looks<00:05:15.370> cool<00:05:15.639> and<00:05:15.820> goes<00:05:15.970> in<00:05:16.180> there

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
way that looks cool and goes in there

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.770 
way that looks cool and goes in there
and<00:05:16.450> does<00:05:16.600> it<00:05:17.280> so<00:05:18.280> it<00:05:18.400> was<00:05:18.520> challenging<00:05:18.820> the

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
and does it so it was challenging the

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.240 
and does it so it was challenging the
axis<00:05:20.080> did<00:05:20.260> have<00:05:20.410> a<00:05:20.440> lot<00:05:20.590> of<00:05:20.620> good<00:05:20.740> suggestions

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
axis did have a lot of good suggestions

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.219 
axis did have a lot of good suggestions
and<00:05:21.820> they<00:05:22.030> would<00:05:22.180> say<00:05:22.210> this<00:05:22.630> feels<00:05:22.870> like<00:05:22.990> out

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
and they would say this feels like out

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.840 
and they would say this feels like out
of<00:05:23.350> character<00:05:23.770> and<00:05:23.860> we've<00:05:24.220> like<00:05:24.400> that's<00:05:24.639> true

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
of character and we've like that's true
