00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
120 I like South Carolina in this spot

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.899 
120 I like South Carolina in this spot
and<00:00:29.749> usually<00:00:30.410> I<00:00:30.890> would<00:00:31.009> look<00:00:31.310> to<00:00:31.460> fade<00:00:31.730> them

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:31.909 
and usually I would look to fade them

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.300 
and usually I would look to fade them
because<00:00:32.810> here's<00:00:32.960> a<00:00:33.020> team<00:00:33.290> that's<00:00:33.530> coming<00:00:33.800> off

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
a tough schedule you played Georgia blew

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.439 
a tough schedule you played Georgia blew
them<00:00:36.949> away<00:00:37.000> then<00:00:38.000> you<00:00:38.090> went<00:00:38.270> to<00:00:38.420> LSU<00:00:39.129> lost

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
them away then you went to LSU lost

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.090 
them away then you went to LSU lost
extremely<00:00:41.449> tight<00:00:41.750> game<00:00:41.989> really<00:00:42.559> tough<00:00:42.829> game

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
extremely tight game really tough game

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.849 
extremely tight game really tough game
and<00:00:43.579> now<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:43.789> got<00:00:43.969> to<00:00:44.059> go<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.149> Florida<00:00:44.590> but<00:00:45.590> I

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
and now I got to go to Florida but I

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:47.889 
and now I got to go to Florida but I
think<00:00:46.670> South<00:00:46.850> Carolina's<00:00:47.329> gonna<00:00:47.480> be<00:00:47.570> up<00:00:47.690> for

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
think South Carolina's gonna be up for

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.240 
think South Carolina's gonna be up for
this<00:00:47.960> game<00:00:48.230> I<00:00:48.469> don't<00:00:48.890> think<00:00:48.920> it's<00:00:49.100> gonna<00:00:49.190> be

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
this game I don't think it's gonna be

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.279 
this game I don't think it's gonna be
too<00:00:49.489> difficult<00:00:49.730> for<00:00:50.000> them<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.269> get<00:00:50.780> up<00:00:50.989> for

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
too difficult for them to get up for

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.170 
too difficult for them to get up for
this<00:00:51.350> game<00:00:51.620> there's<00:00:52.160> six<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:52.609> one<00:00:52.760> right<00:00:53.000> now

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
this game there's six and one right now

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.389 
this game there's six and one right now
and<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:53.449> got<00:00:53.570> two<00:00:53.780> teams<00:00:54.050> that<00:00:54.320> been<00:00:54.949> covering

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
and you got two teams that been covering

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.840 
and you got two teams that been covering
machines<00:00:56.000> all<00:00:56.420> season<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:57.530> I<00:00:58.460> think<00:00:58.670> there's

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
machines all season and I think there's

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.340 
machines all season and I think there's
some<00:00:59.030> value<00:00:59.210> with<00:00:59.539> South<00:00:59.719> Carolina<00:01:00.140> because

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
some value with South Carolina because

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.099 
some value with South Carolina because
of<00:01:00.739> how<00:01:00.859> one-dimensional<00:01:01.760> Florida<00:01:02.239> is<00:01:02.420> when

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
of how one-dimensional Florida is when

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.530 
of how one-dimensional Florida is when
you<00:01:03.260> can't<00:01:03.589> throw<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.129> football<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.940> you're

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
you can't throw the football and you're

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.180 
you can't throw the football and you're
playing<00:01:05.780> against<00:01:06.020> one<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.230> the<00:01:06.350> best<00:01:06.380> defenses

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
playing against one of the best defenses

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.550 
playing against one of the best defenses
in<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.370> country<00:01:07.540> there's<00:01:08.540> no<00:01:08.900> room<00:01:09.200> for<00:01:09.410> error

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
in the country there's no room for error

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.580 
in the country there's no room for error
and<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.550> think<00:01:10.820> that's<00:01:11.120> the<00:01:11.270> weakness<00:01:11.930> with

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
and I think that's the weakness with

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.440 
and I think that's the weakness with
Florida<00:01:13.250> here<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.700> that's<00:01:13.820> where<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.000> give<00:01:14.300> the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
Florida here and that's where I give the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.210 
Florida here and that's where I give the
advantage<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.960> South<00:01:15.230> Carolina<00:01:15.440> yes<00:01:15.980> their

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
advantage to South Carolina yes their

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.420 
advantage to South Carolina yes their
offense<00:01:16.670> isn't<00:01:17.180> spectacular<00:01:17.800> by<00:01:18.800> any<00:01:19.100> means

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
offense isn't spectacular by any means

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.700 
offense isn't spectacular by any means
but<00:01:20.270> at<00:01:20.420> least<00:01:20.570> they're<00:01:20.870> balanced<00:01:21.560> it's

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
but at least they're balanced it's

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.100 
but at least they're balanced it's
harder<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.070> prepare<00:01:22.580> for<00:01:22.880> they<00:01:23.510> may<00:01:23.660> be<00:01:23.720> poor

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
harder to prepare for they may be poor

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.080 
harder to prepare for they may be poor
running<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.650> pull<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.070> poor<00:01:25.520> passing<00:01:26.000> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
running to pull and poor passing the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.630 
running to pull and poor passing the
balls<00:01:26.270> far<00:01:26.570> stats<00:01:27.140> go<00:01:27.500> but<00:01:28.130> I<00:01:28.160> think<00:01:28.250> they<00:01:28.550> have

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
balls far stats go but I think they have

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.790 
balls far stats go but I think they have
more<00:01:28.940> guys<00:01:29.330> at<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.660> skill<00:01:30.020> positions<00:01:30.050> that

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
more guys at the skill positions that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.890 
more guys at the skill positions that
could<00:01:30.980> get<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.250> done<00:01:31.460> we're<00:01:32.030> with<00:01:32.150> Florida<00:01:32.720> you

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
could get it done we're with Florida you

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.600 
could get it done we're with Florida you
know<00:01:32.930> Driscoll's<00:01:33.680> not<00:01:33.860> going<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.160> light<00:01:34.370> it<00:01:34.400> up

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
know Driscoll's not going to light it up

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.330 
know Driscoll's not going to light it up
you<00:01:35.000> got<00:01:35.300> to<00:01:35.480> stop<00:01:35.660> Calissa<00:01:36.140> Lee<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.860> do<00:01:37.070> that

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
you got to stop Calissa Lee you do that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.600

against I think we all had LSU in that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.280 
against I think we all had LSU in that

Jadeveon<00:03:05.180> Clowney<00:03:05.209> I<00:03:05.600> mean<00:03:05.780> this<00:03:05.900> kid<00:03:06.140> is

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
Jadeveon Clowney I mean this kid is

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.740 
Jadeveon Clowney I mean this kid is
awesome<00:03:07.069> there's<00:03:07.489> a<00:03:07.640> run-stopper<00:03:08.090> he<00:03:08.360> rushes

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.410 
awesome there's a run-stopper he rushes
the<00:03:08.840> passer<00:03:09.050> maybe<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.040> best<00:03:10.220> athlete<00:03:11.180> on<00:03:11.360> the

the passer maybe the best athlete on the
field<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.019> I<00:03:12.230> think<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.650> may<00:03:13.400> tip<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.880> skills

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
I think it's gonna be a hard fought game

I think it's gonna be a hard fought game
let's<00:03:15.980> not<00:03:16.069> forget<00:03:16.519> when<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.030> look<00:03:17.420> at<00:03:17.540> the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
let's not forget when you look at the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.920 
let's not forget when you look at the
LSU<00:03:18.110> game<00:03:18.250> South<00:03:19.250> Carolina<00:03:19.700> got<00:03:19.940> destroyed<00:03:20.600> if

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
LSU game South Carolina got destroyed if

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.140 
LSU game South Carolina got destroyed if
you<00:03:21.200> just<00:03:21.230> looked<00:03:21.709> at<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:21.920> box<00:03:22.130> score<00:03:22.280> you
