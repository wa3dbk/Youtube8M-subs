or whatever your requirement is so we'll

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.140 
or whatever your requirement is so we'll
take<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:27.750> ticklers<00:02:28.750> across<00:02:29.050> there<00:02:29.350> like<00:02:29.800> that

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
take the ticklers across there like that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.490 
take the ticklers across there like that
let's<00:02:31.150> make<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.690> it's<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.290> fits

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
let's make that so it's so it fits

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.400 
let's make that so it's so it fits
within<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:33.300> within<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.450> screen<00:02:37.200> okay<00:02:38.200> we've

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410

drawn

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.840 

and<00:03:02.710> we<00:03:02.800> just<00:03:03.010> placed<00:03:03.220> somewhere<00:03:03.460> we<00:03:03.700> need

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
and we just placed somewhere we need

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.430 
and we just placed somewhere we need
them<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.210> be

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.350 

just<00:03:10.130> spread<00:03:10.340> them<00:03:10.460> around<00:03:10.550> just<00:03:10.910> for<00:03:11.030> now<00:03:11.150> so

just spread them around just for now so

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.420 
just spread them around just for now so
we've<00:03:11.480> got<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.690> little<00:03:11.840> bit<00:03:12.080> of<00:03:12.170> room<00:03:12.320> to<00:03:12.560> decide

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
we've got a little bit of room to decide

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.820 
we've got a little bit of room to decide

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
where we want to put them so we can put

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:24.210 
where we want to put them so we can put
the<00:03:15.920> tape

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.300 

and<00:03:24.730> also<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.570> instruments<00:03:26.530> show<00:03:26.710> you<00:03:27.130> can

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
and also the instruments show you can

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.740 
and also the instruments show you can
turn<00:03:27.520> them<00:03:27.700> into<00:03:27.820> more<00:03:28.060> than<00:03:28.240> one<00:03:28.390> instrument

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
turn them into more than one instrument

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.790 
turn them into more than one instrument
you<00:03:29.290> can<00:03:29.470> actually<00:03:30.060> quite<00:03:31.060> simply<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:32.620> click

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
you can actually quite simply just click

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.500 
you can actually quite simply just click
on<00:03:33.150> for<00:03:34.150> example<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:36.160> n1<00:03:36.490> gauge<00:03:36.760> click<00:03:37.330> on

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
on for example the the n1 gauge click on

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.770 
on for example the the n1 gauge click on
settings<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.340> can<00:03:39.550> make<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:40.090> can<00:03:40.300> we<00:03:40.420> put

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
settings so I can make this I can we put

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.380 
settings so I can make this I can we put
up<00:03:40.900> three<00:03:41.140> gauges<00:03:41.680> from<00:03:41.950> one<00:03:42.190> gauge<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:43.150> make

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
up three gauges from one gauge and make

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.140 
up three gauges from one gauge and make
them<00:03:43.540> one<00:03:43.690> two<00:03:43.840> four<00:03:44.080> I<00:03:46.200> just<00:03:47.200> cancel<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.710> now

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
them one two four I just cancel that now

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.150 
them one two four I just cancel that now
now<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.300> is<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.630> add-on<00:03:49.840> efis<00:03:50.590> construction

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
instruments as well so you can you can

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.630 
instruments as well so you can you can
basically<00:04:01.510> add<00:04:02.230> whatever<00:04:02.800> you<00:04:02.950> need<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.370> to

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
basically add whatever you need to to

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.790 
basically add whatever you need to to
make<00:04:03.670> your<00:04:04.000> add<00:04:04.240> cockpit<00:04:04.750> now<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:05.320> gist<00:04:05.590> of<00:04:05.710> it

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
make your add cockpit now the gist of it

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.880 
make your add cockpit now the gist of it
is<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.190> may<00:04:06.340> feel<00:04:06.610> that<00:04:06.640> that<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.030> too<00:04:07.360> small

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
is you may feel that that is too small

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.560 
is you may feel that that is too small
so<00:04:08.890> we<00:04:09.130> just<00:04:09.310> make<00:04:09.490> it<00:04:09.640> bit<00:04:09.850> we<00:04:10.060> make<00:04:10.240> it<00:04:10.390> bigger

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
so we just make it bit we make it bigger

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.640 
so we just make it bit we make it bigger
move<00:04:11.320> it<00:04:11.470> up<00:04:11.620> make<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.400> a<00:04:12.460> bit<00:04:12.610> bigger<00:04:13.530> make<00:04:14.530> the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
move it up make it a bit bigger make the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:23.020 
move it up make it a bit bigger make the
tape<00:04:14.890> on<00:04:15.520> the<00:04:15.670> side<00:04:15.880> bigger<00:04:17.040> place<00:04:18.040> it

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:46.400 

okay

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.420 

so<00:04:47.040> you<00:04:47.100> can<00:04:47.340> see<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:48.000> is<00:04:48.210> literally<00:04:48.750> a

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
so you can see it is literally a

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.380 
so you can see it is literally a
construction<00:04:50.430> kit<00:04:52.220> you<00:04:53.220> make<00:04:53.430> it<00:04:54.090> will<00:04:54.210> work

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
construction kit you make it will work

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.740 
construction kit you make it will work
with<00:04:54.600> any<00:04:54.780> aircraft<00:04:56.120> with<00:04:57.120> Microsoft<00:04:57.630> Flight

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
with any aircraft with Microsoft Flight

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.000 
with any aircraft with Microsoft Flight
Simulator<00:04:58.080> or<00:04:58.650> X<00:04:59.070> plane<00:05:00.680> depending<00:05:01.680> on<00:05:01.890> which

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
Simulator or X plane depending on which

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.950 
Simulator or X plane depending on which
version<00:05:02.040> you've<00:05:02.700> actually<00:05:02.940> chosen<00:05:03.510> we'll

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
version you've actually chosen we'll

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.380 
version you've actually chosen we'll
make<00:05:04.140> that<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:04.560> it's<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:04.880> decent<00:05:05.880> size<00:05:05.940> so<00:05:06.270> that

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
make that so it's a decent size so that

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.110 
make that so it's a decent size so that
we<00:05:06.450> can<00:05:06.600> see<00:05:06.840> it<00:05:08.870> now<00:05:09.870> in<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.110> background<00:05:11.000> if<00:05:12.000> I

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
we can see it now in the background if I

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.210 
we can see it now in the background if I
just<00:05:12.390> said<00:05:12.630> if<00:05:12.870> I<00:05:13.050> just<00:05:13.290> minimize<00:05:13.710> this<00:05:13.740> say<00:05:14.190> I

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
just said if I just minimize this say I

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.820 
just said if I just minimize this say I
just<00:05:14.340> move<00:05:14.700> these<00:05:15.150> so<00:05:15.300> I<00:05:15.360> can<00:05:15.390> see<00:05:15.690> that<00:05:15.830> the

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
just move these so I can see that the

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.370 
just move these so I can see that the
taskbar

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.050 

okay<00:05:24.380> there's<00:05:24.560> a<00:05:24.650> taskbar<00:05:25.070> we<00:05:25.370> can<00:05:25.520> we<00:05:25.880> can

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
okay there's a taskbar we can we can

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:33.180 
okay there's a taskbar we can we can
bring<00:05:26.240> up<00:05:26.390> the<00:05:26.660> X<00:05:27.170> play<00:05:27.940> in<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.060> background

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:45.100 

and<00:05:34.190> you<00:05:34.250> can<00:05:34.460> see

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:06:00.540 

the<00:05:46.110> worse

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:15.270 

you're<00:06:01.000> very<00:06:01.360> slow<00:06:01.990> yes<00:06:02.830> I've<00:06:03.190> got<00:06:03.340> yes
