00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.750
 The reason I wanted to work at Obvion is that it is a small company. 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.410
 A true specialist; a specialist who is very good at what she is doing and that is .. 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.630
 providing mortgages to customers and that with a very nice team 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.839
 to do. 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.269
 A small organization but big enough to be able to put really beautiful things on the market 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:33.530
 put. 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.810
 Responsible financing of housing needs, that is our mission. 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.900
 It contains two elements. One is living need, that has to do with the customer 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.140
 customer needs. 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.060
 That is very important. 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.470
 The other part is responsible finance. 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.000
 That is typically something in our genes. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.030
 And which is also one of the major success factors for Obvion. 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.310
 This combination between responsible and .. 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.210
 look at the customer. 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.970
 Obvion has set itself the goal of making and keeping housing accessible. 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.870
 The living space is a very important place for our customers. 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.390
 For some, that is something he has dreamed of for a long time; a place with his family 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.770
 to live together or 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.400
 all sorts of ambitions underlie this. 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.980
 We want to make that possible, but we also want it to fit in well 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.520
 the future. 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.500
 That is what everyone at Obvion is doing all day long. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.960
 My first working day was really whole 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.990
 ... came across as very special. 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.800
 Because a group of employees was immediately on hand 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.109
 who were going to guide us 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.840
 from A to Z everything was discussed with you 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.590
 That is something I have never experienced in other places. 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.070
 At first I like it 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.460
 that when people come they are indeed at home 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.800
 to feel; feel at home within the Obvion family 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.840
 After that it is of course important that they matter 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.310
 pick it up and they don't 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.360
 be afraid 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.000
 to ask things. 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.410
 What I find very important within this company is that we don't 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.820
 just be prepared to do our own thing. 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.550
 That you are not only prepared for your own position 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.429
 perfect to perform, but that you do that together. And each other very hard there 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.559
 in need. 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.259
 But the challenge is also to push boundaries. 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.579
 We do not want employees to just follow the manual 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.429
 because it is in the manual or follow a rule 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:22.299
 because it is simply a rule. 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.489
 What we want is that they comply with legislation and regulations. 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.939
 And acting within the space that exists, thinking from the customer's perspective. 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.739
 And if that means you're looking for each other 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.000
 and that you are going to put matters up for discussion, you should do so. 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:36.859
 So that's an invitation that we 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.979
 at the moment you start here, give it already. 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:43.729
 I think you should look at Obvion as a company where you 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.309
 get plenty of opportunities to develop yourself. 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.039
 In which the necessary is also asked of you 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.759
 professionalism and commitment, but 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.039
 if you show it 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.359
 that a possibility opens up for you. 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.909
 What I really like about the job I have, because I don't want it 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:58.989
 call function. 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.409
 The job that I have is that I feel that I am mostly broad 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.669
 have a job. 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.039
 I see a lot from my MT role 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.769
 I think that is very beautiful. 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.559
 But that I can also make those links. Between what are we now set up as a company and how do we ensure now 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.819
 sure that it will actually happen. 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.969
 At Obvion, we want to attract talent to us 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.539
 so people with passion 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:22.459
 and drive who are good at something who want 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.229
 we like to win for us. 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:30.000
 And we invest in our employees through training, once an internship somewhere and when we see real talents 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.349
 then those people also get the opportunity to take other steps within the company. 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.019
 It is definitely the nicest employer I have ever had 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.500
 also an employer 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.209
 and that is of course the bottom line 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.439
 true result 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.149
 and people orientation very strong 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:48.189
 go together. 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.429
 It is not a contradiction 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.959
 Of course that is sometimes exciting, but 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.000
 result orientation and people orientation go very well together within Obvion.
