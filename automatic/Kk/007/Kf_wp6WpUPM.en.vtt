00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:40.370 

now<00:02:23.530> that's<00:02:24.310> what<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.640> call<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.300> spy

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.390 

before<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.470> do<00:02:41.560> anything<00:02:41.800> rash

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
I think it's know that I have the cipher

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.990 
I think it's know that I have the cipher
hand<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.410> over<00:02:44.530> right<00:02:44.740> now<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.760> think<00:02:45.940> we

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
hand it over right now so you think we

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.970 
hand it over right now so you think we
should<00:02:46.030> discuss<00:02:46.360> terms<00:02:46.690> first<00:02:47.080> what<00:02:47.590> happened

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980

ultimately<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.860> this<00:04:20.490> was<00:04:20.610> a<00:04:20.640> choice<00:04:20.910> that<00:04:20.940> I

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
ultimately and this was a choice that I

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.300 
ultimately and this was a choice that I
made<00:04:21.390> when<00:04:21.720> we<00:04:21.810> shot<00:04:21.990> the<00:04:22.080> pilot<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:23.160> so

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
made when we shot the pilot and so

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.530 
made when we shot the pilot and so
therefore<00:04:23.490> I've<00:04:23.730> had<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:23.940> commit<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.390> ever

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
therefore I've had to commit to it ever

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.210 
therefore I've had to commit to it ever
since<00:04:24.690> then<00:04:24.900> but<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:25.620> face<00:04:25.800> that<00:04:25.980> I<00:04:26.040> make

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
since then but that face that I make

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.940 
since then but that face that I make
when<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:26.940> look<00:04:27.150> like<00:04:27.360> I'm<00:04:27.810> it's<00:04:28.470> kind<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.770> it's

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
when I look like I'm it's kind of it's

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.100 
when I look like I'm it's kind of it's
it's<00:04:29.130> it's<00:04:29.490> like<00:04:29.610> it's<00:04:30.000> nausea<00:04:30.810> means

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
it's it's like it's nausea means

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.760 
it's it's like it's nausea means
constipation<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:32.490> look<00:04:33.360> is<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:34.200> it's<00:04:34.650> the

constipation that look is the it's the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.500 
constipation that look is the it's the
flash<00:04:34.980> look<00:04:35.250> hopefully<00:04:35.940> I<00:04:36.120> won't

I won't look so constipated in the

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.600 
I won't look so constipated in the
future<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:39.470> that's<00:04:40.470> when<00:04:40.740> I<00:04:40.770> see<00:04:41.160> something

update of this new intersect computer so

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.770 
update of this new intersect computer so
they<00:05:53.130> put<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.400> cipher<00:05:53.700> into<00:05:53.820> the<00:05:54.000> computer<00:05:54.360> it

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
they put the cipher into the computer it

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.630 
they put the cipher into the computer it
drops<00:05:55.110> down<00:05:55.320> into<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:55.740> console<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:56.490> the

drops down into the console and the

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.250 
drops down into the console and the
computer<00:05:56.970> begins<00:05:57.210> deactivate<00:05:57.810> but<00:05:58.140> we

computer begins deactivate but we

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.470 
computer begins deactivate but we

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
realizes is that the cipher is a Trojan

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.630 
realizes is that the cipher is a Trojan

causes the computer to explode intersect

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.830 
causes the computer to explode intersect
two<00:06:05.220> we<00:06:05.610> realize<00:06:06.060> that<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.360> government<00:06:06.690> has

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
two we realize that the government has

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.630 
two we realize that the government has
