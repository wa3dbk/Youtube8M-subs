00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
been progressing through all the guns

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.020 
been progressing through all the guns
right<00:01:52.049> now<00:01:52.200> right<00:01:52.439> now<00:01:52.470> I'm<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> sniper<00:01:53.130> um

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
I really don't like what they've done

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.560 
I really don't like what they've done
the<00:01:55.619> snipers<00:01:56.100> as<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.880> see<00:01:57.149> whenever<00:01:57.390> i

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the snipers as you can see whenever i

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.969 
the snipers as you can see whenever i
zoom<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.140> does<00:01:58.259> kind<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.619> little<00:01:58.710> like

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
zoom in it does kind of a little like

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.260 
zoom in it does kind of a little like
totally<00:01:59.909> do<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:01.020> an<00:02:01.890> offset<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.610> treyarch

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
totally do it's an offset that treyarch

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.039 
totally do it's an offset that treyarch
did<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:04.140> nerf<00:02:04.500> quick<00:02:04.799> scoping<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:06.049> actually

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
did to nerf quick scoping and actually

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.290 
did to nerf quick scoping and actually
I'm<00:02:07.560> really<00:02:07.860> bummed<00:02:08.009> out<00:02:08.190> about<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.520> because<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
I'm really bummed out about it because I

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.839 
I'm really bummed out about it because I
feel<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.810> doesn't<00:02:09.929> really<00:02:10.700> address<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
feel like it doesn't really address the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.530 
feel like it doesn't really address the
issue

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
issue

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.179 
issue
people<00:02:12.750> who<00:02:12.810> go<00:02:12.959> around<00:02:13.079> no<00:02:13.409> scoping<00:02:13.860> but<00:02:14.069> it

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
people who go around no scoping but it

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:15.350 
people who go around no scoping but it
does<00:02:14.340> make<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.640> harder<00:02:14.939> for<00:02:14.969> people<00:02:15.209> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
does make it harder for people to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.750 
does make it harder for people to
succeed<00:02:15.569> with<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> sniper<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:17.219> addition<00:02:17.340> to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
succeed with a sniper and in addition to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.250 
succeed with a sniper and in addition to
just<00:02:17.939> you<00:02:18.299> know<00:02:18.329> not<00:02:18.540> being<00:02:18.750> able<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.019> succeed

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
just you know not being able to succeed

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.670 
just you know not being able to succeed
because<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:21.180> actual<00:02:21.329> scoping<00:02:22.079> in<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.409> so

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
because the the actual scoping in is so

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.179 
because the the actual scoping in is so
much<00:02:22.859> stranger<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:25.079> map<00:02:25.230> design<00:02:25.469> just

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
much stranger it's the map design just

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.740 
much stranger it's the map design just
doesn't<00:02:26.549> have<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.700> many<00:02:26.969> long<00:02:27.450> line<00:02:27.719> of

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
doesn't have that many long line of

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.229 
doesn't have that many long line of
sites<00:02:28.140> for<00:02:28.439> people<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.950> even<00:02:29.670> line<00:02:30.000> up<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.209> shot

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
sites for people to even line up a shot

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.539 
sites for people to even line up a shot
in<00:02:30.659> the<00:02:30.780> first<00:02:30.930> place<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.470> mean<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.370> map

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
in the first place I mean on this map

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.069 
in the first place I mean on this map
there<00:02:32.790> are<00:02:32.909> a<00:02:32.939> couple<00:02:33.150> i<00:02:33.450> know<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:33.989> the

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
there are a couple i know that on the

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.410 
there are a couple i know that on the
other<00:02:34.200> side<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.829> can<00:02:34.980> actually<00:02:35.430> go<00:02:36.090> up<00:02:36.120> to

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
other side you can actually go up to

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.750 
other side you can actually go up to
basically<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.870> top<00:02:37.079> of<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.290> map<00:02:37.470> but<00:02:37.980> um<00:02:38.340> in

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
basically the top of the map but um in

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.809 
basically the top of the map but um in
most<00:02:39.689> i<00:02:40.170> mean<00:02:40.439> take<00:02:40.829> nuketown<00:02:41.280> for<00:02:41.459> example

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
most i mean take nuketown for example

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.399 
most i mean take nuketown for example
there's<00:02:41.969> no<00:02:42.209> way<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.569> hell<00:02:42.689> you<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:42.959> snipe<00:02:43.170> on

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
there's no way in hell you can snipe on

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.369 
there's no way in hell you can snipe on
a<00:02:43.439> map<00:02:43.680> like<00:02:43.829> nuketown<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.870> one<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.079> one

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
a map like nuketown and one of the one

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.690 
a map like nuketown and one of the one
of<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.500> biggest<00:02:46.739> things<00:02:47.069> about<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.430> game<00:02:47.670> is

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
of the biggest things about this game is

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.610 
of the biggest things about this game is
the<00:02:48.000> focus<00:02:48.389> on<00:02:48.540> how<00:02:48.750> many<00:02:48.900> points<00:02:49.139> you<00:02:49.349> get<00:02:49.470> per

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
the focus on how many points you get per
