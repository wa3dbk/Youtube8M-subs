00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.110
 Hello dear friends this 

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:10.490
 berry business otliz from want you 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 tell of Bezus th strawberries 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:18.530
 which is propagated by seeds well 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.160
 slightly revive and roots climb only 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:27.830
 slugs will sit here this seedling 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.099
 I want to show up already on the berry 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.690
 how are the stages in the production of such 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.079
 a seedling such a seedling is already possible 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.020
 plant on drip irrigation on 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.540
 permanent seedlings 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.600
 grow more or less equal to vepa as if 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.470
 This is the first strawberry growing experience. 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.290
 from seeds and more less it turned out 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.530
 successful i mean i want to show you all 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.020
 stages this is the final stage final 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.299
 seedling for a permanent place here 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.159
 see 10 10 sleeve plenochka 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:12.870
 usually forest land 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:18.350
 once under the oaks grows well that is 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.530
 we are just digging 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.560
 trench 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.360
 set not and deployed flew on 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.150
 breaks we put a lump of earth 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.229
 sprinkle here is how she grew for the same 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.310
 depth and all that is the process of landing 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.020
 finished look and 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:45.909
 then first all the seeds were sown first 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:49.460
 Here peat drawers elephant never flew 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:53.530
 centimeters a layer of peat and just 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.500
 thickly and thickly with sand they sowed seeds 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:02.360
 mixed in such a box of five 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.829
 bags of seeds seeds good bags 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.310
 help that 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.690
 that something up to 200 seeds that is 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.410
 it turns out about a thousand 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.670
 on such a big seed box with 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.010
 sand mixed up here and so scattered 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.530
 then people from above took capri cowards 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.040
 traffic a little bit less important 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.120
 and even drier so that the light layer 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.670
 sprinkled zilch allochku and on top 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.330
 something covered so it was less 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.080
 evaporation is best such a box 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:44.330
 put here just such a canoe 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:48.489
 what's that guy called here 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:53.269
 foger and humidity is very good 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:57.440
 high and instant seeds germinate 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:01.069
 does not dry the top layer of soil then 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:06.349
 there is and there is an opportunity to do 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:10.190
 make such a greenhouse and the seeds will be 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.790
 sprout moment she then sprouted 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.940
 the seeds 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:19.010
 stand in the shade that is, under the mesh 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.629
 so as not to burn in the sun and quickly 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.410
 so here is the growth and then from here to we 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:31.250
 already take transplant or cassette 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.730
 as we did with this box or here 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.330
 such containers as we did there 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.760
 with another with other varieties 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.440
 that's all I wanted to tell strawberries 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.620
 from seeds 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.110
 when it starts fruiting will begin 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:53.680
 fruiting at the end of the summer I tell you 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.680
 I will tell you in more detail will remove all the good
