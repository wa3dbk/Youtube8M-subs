00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.320
 Maybe show that the game is cooking from all over the world market apparently 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.960
 is a tax-exempt version of the federal government, but from where he has further where 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:26.829
 Won Porsche Ferrari 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.970
 that does not mean it's in the game 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.489
 but often hardly 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.970
 al-bakkur's winners were the fugitive perpetrators making camera 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.260
 get over 2 500 dollars 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.429
 Basement run or quite serious cases but 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.199
 When registering, you can hardly do one directly just in a password 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.060
 who play the first laugh scooters over the world 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.660
 we see here already I have the games this weeks 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.390
 especially when I'm on the train 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
 and the outlines against on the turn the players started again 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.630
 The Gillespie reigns nations are dying of his dwelling 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.230
 and then have different now 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.440
 Words are in German 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.770
 and then one can demand of the other now the problem of him expressed 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.260
 had been 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
 he had to write and that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.470
 Percent times to see if there now the Ruhr sees the time but happens like it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.260
 was - how long 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.640
 a quick test shows you right now 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.050
 there you can play more in the cell 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.050
 and the word "can" blows here 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.710
 Rome 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.420
 the weather played played with the course 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.480
 which are becoming more and more different 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.170
 Fields The action is a steely with which you have to be caught 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.300
 otherwise we have here since you can such a 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.140
 twice, that is the federal government but twice counted 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.600
 The whole thing with three times and we have only there that is the word 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.920
 Value complete object level points 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.080
 my winnings wants open games I have her various open games 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.910
 July the orbiters then return posthumously that means I'm back on the train 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.759
 Umbach plays KOMCOM Nord points 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.569
 that destroys here 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.939
 nla-game against murder again enter my turn 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.939
 if Rome had played I could 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.959
 game 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.310
 And so it goes on and on you can if you want to play new game 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.339
 Players are running here 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:44.979
 what other open channel do or they just like these feeder players 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.449
 Flippers players questions image games 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.789
 there you can see different games that are open but not at all 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:54.099
 or just start making it possible to tell how long the time should be 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.609
 Player has to govern 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.609
 that is for you yourself you want to play relatively fast 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.299
 that his patience with the player just made sandwich 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.479
 Game Game 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.919
 they can only make beginners advanced and professionals 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:12.929
 otherwise we can very young players himself at the beginning very much 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.499
 very good but read the bit played and trained 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.159
 I'm very fond of playing around because you're just strikingly fast 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.769
 but does not play Germany differently 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.619
 Urs Wyss Friend Euro pleased 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:30.219
 Gold is just that if it is also easier to play than English 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.419
 yes German-speaking people 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.709
 viewed here at the game Smurf 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.499
 since a little more played and raussuchen again 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.679
 you see the medics I have here 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.699
 shown at 4:20 pm when next time to play 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.319
 If it says here you can choose in peace what you want 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:51.529
 If I am here in the game, Morf will look no further "neither the opponents nor 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.819
 one minute and 30 seconds each participant will take three minutes 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.819
 again piece was again that is the view can 

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:03.899
 Paloma Marcello Marcello Lippi 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.639
 easy 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.089
 on the one hand 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.899
 and then you can see it all here 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:13.249
 as you have been playing for weeks you can simply go out of play and Eitorf's 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.979
 Nation if the opponent in what makes that very nice but one again 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:17.879
 step further 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.190
 I like it very much 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.909
 the playing field more if I'm very good 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:25.039
 is similar high as you like though the seaside playing field 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.999
 make another mobile that would be happy to come on it is about 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.990
 the authors 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.830
 that's good too 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.400
 as I said, of course, ideological euro-donation cleaning as well as always 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.210
 on and on and on 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.980
 the next time
