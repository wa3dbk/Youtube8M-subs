00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 to a big fire in the marburger 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.910
 wallpaper factory probably one 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.519
 caused millions of dollars came 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.889
 on sunday around 11.40 in kirchheim im 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.750
 Marburg-Biedenkopf district of 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.000
 initially unresolved cause broke 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.190
 The fire in a cultivated hall 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.789
 in the expensive machinery among other things 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.859
 stand 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.600
 a senior employee agreed 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.300
 hessen news stand in the hall 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.220
 machines that cost partly millions 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.560
 especially bad it hit the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.420
 machine shop because a static had to 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.910
 realize that the building is massive 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.190
 Risk of collapse for the fire department 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.230
 a clear statement five meters 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.809
 safety distance and nobody enter 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.610
 he building strong heat development 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.710
 has now led to the statics 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.300
 of the building is impaired so that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.100
 a statician has said that now 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.570
 building is in acute danger of collapse 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.469
 So we have to piece together now 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.910
 to withdraw the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.280
 safety distance comply with our 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.989
 Refocus firefighting on it 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.780
 Investigations led by the police 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.780
 fast to a 21 year old man 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.300
 pour the nearby AmÃ¶neburg in 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.430
 an edeka market had broken in 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.710
 There he happened to be one by one 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.229
 broker discovered him holding him up 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.880
 The police arrived very quickly 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.770
 It turns out that the young man too 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.090
 something with the brand in the wallpaper factory 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.909
 must do 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.170
 a little later his confession came 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.659
 due to the strong smoke development 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.490
 and the very unfavorable wind direction 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.470
 the smoke moved in the direction of 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.140
 adjoining houses so that the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.530
 issue police radio alert 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.810
 had to 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.790
 However, after the fire department first 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.810
 measurements of the air had been made 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.970
 quickly clear 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.520
 the people have to be evacuated 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.140
 high carbon monoxide and hydrochloric acid shares 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.210
 The air was mixed in 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.439
 clear sign here must be immediately 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.869
 traded 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.759
 a total of eleven people had to be evacuated 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.220
 will be five more family members 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.410
 They were joined by the fire department 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.940
 The 16-member Turkish family goes 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.280
 the house directly opposite the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.380
 Brandobjektes was inhabited in the near 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.840
 for the time being 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.550
 housed around 11 o'clock fell the 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.070
 Residents on it suddenly dark 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.800
 was and dense smoke billowing at the house 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.840
 passed quickly panic came on the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.460
 the residents know only too well what 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.810
 everything is stored in the factory so how 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.970
 yes, let's say the first one 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.140
 been laying the company and of course 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.010
 panic maybe there too 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.220
 explosions 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.170
 thereby arise and of course one has 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.730
 fear 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.470
 So that's the wallpaper company 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.770
 that's all possible except paper yes 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.440
 there are also colors the poisonous whole 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.990
 pollutants so that was already are 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.910
 very bad family a year just came 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.160
 from the ski holiday home and had 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.230
 massive problems by the enormous 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.040
 Shut down your house at all 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.050
 to reach 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.390
 They have been living in it for 20 years now 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.700
 direct neighborhood have three fires 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.010
 they already experienced but they feel 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.720
 for sure 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.730
 We have been here for 20 years now 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.010
 it has three times already experienced it 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.840
 properly burned, there is springle 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.310
 from time to time but it is a good thing 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.900
 Let's get there very fast and think 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.480
 that we are quite sure about that 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.160
 nevertheless over 240 operational forces were 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.910
 necessary to handle the fire 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.860
 to get 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.989
 in the afternoon the fire department had 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.760
 the fire finally under control 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.769
 so there is that before now under 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.540
 control is not deleted yet 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.370
 There are still some areas in this 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.780
 cellar where it burns problem is through 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.580
 we can not get in the danger of falling 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.380
 that means you have to use water cannons 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.239
 try with great throw from the outside 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.590
 to catch those fire nests and 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.640
 to finally delete that one more 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.040
 take all the time 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.860
 Around 17 o'clock, the fire department then gave the 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.660
 message fire made known why the man 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.310
 The fire could have put us down 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.410
 Do not tell police yet 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.060
 until late in the evening came up 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.100
 in the context of the investigations further 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.360
 the evidence of the 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.250
 Man confirm 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.250
 the investigations are ongoing
