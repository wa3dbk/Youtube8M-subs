00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.350

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.950
 a mascarpone cream 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.090
 in this report of 13 web pages 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.010
 the two men arrested in the fleet and more to do 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.130
 and two-quarters three-quarters of the football records and won after 3 years 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.780
 from that 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.780
 the agreement hanging out 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.500
 over the past week the dow jones seems the temple the coffee so this 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.890
 effect 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.520
 this exit from the Libyan territory 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.520
 but in Rome on coffee between district director 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.730
 and the cookie prefect of the EU 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.540
 completely 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.590
 in motogp last year 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.350
 I have a first record 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350
 inside 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.610
 I add 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.610
 other mascarpone cream mascarpone cream 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.450
 the first disc of milk chocolate 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.460
 a little mascarpone cream 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.330
 in this register 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
 iliad battering 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.060
 I ended up with a layer 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.060
 of his body mass 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.749
 I'm done 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.159
 paradise shut up 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.159
 milk chocolate 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.449
 we wait for our your dessert 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.509
 we will finish the death 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.729
 or we had some specific cases of cocoa powder 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.269
 on top of the cream 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.469
 after six months 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.529
 for a first it's a small discussion 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:33.129
 with hazelnut and colisée 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.129
 the agreement always has a little more co² of consciousness of that 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.689
 the cookie one of his two predecessors from these communities 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:40.430
 Foreign 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.040
 quite like it's like a sweet dough departments like pie to 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.009
 apples for the die 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.149
 it's a little memory this trend of the way of use and wages 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.819
 could she have shot like this 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.269
 and then we are a praline layer between the two 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.619
 it's a small figure as rare as that it's very good 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:59.389
 of passion and swear in general yes 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.549
 all because of mascarpone cream 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.689
 how long do you count 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.799
 in 2008 we did a good job 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.359
 in Belgium we call it what we can say is that in this case 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.349
 and there it was possible to do with 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.759
 like that the tendency sometimes to retire between the two 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.759
 it was on a little bit more savvy 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.059
 you will be reminded of the plan director 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.189
 here is tiramisu traditional cts 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.189
 and financial we believed 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.649
 here is a little water party 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.649
 that's done 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:35.859
 to do the dishes 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.029
 the party does not stop
