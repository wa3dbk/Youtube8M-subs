 about 65 without our mission is to reach 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.759

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.740
 percent from 2014 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.409

 São Paulo to mtvu where it pollutes less 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.400
 more comfort and more safety have 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.490
 accessibility is not that next year 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.799
 the entire fleet of buses must have the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.170
 sensitivity is to propose a wheelchair to 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.570
 people with reduced mobility and 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.790
 these men are already being 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.030
 delivered with this then facilitating 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.790
 very nee that transport the mayor 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.040
 Mauro Orlandini also pointed out that 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.409
 priority from now on is the 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.180
 paving the streets of the city 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.520
 we are aware that this 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.530
 stage of this management that will be 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.159
 solve the question of paving the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.379
 streets 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.569
 will be a very important factor for 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:14.170
 that buses have has more buses 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.689
 with greater eco neon one time 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.750
 Well, I think it's the 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.210
 Today we walk our function is that the 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.580
 our reality is this 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.320
 and we are working walking 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.080
 to change this reality is extremely 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.080
 important to be here means better 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.680
 quality of service to the provision of 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.420
 services to our citizens and is right 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.090
 an extremely relevant fact, 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.800
 is a step towards holding a 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.510
 better quality of service in the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.280
 provision of public transport in 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.460
 our municipality the very importance 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.160
 because accessibility today does not 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.820
 It is only the disabled person's 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.850
 reverting to the elderly in favor of 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.670
 Mom served these buses the buses where 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.380
 go the chair can also the cart 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.240
 baby of a mother understand that it is 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.240
 prepared for it 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.190
 besides you and saw that on these buses 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.570
 has tactile signage for the blind to 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.480
 and this is very good. 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.240
 then importance for much bertioga 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.360
 read very good very good and will reverse 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.360
