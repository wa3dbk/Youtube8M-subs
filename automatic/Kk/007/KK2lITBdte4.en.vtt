00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
we need a pool table number two we have

to find the foot spot number three we

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
to find the foot spot number three we
have<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> set<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> balls<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.760> number

four<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.430> triangular

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
four we have to have that triangular

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.180 
four we have to have that triangular
rack<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.989> makes<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.890> nice<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.100> tight

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
rack that makes them nice and tight

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
rack that makes them nice and tight
let's<00:00:59.190> take<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> good<00:01:00.120> look<00:01:00.449> at<00:01:00.750> some

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
let's take a good look at some

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.789 
let's take a good look at some
techniques<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:03.030> keep<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.510> rack<00:01:03.870> nice<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
techniques to keep that rack nice and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.700 
techniques to keep that rack nice and
tight<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.659> think<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> first<00:01:07.110> thing<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.470> I

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
tight I think the first thing that I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.500 
tight I think the first thing that I
like<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.670> when<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
like to do is when I get all of the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.200 
like to do is when I get all of the
balls<00:01:09.720> into<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> rack<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.640> roll<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
balls into the rack I like to roll the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.300 
balls into the rack I like to roll the
entire<00:01:12.299> rack<00:01:12.869> back<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.320> forth<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.010> few<00:01:14.040> times

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
entire rack back and forth a few times

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.600 
entire rack back and forth a few times
just<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.450> get<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.960> loose<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.500> clean<00:01:16.680> then<00:01:17.580> I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
just to get them loose and clean then I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.700 
just to get them loose and clean then I
move<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> head<00:01:18.360> ball<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> foot<00:01:19.380> spot

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
move the head ball up to the foot spot

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.760 
move the head ball up to the foot spot
and<00:01:19.979> using<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:20.970> four<00:01:21.630> fingers<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.409> my<00:01:22.740> thumb

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and using my four fingers and my thumb

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440 
and using my four fingers and my thumb
on<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> outside<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> rack

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
on the outside of the rack

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.770 
on the outside of the rack
i<00:01:24.479> shimmied<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.619> balls<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.790> make<00:01:27.750> sure

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
i shimmied the balls up and make sure

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.289 
i shimmied the balls up and make sure
they're<00:01:28.170> nice<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.409> tight<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.030> last

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
they're nice and tight then the last

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.990 
they're nice and tight then the last
technique<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.140> use<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> barely<00:01:32.189> push<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
technique I use is I barely push the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.719 
technique I use is I barely push the
rack<00:01:33.270> ahead<00:01:33.780> maybe<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.560> quarter<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.250> an<00:01:35.340> inch<00:01:35.460> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
rack ahead maybe a quarter of an inch of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.210 
rack ahead maybe a quarter of an inch of
sixteenth<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.479> an<00:01:36.600> inch<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.710> any<00:01:37.920> balls

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
sixteenth of an inch to see if any balls

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.200 
sixteenth of an inch to see if any balls
move<00:01:38.659> before<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.960> take<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.470> rack<00:01:40.650> off<00:01:40.939> if<00:01:41.939> they

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
move before I take the rack off if they

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.780 
move before I take the rack off if they
move<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.720> start<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.530> process<00:01:43.829> over<00:01:44.399> again

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
move I start that process over again

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.270 
move I start that process over again
I<00:01:44.909> shall<00:01:45.479> am<00:01:45.750> around<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.829> use<00:01:47.040> my<00:01:47.070> fingers

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
I shall am around then I use my fingers

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.510 
I shall am around then I use my fingers
push<00:01:47.970> them<00:01:48.180> up<00:01:48.270> nice<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.570> tight<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.890> first

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
push them up nice and tight then I first

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.450 
push them up nice and tight then I first
step<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.540> push<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.170> rack<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.799> sixteenth

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
step just push the rack up a sixteenth

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.819 
step just push the rack up a sixteenth
of<00:01:53.640> an<00:01:53.759> inch<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.840> any<00:01:55.049> balls<00:01:55.350> move<00:01:55.649> out

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
of an inch and see if any balls move out

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.249 
of an inch and see if any balls move out
of<00:01:55.860> place<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.460> they<00:01:56.670> don't<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.630> carefully

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
of place if they don't you carefully

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.959 
of place if they don't you carefully
remove<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.680> rack<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.369> wallah

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
remove the rack and wallah

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.170 
remove the rack and wallah
you've<00:02:00.390> got<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> tight<00:02:00.990> rack<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:02.640> common

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
you've got a tight rack the common

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.420 
you've got a tight rack the common
denominator<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.079> both<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.920> eight<00:02:05.070> ball<00:02:05.369> and

denominator of both the eight ball and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.499 
denominator of both the eight ball and
the<00:02:05.700> nine<00:02:05.729> ball<00:02:06.090> rack<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.750> one<00:02:07.649> single<00:02:08.009> thing

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
the nine ball rack is one single thing

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.720 
the nine ball rack is one single thing
let's<00:02:09.509> make<00:02:09.780> sure<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.619> balls<00:02:10.830> are<00:02:11.129> tight

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
let's make sure all the balls are tight

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.650 
let's make sure all the balls are tight
let's<00:02:12.300> make<00:02:12.540> sure<00:02:12.569> each<00:02:13.200> of

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
let's make sure each of

let's make sure each of
those<00:02:13.750> wrecks<00:02:14.170> are<00:02:14.670> compressed<00:02:15.670> as<00:02:15.910> much<00:02:16.300> as

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
those wrecks are compressed as much as

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.910 
those wrecks are compressed as much as
we<00:02:16.660> possibly<00:02:16.930> can

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
we possibly can
