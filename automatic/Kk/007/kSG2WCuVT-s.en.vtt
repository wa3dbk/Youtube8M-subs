00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
mean of course it's a beta and hopefully

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.770 
mean of course it's a beta and hopefully
it<00:06:27.389> will<00:06:27.479> fix<00:06:27.720> that<00:06:27.870> in<00:06:28.169> the<00:06:28.289> full<00:06:28.500> game<00:06:28.650> but<00:06:29.780> if

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
it will fix that in the full game but if
