the<00:02:32.549> way<00:02:33.109> once<00:02:34.109> i<00:02:34.170> get<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.409> lift<00:02:34.590> Hill<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.069> the

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
the way once i get the lift Hill and the

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.800 
the way once i get the lift Hill and the
i'm<00:02:35.370> guessing<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.790> second<00:02:36.209> hill<00:02:36.359> after<00:02:36.569> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
i'm guessing the second hill after the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.009 
i'm guessing the second hill after the
first<00:02:37.140> turn<00:02:37.439> up<00:02:38.400> they'll<00:02:39.299> get<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.569> big<00:02:39.719> cranes

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
first turn up they'll get the big cranes

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.690 
first turn up they'll get the big cranes
out<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.379> here<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> lot<00:02:40.829> of<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.340> rest<00:02:41.519> of

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
out of here and a lot of the rest of

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.369 
out of here and a lot of the rest of
it's<00:02:41.819> just<00:02:41.909> low-lying<00:02:42.450> stuff<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.170> will

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
it's just low-lying stuff so that will

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.649 
it's just low-lying stuff so that will
fly<00:02:43.680> up<00:02:43.920> pretty<00:02:44.159> quick<00:02:44.459> all<00:02:45.299> right<00:02:45.420> we'll<00:02:45.540> go

fly up pretty quick all right we'll go
check<00:02:45.900> out<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.700> first<00:02:47.700> drop<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.030> turn<00:02:48.420> around

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:49.219

drop their putting the first beam into

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.839 
drop their putting the first beam into
place<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:10.169> what<00:03:10.349> will<00:03:10.500> be<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:11.069> total<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.579> believe

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
place of what will be a total I believe

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.259 
place of what will be a total I believe
three<00:03:12.419> or<00:03:12.569> four<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:14.310> looks<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:14.969> it's<00:03:15.120> going

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
three or four it looks like it's going

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.000 
three or four it looks like it's going
to<00:03:15.329> be<00:03:15.419> long<00:03:16.200> could<00:03:16.409> be<00:03:16.530> either<00:03:16.650> way<00:03:19.010> actually

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
to be long could be either way actually

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.140 
to be long could be either way actually
it's<00:03:20.159> going<00:03:20.219> to<00:03:20.340> be<00:03:20.430> four<00:03:20.669> there's<00:03:20.969> going<00:03:21.090> to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
it's going to be four there's going to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.899 
it's going to be four there's going to
be<00:03:21.180> four<00:03:21.389> on<00:03:21.599> that<00:03:21.780> one<00:03:21.959> three<00:03:22.829> on<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.189> one<00:03:23.370> or

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
be four on that one three on that one or

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.309 
be four on that one three on that one or
on<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.329> one

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:35.360 

let<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.069> turnaround<00:03:29.549> there<00:03:34.370> hopefully

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
let the turnaround there hopefully

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.949 
let the turnaround there hopefully
they'll<00:03:35.730> keep<00:03:35.879> some<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.209> those<00:03:36.299> trees<00:03:36.629> right

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
they'll keep some of those trees right

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:46.970 
they'll keep some of those trees right
there

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.190 

one<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.730> smaller<00:03:48.090> cranes<00:03:48.510> over<00:03:48.810> here<00:03:48.989> to

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
one of the smaller cranes over here to

00:03:49.200 --> 00:04:06.059 
one of the smaller cranes over here to
the<00:03:49.290> left

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.250 

so<00:04:06.670> that's<00:04:06.909> basically<00:04:07.420> what's<00:04:07.870> going<00:04:08.140> on

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
so that's basically what's going on

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.020 
so that's basically what's going on
right<00:04:08.469> now<00:04:08.700> I'm<00:04:09.700> not<00:04:10.269> seeing<00:04:11.849> I'm<00:04:12.849> not<00:04:12.909> seeing

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
right now I'm not seeing I'm not seeing

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.469 
right now I'm not seeing I'm not seeing
any<00:04:13.540> of<00:04:13.659> the<00:04:14.549> pieces<00:04:15.549> of<00:04:15.790> crack<00:04:16.030> sitting<00:04:16.329> down

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
any of the pieces of crack sitting down

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.749 
any of the pieces of crack sitting down
there<00:04:16.630> but<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:16.810> do<00:04:16.870> see<00:04:17.169> something<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:17.680> can<00:04:17.859> make

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:18.759 
there but I do see something I can make

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:31.210 
there but I do see something I can make
it<00:04:18.910> through<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.359> soft<00:04:19.780> mud<00:04:20.229> here

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.980 

right<00:04:31.940> there<00:04:32.210> that<00:04:32.480> looks<00:04:32.690> like<00:04:34.420> where<00:04:35.420> the

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
right there that looks like where the

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.670 
right there that looks like where the
double<00:04:36.380> spine<00:04:36.650> track<00:04:36.980> leaves<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:38.380> huge<00:04:39.380> lift

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
double spine track leaves the huge lift

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.250 
double spine track leaves the huge lift
Hill<00:04:39.860> track<00:04:40.160> there<00:04:40.570> that's<00:04:41.570> probably<00:04:42.110> going

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
Hill track there that's probably going

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.810 
Hill track there that's probably going
to<00:04:42.320> be<00:04:42.470> one<00:04:42.620> of<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.830> pieces<00:04:43.310> that's<00:04:43.610> going<00:04:43.730> to

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
to be one of the pieces that's going to

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.980 
to be one of the pieces that's going to
be<00:04:43.880> coming<00:04:44.030> up<00:04:44.210> pretty<00:04:44.420> close<00:04:44.570> because<00:04:44.810> I

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
be coming up pretty close because I

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.260 
be coming up pretty close because I
believe<00:04:45.290> that<00:04:45.320> connects<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.820> that<00:04:46.850> tower

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
believe that connects to that tower

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.180 
believe that connects to that tower
right<00:04:47.450> there<00:04:50.230> so<00:04:51.230> those<00:04:51.440> must<00:04:51.650> be<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:51.830> next

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
right there so those must be the next

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.180 
right there so those must be the next
two<00:04:52.460> pieces<00:04:52.880> that<00:04:53.030> are<00:04:53.150> going<00:04:53.420> up<00:04:53.540> right<00:04:53.630> there

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.400 

all<00:04:58.790> right<00:04:58.940> good<00:04:59.150> stuff<00:04:59.450> guys<00:04:59.690> well<00:05:00.260> that's
