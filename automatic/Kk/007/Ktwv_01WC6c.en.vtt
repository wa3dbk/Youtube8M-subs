00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.020
 so hello everyone today on the review with us 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.300
 monopod I think everyone knows selfie 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.740
 gizmo who does not know watch the video 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.839
 and find out that they are usually sold. 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.910
 But in such sets, yes , the selfie itself 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.279
 monopod which can be attached to the world 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.340
 also a special holder for 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.189
 mobile phones coming here 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.960
 absolutely all phone models that is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.260
 it is on the spring of any phone here 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.640
 becomes and bluetooth button using 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.559
 which can also take pictures with me 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.469
 in the store can be purchased separately 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.420
 just a monopod if these gadgets you 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.969
 not needed can be purchased separately 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.289
 the holder and separately the button that is all 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.840
 it can be purchased separately 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:55.410
 to whom such information is important in this video 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.680
 I'll show you my monopod which I sell 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.050
 poison and tell you how to choose the Internet 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.489
 all the same quality yourself monopod 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.960
 because there are so many 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.240
 for the price they are different and I will tell you 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.549
 what's the difference because myself when 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.610
 bought monopods got on very 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.460
 poor quality and monopods 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.610
 it means there are very different colors 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.860
 but exactly the handle itself means in the data 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.630
 monopods handle such rubber that is 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.750
 no you can not slip on the hand 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.390
 monopod 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.070
 heavy meaning he weighs because he 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.460
 made qualitatively here goes this 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.259
 bolt that is, you can wind any 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.810
 the camera, that is, there was a bolt coming with 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.700
 standard as on any tripods 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.420
 there is any camera fit here here 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.030
 such a rezinochka here goes special 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.060
 such a pen, that is, if you need 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.270
 turn somehow the camera yes then you 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.460
 unscrew and then turn 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.079
 twist into place that is in that 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.619
 the position in which you need further 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:09.989
 moves apart absolutely there by the meter 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.150
 ten in my here it is completely when 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.200
 laid out vk 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.030
 ron you do not fit what I want to say 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.000
 when choosing monopod 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.430
 I myself the first time I started them 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.530
 engage on monopods very 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.709
 cheap chinese thought they were all 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.120
 but the same was not the case most 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:34.189
 common mistake the most 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.829
 common marriage in monopods this then 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.659
 that you catch the camera and you have it 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.609
 starts to scroll that is to the camera 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.220
 help her about and cranked that is 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:46.239
 in this monopod see that you can 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.299
 twist but for this you need to attach 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.510
 the efforts themselves here are these tubes very tight 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.760
 sit in each other therefore not 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.829
 scrolls back and forth yes that is you 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.079
 you yourself are a man and then you turn it like 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.200
 you need and when you have a camera fixed 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.540
 that is, it does not go back and forth 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.189
 the following is worth paying attention to 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.220
 if here you take some internet 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.299
 store note and what was 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.599
 photos 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.099
 Well, I have a video let's say others 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.579
 stores pay attention to 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.160
 photo thickness of these tubes 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.620
 since the first time I bought 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.419
 monopods for sale mind i 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.459
 I ran into the problem that I had him 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:31.790
 completely laid out the last tube was 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.889
 so thin and so thin 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.440
 metal that it just broke under weight 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:39.459
 usual here such a mobile phone 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.129
 that is, the usual lenovo 190 grams weighs and 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.709
 monopod broke data monopods which 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:49.849
 sold in my shop do not break 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.560
 I give them a guarantee that you can withstand 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.919
 absolutely no camera will be 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.280
 scroll I'm checking everything in 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:01.069
 The bundle also goes here to me unpacked 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.049
 there is such a button on the side here goes 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.060
 the switch that is everything is very simple you 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.069
 turn on the switch button here 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.389
 starts blinking 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:14.269
 then you go in the phone turns out 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:16.549
 where you have bluetooth go to 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.029
 bluetooth turn on your bluetooth and 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.180
 turn on the search for devices that is, here I am 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:25.669
 turned on device search found devices 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.810
 Here you can see here writes no candles and 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:33.910
 here is the device button yes i press 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.590
 connect goes pairing device 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.340
 Now she connect and I'll show you how 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:47.960
 works further you fix the phone 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:50.479
 on a stick yes you fix that is either 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.180
 front camera or unwrap 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.759
 and fix it but in the back of the camera then 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.729
 there is absolutely no matter go further 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:03.710
 into the camera and here it is drawn to ios and 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:06.979
 android that is, but you can take pictures 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.169
 in principle, well, here's try two buttons 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:12.710
 have i press the button and 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.840
 the phone under takes a picture that is in 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.360
 further yes you wind on a regiment 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:23.060
 wind up the holder on the shelf and 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.080
 press the button and the phone takes pictures 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.449
 you or nature or whatever you want 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.240
 take a picture that is just one 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.099
 pressing a button from any distance on 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.159
 outdoors that is up to 20 meters 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:40.310
 she will hold a new 20 meters 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:43.699
 you stick just meter so will 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.919
 work without problems also who is not 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:49.070
 lover of such buttons go to me 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.650
 In the online store there is a link under the video 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.470
 more monopods will be soon 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:58.250
 with a wire that connects to 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.300
 the phone is also a good thing too 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:04.009
 the video will be shot separately 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.220
 so who has any questions 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:10.940
 who else wants to know anything exactly 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:14.060
 write about monopods under video in 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:17.449
 comments and go to 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:20.120
 link under the video on my site and read 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:22.210
 description of this monopod characteristics 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.409
 all there will be presented by his 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:28.310
 sizes how much he folded 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:31.430
 how much in the unfolded yes I hope you 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.650
 could help and answer questions then 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.300
 there is how to choose a monopod that is 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.060
 online photos they are all 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.750
 absolutely 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.810
 and for whom but the thickness of the tubes and quality 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.900
 assembly still different let's say here 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.150
 this monopod for purchases is 10 times 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:51.240
 more expensive than i saw than i first time 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.550
 I buy the cheapest that is, which have 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.730
 I broke down well I played them 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.590
 all kinds of contests and presents 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.540
 presented 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.850
 but as if it were very poor quality 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.370
 monopods I see on the Internet are often 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.680
 buy me too sometimes call 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.950
 customers say that I bought but he 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.560
 bad and you have good bad there 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:16.620
 ask therefore I decided to you on video 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.680
 pay attention to this too 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.940
 that when choosing, look at the thickness 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.400
 tubes that is if you don't want 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:26.300
 buy from my store and if you're in 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.550
 another take here the thickness of the tubes on 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.500
 photos of course it's hard to see them and 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:35.940
 in the video I can tell you right now but I can not 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:38.790
 but monopod is heavy 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.700
 force does not apply that is, see here but 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:45.450
 I try to bend the pipe pretty hard 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.169
 nothing at all i mean i'm here 

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.260
 thinner 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:52.620
 I did not bend the tube, that is, 

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:56.419
 my fingers turned red but the tubes in general 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.979
 nothing, that is, bends not 

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:02.160
 scrolls that is really 

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:05.360
 cool thing grandson for which I do not 

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:10.039
 ashamed to sell it to you and you will stay 

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:12.780
 obviously happy therefore the links under the video 

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:15.450
 contact anyone interested if you have 

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:18.650
 write questions or call everyone to everyone 

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.650
 thanks to new meetings
