00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.590
 in the internet video you have already heard 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.380
 the device is relatively loud show 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.299
 I still have some music 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.840
 this play music so we see 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.360
 can 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.710
 here you have, for example, the newest 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.970
 what has been charged here 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.650
 interprets albums title genre and then 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.540
 we always choose my title 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.840
 then you see the album cover im 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:32.430
 background you can change the bidder 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.670
 traveled tracks is good 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.409
 So that really means reproduction 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.409
 as repeated playback 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.420
 yes then I could continue here tracks 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.670
 select three from the album here above 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.140
 points are again further settings 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.840
 equalizer queue queue 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.660
 speak setting equalizer looks like this 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.520
 from here you can then settings 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.560
 make depending on whether you the sound 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.030
 somehow we want to customize 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.030
 rock listen again 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.460
 here you still have to playlist 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.550
 add play queue 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.300
 you can also buy remove music 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.330
 or delete 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.050
 in the play store you can listen directly to songs 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.940
 to buy 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.740
 you can not just apps 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.070
 Download like me but also 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.600
 Songs movies everything you want 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.990
 Here is a small overview 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.289
 that is then you can of course here 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.840
 also on the player access so the 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.080
 sound was good as you heard 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.050
 I already showed you fully at the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.180
 youtube app so that it is very first 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.440
 nice and the player you have too 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.390
 seen more often 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.250
 Let's take a look at the play store apps 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.619

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.580
 but that once saw you have 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.170
 more interesting are of course the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.690

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.640

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.340
 tempera two simpsons vector I 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.660

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.220
 backgrounds live backgrounds you can 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.910
 Why do we do that at the 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.830
 play is and tempera neins a few 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.800
 games I'll show you my now 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.840
 Overview so you see how good 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.050
 these games are still running a new one here 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.690
 We play the game of the angry birds 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.310
 could see cruz and there you have 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.660
 Here you can see screenshots here 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.340
 just press on install 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.450
 description you have new function 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.319
 reviews 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.319
 a really cool game 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.599
 you see 3d games are going great 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.510
 this device 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.909
 I have everything down and do 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.859
 benchmark test quadrant 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.959
 standard so that I can at some point overview 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.019
 we get from benchmark test us 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.270
 look at the result 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:28.620
 so once pressed four and then have 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:33.389
 we are the result and that is what we are now 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.820
 suddenly here 4083 depending on me 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:39.570
 was quite at the last benchmark tests 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.910
 above so above the htc evo ix with 4650 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.430
 So we have a result now 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:52.500
 we can see the 4083 cpu eight 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.300
 1447 memory 5881 yes about it now comes 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.539
 the transformer prime underneath that 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.849
 motorola atrix so we'll look again 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:03.539
 I press it again and this time 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.280
 we are at the top with four in 1953 so 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.520
 you can see that you benchmark test too 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.289
 can not always trust the 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.419
 Order differs in part 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.159
 more often or even the result now 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.940
 we are, as I said, at the top 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.919
 and yes you can still see the device 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.770
 has been classified relatively far up 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.539
 more than 4,000 if that was now as 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.610
 Of course, there's another one down here 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.659
 things like important that it is natural 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.159
 such a question 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.690
 but he has the most important 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.449
 Settings seen the most important 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.720
 functions a top camera with cool 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.280
 features like photos was the sound 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.590
 very good on this device the games 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.599
 run smoothly you have her cool apps 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.560
 writing works by wiping 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.659
 we have google language search so i 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.909
 think this is pure google device times 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.099
 again a top performance rear glass 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.330
 front glass is probably a matter where 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.490
 people complained that he was fast 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.770
 but it breaks down that happens too 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.840
 an iphone or other devices 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:05.760
 you will find more information as always
