00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 "Treatment of dry eye disease diet: Just add water?" 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.430
 Dry eye disease is one of the most common eye disorders. 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.570
 Causes irritation and discomfort and can reduce functional vision. 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.680
 Sometimes it causes a dramatic deterioration in the quality of life. 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.710
 In the US, about five million men and women are over 50 years old 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.680
 moderate to severe dry eye disease. Tens of millions more 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.120
 they have weak or occasional manifestations of the disease, costing more than $ 50 billion. 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.920
 When it comes to treatment, there are plenty of drops and medications that can help. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.120
 We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on things like tears, 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.640
 but there is currently no treatment available to address the problem. 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.989
 If drugs do not work, doctors may try to enter the lacrimal canals of the plug, 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.579
 but this can cause complications, such as plug migration 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.350
 and eroding them into the face that requires surgical removal. 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.140
 Or surgeons can cauterize the canals. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.890
 There must be a better way. And what about prevention? 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.109
 Dry eyes can be caused by LASIK surgery; 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:16.259
 six months after surgery affect approximately 20-40% of patients. 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.159
 There are a lot of people with millions of LASIK procedures every year 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.369
 and these long-term symptoms may sometimes be severe and limiting. 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.950
 There is a long list of medicines that can do this: antihistamines, 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.149
 decongestants, almost all antidepressants, anti-seizures, antipsychotics, 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.600
 Parkinson's disease medications, beta-blockers, hormone replacement therapy 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.920
 like a few herbal remedies. 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.740
 In the developing world with dry eyes, vitamin A deficiency sometimes begins to manifest, 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.170
 which is gradually becoming the main preventable cause of child blindness. 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.409
 If vitamin A deficiency is not deliberate, in the developed world 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.479
 you won't see it. It appeared in the 1960s 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.950
 a message about a guy who intentionally ate a vitamin A deficient diet 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.139
 and for five years he lived on bread and lime juice. His eye has changed into this. 

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:11.000
 But it's still better than this poor, a cult member, 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.950
 who tried to live only from brown rice and herbal tea. 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.890
 Her eyes literally dissolved and collapsed. 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.730
 There are also some reports of autistic children they have rejected 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.890
 eat anything other than fries or bacon muffins and something like Vitacit 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.870
 and lack vitamin A. 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.460
 A case of vegan diet and vitamin A deficiency has been reported in the Bronx 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.010
 but it was not a healthy vegan baby food; boy refusing to eat vegetables 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.280
 and consumed only potato chips, puffed rice cereals 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.170
 with non-fortified soy milk and juices. 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.880
 His parents were unable to overcome the child's inclination 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.140
 avoiding fruits and vegetables. 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.920
 Vegetable diet can be the best thing 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.450
 for patients with dry eye disease, for those wearing contact lenses, 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.760
 and for those who want to maximize their tear excretion. 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.350
 People with dry eyes should be advised to reduce their protein intake 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.790
 total fat and cholesterol, plus increased carbohydrate intake. 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.350
 Vitamin A intake should also be increased by eating red, orange 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.320
 and yellow vegetables, plus dark green wheatgrass. 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.490
 Furthermore, they must increase the intake of zinc and folate by eating whole grain cereals, 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.520
 legumes and raw vegetables, especially spinach. 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.040
 Provide sufficient vit. B-6 and potassium intake by eating nuts 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.710
 bananas and beans. Get enough vitamin C from citrus; 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.480
 discard alcohol and caffeine 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.880
 reduce sugar and salt intake 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.370
 and increase water consumption to 6 to 8 glasses a day. 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.960
 We know that dehydration can cause dry mouth. 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.150
 Could even dry eyes work? 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.530
 It seems obvious, but it has never been proven, so far. 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.370
 Is the solution to drink more water? 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.460
 We know that those who suffer from dry eyes are quite dehydrated. 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.010
 Scientists understand that tear secretion decreases with dehydration, 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.300
 as well as saliva secretion decreases, causing dry mouth. 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.240
 And indeed how more and more dehydrated you are, 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.850
 urine concentrates as well as tears. 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.069
 But this can be reversed by rehydration, increasing the exciting prospects, 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:21.660
 that would improve the hydration of the whole body by making people drink more water, 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.599
 could produce significant therapeutic effects in patients with dry eyes. 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.199
 Scientists recommend eight cups of water for women 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.000
 and ten cups a day for men.
