00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
down in a weird way but what it ended up

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.299 
down in a weird way but what it ended up
doing<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.379> night<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.829> actually<00:00:53.039> that

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
doing that night but actually that

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.900 
doing that night but actually that
people<00:00:54.180> made<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> dare<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.430> more<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
people made a dare out of it so more and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.470 
people made a dare out of it so more and
more<00:00:57.000> actually<00:00:58.520> ordered<00:00:59.520> them<00:00:59.730> just<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.239> dad

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.689 
more actually ordered them just to dad
shorter<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.710> correctly<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.430> quite

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
shorter so it correctly it quite

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.370 
shorter so it correctly it quite
successful<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> what's<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.170> first<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.290> all

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
successful so what's in it first of all

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.530 
successful so what's in it first of all
there's<00:01:08.159> some<00:01:08.430> bailing<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:12.030> there's<00:01:12.270> actually

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
there's some bailing so there's actually

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.320 
there's some bailing so there's actually
two<00:01:12.720> ways<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.200> doing<00:01:13.560> circus<00:01:14.159> either<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.119> can

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
two ways of doing circus either you can

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.350 
two ways of doing circus either you can
shake<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.860> which<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.250> weird<00:01:17.520> way<00:01:17.610> makes<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
shake it which in a weird way makes it

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.390 
shake it which in a weird way makes it
more<00:01:18.540> district<00:01:18.930> gusting<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.320> drink<00:01:19.799> than<00:01:20.250> if

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
more district gusting to drink than if

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.820

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you just lay eyes it hadn't quite

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.810 
you just lay eyes it hadn't quite
figured<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.909> why<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.830> what<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> hell<00:01:26.130> so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.000 
or maybe some new ideas for some
cocktails<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.550> we<00:03:32.000> should<00:03:32.150> try<00:03:32.330> but<00:03:33.170> enjoy

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.060

the<00:03:34.370> last<00:03:34.550> string<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.180> suck<00:03:35.360> wash<00:03:35.570> and

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
the last string to suck wash and

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.670 
the last string to suck wash and
hopefully<00:03:37.070> we'll<00:03:37.280> see<00:03:37.310> each<00:03:37.550> other<00:03:37.730> again

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
hopefully we'll see each other again

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.680
