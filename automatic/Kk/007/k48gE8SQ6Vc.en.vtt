00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.470

 Ever was an Egyptian stallion

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.340
 without him, I would not be healthy like now 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.130

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.610
 confidence 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:08.720
 We start at the moment with about 10 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.510
 our most successful and in the breed 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.450
 most beautiful horses on our the line 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.780
 it goes back to the u peter manni we 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.140

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.050
 get stallions and the second line 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.200
 goes back to the sara mina that is 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.890
 the targets that start with it as we run 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:34.880

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.010

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.140
 we have a wonderful beautiful 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:43.040
 Filly from the combination of these 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:47.230
 have lines and set great hope 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.720
 We also have a two-year-old 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:55.330
 stallion show times on familial 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.850
 goes back and the father of course ours 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.250
 wonderful of all is the residential and 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.910
 hopefully in his footsteps 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.580
 which already shows extreme quality today 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.210
 and ours the kings for the future 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:14.750
 we will breed pure egypt because 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.390
 it is the greatest horses for us and 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.390
 I also think that we should 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.960
 our bloodlines at least until one 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.850
 Certainly keep it clean with it always 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.249
 again have the opportunity to one 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.879
 to resort to opposite polarity 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:34.259
 our horses are my best friends 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:36.719
 I'm happy when I'm in the evening of the 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:40.050
 company comes all which barn 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:42.990
 welcome me all are friendly though 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:48.650
 Once a bad mood then shows 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.650
 that and they are just always honest
