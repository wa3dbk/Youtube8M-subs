00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello today vkontakte not 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.660
 stumbled upon one article which 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.230
 so called 9 reasons not to buy 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.139
 iphone 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.660
 I found it in the comparison group and maybe 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.000
 I would have ignored this article if 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.520
 Not a word of the creator of this public Timur 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.670
 sidelnikov and so that's what he wrote 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.890
 friends I found 2 little articles on the Internet 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.230
 very helpful and i'm with her completely 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.170
 Of course I agree without any 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.349
 sarcasm exaggeration or whatever there 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.620
 Never even remember without sarcasm and 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.110
 exaggeration article called 9 reasons 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.300
 don't buy iphone first item 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.879
 iphone program costs a lot of money 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 if you do not have a bank card 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.390
 an extra couple thousand dollars to pay 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.309
 software do not buy iphone well first 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.890
 Play market is also quite paid 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.120
 applications up in android there 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 ability to download applications 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.100
 third-party peter on the one hand is a plus 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.109
 but on the other hand all the charm 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.039
 free content is 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.799
 Kirov software 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.810
 please note if you feel sorry for spending 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.330
 dollar on the implemented project over 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.610
 that people tried on the iphone you 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.250
 You can download any applications from 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.020
 cydia and jailbreak i am this way 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.630
 I installed myself vk application 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.990
 when it was removed from the appstore for example 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.250
 through the curbstone ok next point 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.040
 for iphone 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.619
 mandatory registration enter if you are 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.430
 stand for freedom and don't want every 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.200
 god day 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.560
 send your data to servers 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.650
 and buy iphone i'm sorry but 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.760
 not the same google play 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.590
 okay drove the third item 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.200
 iphone does not work without a sim card 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.790
 you cannot call it in the video 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.740
 complain that 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.750
 many functions cannot be used 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.160
 while on the screen is an inscription 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.280
 insert sim card 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.200
 Well , firstly, I am very happy for the owners 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.950
 android and windows phone a what are they 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.670
 make great calls without a sim card 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.340
 I was surprised secondly in the week 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.130
 I use an iPhone without a SIM card and 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.040
 I do not feel any infringements 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.930
 everything works for me i can call 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.840
 skype download applications 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.330
 I can check the mail and by the way even 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.270
 Calls are available through our set still 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.300
 it says here that the big inscription is burning 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.959
 insert a sim card but alas I donâ€™t 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.480
 had seen 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.040
 no matter how much I looked for where I did not find this 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.140
 inscription 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.080
 fourth iphone point suddenly 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.360
 turns off at the most inopportune moment 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.820
 one man called sponsors and that 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.920
 did not hear them as a result of which remained 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.440
 without work you want to be on his 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.450
 place excuse me but this nonsense and even 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.180
 comment not 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.430
 The fifth point here is that 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.620
 iphone itself comes in all these update 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.840
 application when you do not know it 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.510
 can spend all your traffic and so 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.160
 then I will say briefly in the iPhone 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.500
 disable auto function 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.319
 update sixth item 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.959
 iphone antenna is inside the phone 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.230
 if you use your hand to climb through the microphone 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:17.340
 obviously inside and close the antenna with your hand 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.620
 then the network will disappear what kind of trash and how do I 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.420
 sorry iphone antenna doesn't stick out 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.180
 phone 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.690
 The seventh paragraph here says that 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.190
 people of the whole planet are in misery for iphone 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.970
 no flash adob 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.630
 but who needs him even if bye now 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.269
 trying to avoid him as much as possible 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.989
 The eighth point is very solid here. 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.049
 is written 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.380
 if iphone throw on asphalt screen 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:49.980
 you can break it personally 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.829
 me iphone fell so many times and with 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.470
 second floor from different heights through two 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.519
 of the year the screen cracked from falling on the tile 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.370
 which was unsurprising ninth point 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:05.730
 iphone shoved in a blender grinds 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.790
 into powder one minute on face cheap 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.280
 materials lack of armor class b and 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.440
 floor saves on its users 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.420
 let's shove like a blender any 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.359
 phone see what happens to him through 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.260
 minute and last phrase in this article 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.650

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.900
 apple shit for rogue that 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.580
 shows the author's intelligence 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.260
 articles 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.789
