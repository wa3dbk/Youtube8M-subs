00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
off is one of these plastic nubby things

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.669 
off is one of these plastic nubby things
on<00:01:32.420> this<00:01:32.600> corner<00:01:33.049> that's<00:01:33.319> the<00:01:33.469> piece<00:01:33.649> that

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
on this corner that's the piece that

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.789 
on this corner that's the piece that
kind<00:01:34.009> of<00:01:34.100> came<00:01:34.280> off<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:35.509> piece<00:01:36.229> actually

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
kind of came off and that piece actually

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.569 
kind of came off and that piece actually
fits<00:01:37.069> into<00:01:38.350> these<00:01:39.350> little<00:01:39.530> divots<00:01:39.799> right<00:01:40.219> here

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
fits into these little divots right here

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.940 
fits into these little divots right here
and<00:01:40.789> I<00:01:40.999> guess<00:01:41.840> it's<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.079> pretty<00:01:42.319> poor<00:01:42.530> design<00:01:42.799> if

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
and I guess it's a pretty poor design if

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.349 
and I guess it's a pretty poor design if
it<00:01:43.100> can't<00:01:44.319> take<00:01:45.319> that<00:01:45.590> kind<00:01:46.069> of<00:01:46.130> drop<00:01:46.549> my<00:01:47.149> phone

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
it can't take that kind of drop my phone

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.190 
it can't take that kind of drop my phone
