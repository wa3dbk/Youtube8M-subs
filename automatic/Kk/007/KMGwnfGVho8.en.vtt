 I think I picked up a few 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.539
 good options I got acquainted with 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.119
 pages exactly facebook and found out about 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.579
 She is interested here you see and I would 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:04.500
 I never thought of it 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.440

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.429

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.429
 tear off 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.470
 and so i found out she likes to play 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.930
 I found this amazing harp 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.310
 music box that plays 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.310
 one of her favorite tunes 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.390
 but then there was a real harp on 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.330
 which can play any melody to 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:43.760
 what then is this whole farce 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:45.410
 I just thought of the following well I 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.830
 I know that she is a fan 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.140
 canterbury stories and i found here 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.420
 such a map that illustrates 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.720
 travel of the main characters in England 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.460
 you can leave in a beautiful frame 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.460
 up on the phone from google maps 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.270
 I don't even know how to react to it, but 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.920
 I hope that the third option at least 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.920
 something is good because it flies to you 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.300

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.790
