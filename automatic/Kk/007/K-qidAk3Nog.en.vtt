with directional buttons I don't use

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.110 
with directional buttons I don't use
analog<00:02:14.900> sticks<00:02:15.170> because<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.970> move<00:02:16.970> in

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
analog sticks because I move in

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.050 
analog sticks because I move in
diagonals<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:17.960> can't<00:02:18.290> tell<00:02:18.620> my<00:02:19.000> brain<00:02:20.000> just

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
diagonals and I can't tell my brain just

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.370 
diagonals and I can't tell my brain just
doesn't<00:02:20.450> get<00:02:21.080> it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
doesn't get it

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.370 
doesn't get it
so<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.480> recipe<00:02:24.110> for<00:02:24.290> disaster

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
so this is a recipe for disaster

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:33.220 
so this is a recipe for disaster
basically<00:02:31.210> was<00:02:32.210> a<00:02:32.270> good<00:02:32.390> start<00:02:32.750> well<00:02:32.930> I'm<00:02:33.050> out

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
basically was a good start well I'm out

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.530 
basically was a good start well I'm out
it's<00:02:33.980> I'm<00:02:34.340> not<00:02:34.610> ending<00:02:35.000> though<00:02:35.120> because<00:02:35.360> I

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
it's I'm not ending though because I

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.700 
it's I'm not ending though because I
have<00:02:35.570> reaped<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.320> have<00:02:37.120> restarts<00:02:38.470> 20<00:02:39.470> free

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
have reaped I have restarts 20 free

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.400 
have reaped I have restarts 20 free
playback<00:02:40.190> ok<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:40.550> right<00:02:41.120> now<00:02:41.330> continues<00:02:42.050> afore

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
playback ok so right now continues afore

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.590 
playback ok so right now continues afore
for<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.680> second<00:02:42.920> force<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.280> i-23<00:02:43.910> continues<00:02:44.450> I

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
for a second force and i-23 continues I

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.300 
for a second force and i-23 continues I
was<00:02:44.720> like<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:45.350> is<00:02:45.410> gonna<00:02:45.500> be<00:02:45.650> an<00:02:45.740> hour<00:02:45.920> long

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
was like this is gonna be an hour long

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.150 
was like this is gonna be an hour long
what<00:02:46.640> ok<00:02:47.120> maybe<00:02:47.300> not<00:02:47.390> an<00:02:47.540> hour<00:02:47.830> boil<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.040> by

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
what ok maybe not an hour boil it and by

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.240 
what ok maybe not an hour boil it and by
that<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.370> mean<00:02:49.550> it'll<00:02:49.700> be<00:02:49.760> like<00:02:49.910> 22<00:02:50.600> minutes<00:02:50.930> not

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
that I mean it'll be like 22 minutes not

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.979 
that I mean it'll be like 22 minutes not
but<00:02:52.250> I'm<00:02:52.400> going<00:02:52.610> up<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.000> bonus<00:02:53.180> room<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.750> mean

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
but I'm going up the bonus room I mean

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.170 
but I'm going up the bonus room I mean
ah<00:02:54.620> I<00:02:55.340> had<00:02:55.520> it<00:02:56.770> it<00:02:57.770> says<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.489> for<00:02:58.610> me<00:02:58.760> this<00:02:58.970> is

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
ah I had it it says it for me this is

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.020 
ah I had it it says it for me this is
really<00:02:59.540> hard<00:02:59.900> like<00:03:00.440> my<00:03:00.890> my<00:03:01.220> brain<00:03:01.520> just<00:03:01.550> can't

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
really hard like my my brain just can't

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.240 
really hard like my my brain just can't
do<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.190> it's<00:03:04.190> it's<00:03:04.610> super<00:03:05.300> confusing<00:03:05.720> like<00:03:06.380> I

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
do it it's it's super confusing like I

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.190 
do it it's it's super confusing like I
don't<00:03:07.760> know<00:03:08.030> what<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.390> if<00:03:08.720> my<00:03:08.959> brain<00:03:09.140> just

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
don't know what it is if my brain just

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.500 
don't know what it is if my brain just
doesn't<00:03:09.560> connect<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.130> dots<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.209> can't

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
doesn't connect the dots and I can't

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.090 
doesn't connect the dots and I can't
move<00:03:11.690> in<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.959> straight<00:03:12.200> line<00:03:12.230> most<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.890> time

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
move in a straight line most of the time

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.530 
move in a straight line most of the time
I<00:03:14.770> think<00:03:15.770> that<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.520> guy<00:03:16.820> can<00:03:17.209> think<00:03:17.360> about<00:03:17.420> a

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
I think that the guy can think about a

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.810 
I think that the guy can think about a
game<00:03:17.660> view<00:03:17.810> control<00:03:18.110> with<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.530> ridged<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.790> I

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
game view control with is ridged so I

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.050 
game view control with is ridged so I
can<00:03:20.209> like<00:03:20.660> it's<00:03:20.810> not<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.020> flat<00:03:21.500> circle<00:03:22.130> there

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
can like it's not a flat circle there

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.590 
can like it's not a flat circle there
are<00:03:23.209> it's<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.690> hexagon<00:03:24.140> shapes<00:03:24.560> like<00:03:24.770> Hansel

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
are it's a hexagon shapes like Hansel

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.030 
are it's a hexagon shapes like Hansel
figure<00:03:26.600> out<00:03:26.780> where<00:03:29.050> doesn't<00:03:30.050> help<00:03:30.290> too<00:03:30.739> much

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
figure out where doesn't help too much

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.250 
figure out where doesn't help too much
let's<00:03:31.489> be<00:03:31.730> honest<00:03:32.890> but<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:34.010> want<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.370> want<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.790> I

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.650 

go<00:04:11.240> as<00:04:12.040> in<00:04:13.040> don't<00:04:13.400> screw<00:04:13.730> up<00:04:13.900> basically<00:04:16.660> right

go as in don't screw up basically right

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.520 
go as in don't screw up basically right
if<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:18.470> don't<00:04:18.739> if<00:04:19.609> I<00:04:19.850> don't<00:04:19.880> do<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.419> within<00:04:20.720> the

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
if I don't if I don't do it within the

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.820 
if I don't if I don't do it within the
next<00:04:21.739> like<00:04:22.010> three<00:04:22.490> lives<00:04:23.090> or<00:04:23.990> two<00:04:24.350> lives<00:04:24.590> I

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
next like three lives or two lives I

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.320 
next like three lives or two lives I
guess<00:04:27.100> yeah<00:04:28.100> but<00:04:28.250> I'd<00:04:28.340> do<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.640> sooner<00:04:29.120> then

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
guess yeah but I'd do it sooner then

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.719 
guess yeah but I'd do it sooner then
I'll<00:04:29.450> just<00:04:29.630> go<00:04:29.750> down<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.110> other<00:04:30.229> path<00:04:30.550> but<00:04:31.550> I

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
I'll just go down the other path but I

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.620 
I'll just go down the other path but I
want<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.270> try<00:04:32.750> at<00:04:33.110> least<00:04:34.150> well<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.180> thought<00:04:35.450> he'd

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
want to try at least well I thought he'd

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.090 
want to try at least well I thought he'd
