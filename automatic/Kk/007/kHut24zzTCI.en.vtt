00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.990
 DVD review with another trailer 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.309
 check to a movie ben quieter in the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.260
 main role and he says like me that 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.030
 feeling leaves as if he wanted to 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.559
 little little serious to try 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.929
 establish and with it we throw one 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.430
 look at the amazing life of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.430
 walter with 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.140
 pleased 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.710
 well 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.710
 we are on 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.899
 the mount st 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.760
 Do you have a rental car for me in Yes 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.760
 a blue and a red dare 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.080
 I take the red one 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.420
 not that uninteresting at all 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.070
 trailer of virtually no words 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.510
 gets along and you will not feel 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.820
 Let's go that quieter a little bit 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.500
 trying to get serious how often 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.120
 among other things because sean penn are there 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.890
 not necessarily the actor for that 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.440
 funny is what else ben quieter like that 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.580
 but deducts the amazing life 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.230
 from wall that will be in the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.390
 Story tells a coworker of the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.830
 The live mail is really in the 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.050
 life does not get along and yourself 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.670
 flees regularly into his daydreams 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.340
 and because we have a completely different fantastic 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.840
 and amazing world experiences find it 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.880
 I also the original title the secret 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.680
 life of water with the very interesting 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.450
 By the way, it brings us the century 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.100
 fox the movie from the 25th 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.650
 december in German cinemas and 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.090
 especially in the christmas week and it is 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.950
 already cruel in august over 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.300
 He always has a Christmas to talk about 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.590
 so these either film a bit 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.420
 go in family directions or the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.860
 try in lifestyle last year 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.170
 a very profound and such 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.360
 overall harmonic tone strike 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.950
 because half the world is Christian 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.750
 area located in this state 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.010
 which is why it can be it 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.240
 things get a bit more serious here and 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.280
 city ​​comedy maybe one 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.140
 tragickomödie I'm curious 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.370
 how ben quieter that in the end 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.870
 can withstand this genre and 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.580
 maybe I am totally wrong 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.620
 Unfortunately, there are not many 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.940
 infos about these titles from part 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.500

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.060
 as soon as he knows I'll let you on everyone 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.410
 know case determines a second 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.600

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.000

 the amazing life of walter with 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.820

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.230
