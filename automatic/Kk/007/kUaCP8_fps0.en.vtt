 oval carpet knit on the back wall 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:59.220
 either for the back lobule of the main loop and 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:03.060
 between the rows it will be with us in the hem you 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:12.540
 nakida in each column of the previous 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.900
 row knotted column without nakida 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.909
 we introduce a hook because of the back half-loop 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.880
 tying up the posts without nakida here 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.390

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.770
 flat side 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.750
 knit further arches start it 640 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.580
 in which we are tied in the fifth row 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.740
 five bars, without sc since 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.470
 rounding the oval carpet and to 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.540
 the product was exactly how we knit here 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.780
 let's alternate the first loop 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.369
 we knit a single crochet into the next 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.060
 2 columns without nakida and so after 1 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.150
 loop 1 column 212 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.909
 next knit 1 column without nakida also 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.710

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:19.880
 profile and so on 1 next two 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.880
 and so alternate 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.380
 completely on the oval side 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.780
 tying 2 stitches into one loop without 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.450

 just knit continue for the back wall 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.490
 and yet he even rounds us up but 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:56.209
