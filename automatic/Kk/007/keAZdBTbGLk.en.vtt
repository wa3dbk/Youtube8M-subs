bit shorter studs and if you feel like

your studs are digging in too much and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
why because artificial grass is

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.319 
why because artificial grass is

sure a lot of you guys have turf fields

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.319

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
to wear studs on there simply because it

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.559 
to wear studs on there simply because it
tears<00:03:31.949> up<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.159> field<00:03:32.459> but<00:03:33.000> like<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.239> said<00:03:33.419> it's

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
tears up the field but like I said it's

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.909 
tears up the field but like I said it's
very<00:03:33.629> dangerous<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.260> wear<00:03:34.379> this<00:03:34.470> type<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.650> stop

pattern<00:03:35.220> on<00:03:35.340> there<00:03:35.519> simply<00:03:36.209> because<00:03:36.379> you're

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
pattern on there simply because you're

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.830 
pattern on there simply because you're
intentionally<00:03:38.790> putting<00:03:39.120> yourself<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.750> an

extra<00:03:54.209> long<00:03:54.359> metal<00:03:54.599> studs<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.049> there<00:03:55.229> and<00:03:55.650> now

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
extra long metal studs on there and now

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:56.990 
extra long metal studs on there and now
let's<00:03:56.069> talk<00:03:56.159> a<00:03:56.220> little<00:03:56.340> bit<00:03:56.519> about<00:03:56.699> stud

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
let's talk a little bit about stud

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.640 
let's talk a little bit about stud
pressure<00:03:57.329> because<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.109> pressure<00:03:58.319> can<00:03:58.530> be

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
pressure because that pressure can be

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.349 
pressure because that pressure can be
caused<00:03:58.859> by<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.129> couple<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.549> things<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.329> first

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
caused by a couple of things the first

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.420 
caused by a couple of things the first
thing<00:04:00.689> being<00:04:00.989> breaking<00:04:01.709> down<00:04:01.889> of<00:04:01.919> the<00:04:02.220> shoe

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
thing being breaking down of the shoe

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.250 
thing being breaking down of the shoe
where<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.209> sole<00:04:03.449> of<00:04:03.479> the<00:04:03.659> shoe<00:04:03.689> actually

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
where the sole of the shoe actually

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.110 
where the sole of the shoe actually
becomes<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.739> little<00:04:04.919> bit<00:04:05.010> flimsy<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.549> gets<00:04:05.849> old

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
becomes a little bit flimsy it gets old

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.449 
becomes a little bit flimsy it gets old
eventually<00:04:06.629> shoes<00:04:06.900> do<00:04:07.169> break<00:04:07.439> down<00:04:07.470> even<00:04:08.220> if

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
eventually shoes do break down even if

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.099 
eventually shoes do break down even if
nothing<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:08.909> wrong<00:04:08.970> with<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.959> shoe

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
nothing is wrong with the shoe

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.619 
nothing is wrong with the shoe
physically<00:04:10.620> sometimes<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:12.000> soleplate<00:04:12.239> just

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
physically sometimes the soleplate just

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.210 
physically sometimes the soleplate just
breaks<00:04:12.870> down<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.379> you're<00:04:13.650> gonna<00:04:13.769> have<00:04:13.889> issues

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
breaks down and you're gonna have issues

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.409 
breaks down and you're gonna have issues
with<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.459> soil<00:04:14.729> being<00:04:14.879> a<00:04:15.000> little<00:04:15.180> bit<00:04:15.269> too

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
with the soil being a little bit too

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:16.999 
with the soil being a little bit too
soft<00:04:15.659> and<00:04:15.959> you're<00:04:16.409> going<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.560> be<00:04:16.650> start<00:04:16.889> to

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
soft and you're going to be start to

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.379 
soft and you're going to be start to
feel<00:04:17.250> those<00:04:17.459> studs<00:04:17.729> under<00:04:17.940> your<00:04:18.060> feet<00:04:18.180> which

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
feel those studs under your feet which

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.479 
feel those studs under your feet which
could<00:04:18.599> lead<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.810> some<00:04:18.959> discomfort<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:20.099> second

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
could lead to some discomfort the second

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.190 
could lead to some discomfort the second
reason<00:04:20.609> why<00:04:20.759> you<00:04:20.970> would<00:04:21.419> get<00:04:21.630> stud<00:04:21.959> pressure

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
reason why you would get stud pressure

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.959 
reason why you would get stud pressure
is<00:04:22.469> because<00:04:23.070> you're<00:04:23.190> using<00:04:23.430> these<00:04:23.760> particular

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
is because you're using these particular

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.550 
is because you're using these particular
sub<00:04:24.389> patterns<00:04:24.750> on<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.080> wrong<00:04:25.260> type<00:04:25.529> of

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
sub patterns on the wrong type of

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.890

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
is gone because you have to have this

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.500 
is gone because you have to have this

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
little mechanism in there for the stud

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.360 
little mechanism in there for the stud
to<00:05:18.630> actually<00:05:19.020> screw<00:05:19.260> in<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:19.710> if<00:05:20.039> you<00:05:20.130> look<00:05:20.280> at

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
to actually screw in and if you look at

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.189 
to actually screw in and if you look at
an<00:05:20.490> actual<00:05:20.639> soft<00:05:21.060> ground<00:05:21.240> stud<00:05:21.539> you're<00:05:22.050> going

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
an actual soft ground stud you're going

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.360 
an actual soft ground stud you're going
to<00:05:22.260> notice<00:05:22.349> that<00:05:22.440> there's<00:05:22.650> actually<00:05:22.830> quite<00:05:23.250> a

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
to notice that there's actually quite a

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.570 
to notice that there's actually quite a
bit<00:05:23.580> of<00:05:23.699> a<00:05:23.900> screw<00:05:24.900> on<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.380> actual<00:05:25.680> stud<00:05:25.979> to<00:05:26.430> go

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
bit of a screw on the actual stud to go

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.990 
bit of a screw on the actual stud to go
into<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:26.970> shoe<00:05:27.180> so<00:05:27.630> if<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:27.810> have<00:05:29.000> somewhere

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
into the shoe so if you have somewhere

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.730 
into the shoe so if you have somewhere
there<00:05:30.270> that<00:05:30.570> has<00:05:30.780> to<00:05:30.930> go<00:05:31.050> into<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.500> soleplate

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
there that has to go into the soleplate

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.189 
there that has to go into the soleplate
so<00:05:32.070> you<00:05:32.160> can<00:05:32.280> see<00:05:32.430> that's<00:05:32.970> quite<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:33.240> bit<00:05:33.599> quite

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
so you can see that's quite a bit quite

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.839 
so you can see that's quite a bit quite
a<00:05:34.260> long<00:05:34.530> thing<00:05:34.860> especially<00:05:35.099> considering<00:05:35.760> how

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
a long thing especially considering how

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.550 
a long thing especially considering how
thin<00:05:36.150> this<00:05:36.360> particular<00:05:36.840> soleplate<00:05:37.139> is<00:05:37.229> or

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
thin this particular soleplate is or

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.860 
thin this particular soleplate is or
even<00:05:37.889> a<00:05:38.190> soccer<00:05:38.430> soleplate<00:05:39.389> in<00:05:39.539> general

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
even a soccer soleplate in general

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.750 
even a soccer soleplate in general
regardless<00:05:40.289> of<00:05:40.380> its<00:05:40.530> carbon<00:05:40.770> fiber<00:05:41.010> glass

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.839 
regardless of its carbon fiber glass
fiber<00:05:42.650> plastic<00:05:43.650> something<00:05:44.370> has<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.610> go<00:05:44.699> in

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
fiber plastic something has to go in

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.040 
fiber plastic something has to go in
there<00:05:45.000> so<00:05:45.120> if<00:05:45.330> you<00:05:45.419> think<00:05:45.630> about<00:05:45.810> if<00:05:45.930> you're

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
there so if you think about if you're

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.040 
there so if you think about if you're
playing<00:05:46.229> on<00:05:46.349> a<00:05:46.380> hard<00:05:46.650> surface<00:05:46.909> like<00:05:47.909> a<00:05:48.240> hard
