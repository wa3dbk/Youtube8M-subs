00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.240
 I decided to do another review on this one. 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.639
 knife 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.130
 many make various videos on it 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.420
 This is a Victorian 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.740
 index 37 13 is also called hansen 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.410
 This is my favorite knife that I have 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.410
 always with your pocket wherever you go and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.420
 I want to become exactly why well firstly 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.420
 because it is Swiss quality and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.720
 to make sure you buy a knife 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.030
 how to determine is it fake or not here 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.180
 this is the part where the logo is made 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.420
 metal metal liner 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:48.059
 just polished and in one plane 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.860
 together with the handle here and the second but 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.870
 naturally when its price should be 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.469
 Accordingly, that is, you need to buy for 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.539
 two hundred and twenty six hryvnia where is he 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.180
 more expensive and cheaper but in principle how would 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.030
 I have this screwdriver, I have it separately 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.500
 bought it bought separately too 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:13.770
 Wow what you can buy your own 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:16.020
 toothpick or say pintsetik let 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.200
 I would have missed me and myself 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200
 smog 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.900
 buy fine but I do not rank it 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.600
 so what we have we have good 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.320
 the blade is not huge that is if 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.040
 compare with the hand then it is not so big 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.290
 blade 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.000
 but it is enough to cut bread sausage there 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.610
 in detail to answer such tasks 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.119
 decide though the bun had to be then 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.770
 the ring is not enough length for 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:51.800
 to cut the fur coat or there too fraternal 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.750
 too little fox running from the tree 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:02.100
 we have this tool for pulling out 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.060
 tubes for example from wine or you can 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.100
 it is very convenient to untie knots 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.560
 I use my own more often to 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.840
 untie the reins at the open but I do not drink 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.400
 Alcohol here is this screwdriver for disassembly 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:24.140
 points for example there or pull us 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:27.870
 need to use there is also sewed 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.410
 which can be conveniently cut that is it 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.410
 decided 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.630
 and the water-face drill 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.519
 such a strange hook tool 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.260
 I use it quite rarely 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.100
 but still use that is when 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.280
 heavy bags then here and so took 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.310
 hooked and very comfortable to carry comfortably so 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.450
 we reviewed two blades 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:55.380
 the next tool is a very saw 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.240
 aggressive for so you can see see 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:05.820
 so big less 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:08.010
 remember this form if you remember 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.900
 the form then you do not buy a fake that is 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.570
 counterfeits never have quality 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.120
 Forms and by the way here carried out 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.560
 sweep 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:22.140
 I still want to show on one of 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.760
 branches like a knife cuts this case here 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.920
 see them almost almost on 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.920
 half the thickness of this saw 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.840
 it is acacia but acacia is dry 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:46.700
 Acacia I think you know well try these 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:46.700
 may actually all well here 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.930
 approximately the ratio yes and that is 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.709
 the thickness is quite normal any branch 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:00.420
 you can cut it was the action here 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.209
 the next thing we have here is 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.560
 scissors scissors are very good 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.810
 spring loaded here see 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.549
 there are grooves in which the spring comes in then 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.310
 it is not going anywhere very conveniently 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:19.160
 OK 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:22.860
 we also have two tools here 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.260
 bottle opener for regular bottles and also 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.419
 Russia for this thing can be convenient and 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.710
 wire can there be traps still 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:34.320
 what's the other star and flat head screwdriver and 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.060
 wide which can be fixed so 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.620
 Well, how to fix it spring I 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.720
 just that is to close it so not easy 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:47.539
 or so it can be so too 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.710
 fixed and the second tool we have 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.419
 can opener 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.919
 somehow show how it works or 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.960
 You can see the quality on the Internet 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.789
 very good this is one of the best 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.680
 bottle openers and in principle if home need 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.430
 fix use it more often than 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.400
 some other 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.620
 but in the butt we see what once 10 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.720
 screwdriver it fits very well 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.070
 by the way under computer baptism very 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.849
 well convenient to turn off too she 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.110
 fixed in a different position partially and 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.510
 closes, but here's the actual 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.880
 need 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.510
 small weight small size and therefore 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.510
 he is my favorite
