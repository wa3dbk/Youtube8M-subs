thing i don't like about it though is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.120

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
using my phone for it to be just closed

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.270 
using my phone for it to be just closed
up<00:05:18.900> like<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.260> sink<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.590> or<00:05:19.740> charge<00:05:19.950> it<00:05:20.070> that<00:05:20.160> way

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
up like I sink it or charge it that way

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.070 
up like I sink it or charge it that way
but<00:05:20.340> that's<00:05:20.730> not<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.300> design<00:05:21.600> way<00:05:21.720> this<00:05:21.990> is

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
but that's not the design way this is

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.300 
but that's not the design way this is
designed<00:05:22.200> with<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.500> flap<00:05:22.710> on<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:22.890> bottom<00:05:23.160> so

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
designed with the flap on the bottom so

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.640 
designed with the flap on the bottom so
it<00:05:23.340> does<00:05:23.580> go<00:05:23.730> up<00:05:23.850> the<00:05:23.970> connector<00:05:24.330> so<00:05:24.650> when

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
it does go up the connector so when

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
it does go up the connector so when
you're<00:05:25.740> sleeping<00:05:25.980> at<00:05:26.070> night<00:05:26.190> when<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.400> phones
