learn<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.710> truth<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.160> my<00:00:26.310> own<00:00:26.490> eyes<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.539> I

learn the truth with my own eyes so I

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.689 
learn the truth with my own eyes so I
think<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.439> safe<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> say<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.220> are<00:00:29.400> going

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
think it's safe to say that we are going

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.189 
think it's safe to say that we are going
to<00:00:29.849> France<00:00:30.150> that's<00:00:30.390> where<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.599> maps<00:00:30.929> going

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
to France that's where this maps going

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.860 
to France that's where this maps going
to<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.790> can't<00:00:32.790> really<00:00:32.969> tell<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.630> reading

the<00:00:33.899> letter<00:00:34.170> how<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.559> characters<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.309> are

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
left who could be you know it could be

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.470

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
tank Dempsey and Nikolai I don't think

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.030 
tank Dempsey and Nikolai I don't think
this<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.050> nicole<00:00:43.469> i<00:00:43.590> think<00:00:43.860> they're<00:00:43.950> probably

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
this is nicole i think they're probably

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
saving that for last i think this is

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.290 
saving that for last i think this is
definitely<00:00:45.780> take<00:00:46.200> dub<00:00:46.440> c<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:47.610> once<00:00:47.760> again<00:00:47.910> i'm

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
definitely take dub c but once again i'm

definitely take dub c but once again i'm
not<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.480> hundred<00:00:48.690> percent<00:00:48.809> sure<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
not a hundred percent sure that's the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.049 
not a hundred percent sure that's the
thumbnail<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.219> had<00:00:50.370> ready<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.910> that's

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.660 
they're definitely right I think it's
safe<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.799> say<00:01:25.979> that's<00:01:26.220> going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.580> in

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
safe to say that's going to be in

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.999 
safe to say that's going to be in
northern<00:01:26.939> France<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.689> says<00:01:28.009> it's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
northern France because it says it's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.410 
northern France because it says it's
being<00:01:29.220> tested<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.640> northern<00:01:29.939> France<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.299> then

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
being tested in northern France and then

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.969 
being tested in northern France and then
the<00:01:30.479> last<00:01:30.659> paragraph<00:01:30.869> says<00:01:31.380> i'll<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.650> at<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the last paragraph says i'll be at the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.590 
the last paragraph says i'll be at the
site<00:01:32.159> within<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> week<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.909> learn<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.360> truth

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
site within the week to learn the truth

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.870 
site within the week to learn the truth
with<00:01:33.900> my<00:01:34.020> own<00:01:34.200> eyes<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.860> i<00:01:35.130> think<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.729> safe<00:01:35.850> to

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
with my own eyes so i think it's safe to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.550 
with my own eyes so i think it's safe to
say<00:01:36.000> yeah<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:36.930> confirmed<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.470> the
