 also some modeling clay what that 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.119
 with the sheep is it going to be the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.100
 pig shopping I believe that the pig who 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.750
 he is happy when it comes 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.700
 I'm interested this is the first time 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.280
 we open it so it's a map 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.180
 here with sigean pre-cut objects 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.159
 precut 1 like this here I 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.820
 think we have the dough nature and you have the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.520
 pink modeling clay one sees there 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.799
 that you are removing from the small 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.079
 clipping small parties that small 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.159
 small pouch pouch 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.840
 little group of the other elsewhere iliad to 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.040
 collectible figurines there are some 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.180
 sheep there is the dog and the pig 67 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.920
 who went very very well this 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.299
 exhibition especially if you like wallace 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.380
 and gromit and I advise you to 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.530
 watch animation movies that's 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.149
 very funny it is very well done more 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.490
 high hit it's a little bit harder 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.780
 that the wound back to the little bit longer 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.880
 but it's still modeling clay 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.950
 and kalist look here it's epic and 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.840
 the little flyer here is the instructions for use 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.370
 you have more to follow the model that goes 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.620
 to be much easier because that 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.190
 you're at the thalys bakou exhibition 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.610
 yeah I advise little friends 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.840
 yes it's funny here is the rocket 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.050
 surprise 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.120
 shaun the sheep you can model your 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:36.180
 own characters 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:38.959
 there are twelve lectionary beings it is 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:45.860
 much better than a small accessory 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.860
 you are here and that is alice 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.870
 the harder it is to stand 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.709
 we will review all the time to 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.530
 query is to be the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:03.360
 is part of it then is it okay 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.870
 to be the dog because it's going to be a 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:14.760
 sheep becomes sheep 65 motorcycle this is the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:17.610
 same time the fight in europe and gaby oh 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.060
 yes oh yes I recognize I recognize you 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.810
 the sheep look an ammann that looks 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.489
 in fuel or if they want flyers 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.860
 so you have a white modeling clay 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.810
 have accessories see you sting and 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:38.940
 accessories as for the pig but 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:41.910
 I do not know what it's used for 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.230
 make a wool look pretty well done and 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.840
 how do we make the animated film in 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.070
 modeling clay tennis you know it's a 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.109
 bit like cartoons this is at 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.579
 to say that turned with photos 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.070
 and in a movie 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.530
 normally there are 25 frames per second 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.510
 or is against when we make a movie 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.519
 of animation for arne mann they do it 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.530
 in 12 frames per second which gives 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.900
 really an aspect of cartoons and 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.570
 so you have to do twelve photos per 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.400
 second do 12 different positions 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.690
 of modeling clay says when I give you back 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.790
 account only for a one hour movie 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.799
 twenty one rinsed how much these 80 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.000
 80 minutes it's like a second it's 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:20.459
 a lot and so and after these twelve 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.810
 photos per second so that's huge and 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.220
 my job was several years of 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.860
 work but after the result is 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.259
 really very well has pacssed diomedes 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.449
 vote a lot of patience this is from the 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.250
 patience and thoroughness as what 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:37.740
 you're doing it here is your side 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:42.360
 delicately like a brute on the head 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:45.960
 noted here do not hesitate to go see 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.410
 this exhibition in paris until 30 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.050
 August 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.490
 So here's your sheep for now we 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:57.660
 would look more like a moment like this 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:05:02.009
 donation does not matter 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.340
 opium comes from where whites in the dough 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.530
 blow existed a little bit a 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.500
 little bit of texture it gives a 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.479
 appearance of aisne and class with 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.889

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:19.650

 the end of the exhibition and was the 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.960
 chance that on the two small

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.940
