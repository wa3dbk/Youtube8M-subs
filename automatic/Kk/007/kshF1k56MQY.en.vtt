00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
at a shot who was by this is the eight

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.289 
at a shot who was by this is the eight
pin<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> spare<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.610> would<00:01:11.760> assume<00:01:11.850> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
pin for the spare and I would assume I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.550 
pin for the spare and I would assume I
don't<00:01:12.570> know<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:12.840> we've<00:01:12.960> ever<00:01:13.110> taken<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.470> this

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
far but I assume it's a one ball penalty

far but I assume it's a one ball penalty
