soft waves so my hair was straight this

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.630 
soft waves so my hair was straight this
day<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.110> decided<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.739> curl<00:03:53.070> it<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.310> little<00:03:53.459> bit

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
day so I decided to curl it a little bit

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.400 
day so I decided to curl it a little bit
with<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.790> curling<00:03:54.060> iron<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.450> get<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.720> really<00:03:55.140> soft

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
with a curling iron to get a really soft

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.970 
with a curling iron to get a really soft
wavy<00:03:55.890> look<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.239> sectioned<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.050> off<00:03:58.170> using<00:03:58.800> a

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
wavy look so I sectioned it off using a

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.190 
wavy look so I sectioned it off using a
clip<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.580> then<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.820> took<00:04:00.090> about<00:04:00.570> one<00:04:00.930> inch

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
clip and then I took about one inch

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.100 
clip and then I took about one inch
sections<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.100> then<00:04:02.160> using<00:04:02.880> my<00:04:03.360> one<00:04:03.690> in<00:04:03.989> a

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
sections and then using my one in a

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.410 
sections and then using my one in a
fourth<00:04:04.410> inch<00:04:04.709> curling<00:04:05.010> iron<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.580> started<00:04:06.239> at

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
fourth inch curling iron I started at

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.970 
fourth inch curling iron I started at
the<00:04:06.570> middle<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.080> kind<00:04:07.320> of<00:04:07.440> worked<00:04:07.709> my<00:04:07.950> way

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
the middle and kind of worked my way

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.210 
the middle and kind of worked my way
down<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:09.020> doing<00:04:10.020> that<00:04:10.350> really<00:04:10.800> helps<00:04:11.100> the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
down and doing that really helps the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.430 
down and doing that really helps the
curl<00:04:11.550> not<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.910> get<00:04:12.030> too<00:04:12.300> tight<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:13.020> way<00:04:13.170> it's

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
curl not to get too tight that way it's

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.260 
curl not to get too tight that way it's
a<00:04:13.530> lot<00:04:13.680> easier<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:14.100> comb<00:04:14.489> through<00:04:14.520> with<00:04:15.120> my

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
a lot easier to comb through with my

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.449 
a lot easier to comb through with my
fingers<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:16.109> make<00:04:16.200> them<00:04:16.410> look<00:04:16.560> more<00:04:16.620> like<00:04:17.130> soft

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
fingers to make them look more like soft

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.050 
fingers to make them look more like soft
natural<00:04:17.850> waves<00:04:18.450> and<00:04:19.549> then<00:04:20.549> for<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.910> next

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
natural waves and then for the next

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.450 
natural waves and then for the next
section<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:21.750> curled<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.230> towards<00:04:22.680> my<00:04:22.860> face<00:04:23.130> I

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
section I curled that towards my face I

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.280 
section I curled that towards my face I
still<00:04:23.940> started<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.570> middle<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.990> worked

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
still started in the middle and worked

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.140 
still started in the middle and worked
my<00:04:25.410> way<00:04:25.500> down<00:04:25.650> but<00:04:26.100> this<00:04:26.310> will<00:04:26.520> help<00:04:26.640> the<00:04:26.850> curls

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
my way down but this will help the curls

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.450 
my way down but this will help the curls
to<00:04:27.330> look<00:04:27.540> a<00:04:27.720> little<00:04:28.110> more<00:04:28.260> haphazard<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:29.220> not

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
to look a little more haphazard and not

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.580 
to look a little more haphazard and not
clump<00:04:29.760> together<00:04:29.880> into<00:04:30.510> one<00:04:30.540> piece<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.290> then

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
clump together into one piece and then

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.810 
clump together into one piece and then
make<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.919> waves<00:04:32.160> look<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.460> little<00:04:32.700> more

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
make the waves look a little more

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.320 
make the waves look a little more
natural<00:04:33.300> as<00:04:33.479> well<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:34.520> then<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.550> just<00:04:35.760> continue

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
natural as well and then I just continue

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.270 
natural as well and then I just continue
doing<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.690> same<00:04:36.870> thing<00:04:37.200> all<00:04:37.440> around<00:04:37.590> until

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
doing the same thing all around until

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.450 
doing the same thing all around until
everything<00:04:38.970> was<00:04:39.150> curled<00:04:42.830> once<00:04:43.830> I<00:04:43.979> got<00:04:44.190> to<00:04:44.250> the

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
everything was curled once I got to the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.940 
everything was curled once I got to the
top<00:04:44.760> section<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:45.540> just<00:04:46.050> curled<00:04:46.290> both<00:04:46.650> of<00:04:46.830> these

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
top section I just curled both of these

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.120 
top section I just curled both of these
pieces<00:04:47.310> away<00:04:47.729> from<00:04:48.240> my<00:04:48.390> face<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:51.590> then<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.620> used

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
pieces away from my face and then I used

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.030 
pieces away from my face and then I used
a<00:04:53.370> bobby<00:04:53.640> pin<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:54.630> section<00:04:55.229> off<00:04:55.380> a<00:04:55.440> piece<00:04:55.800> of<00:04:55.830> my

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
a bobby pin to section off a piece of my

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.700 
a bobby pin to section off a piece of my
hair<00:04:56.460> away<00:04:56.669> from<00:04:56.880> my<00:04:57.150> face<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.050> same<00:04:58.320> type

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
hair away from my face and the same type

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:08.600 
hair away from my face and the same type
of<00:04:58.740> style<00:04:59.130> that<00:04:59.310> lauren<00:04:59.850> had<00:05:00.060> in<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.540> picture

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.129

just<00:05:11.290> took<00:05:11.590> my<00:05:11.770> fingertips<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.550> ran<00:05:12.820> it

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
just took my fingertips and ran it

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.640 
just took my fingertips and ran it
through<00:05:13.240> all<00:05:13.480> of<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.720> curls<00:05:13.990> just<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.410> kind<00:05:14.590> of

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
through all of the curls just to kind of
