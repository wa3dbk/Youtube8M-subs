here's<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:02.010> question<00:00:02.540> if<00:00:03.540> you<00:00:03.840> disagree<00:00:04.799> with

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
here's a question if you disagree with

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.209 
here's a question if you disagree with
the<00:00:06.839> moral<00:00:07.290> basis<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.790> law<00:00:09.679> would<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.860> still

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
the moral basis of a law would you still

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.230 
the moral basis of a law would you still
obey<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:13.549> what<00:00:14.549> makes<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.179> law<00:00:15.599> law<00:00:16.880> what<00:00:17.880> gives

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
obey it what makes a law law what gives

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.700 
obey it what makes a law law what gives
a<00:00:18.539> law<00:00:18.980> validity<00:00:21.890> why<00:00:22.890> are<00:00:23.340> laws<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> highly

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
a law validity why are laws so highly

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.970 
a law validity why are laws so highly
regarded<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.779> society

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.100 

on<00:00:32.980> one<00:00:33.220> hand<00:00:33.250> we<00:00:33.670> know<00:00:33.910> that<00:00:33.940> laws<00:00:34.540> are

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
on one hand we know that laws are

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.030 
on one hand we know that laws are
intended<00:00:35.650> to<00:00:35.940> shape<00:00:36.940> behavior<00:00:38.040> they're

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
intended to shape behavior they're

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.140 
intended to shape behavior they're
intended<00:00:39.489> to<00:00:39.520> shape<00:00:40.239> relations<00:00:41.110> between

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
intended to shape relations between

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.330 
intended to shape relations between
societal<00:00:43.150> members<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:44.559> know<00:00:44.680> that<00:00:44.920> law<00:00:45.100> is

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
societal members we know that law is

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.490 
societal members we know that law is
also<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.790> means<00:00:46.090> of<00:00:46.590> regulating<00:00:47.590> relations<00:00:48.070> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
also a means of regulating relations and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.939 
also a means of regulating relations and
imposing<00:00:50.910> particular<00:00:51.910> behaviors<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.739> one

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
imposing particular behaviors so one

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.560 
imposing particular behaviors so one
important<00:00:54.400> characteristic<00:00:54.519> well<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.390> law

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
important characteristic well the law

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.000 
important characteristic well the law
the<00:00:56.440> laws<00:00:56.710> are<00:00:57.010> preferred<00:00:57.750> practices

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the laws are preferred practices

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.220 
the laws are preferred practices
preferred<00:01:00.010> practices<00:01:00.820> that<00:01:01.780> are<00:01:01.960> articulated

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
preferred practices that are articulated

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.770 
preferred practices that are articulated
as<00:01:02.860> rules<00:01:04.260> designed<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.530> influence<00:01:06.130> behavior

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
as rules designed to influence behavior

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.539 
as rules designed to influence behavior
so<00:01:07.780> laws<00:01:08.080> are<00:01:08.650> rules<00:01:09.220> of<00:01:09.400> behavior<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:12.400> are

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
so laws are rules of behavior but are

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.680 
so laws are rules of behavior but are
encouraged<00:01:13.180> through<00:01:14.220> coercive<00:01:15.220> force<00:01:15.490> or<00:01:16.390> the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
encouraged through coercive force or the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.250 
encouraged through coercive force or the
threat<00:01:16.720> there<00:01:17.470> off<00:01:18.690> let's<00:01:19.690> consider<00:01:20.049> the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
threat there off let's consider the

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.770 
threat there off let's consider the
purpose<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:21.400> law<00:01:21.549> when<00:01:22.180> we're<00:01:22.330> referring<00:01:22.630> to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
purpose of a law when we're referring to

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.310 
purpose of a law when we're referring to
laws<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:24.400> prohibit<00:01:24.640> people<00:01:24.940> from<00:01:25.690> killing<00:01:25.930> or

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
laws to prohibit people from killing or

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.649 
laws to prohibit people from killing or
drinking<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.040> driving<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:28.030> impetus<00:01:28.630> the

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
drinking and driving the impetus the

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.130 
drinking and driving the impetus the
motivation<00:01:29.560> is<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:30.280> protect<00:01:30.640> society<00:01:31.450> so<00:01:32.020> the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
motivation is to protect society so the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.320 
motivation is to protect society so the
first<00:01:32.409> is<00:01:32.710> about<00:01:32.830> protecting<00:01:33.490> society<00:01:34.119> and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
first is about protecting society and

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.080 
first is about protecting society and
the<00:01:34.810> second<00:01:35.290> is<00:01:35.440> about<00:01:35.710> imposing<00:01:36.520> a

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
the second is about imposing a

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.760 
the second is about imposing a
particular<00:01:37.930> morality

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
particular morality

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.830 
particular morality
according<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.799> John<00:01:42.460> Stuart<00:01:42.880> Mill<00:01:43.149> law<00:01:43.600> should

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
according to John Stuart Mill law should

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.749 
according to John Stuart Mill law should
only<00:01:44.049> regulate<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.740> behavior<00:01:45.189> of<00:01:45.219> citizens

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
only regulate the behavior of citizens

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.319 
only regulate the behavior of citizens
insofar<00:01:46.630> as<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.469> behavior<00:01:48.069> directly<00:01:48.759> arms

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
insofar as that behavior directly arms

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.990 
insofar as that behavior directly arms
others<00:01:49.840> Mill<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:50.799> trying<00:01:51.189> to<00:01:51.429> protect<00:01:51.759> our

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
others Mill is trying to protect our

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.580 
others Mill is trying to protect our
personal<00:01:52.780> freedoms

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
personal freedoms

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.999 
personal freedoms
our<00:01:53.829> personal<00:01:54.369> liberties<00:01:54.659> by<00:01:55.659> saying<00:01:56.049> that

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
our personal liberties by saying that

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.910 
our personal liberties by saying that
the<00:01:57.640> baseline<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.869> that<00:01:59.049> a<00:01:59.079> person<00:01:59.500> is<00:01:59.619> free

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
the baseline is that a person is free

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.109 
the baseline is that a person is free
and<00:02:00.219> free<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.119> do<00:02:01.299> whatever<00:02:01.539> they<00:02:01.840> please<00:02:03.119> so

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
and free to do whatever they please so

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.839 
and free to do whatever they please so
long<00:02:04.420> as<00:02:04.780> that<00:02:04.920> behavior<00:02:05.920> does<00:02:06.310> not<00:02:06.340> harm

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
long as that behavior does not harm

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.619 
long as that behavior does not harm
others<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.920> we<00:02:09.039> have<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.399> think<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:09.970> harm<00:02:10.330> can

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
others so we have to think that harm can

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.199 
others so we have to think that harm can
mean<00:02:10.810> different<00:02:11.049> things<00:02:11.370> what<00:02:12.370> form<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.879> harm

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
mean different things what form of harm

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.770 
mean different things what form of harm
is<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.900> physical<00:02:14.470> harm<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.790> financial<00:02:16.180> harm

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
is it physical harm is it financial harm

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.970 
is it physical harm is it financial harm
is<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.530> emotional<00:02:17.980> harm<00:02:19.019> now<00:02:20.019> this<00:02:20.200> points<00:02:20.829> to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
is it emotional harm now this points to

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.250 
is it emotional harm now this points to
some<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.610> weaknesses<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.390> Mills<00:02:22.930> theory

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
some of the weaknesses in Mills theory

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.460 
some of the weaknesses in Mills theory
private<00:02:26.260> behaviors<00:02:27.629> sometimes<00:02:28.629> affect

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
private behaviors sometimes affect

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.789 
private behaviors sometimes affect
others<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:31.269> if<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.510> choose<00:02:31.750> not<00:02:32.079> to<00:02:32.140> wear<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.530> seat

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
others so if I choose not to wear a seat

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.069 
others so if I choose not to wear a seat
belt<00:02:32.829> and<00:02:33.220> get<00:02:33.370> into<00:02:33.609> an<00:02:33.730> accident<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.420> end<00:02:34.959> up

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
belt and get into an accident and end up

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.650 
belt and get into an accident and end up
in<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.319> hospital<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:36.849> going<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.329> have<00:02:37.510> an

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
in the hospital this is going to have an

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.390 
in the hospital this is going to have an
impact<00:02:38.230> on<00:02:38.730> healthcare<00:02:39.730> costs<00:02:40.980> ergo<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.250> is

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
impact on healthcare costs ergo this is

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.120 
impact on healthcare costs ergo this is
going<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:42.970> an<00:02:43.120> impact<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:44.049> our<00:02:44.560> tax<00:02:44.859> our

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
going to have an impact on our tax our

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.710 
going to have an impact on our tax our
collective<00:02:45.579> tax<00:02:45.940> burden<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:49.329> second

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
collective tax burden the second

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.190 
collective tax burden the second
weakness<00:02:50.109> in<00:02:50.410> Mills<00:02:51.130> theory<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:52.299> that<00:02:52.359> he<00:02:52.989> does

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
weakness in Mills theory is that he does

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.819 
weakness in Mills theory is that he does
not<00:02:53.380> explain<00:02:53.980> why<00:02:55.109> preventing<00:02:56.109> harm<00:02:56.500> to

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
not explain why preventing harm to

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.699 
not explain why preventing harm to
others<00:02:57.340> should<00:02:58.000> be<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.450> only<00:02:59.260> permissible

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
others should be the only permissible

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.140 
others should be the only permissible
basis<00:03:00.609> for<00:03:01.209> regulating<00:03:01.750> behavior<00:03:02.760> how<00:03:03.760> about

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
basis for regulating behavior how about

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.460 
basis for regulating behavior how about
harm<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.079> self

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
harm to the self

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.099 
harm to the self
what<00:03:06.400> about<00:03:06.519> harm<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.840> society<00:03:09.720> it's<00:03:10.720> even<00:03:11.049> a

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
what about harm to society it's even a

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.900 
what about harm to society it's even a
devil<00:03:11.319> in<00:03:11.530> both<00:03:11.709> disagree<00:03:12.280> with<00:03:12.519> milk

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
devil in both disagree with milk

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.690 
devil in both disagree with milk
so<00:03:13.269> what<00:03:13.389> Devlin<00:03:13.870> says<00:03:14.139> is<00:03:14.579> that<00:03:15.579> the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
so what Devlin says is that the

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.990 
so what Devlin says is that the
government<00:03:16.239> has<00:03:16.359> a<00:03:16.930> right<00:03:17.319> to<00:03:17.889> protect<00:03:18.069> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
government has a right to protect the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.159 
government has a right to protect the
moral<00:03:19.569> fabric<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.590> society<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.569> Devlin<00:03:23.049> is

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
moral fabric of society so a Devlin is

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.309 
moral fabric of society so a Devlin is
saying<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:23.769> laws<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.639> prohibit

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
saying is that laws that prohibit

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.460 
saying is that laws that prohibit
immoral<00:03:26.319> behavior<00:03:27.840> are<00:03:28.840> valid

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.430 

and<00:03:31.920> what<00:03:32.070> Stephen<00:03:32.580> says<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.990> government

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
and what Stephen says is the government

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.550 
and what Stephen says is the government
can<00:03:34.680> regulate<00:03:35.100> any<00:03:35.610> behavior<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.200> state

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
can regulate any behavior that the state

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.170 
can regulate any behavior that the state
deems<00:03:38.660> immoral

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.190 

who<00:03:44.180> defines<00:03:44.630> what's<00:03:45.170> moral<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:46.040> what<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.520> not

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
who defines what's moral and what is not

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.070 
who defines what's moral and what is not
second<00:03:48.200> does<00:03:49.190> morality<00:03:49.610> always<00:03:50.570> stay<00:03:50.870> the

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
second does morality always stay the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.930 
second does morality always stay the
same

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
same

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.080 
same
these<00:03:52.940> are<00:03:53.120> all<00:03:53.330> very<00:03:53.690> highly<00:03:54.500> subjective

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
these are all very highly subjective

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.530 
these are all very highly subjective
topics<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.780> very<00:03:57.190> person<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.310> person<00:03:58.520> so<00:03:59.390> when

topics the very person to person so when

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.300 
topics the very person to person so when
you<00:03:59.630> allow<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.050> government<00:04:00.800> to<00:04:00.950> regulate

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
you allow the government to regulate

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.300 
you allow the government to regulate
morality<00:04:02.180> what<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.780> are<00:04:02.930> doing<00:04:03.320> is<00:04:03.560> allowing

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
morality what you are doing is allowing

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.170 
morality what you are doing is allowing

natural<00:04:13.610> law<00:04:13.790> theory<00:04:14.090> puts<00:04:14.690> forward<00:04:14.960> an

natural law theory puts forward an

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.620 
natural law theory puts forward an
answer<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.710> that<00:04:15.740> question<00:04:15.860> what<00:04:16.790> gives<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.330> law

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
answer to that question what gives a law

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.920 
answer to that question what gives a law
validity<00:04:18.610> now<00:04:19.610> natural<00:04:20.090> law<00:04:20.270> theorists

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
validity now natural law theorists

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.670 
validity now natural law theorists
determine<00:04:21.800> the<00:04:21.980> validity<00:04:22.280> of<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.670> law<00:04:23.680> by

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
determine the validity of a law by

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.180 
determine the validity of a law by
reference<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.030> moral<00:04:26.890> authority<00:04:27.890> that

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
reference to a moral authority that

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.980 
reference to a moral authority that
exists<00:04:28.790> beyond<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:30.110> law<00:04:30.320> itself<00:04:31.930> now<00:04:32.930> the

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
exists beyond the law itself now the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.200 
exists beyond the law itself now the
most<00:04:33.230> important<00:04:33.740> element<00:04:34.280> for<00:04:34.460> natural<00:04:35.030> law

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
most important element for natural law

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.610 
most important element for natural law
theorists<00:04:36.010> is<00:04:37.010> that<00:04:37.370> law<00:04:37.850> is<00:04:38.420> not<00:04:38.840> regarded<00:04:39.470> as

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
theorists is that law is not regarded as

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.430 
theorists is that law is not regarded as
separate<00:04:40.370> from<00:04:40.850> morality<00:04:41.680> but<00:04:42.680> rather<00:04:42.950> law<00:04:43.850> is

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
separate from morality but rather law is

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.430 
separate from morality but rather law is
subordinate<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.500> that<00:04:45.920> morality<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.990> natural

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
subordinate to that morality so natural

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.630 
subordinate to that morality so natural
law<00:04:48.620> theorists<00:04:50.320> say<00:04:51.320> that<00:04:51.560> yes<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:52.250> may<00:04:52.580> be

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
law theorists say that yes it may be

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.750 
law theorists say that yes it may be
difficult<00:04:53.570> to<00:04:53.990> determine<00:04:54.550> what<00:04:55.550> our

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
difficult to determine what our

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.780 
difficult to determine what our
fundamental<00:04:56.570> moral<00:04:56.900> principles<00:04:57.650> are<00:04:59.080> however

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
fundamental moral principles are however

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.860 
fundamental moral principles are however
there<00:05:01.790> are<00:05:02.000> sources<00:05:02.420> that<00:05:03.230> can<00:05:03.470> be<00:05:03.560> drawn<00:05:03.950> upon

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
there are sources that can be drawn upon

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.700 
there are sources that can be drawn upon
via<00:05:05.870> which<00:05:06.140> we<00:05:06.350> can<00:05:06.530> formulate<00:05:07.180> certain<00:05:08.180> rules

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
via which we can formulate certain rules

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.590 
via which we can formulate certain rules
certain<00:05:09.710> regulations<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:11.150> are<00:05:11.210> going<00:05:11.300> to

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
certain regulations that are going to

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.560 
certain regulations that are going to
guide<00:05:12.050> our<00:05:12.800> behavior<00:05:13.310> our<00:05:14.120> collective

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
guide our behavior our collective

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.650 
guide our behavior our collective
behavior<00:05:15.310> so<00:05:16.310> this<00:05:16.460> moral<00:05:16.850> authority<00:05:17.330> usually

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
behavior so this moral authority usually

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.650 
behavior so this moral authority usually
comes<00:05:17.900> from<00:05:18.020> three<00:05:18.380> sources<00:05:18.760> one<00:05:19.760> is<00:05:20.090> a

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
comes from three sources one is a

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.770 
comes from three sources one is a
religious<00:05:21.170> source<00:05:21.730> so<00:05:22.730> we<00:05:22.910> look<00:05:23.090> at<00:05:23.300> would

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
religious source so we look at would

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.400 
religious source so we look at would
refer<00:05:24.080> to<00:05:24.290> as<00:05:24.470> holy<00:05:24.890> books<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:26.110> these<00:05:27.110> holy

refer to as holy books and these holy

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.010 
refer to as holy books and these holy
books<00:05:27.740> contain<00:05:28.250> a<00:05:28.520> certain<00:05:29.060> code<00:05:29.300> these

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
books contain a certain code these

morality<00:05:33.520> another<00:05:34.520> source<00:05:34.880> is<00:05:35.180> what<00:05:35.330> we<00:05:35.450> refer

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
morality another source is what we refer
