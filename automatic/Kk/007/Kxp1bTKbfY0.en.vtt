00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
button there is one of these guys here

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.930 
button there is one of these guys here
and<00:00:53.500> there's<00:00:53.710> two<00:00:54.040> days<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:54.519> I<00:00:54.549> need<00:00:54.580> to<00:00:54.760> get

and there's two days and I need to get

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.490 
and there's two days and I need to get
that<00:00:55.150> somehow<00:00:56.850> wondering<00:00:57.850> if<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.059> do<00:00:58.119> that

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that somehow wondering if I do that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.399 
that somehow wondering if I do that
maybe<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.530> bit<00:00:59.680> in<00:00:59.890> a<00:00:59.920> bit<00:01:00.220> higher<00:01:01.409> something

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
maybe a bit in a bit higher something

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.399 
maybe a bit in a bit higher something
like<00:01:02.830> there<00:01:03.330> will<00:01:04.330> that<00:01:04.920> lock<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.250> s<00:01:06.400> haha

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
like there will that lock it the s haha

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.100 
like there will that lock it the s haha
so<00:01:08.409> its<00:01:08.530> first<00:01:08.590> keep<00:01:09.010> done<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:10.689> the<00:01:10.750> second

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
so its first keep done for the second

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.460 
so its first keep done for the second
cube<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:12.540> i'm<00:01:13.540> assuming<00:01:13.840> i<00:01:14.049> need<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.229> get<00:01:14.350> that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
cube and i'm assuming i need to get that

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.710 
cube and i'm assuming i need to get that
button<00:01:14.830> in<00:01:14.950> there<00:01:15.189> so<00:01:15.400> if<00:01:15.549> i<00:01:15.640> do<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.820> that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
button in there so if i do that that

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.760 
button in there so if i do that that
should<00:01:17.200> be<00:01:17.500> small<00:01:18.280> enough<00:01:18.310> gap<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.210> hop<00:01:19.330> over

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
should be small enough gap to hop over

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.980 
should be small enough gap to hop over
yeah<00:01:20.770> yeah<00:01:21.010> it's<00:01:21.159> fine<00:01:21.310> yeah<00:01:21.490> cool<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:22.719> so
