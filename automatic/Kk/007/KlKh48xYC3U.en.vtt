00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:19.000
 here is the arrival of the newt in addition to this 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:20.410
 sum is the latest novelty one can 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.140
 not really talking about what you are talking about 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.960
 or air but it's still a 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.050
 touring machine the suspensions are 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.570
 firm enough to hold the starting 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.370
 speed we have a good feeling of the 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.059
 direction even though I noticed that 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.230
 low speed 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.649
 she seems pretty heavy the machine is 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.649
 nerve 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.000
 the bars had been racing by 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.000
 compared to true fighter 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.350
 you allow to be agile and manageable 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.010
 he had his hands to the promoters in 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.010
 revisions 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.579
 that's why not everything 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.579
 the machine stays fun 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.960
 slide easily especially loved 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.960
 montrichard 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.950
 h yes 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.730
 pretty effective whether it's the right one 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.880
 on the other hand 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.680
 the couple is at worst 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.520
 we have 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.520
 maraka bella pella 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.070
 raise but good 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.050
 triton goes into gear and 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.720
 climbing capacity for 2013 with this set 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.370
 without ferry 1 compact craft finally 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.620
 not too impressive because taking over the 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.300
 basis of the 400th back out two years ago 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.430
 and as there is not even a mark 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.200
 to report his name and he displacement 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.030
 is very discreet but in his 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.690
 there is a powerful mono block 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.340
 cylinder of 686 cubic centimeters before 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.140
 to settle on board we linger 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.850
 easily on a host of details and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.400
 of equipment that the newt 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.170
 it is the heating handles hitch 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.220
 is taking trailer walk in 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.780
 aluminum storage with usb socket 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.340
 gas cap with key under hatch without 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.750
 forget all the classic of a quad 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.209
 fighter at the level of the transmission 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.190
 with short box and long and walking 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.570
 back 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.970
 the front side with four lights 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.590
 lenticular reminiscent of the quads tgb and 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.550
 the rear is more original with 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.550
 beautiful led lights 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.340
 we note the generous door package that 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.220
 also ensures the protection of 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.659
 bodywork we appreciate the bay 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.129
 instrumentation that does not fail 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.849
 to be complete and offer a good 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.830
 visibility 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.690
 the handlebar is protected by blocks 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.769
 steel square section that 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.569
 will withstand all possible shocks the 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.220
 transmission lever changes to hand 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.349
 left is the mode of transmission 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.390
 is done on the right handlebar so 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.790
 classic with push to go 4 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.400
 2 in 4 4 and rotation for blocking 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.110
 differential attention to the distracted ones because 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.450
 it's going to slow down and especially 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.579
 can start hold of the same for the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.620
 parking brake located on the left hand and 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.390
 that we easily forget 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.129
 the passenger was somewhat sacrificed 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.629
 silas it has an extension 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.489
 independent to offer us and plates 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.319
 descent the raised steps are 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.690
 deported to the outside and imposes 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.930
 to open legs at nearly 180 degrees 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.769
 hard for adductors the boot 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.629
 but in the mood 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.849
 not that the engine is noisy but we 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.440
 immediately feel the strength of Block 4 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.920
 time in the hoarse sound and the 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.920
 revolved 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.959
 the power is there because we feel the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.290
 Sorting to jump and take off wheels 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.480
 before 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.010
 as soon as we open the gases in large numbers 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.829
 tracks being rolling with areas 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.659
 stained lobag face with efficiency of 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.280
 rugged areas highlighting its 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.310
 good suspensions and its 4 wheels 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.310
 independent 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.819
 we are a little shaken but the trajectory 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.829
 is precise and controlled 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.629
 we are not far from the behavior 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.129
 of a sports quad while the newt 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.129
 still exceeds 300 kg 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.760
 the four disc brakes are there for 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.680
 stop the quad and be seduced 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.139
 by the pedal coupling which ensures a 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.729
 perfect distribution without blocking them 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.889
 athletes will find just a lack of 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.690
 biting 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.340
 under the tune of a super- equipped fighter 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.900
 finally hides a shivering newt 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.699
 which has nothing to envy to some 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.520
 athletes and offers the advantage of proposing 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.139
 different usages look back 700 is so 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.470
 a success on this plane very well 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.580
 powered by this blog 701 injection on 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.260
 the appreciated also the good 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.540
 integration of equipment and their 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.919
 number is finally not a maxi 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.020
 fighters as one might think 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.030
 but a super versatile that just has 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.690
 forgot to worry about the passenger and 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.690
 the consumption 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.360
 but no
