00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
video games - now we're both a fan of

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.200 
video games - now we're both a fan of
Pokemon<00:00:32.599> Mario<00:00:33.440> Zelda<00:00:33.890> Super<00:00:34.760> Smash<00:00:34.879> Brothers

Pokemon Mario Zelda Super Smash Brothers

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.810 
Pokemon Mario Zelda Super Smash Brothers
Mario<00:00:35.750> Kart<00:00:36.109> Kirby<00:00:36.769> Metroid<00:00:37.370> were<00:00:37.550> a<00:00:37.579> fan<00:00:37.789> of

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
Mario Kart Kirby Metroid were a fan of

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.090 
Mario Kart Kirby Metroid were a fan of
almost<00:00:38.149> every<00:00:38.420> single<00:00:38.629> Nintendo<00:00:39.230> series<00:00:39.649> so

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
almost every single Nintendo series so

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.349 
almost every single Nintendo series so
choosing<00:00:40.429> one<00:00:40.609> game<00:00:40.789> is<00:00:40.940> really<00:00:41.179> difficult

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
choosing one game is really difficult

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.599 
choosing one game is really difficult
but<00:00:41.989> if<00:00:42.079> I<00:00:42.230> had<00:00:42.379> to<00:00:42.500> have<00:00:42.620> my<00:00:42.649> choice<00:00:43.010> first<00:00:43.399> of

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
but if I had to have my choice first of

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.400 
but if I had to have my choice first of
all<00:00:43.730> I<00:00:43.910> think<00:00:44.329> it<00:00:44.420> all<00:00:44.570> boils<00:00:44.899> down<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.079> them

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
all I think it all boils down to them

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.380 
all I think it all boils down to them
playing<00:00:45.679> something<00:00:46.010> from<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:46.280> original<00:00:46.850> NES

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
playing something from the original NES

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.079 
playing something from the original NES
console<00:00:48.079> now<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:48.890> console<00:00:49.339> is<00:00:49.429> so<00:00:49.699> iconic

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
console now this console is so iconic

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.479 
console now this console is so iconic
but<00:00:50.839> it<00:00:51.019> is<00:00:51.199> also<00:00:51.440> a<00:00:51.620> great<00:00:51.800> introduction<00:00:52.309> to

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
but it is also a great introduction to

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.759 
but it is also a great introduction to
videogames<00:00:53.120> because<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.960> controller<00:00:54.469> is

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
videogames because the controller is

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.889 
videogames because the controller is
really<00:00:55.219> really<00:00:55.370> simple<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:55.910> basic<00:00:56.359> there's

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
really really simple and basic there's

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.660 
really really simple and basic there's
just<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.320> d-pad<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.039> most<00:00:58.219> of<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.339> time<00:00:58.489> they're

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
just a d-pad so most of the time they're

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.459 
just a d-pad so most of the time they're
holding<00:00:58.969> a<00:00:59.030> right<00:00:59.210> or<00:00:59.420> left<00:00:59.449> and<00:00:59.989> they<00:01:00.350> only

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
holding a right or left and they only

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.919 
holding a right or left and they only
have<00:01:00.649> to<00:01:00.769> use<00:01:00.859> the<00:01:00.980> buttons<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.609> B<00:01:01.850> as<00:01:01.999> well<00:01:02.359> so

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
have to use the buttons and B as well so

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.300 
have to use the buttons and B as well so
because<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.289> that<00:01:03.320> option<00:01:03.710> I<00:01:03.980> think<00:01:04.160> that's

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:04.310 
because of that option I think that's

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.920 
because of that option I think that's
great<00:01:04.460> for<00:01:04.700> a<00:01:04.790> young<00:01:04.850> kid<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.270> get<00:01:05.480> into<00:01:05.810> video

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
great for a young kid to get into video

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.530 
great for a young kid to get into video
games<00:01:06.310> only<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.340> few<00:01:07.580> options<00:01:07.730> and<00:01:08.210> it's<00:01:08.360> very

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
games only a few options and it's very

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.300 
games only a few options and it's very
simple<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.230> graphics<00:01:09.650> will<00:01:09.800> be<00:01:09.890> 8-bit

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
simple and the graphics will be 8-bit

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.160 
simple and the graphics will be 8-bit
which<00:01:10.550> is<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:10.880> retro<00:01:11.120> and<00:01:11.480> so<00:01:11.600> perfect<00:01:12.020> for<00:01:12.050> a

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
which is so retro and so perfect for a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.500 
which is so retro and so perfect for a
kid<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:12.500> just<00:01:12.680> learn<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:13.580> think<00:01:13.610> if<00:01:14.300> you're

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
kid to just learn and I think if you're

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.420 
kid to just learn and I think if you're
starting<00:01:14.810> with<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.110> NES<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.890> really<00:01:16.160> do<00:01:16.310> have

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
starting with the NES you really do have

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.500 
starting with the NES you really do have
to<00:01:16.550> start<00:01:16.760> with<00:01:16.910> something<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:17.210> is<00:01:17.360> so

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
to start with something that is so

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.450 
to start with something that is so
iconic<00:01:17.660> and<00:01:18.110> perhaps<00:01:18.380> save<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.220> gaming

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
iconic and perhaps save the gaming

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.610 
iconic and perhaps save the gaming
industry<00:01:19.580> I<00:01:20.060> would<00:01:20.570> start<00:01:20.840> them<00:01:20.990> on<00:01:21.140> Super

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
industry I would start them on Super

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.580 
industry I would start them on Super
Mario<00:01:21.650> Bros<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.640> original<00:01:23.240> game<00:01:23.570> this<00:01:24.260> is<00:01:24.410> all

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
Mario Bros the original game this is all

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.880 
Mario Bros the original game this is all
the<00:01:24.650> way<00:01:24.710> back<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:25.100> think<00:01:25.160> from<00:01:25.600> 1985<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.380> so

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
the way back I think from 1985 it is so

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.560 
the way back I think from 1985 it is so
old<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.460> my<00:01:28.610> kids<00:01:28.850> are<00:01:28.940> finally<00:01:29.270> born<00:01:29.450> and

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
old and my kids are finally born and

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.520 
old and my kids are finally born and
they're<00:01:29.660> able<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.870> play<00:01:30.050> this<00:01:30.200> whether

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
they're able to play this whether

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.800 
they're able to play this whether
they're<00:01:30.740> two<00:01:31.340> three<00:01:31.730> four<00:01:31.970> or<00:01:32.090> five<00:01:32.270> years<00:01:32.480> old

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
they're two three four or five years old

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.930 
they're two three four or five years old
the<00:01:33.200> game<00:01:33.380> will<00:01:33.500> be<00:01:33.590> even<00:01:33.890> older<00:01:34.310> but<00:01:34.820> it's

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
the game will be even older but it's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.610 
the game will be even older but it's
just<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.270> perfect<00:01:35.480> tutorial<00:01:36.170> for<00:01:36.410> video

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
just the perfect tutorial for video

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.500 
just the perfect tutorial for video
games<00:01:36.920> in<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.610> very<00:01:37.820> first<00:01:38.120> level<00:01:38.480> you

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
games in the very first level you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.360 
games in the very first level you
actually<00:01:38.990> hit<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:39.200> mushroom<00:01:39.530> block<00:01:39.950> the

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
actually hit that mushroom block the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.280 
actually hit that mushroom block the
mushroom<00:01:40.700> goes<00:01:40.910> it<00:01:41.150> hits<00:01:41.300> a<00:01:41.420> pipe<00:01:41.660> and<00:01:41.930> then<00:01:42.200> it

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
mushroom goes it hits a pipe and then it

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.140 
mushroom goes it hits a pipe and then it

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.880 
actually is rebounded back to you you're
almost<00:01:44.330> forced<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.080> get<00:01:45.230> it<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.470> see<00:01:45.680> that<00:01:45.830> you

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890
