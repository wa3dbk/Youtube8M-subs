00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
there is a bad little map of Africa that

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.480 
there is a bad little map of Africa that
can<00:00:03.389> be<00:00:03.449> like<00:00:03.600> that<00:00:03.750> ready<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.410> here<00:00:04.980> is<00:00:05.250> a

can be like that ready and here is a
badly<00:00:06.150> drawn<00:00:06.420> map<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:07.020> South<00:00:07.290> America<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:08.130> will

badly drawn map of South America I will

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.650 
badly drawn map of South America I will
do<00:00:08.670> them<00:00:08.820> both<00:00:09.170> okay<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:11.090> what<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.480> notice

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
do them both okay so what do you notice

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.990 
do them both okay so what do you notice
about<00:00:12.840> these<00:00:13.230> two<00:00:13.290> what<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.190> noticed<00:00:14.910> about

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
about these two what I noticed about

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000 
about these two what I noticed about
these<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:15.480> ages<00:00:16.049> ago<00:00:16.170> when<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.619> was<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.800> primary

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
these two ages ago when I was in primary

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.980 
these two ages ago when I was in primary
school<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.670> as<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> result<00:00:18.300> got<00:00:18.420> lost<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.750> cover

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
school and as a result got lost in cover

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.429 
school and as a result got lost in cover
for<00:00:19.199> four<00:00:19.350> months<00:00:19.619> was<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:21.109> they<00:00:22.109> fit

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
for four months was that they fit

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.800 
for four months was that they fit
together<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:27.269> sort<00:00:27.599> of

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
together like that and so that sort of

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.140 
together like that and so that sort of
suggests<00:00:28.039> that<00:00:29.039> I'm<00:00:29.369> trying<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.699> get<00:00:29.820> rid<00:00:30.119> of

suggests that I'm trying to get rid of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.580 
suggests that I'm trying to get rid of
the<00:00:30.300> emotional<00:00:30.689> baggage<00:00:30.810> that's<00:00:31.109> connected

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the emotional baggage that's connected

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.049 
the emotional baggage that's connected
with<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.830> observation<00:00:32.130> because<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.880> what

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
with that observation because of what

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.389 
with that observation because of what
happened<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> result<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.800> take<00:00:35.219> into

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
happened as a result if you take into

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.130 
happened as a result if you take into
account<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.850> continental<00:00:36.390> shelves<00:00:36.690> which

konzern's consonants in particular South
America<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.110> Africa<00:00:43.320> tend<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.890> fit<00:00:44.070> together

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
America and Africa tend to fit together

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.010 
America and Africa tend to fit together
very<00:00:44.789> well<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.789> in<00:00:47.789> fact<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.690> see<00:00:48.840> that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
very well and in fact you can see that

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.979 
very well and in fact you can see that
in<00:00:49.079> other<00:00:49.170> places<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.649> for<00:00:50.100> example

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
in other places like for example

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.209 
in other places like for example
Antarctica<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.260> southern<00:00:52.770> coast<00:00:53.039> of

Antarctica and the southern coast of

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.029 
Antarctica and the southern coast of
Australia<00:00:53.850> also<00:00:54.510> fit<00:00:54.809> together<00:00:55.140> very<00:00:55.230> well

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
Australia also fit together very well

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.790 
Australia also fit together very well
so<00:00:57.949> that<00:00:58.949> observation<00:00:59.420> was<00:01:00.420> made<00:01:00.809> by<00:01:01.320> Alfred

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800

another example is the coal deposits

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.280 
another example is the coal deposits

world and then there's a plant fossil

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.610 
world and then there's a plant fossil
called<00:02:32.130> glossopteris<00:02:32.520> which<00:02:33.510> again<00:02:33.870> exists

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
called glossopteris which again exists

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.390 
called glossopteris which again exists
all<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.830> way<00:02:34.920> across<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.250> southern

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
all the way across the southern

continents but not in lowland continents

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.790 
continents but not in lowland continents
and<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.760> they<00:02:42.150> had<00:02:42.690> some<00:02:43.080> kind<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.440> theory<00:02:43.709> or

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
and so they had some kind of theory or

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.920 
and so they had some kind of theory or

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
joined together and the idea was that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.580 
joined together and the idea was that
these<00:02:59.610> languages<00:03:00.150> enabled<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.170> animals<00:03:01.470> and

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
these languages enabled the animals and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.920 
these languages enabled the animals and

century then vegan or had his theory

century then vegan or had his theory
he'd<00:03:16.590> already<00:03:16.739> had<00:03:17.040> his<00:03:17.160> theory<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:17.910> thing<00:03:18.180> is

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
he'd already had his theory but thing is

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.750 
he'd already had his theory but thing is
he<00:03:19.110> couldn't<00:03:19.320> explain<00:03:19.650> how<00:03:19.890> these<00:03:20.040> things<00:03:20.370> in

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
he couldn't explain how these things in

all<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.000> land<00:03:21.269> masters<00:03:21.600> could<00:03:21.720> float<00:03:22.110> around

all this land masters could float around

all this land masters could float around
and<00:03:22.860> join<00:03:23.280> together<00:03:23.459> like<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> jigsaw<00:03:24.180> puzzle

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
and join together like a jigsaw puzzle

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.670 
and join together like a jigsaw puzzle
there<00:03:26.510> he<00:03:27.510> came<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.930> with<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.140> idea<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.470> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
there he came up with this idea of the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.180 
there he came up with this idea of the
component<00:03:29.250> floor<00:03:30.290> but<00:03:31.290> he<00:03:31.560> was<00:03:31.709> very<00:03:31.739> much<00:03:32.040> on

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
component floor but he was very much on

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.890 
component floor but he was very much on
the<00:03:32.310> fringes<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.000> think<00:03:33.239> we<00:03:33.450> should<00:03:33.690> bear

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
the fringes and I think we should bear

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.570 
the fringes and I think we should bear
in<00:03:34.019> mind<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.920> lot<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.160> scientific

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
in mind that a lot of scientific

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.120 
in mind that a lot of scientific
hypotheses<00:03:36.540> do<00:03:36.780> start<00:03:37.110> off<00:03:37.170> on<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.680> fringes

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
hypotheses do start off on the fringes

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.770 
hypotheses do start off on the fringes
so<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.579> lot<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.790> things<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.120> we<00:03:39.239> might<00:03:39.480> think

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
so a lot of things that we might think

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.199 
so a lot of things that we might think
of<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.110> strange<00:03:40.440> science<00:03:40.739> nowadays<00:03:41.280> could<00:03:42.090> in

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
of the strange science nowadays could in

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.259 
of the strange science nowadays could in
fact<00:03:42.470> be<00:03:43.470> mainstream<00:03:44.130> science<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.670> at<00:03:45.030> some

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
fact be mainstream science and at some

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.920 
fact be mainstream science and at some
point<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.660> future<00:03:46.790> however<00:03:47.790> then<00:03:48.600> it

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
point in the future however then it

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.900 
point in the future however then it
turned<00:03:49.200> out<00:03:49.350> that<00:03:49.410> somebody<00:03:50.010> discovers<00:03:50.610> that

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
turned out that somebody discovers that

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.229 
turned out that somebody discovers that
what<00:03:51.150> one<00:03:52.019> thing<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.440> happens<00:03:52.920> with<00:03:53.340> lava

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
what one thing that happens with lava

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.789 
what one thing that happens with lava
and<00:03:54.570> magma<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.110> interior<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.709> earth

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
and magma in the interior of the earth

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.520 
and magma in the interior of the earth
wasn't<00:03:56.100> ly<00:03:56.310> welled<00:03:56.610> up<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.180> pushed<00:03:57.870> things<00:03:58.350> a

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
wasn't ly welled up and pushed things a

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.470 
wasn't ly welled up and pushed things a
lot<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:59.040> so<00:03:59.549> what<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.880> have<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.299> you<00:04:00.450> have

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
lot and so what you have is you have

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.710 
lot and so what you have is you have
these<00:04:00.840> zones<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.590> middle<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.370> oceans<00:04:02.820> but

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
these zones in middle of the oceans but

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.660 
these zones in middle of the oceans but
with<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.989> exception<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.530> Pacific<00:04:05.010> which

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
with the exception of the Pacific which

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.100 
with the exception of the Pacific which
push<00:04:06.120> apart<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:07.220> they<00:04:08.220> drive<00:04:09.110> continents

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
push apart and they drive continents

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.319 
push apart and they drive continents
apart<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.680> they<00:04:10.799> move<00:04:11.010> them<00:04:11.250> around<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.910> if

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
apart and they move them around and if

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.210 
apart and they move them around and if
you<00:04:12.450> run<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:13.079> film<00:04:13.320> backwards<00:04:13.829> as<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.100> were

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
you run the film backwards as it were

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.759 
you run the film backwards as it were
you<00:04:14.489> end<00:04:14.940> up<00:04:15.120> with<00:04:15.900> something<00:04:16.229> that<00:04:16.470> looks

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
you end up with something that looks

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.710 
you end up with something that looks

India's<00:04:24.720> in<00:04:24.900> there<00:04:25.080> some<00:04:25.290> of<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.470> Indians<00:04:25.800> in

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
India's in there some of the Indians in

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.050 
India's in there some of the Indians in
there<00:04:26.070> somewhere<00:04:26.220> as<00:04:26.370> well

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
there somewhere as well

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.400 
there somewhere as well
North<00:04:27.600> America<00:04:28.230> is<00:04:28.350> there<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:28.770> think<00:04:30.410> your

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
North America is there I think your

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.600 
North America is there I think your
rages<00:04:32.010> there<00:04:32.480> that<00:04:33.480> is<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.900> future

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
rages there that is the future

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.000 
rages there that is the future
Mediterranean<00:04:35.610> Sea<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.500> so<00:04:37.500> forth<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:37.890> they

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
Mediterranean Sea and so forth so they

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.610 
Mediterranean Sea and so forth so they
were<00:04:38.070> all<00:04:38.220> joined<00:04:38.460> together<00:04:38.670> in<00:04:39.000> one<00:04:39.030> place

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
were all joined together in one place

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.530 
were all joined together in one place
then<00:04:40.620> we're<00:04:40.800> lost<00:04:40.950> in<00:04:41.040> space<00:04:41.450> so<00:04:43.880> that's<00:04:44.880> the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
then we're lost in space so that's the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.570 
then we're lost in space so that's the
theory<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:46.020> people<00:04:46.170> have<00:04:46.530> nowadays<00:04:46.890> and

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
theory that people have nowadays and

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.580 
theory that people have nowadays and
it's<00:04:48.240> supported<00:04:48.780> by<00:04:48.930> various<00:04:49.260> bits<00:04:49.470> of

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
it's supported by various bits of

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.530 
it's supported by various bits of
evidence<00:04:49.770> for<00:04:50.100> example<00:04:50.220> this<00:04:50.760> winning<00:04:51.150> up<00:04:51.300> if

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
evidence for example this winning up if

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.020 
evidence for example this winning up if
you<00:04:51.690> look<00:04:52.110> at<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.320> Atlantic<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.400> magnetic

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
you look at the Atlantic the magnetic

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.330 
you look at the Atlantic the magnetic
field<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.540> earth<00:04:54.600> shifts<00:04:55.140> around<00:04:55.500> now<00:04:56.070> if

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
field of the earth shifts around now if

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.460 
field of the earth shifts around now if
there<00:04:56.520> are<00:04:56.640> magnetic<00:04:56.910> particles<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:57.810> lava

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
there are magnetic particles in lava

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.920 
there are magnetic particles in lava
these<00:04:58.710> can<00:04:58.950> be<00:04:59.040> moved<00:04:59.340> so<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.210> Lily<00:05:00.480> align

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
these can be moved so that Lily align

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.200 
these can be moved so that Lily align
with<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.980> lines<00:05:02.310> of<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.670> earth<00:05:02.760> they<00:05:03.030> the

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
with the lines of the earth they the

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.840 
with the lines of the earth they the
magnets<00:05:03.660> before<00:05:04.290> it<00:05:04.500> solidifies<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.730> then

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
magnets before it solidifies and then

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.000 
magnets before it solidifies and then
that<00:05:06.000> they<00:05:06.150> spread<00:05:06.660> what<00:05:07.170> you<00:05:07.320> find<00:05:07.710> is<00:05:07.980> that

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
that they spread what you find is that

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.010 
that they spread what you find is that
there<00:05:08.310> are<00:05:08.460> symmetrical<00:05:09.390> stripes

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
there are symmetrical stripes

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.860 
there are symmetrical stripes
on<00:05:10.170> each<00:05:10.470> side<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.950> ocean<00:05:11.420> which<00:05:12.420> match

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
on each side of the ocean which match

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.720 
on each side of the ocean which match
these<00:05:13.290> things<00:05:13.650> so<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:13.830> strong<00:05:14.160> is<00:05:14.280> just<00:05:14.580> that

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
these things so that strong is just that

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.950 
these things so that strong is just that
that's<00:05:14.880> what's<00:05:15.210> happening<00:05:15.300> there's<00:05:15.750> a<00:05:15.780> sort

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
that's what's happening there's a sort

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.870 
that's what's happening there's a sort
of<00:05:16.020> convey<00:05:16.380> about<00:05:16.650> process<00:05:17.070> going<00:05:17.340> on<00:05:17.460> that

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
of convey about process going on that

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.700 
of convey about process going on that
pushes<00:05:18.300> them<00:05:18.450> apart<00:05:18.570> so<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:22.110> idea<00:05:22.380> of<00:05:22.440> pools

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
pushes them apart so the idea of pools

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.040 
pushes them apart so the idea of pools
lost<00:05:23.040> is<00:05:23.250> no<00:05:23.400> longer<00:05:23.670> necessary<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.480> the

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
lost is no longer necessary and the

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.100 
lost is no longer necessary and the
theory<00:05:25.530> becomes<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.920> lot<00:05:26.040> simpler<00:05:26.720> but<00:05:27.720> still

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
theory becomes a lot simpler but still

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.780 
theory becomes a lot simpler but still
had<00:05:28.470> quite<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.920> lot<00:05:29.130> of<00:05:29.160> difficulty<00:05:29.490> being

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
had quite a lot of difficulty being

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.950 
had quite a lot of difficulty being
accepted<00:05:30.360> I<00:05:30.420> think<00:05:30.600> it<00:05:30.690> didn't<00:05:30.900> actually

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
accepted I think it didn't actually

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.320 
accepted I think it didn't actually
happen<00:05:31.260> until<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:31.620> sixties<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.550> that<00:05:33.090> is<00:05:33.210> the

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
happen until the sixties and that is the

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.790 
happen until the sixties and that is the
interesting<00:05:33.720> thing<00:05:34.140> from<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.410> point<00:05:34.650> of<00:05:34.740> view

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
interesting thing from the point of view

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.460 
interesting thing from the point of view
of<00:05:35.190> science<00:05:35.670> the<00:05:36.630> way<00:05:36.810> that<00:05:37.020> scientific

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
of science the way that scientific

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.110 
of science the way that scientific
theories<00:05:37.800> work<00:05:38.100> and<00:05:38.460> that's<00:05:38.610> connected<00:05:38.790> to<00:05:39.000> a

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
theories work and that's connected to a

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.440 
theories work and that's connected to a
kuhnian<00:05:39.660> view<00:05:40.290> of<00:05:40.500> science<00:05:40.800> now<00:05:41.550> I<00:05:41.850> have<00:05:42.420> a

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
kuhnian view of science now I have a

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.210 
kuhnian view of science now I have a
very<00:05:42.720> strong<00:05:43.050> kuhnian<00:05:43.530> view<00:05:43.710> of<00:05:43.800> blows<00:05:43.980> both

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
very strong kuhnian view of blows both

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.450 
very strong kuhnian view of blows both
sides<00:05:44.490> and<00:05:44.730> philosophy<00:05:45.920> and<00:05:46.920> I<00:05:46.980> can<00:05:47.190> go<00:05:47.310> into

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
sides and philosophy and I can go into

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.980 
sides and philosophy and I can go into
that<00:05:47.640> but<00:05:47.880> it's<00:05:48.090> not<00:05:48.270> really<00:05:48.570> part<00:05:48.750> of<00:05:48.810> big

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
that but it's not really part of big

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.920 
that but it's not really part of big
science<00:05:49.470> if<00:05:50.160> it<00:05:50.370> is<00:05:50.490> to<00:05:50.670> do<00:05:50.880> we're<00:05:51.240> a<00:05:51.510> book<00:05:51.750> that

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
science if it is to do we're a book that

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.880 
science if it is to do we're a book that
he<00:05:52.050> wrote<00:05:52.080> called<00:05:52.410> the<00:05:52.470> structure<00:05:52.710> of

he wrote called the structure of

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.890 
he wrote called the structure of
scientific<00:05:53.250> revolutions<00:05:53.460> which<00:05:54.210> basically<00:05:54.570> I

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
scientific revolutions which basically I

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.470 
scientific revolutions which basically I
think<00:05:55.470> under<00:05:55.830> face<00:05:56.010> of<00:05:56.190> disguise<00:05:56.640> Marxist

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
think under face of disguise Marxist

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.710 
think under face of disguise Marxist
view<00:05:57.570> of<00:05:57.960> how<00:05:58.500> science<00:05:58.980> changes<00:05:59.610> and<00:06:00.570> I'm

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
view of how science changes and I'm

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.330 
view of how science changes and I'm
going<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:00.900> cover<00:06:01.050> that<00:06:01.230> at<00:06:01.350> some<00:06:01.590> point<00:06:01.620> but

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
going to cover that at some point but

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.860 
going to cover that at some point but
it's<00:06:02.460> not<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:02.640> showing<00:06:02.910> the<00:06:02.970> GCSE<00:06:03.480> said<00:06:03.720> of<00:06:03.810> us

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
it's not a showing the GCSE said of us

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.750 
it's not a showing the GCSE said of us
so<00:06:04.050> basically<00:06:04.440> what<00:06:04.980> you<00:06:05.100> need<00:06:05.280> to<00:06:05.490> remember

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
so basically what you need to remember

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.970 
so basically what you need to remember
is<00:06:06.120> that<00:06:06.330> there<00:06:06.510> is<00:06:06.600> evidence<00:06:06.750> in<00:06:07.080> favor<00:06:07.440> of

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
is that there is evidence in favor of

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.250 
is that there is evidence in favor of
continental<00:06:08.460> drift<00:06:08.670> in<00:06:09.150> these<00:06:09.540> stripes<00:06:09.990> of

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
continental drift in these stripes of
