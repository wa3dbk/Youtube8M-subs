or<00:00:27.130> can<00:00:27.640> you<00:00:27.730> maybe<00:00:27.910> trip<00:00:28.420> down<00:00:28.630> a<00:00:28.660> little<00:00:28.840> bit

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
or can you maybe trip down a little bit

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.600 
or can you maybe trip down a little bit
in<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.260> where<00:00:29.410> that's<00:00:29.619> where<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:29.950> minimum<00:00:30.400> so

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
in the where that's where the minimum so

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.820 
in the where that's where the minimum so
this<00:00:31.119> is<00:00:31.240> a<00:00:31.270> great<00:00:31.630> protection<00:00:32.140> system<00:00:32.710> to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
this is a great protection system to

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.680 
this is a great protection system to
allow<00:00:33.010> you<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.310> stay<00:00:33.550> cooler<00:00:33.820> because<00:00:34.240> you

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
allow you to stay cooler because you

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.970 
allow you to stay cooler because you
really<00:00:34.900> don't<00:00:35.020> need<00:00:35.170> a<00:00:35.230> ride<00:00:35.440> with<00:00:35.680> a<00:00:35.740> full

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
really don't need a ride with a full

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.490 
really don't need a ride with a full
textile<00:00:36.550> or<00:00:36.760> leather<00:00:36.970> jacket<00:00:37.480> over<00:00:37.810> at<00:00:38.320> least

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
textile or leather jacket over at least

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.440 
textile or leather jacket over at least
just<00:00:38.740> ride<00:00:39.010> with<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:39.370> pattern<00:00:39.730> itself<00:00:40.060> so

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
just ride with the pattern itself so

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.550 
just ride with the pattern itself so
she'd<00:00:41.380> be<00:00:41.800> certified<00:00:42.660> hard<00:00:43.660> armor<00:00:44.050> protection

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
she'd be certified hard armor protection

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.400 
she'd be certified hard armor protection
that<00:00:45.270> Alfonso<00:00:46.270> has<00:00:46.570> integrated<00:00:47.170> into<00:00:47.320> the

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
that Alfonso has integrated into the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.060 
that Alfonso has integrated into the
system<00:00:47.830> the<00:00:48.340> mesh<00:00:48.580> here<00:00:48.820> though<00:00:49.000> in<00:00:49.240> between

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
system the mesh here though in between

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.260 
system the mesh here though in between
that<00:00:51.070> just<00:00:51.280> holds<00:00:51.520> the<00:00:51.610> padding<00:00:51.940> together

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
that just holds the padding together

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.350 
that just holds the padding together
essentially<00:00:53.040> is<00:00:54.040> reasonable<00:00:54.640> obviously<00:00:55.210> it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
essentially is reasonable obviously it

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.680 
essentially is reasonable obviously it
doesn't<00:00:55.570> have<00:00:55.990> the<00:00:56.260> heat<00:00:56.470> trapping

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
doesn't have the heat trapping

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.000 
doesn't have the heat trapping
properties<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.900> whole<00:00:59.230> jacket<00:00:59.710> would<00:00:59.800> have

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
properties the whole jacket would have

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.640 
properties the whole jacket would have
so<00:01:00.310> you<00:01:00.970> can<00:01:01.180> literally<00:01:01.750> do<00:01:02.020> it<00:01:02.050> I<00:01:02.230> didn't<00:01:02.500> just

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
so you can literally do it I didn't just

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.369 
so you can literally do it I didn't just
ride<00:01:02.980> with<00:01:03.010> just<00:01:03.580> this<00:01:03.850> airs<00:01:04.629> going<00:01:05.049> through

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
ride with just this airs going through

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.780 
ride with just this airs going through
you<00:01:05.500> you<00:01:05.650> feel<00:01:05.830> great<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.220> comfortable<00:01:06.400> all

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
you you feel great and comfortable all

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.179 
you you feel great and comfortable all
the<00:01:06.909> time<00:01:07.090> you're<00:01:07.240> riding<00:01:07.650> another<00:01:08.650> thought

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
the time you're riding another thought

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.249 
the time you're riding another thought
about<00:01:09.460> this<00:01:09.640> is<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:10.000> I<00:01:10.150> believe<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.869> padding

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
about this is that I believe the padding

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.719 
about this is that I believe the padding
itself<00:01:11.650> is<00:01:11.830> actually<00:01:12.159> better<00:01:12.369> than<00:01:12.460> what

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
itself is actually better than what

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.969 
itself is actually better than what
you're<00:01:12.850> going<00:01:12.939> to<00:01:13.030> find<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.360> most<00:01:13.979> jackets

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
you're going to find the most jackets

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.980 
you're going to find the most jackets
that<00:01:15.070> have<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.430> padding<00:01:15.759> included<00:01:16.299> you<00:01:16.869> know

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
that have the padding included you know

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.919 
that have the padding included you know
they<00:01:17.200> typically<00:01:17.680> are<00:01:17.710> poems<00:01:18.159> or<00:01:18.670> some<00:01:19.539> sort<00:01:19.840> of

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
they typically are poems or some sort of

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.410 
they typically are poems or some sort of
a<00:01:20.079> rubber<00:01:20.409> jelly<00:01:20.740> kind<00:01:21.189> of<00:01:21.249> a<00:01:21.310> situation<00:01:21.880> this

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
a rubber jelly kind of a situation this

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.450 
a rubber jelly kind of a situation this
see<00:01:22.840> certified<00:01:23.469> padding<00:01:23.920> actually<00:01:24.310> has

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
see certified padding actually has

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.450 
see certified padding actually has
plastic<00:01:25.090> on<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.539> outside<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:26.049> it<00:01:26.140> so<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:27.280> your

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
plastic on the outside of it so do your

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.980 
plastic on the outside of it so do your
own<00:01:27.549> estimations<00:01:28.149> at<00:01:28.329> the<00:01:28.509> which<00:01:28.659> is<00:01:28.810> better

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
own estimations at the which is better

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.739 
own estimations at the which is better
but<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.340> padding<00:01:30.759> itself<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.270> think<00:01:31.329> is<00:01:31.569> better

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
but the padding itself I think is better

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:34.169 
but the padding itself I think is better
in<00:01:31.929> this<00:01:32.049> as<00:01:32.679> well<00:01:32.950> as<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.310> fit<00:01:33.549> you<00:01:33.729> get<00:01:34.030> this

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
in this as well as the fit you get this

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.149 
in this as well as the fit you get this

and tight and snug like it should you're
going<00:01:39.999> to<00:01:40.060> find<00:01:40.299> that<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.509> pads<00:01:40.780> would<00:01:40.960> stay

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
going to find that the pads would stay

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.559 
going to find that the pads would stay
in<00:01:41.380> place<00:01:41.409> better<00:01:42.009> off<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.759> we<00:01:43.210> event<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:43.509> a

in place better off and we event of a
crash<00:01:43.719> didn't<00:01:44.229> have<00:01:44.319> one

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
crash didn't have one

crash didn't have one
imagine<00:01:45.189> yourself<00:01:45.280> you'd<00:01:46.090> have<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.539> go<00:01:46.689> down

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
imagine yourself you'd have to go down

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.120 
imagine yourself you'd have to go down
