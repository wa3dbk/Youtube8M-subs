they may be what triggered the

they may be what triggered the

inflammation so the conventional wisdom
has<00:02:06.909> been<00:02:07.149> to<00:02:07.359> tell<00:02:07.599> elderly<00:02:08.259> folks<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:09.219> stay

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
has been to tell elderly folks to stay

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.180 
has been to tell elderly folks to stay
away<00:02:09.819> from<00:02:09.879> these<00:02:10.269> foods

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
away from these foods

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.700 
away from these foods
but<00:02:11.820> at<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> same<00:02:12.300> time<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.870> lack<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.140> plant

but at the same time the lack of plant

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.460 
but at the same time the lack of plant
foods<00:02:14.070> caused<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.330> whole<00:02:15.510> problem<00:02:16.020> in<00:02:16.200> the

foods caused the whole problem in the
first<00:02:16.710> place<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.940> we<00:02:18.090> really<00:02:18.120> want<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.690> tell
