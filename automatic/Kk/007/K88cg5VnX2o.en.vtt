into<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.160> gameplay<00:02:01.370> but<00:02:01.700> how<00:02:02.150> they<00:02:02.360> look<00:02:02.630> and

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
into the gameplay but how they look and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.930 
into the gameplay but how they look and
that<00:02:03.440> means<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.980> art<00:02:04.160> director<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.469 
whole art team had to put a lot of time
into<00:02:07.190> thinking<00:02:07.610> how<00:02:07.790> we<00:02:07.850> would<00:02:08.090> make<00:02:08.300> this

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
into thinking how we would make this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.690 
into thinking how we would make this
crowd<00:02:08.780> interesting

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.150 

we<00:02:12.700> invented<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.330> all<00:02:13.570> brand<00:02:14.110> new<00:02:14.320> character

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
we invented this all brand new character

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.310 
we invented this all brand new character
based<00:02:15.490> on<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.790> assassins<00:02:16.420> but<00:02:17.020> we<00:02:17.140> also

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
based on the assassins but we also

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.600 
based on the assassins but we also
wanted<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.770> give<00:02:17.980> him<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.190> look<00:02:18.400> and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
wanted to give him a look and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.600 
wanted to give him a look and
personality<00:02:18.820> all<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:20.050> his<00:02:20.200> own<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.400> first

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
personality all of his own so the first

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.700 
personality all of his own so the first
reflection<00:02:22.240> was<00:02:22.450> in<00:02:22.690> terms<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.050> gameplay<00:02:23.320> our

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
reflection was in terms of gameplay our

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.340 
reflection was in terms of gameplay our
core<00:02:24.040> gameplay<00:02:24.280> loop<00:02:24.700> what<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.810> assassin

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
core gameplay loop what is the assassin

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.020 
core gameplay loop what is the assassin
doing<00:02:26.680> most<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.070> time<00:02:27.340> but<00:02:27.760> what<00:02:27.910> you're

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
doing most of the time but what you're

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.240 
doing most of the time but what you're
doing<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.420> you're<00:02:28.560> investigating<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.070> you're

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
doing is you're investigating so you're

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.820 
doing is you're investigating so you're
mapping<00:02:30.940> out<00:02:31.270> your<00:02:31.300> territory<00:02:31.990> really<00:02:32.560> trying

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
mapping out your territory really trying

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.920 
mapping out your territory really trying
to<00:02:32.860> pinpoint<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.700> locate<00:02:34.120> your<00:02:34.300> prey<00:02:34.630> and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
to pinpoint and locate your prey and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.350 
to pinpoint and locate your prey and
then<00:02:35.410> once<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.770> focus<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.460> your<00:02:36.580> prey<00:02:36.880> you

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
then once you focus in on your prey you

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.200 
then once you focus in on your prey you
go<00:02:38.110> in<00:02:38.290> quickly<00:02:38.620> for<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.070> kill<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.550> then<00:02:40.060> you

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
go in quickly for the kill and then you

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.510 
go in quickly for the kill and then you
get<00:02:40.420> out<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.690> there<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.260> when<00:02:42.070> we<00:02:42.220> thought<00:02:42.490> of

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
get out of there and when we thought of

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.040 
get out of there and when we thought of
what<00:02:43.030> you're<00:02:43.180> doing<00:02:43.210> most<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:43.660> town<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.930> an

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
what you're doing most of town is an

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.230 
what you're doing most of town is an
assassin<00:02:44.530> made<00:02:45.010> us<00:02:45.160> think<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.820> bird<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.180> prey

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
assassin made us think of a bird of prey

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.570 
assassin made us think of a bird of prey
so<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.410> became<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.800> inspiration<00:02:47.920> for

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
so that became the inspiration for

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.870 
so that became the inspiration for
Altair<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.270> in<00:02:49.720> fact<00:02:49.960> out<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.500> year<00:02:50.950> means

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
Altair and in fact out a year means

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.080 
Altair and in fact out a year means
flying<00:02:52.540> eagle<00:02:53.110> or<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.950> flyer<00:02:54.280> in<00:02:54.670> Arabic<00:02:57.090> if

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
flying eagle or the flyer in Arabic if

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.850 
flying eagle or the flyer in Arabic if
you<00:02:58.240> notice<00:02:58.510> he's<00:02:58.660> wearing<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.960> hood<00:02:59.230> which

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
you notice he's wearing the hood which

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.340 
you notice he's wearing the hood which
has<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.160> little<00:03:00.490> point<00:03:00.820> in<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.120> front<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.630> he

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
has a little point in the front and he

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.950 
has a little point in the front and he
has<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.920> robe<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.760> kind<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.180> splits<00:03:04.630> out<00:03:04.810> on

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
has a robe that kind of splits out on

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.530 
has a robe that kind of splits out on
the<00:03:05.080> sides<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.590> when<00:03:06.310> he's<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.790> movement<00:03:07.240> the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
the sides and when he's in movement the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.050 
the sides and when he's in movement the
sides<00:03:08.050> flip<00:03:08.650> up<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.130> if<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.430> were<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.610> look<00:03:09.730> at

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
sides flip up and if you were to look at

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.600 
sides flip up and if you were to look at
a<00:03:10.210> shadow<00:03:10.930> cast<00:03:11.260> from<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.530> side<00:03:11.800> of<00:03:11.980> him<00:03:12.190> you'd

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
a shadow cast from the side of him you'd

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.520 
a shadow cast from the side of him you'd
get<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.940> angle<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.510> point<00:03:14.020> of<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.320> hood

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
get the angle of the point of the hood

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.250 
get the angle of the point of the hood
and<00:03:14.740> then<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.459> sides<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.540> skirt<00:03:16.780> flapping

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
and then the sides of the skirt flapping

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.440 
and then the sides of the skirt flapping
up<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.590> you'd<00:03:18.130> get<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.490> shadow<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:19.000> an<00:03:19.120> eagle

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
up and you'd get the shadow of an eagle

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.050 
up and you'd get the shadow of an eagle
so<00:03:20.020> altair<00:03:20.560> really<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.190> bird<00:03:21.550> of<00:03:21.640> prey

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
so altair really is a bird of prey

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.000 
so altair really is a bird of prey
