00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
is four point and shoot and if I want to

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.560 
is four point and shoot and if I want to
be<00:00:27.529> a<00:00:27.560> bit<00:00:27.830> more<00:00:27.859> creative<00:00:28.430> i<00:00:28.910> have<00:00:29.119> this<00:00:29.269> scene

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
be a bit more creative i have this scene

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.140 
be a bit more creative i have this scene
so<00:00:29.869> if<00:00:30.019> i<00:00:30.140> have<00:00:30.170> more<00:00:30.590> time<00:00:30.920> and<00:00:31.490> I<00:00:31.760> know<00:00:31.820> what

is the situation I can select from this

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.500 
is the situation I can select from this
be<00:00:34.790> pre-selected<00:00:35.589> like<00:00:36.699> pussies<00:00:37.699> here<00:00:38.150> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
what else is going to automatic so i'm

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.300 
what else is going to automatic so i'm
now<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.030> automatic<00:01:09.750> mode<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.500> point<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
now in automatic mode and I point and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.600 
now in automatic mode and I point and
shoot<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.840> can<00:01:12.840> zoom<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.340> finger

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
shoot I can zoom in with one finger

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.800 
shoot I can zoom in with one finger
which<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.720> handy<00:01:15.810> sore<00:01:16.440> in<00:01:16.560> my<00:01:16.740> undies

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
which is really handy sore in my undies

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.380 
which is really handy sore in my undies
so<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:19.740> did<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.130> room<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:22.910> you<00:01:23.910> kind<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
so they did it the room but you kind of

something similar brothers yes ok all of

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.050 
something similar brothers yes ok all of
our<00:01:30.770> invention<00:01:31.770> no<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:33.440> yes<00:01:34.440> so<00:01:34.770> qu<00:01:35.340> xue<00:01:35.610> me<00:01:35.820> i

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
our invention no and yes so qu xue me i

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.480 
our invention no and yes so qu xue me i
can<00:01:36.900> zoom<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.320> zoom<00:01:37.350> out<00:01:37.800> with<00:01:38.040> one<00:01:38.220> finger

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
can zoom in zoom out with one finger

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.400 
can zoom in zoom out with one finger
then<00:01:38.940> i<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.390> volume<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.200> don't

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
then i have this volume and you don't

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.990 
then i have this volume and you don't
lose<00:01:40.620> much<00:01:40.830> picture<00:01:41.190> quality<00:01:41.610> when<00:01:41.760> you<00:01:41.880> zoom

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
lose much picture quality when you zoom

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.600 
lose much picture quality when you zoom
in<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.270> mustard<00:01:42.690> on<00:01:42.810> any<00:01:43.190> show<00:01:44.190> is<00:01:44.370> called

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
in with mustard on any show is called

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.520 
in with mustard on any show is called
all<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> time<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.600> zone<00:01:46.080> for<00:01:46.290> thirty

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
all the time so you can zone for thirty

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.690 
all the time so you can zone for thirty
eight<00:01:46.950> megapixels<00:01:47.730> to<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.480> will<00:01:48.510> be

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
eight megapixels to this and it will be

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.400 
eight megapixels to this and it will be
so<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:50.880> instance<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.540> now<00:01:51.720> capture<00:01:52.260> this

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
so for instance if I now capture this

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.430 
so for instance if I now capture this
file<00:01:53.220> maker<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.910> by<00:01:54.090> default<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.660> capturing<00:01:55.140> 5

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
file maker so by default is capturing 5

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.550 
file maker so by default is capturing 5
megapixel<00:01:56.100> images<00:01:56.580> if<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.390> now<00:01:57.630> capture<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.260> 5

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
megapixel images if I now capture this 5

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.870 
megapixel images if I now capture this 5
megapixel<00:01:59.220> image<00:01:59.580> it<00:02:00.540> will<00:02:00.600> use<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.650> those<00:02:02.100> 41

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
megapixel image it will use all those 41

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.950 
megapixel image it will use all those 41
megapixels<00:02:03.660> but<00:02:04.260> it's<00:02:04.410> over<00:02:04.770> sampling<00:02:05.960> 77

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
megapixels but it's over sampling 77

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.960 
megapixels but it's over sampling 77
pixels<00:02:07.830> into<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.220> pixel<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.790> that's<00:02:09.060> cool

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.760 

so<00:02:14.970> as<00:02:15.210> i<00:02:15.390> said<00:02:15.420> i<00:02:15.660> have<00:02:15.960> this<00:02:16.080> camera<00:02:16.500> roll

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
so as i said i have this camera roll

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.220 
so as i said i have this camera roll
here<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.610> here<00:02:17.880> i<00:02:17.910> kind<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.330> course<00:02:20.420> zoom<00:02:21.420> in

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
here and here i kind of course zoom in

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.690 
here and here i kind of course zoom in
is<00:02:23.590> your<00:02:23.800> mouth

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
is your mouth

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.000 
is your mouth
what's<00:02:26.150> up<00:02:26.330> in<00:02:26.480> assuming<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:27.110> working<00:02:27.620> and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
what's up in assuming is working and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.140 
what's up in assuming is working and
then<00:02:28.940> i<00:02:29.090> have<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:30.019> it<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.379> is<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.489> let's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
then i have this so it is is it let's
