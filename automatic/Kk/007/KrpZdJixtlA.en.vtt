00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.610
 I have lego city undercover today 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.830
 allowed to play exclusively 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.840
 a mission the man as a driver 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.220
 is on the way and in the game itself 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.510
 There are different costs and you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.920
 can always roll in different 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.109
 hatch and then has accordingly 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.100
 what different skills and as 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.510
 I can then, for example, farmers 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.609
 plant irrigated 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.590
 which then grow up and then I can 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.880
 climb you along and later 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.260
 course one would have and even exists 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.969
 pigs cannons that one such a pig 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.239
 stuffs and then they go with promoted 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.460
 a really interesting idea and then 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.379
 there is still the possibility during the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.260
 jump his chicken out of the bag 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.760
 search and so a small glide to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.370
 how to do that perhaps from the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.649
 legend of zelda knows lÃ¤ge city 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.479
 undercovers such an open-world game that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.359
 means one has relatively many 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.920
 possibilities not only linearly 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.269
 to follow history simply by mission 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.369
 to mission to those but incidentally the 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.319
 to explore entire city from the beginning 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.789
 the great thing is that you can see that 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:04.379
 that the developers really deal with a lot 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.880
 love it because the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.890
 whole characters just amazing 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.930
 funny and entertained are just the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.609
 between sequences what partially 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.240
 delivering it for dialogues is just a lot 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.909
 entertaining 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.250
 that's james mackay if anyone 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.490
 qualified to find pigs then 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.350
 he thanked mr should not be too hard 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.130
 it's not like they're flying 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.840
 could 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.270
 I already have several hours 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.009
 can play and it will be easy 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.999
 again and again new ideas fired so 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.710
 every mission takes place 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.719
 different and you still have 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.140
 this extreme big freely explorable 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.119
 instead of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.579
 the gamepad will also be different 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.430
 implemented in the game where you 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.290
 for example, on the roof of a house 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.970
 the environment has to be scanned there you can 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.130
 then scan different audio signals 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.170
 and then continue in the game progress 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.050
 and then comes different movie 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.150
 references to it and the humor in the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.670
 between sequences so everything in one 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.570
 quite promising the game and me 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.570
 I hope in any case, much of it
