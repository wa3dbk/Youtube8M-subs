00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.940
 he also reverses the move 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.040
 underneath it for me to hit the goal 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.980

 is this natural of cruise flowers 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.750
 that I did not expect is just the books with the 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.270
