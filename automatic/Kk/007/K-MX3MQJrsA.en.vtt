when<00:04:05.130> we<00:04:05.579> look<00:04:05.700> down<00:04:05.880> here<00:04:06.209> at<00:04:06.269> our<00:04:06.419> home

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
when we look down here at our home

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.180 
when we look down here at our home
button<00:04:06.959> we<00:04:07.169> actually<00:04:07.440> have<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> fingerprint

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
button we actually have a fingerprint

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.520 
button we actually have a fingerprint
scanner<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.819> touch<00:04:09.450> ID<00:04:09.690> home<00:04:09.989> button<00:04:10.319> just

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
scanner and touch ID home button just

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.330 
scanner and touch ID home button just
like<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.859> iphone<00:04:11.010> 5s<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.269> new<00:04:12.419> ipad<00:04:12.870> air

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
like the iphone 5s and the new ipad air

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.740 
like the iphone 5s and the new ipad air
except<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.549> doesn't<00:04:14.730> actually<00:04:15.030> recognize<00:04:15.569> the

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
except it doesn't actually recognize the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.240 
except it doesn't actually recognize the
fingerprint<00:04:16.260> but<00:04:16.410> as<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.739> can<00:04:16.799> see<00:04:16.979> it<00:04:17.070> looks

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
fingerprint but as you can see it looks

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.930 
fingerprint but as you can see it looks
very<00:04:17.400> much<00:04:18.030> like<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.630> iphone<00:04:18.989> 5s<00:04:19.349> one<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.739> may

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
very much like the iphone 5s one and may

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.380 
very much like the iphone 5s one and may
the<00:04:20.060> device<00:04:20.299> a<00:04:20.330> lot<00:04:20.690> more<00:04:21.370> realistic<00:04:22.370> like<00:04:23.240> the

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
the device a lot more realistic like the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.230 
the device a lot more realistic like the
iphone<00:04:23.690> 6<00:04:23.870> will<00:04:24.290> be<00:04:24.440> now<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.310> iphone<00:04:25.850> 6<00:04:26.090> will

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240

have tooken pictures and that has been a
little<00:05:53.150> bit<00:05:53.360> low<00:05:53.630> resolution<00:05:54.380> pixels<00:05:54.940> but<00:05:55.940> it

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
little bit low resolution pixels but it

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.440 
little bit low resolution pixels but it
does<00:05:56.480> work<00:05:56.720> most<00:05:57.169> likely<00:05:57.830> fine<00:05:58.400> as<00:05:58.700> you<00:05:59.390> can

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
lock screen and it looks just fine and

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.470 
lock screen and it looks just fine and

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
you can see on the side we can pop a sim

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.490 
you can see on the side we can pop a sim
card<00:06:10.730> in<00:06:11.060> and<00:06:11.270> when<00:06:11.660> we<00:06:11.750> do<00:06:11.930> that<00:06:12.140> we<00:06:12.200> can

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
dialer in just a second so on the side

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.180 
dialer in just a second so on the side
here<00:06:17.600> we<00:06:17.750> get<00:06:17.870> the<00:06:17.900> home<00:06:18.320> oh<00:06:18.620> I'm<00:06:18.890> sorry<00:06:19.010> the

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449 
have on this side we have the vibration

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.670 
have on this side we have the vibration
as<00:06:33.509> you<00:06:34.199> can<00:06:34.319> hear<00:06:34.939> the<00:06:35.939> vibration<00:06:36.539> thing<00:06:37.319> to

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
as you can hear the vibration thing to

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.529 
as you can hear the vibration thing to

go ahead and vibrate or not vibrate and
we<00:06:39.900> have<00:06:40.020> the<00:06:40.139> volume<00:06:40.349> buttons<00:06:43.789> as<00:06:45.229> you<00:06:46.229> can

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349
