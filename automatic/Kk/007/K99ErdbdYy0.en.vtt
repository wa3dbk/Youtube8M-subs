as you can see the little screen on the

as you can see the little screen on the
end<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.110> these<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.250> prime<00:01:59.850> place<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.390> have

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
end of these is a prime place to have

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.219 
end of these is a prime place to have
stuff<00:02:00.869> go<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.890> get<00:02:01.950> caught<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.990> one

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
stuff go in and get caught and this one

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.090 
stuff go in and get caught and this one
was<00:02:04.520> pushed<00:02:05.520> right<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.299> up<00:02:06.689> and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
was pushed right in and up and

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.880 
was pushed right in and up and
uh<00:02:08.150> had<00:02:09.150> some<00:02:09.180> grime<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.560> probably

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
uh had some grime in it so it probably

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.970 
uh had some grime in it so it probably
wasn't<00:02:11.400> letting<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.300> gas<00:02:12.570> go<00:02:13.320> through<00:02:13.710> as

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
wasn't letting the gas go through as

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.640 
wasn't letting the gas go through as
