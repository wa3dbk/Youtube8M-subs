let<00:01:22.799> me<00:01:22.890> tell<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.159> something<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.909> Boise

let me tell you something this Boise

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910 
let me tell you something this Boise
State<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:24.869> number<00:01:25.140> three<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.500> nation<00:01:25.619> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
State was number three in the nation of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.429 
State was number three in the nation of
scoring<00:01:26.220> defense<00:01:26.369> Hawaii<00:01:27.150> held<00:01:27.420> them<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.720> 27

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
scoring defense Hawaii held them to 27

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.160

points<00:01:28.799> zero<00:01:29.700> points<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.420> fourth<00:01:30.689> quarter

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
points zero points in a fourth quarter

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.109 
points zero points in a fourth quarter
this<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> much<00:01:32.009> better<00:01:32.280> football<00:01:32.670> team<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
this is a much better football team that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.130 
this is a much better football team that
people<00:01:33.540> give<00:01:33.689> them<00:01:33.780> credit

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
people give them credit

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.350 
people give them credit
the<00:01:34.380> reason<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.340> never<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.060> see<00:01:36.240> him

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the reason is we never get to see him

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.350 
the reason is we never get to see him
because<00:01:36.720> they<00:01:37.140> play<00:01:37.439> off<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.400> mainland<00:01:38.850> how

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
because they play off the mainland how

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.539 
because they play off the mainland how
cool<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.650> their<00:01:40.890> home<00:01:41.130> stadium

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
cool is that to see their home stadium

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
know that Hawaii had a great chance to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.120 
know that Hawaii had a great chance to
run<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> table<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> wanted<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> wait<00:01:55.619> until

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
against a Boise team that is very

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.520 
against a Boise team that is very
talented<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:03.060> both<00:02:03.360> sides<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> ball<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
talented on both sides of the ball the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.410 
talented on both sides of the ball the
way<00:02:04.560> they<00:02:04.950> played<00:02:05.219> last<00:02:05.460> night<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.119> with<00:02:06.240> all

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
way they played last night and with all

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.969 
way they played last night and with all
these<00:02:06.570> teams<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.079> are<00:02:07.170> losing<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.649> front<00:02:07.890> of

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
these teams that are losing in front of

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.100 
these teams that are losing in front of
them<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.220> think<00:02:08.580> Hawaii<00:02:09.060> does<00:02:09.660> deserve<00:02:10.050> a

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
them I think Hawaii does deserve a

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.380 
them I think Hawaii does deserve a
chance<00:02:10.500> now<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.770> they've<00:02:11.099> gone<00:02:11.370> out<00:02:11.819> taking

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
chance now that they've gone out taking

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.760 
chance now that they've gone out taking
