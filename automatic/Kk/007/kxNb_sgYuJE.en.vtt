this fuel is e85 but it's not the 85 and

this fuel is e85 but it's not the 85 and
it<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.650> vary<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> use<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.420> fuel<00:01:06.689> because

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
it can vary so to use this fuel because

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.210 
it can vary so to use this fuel because
you<00:01:07.110> don't<00:01:07.290> know<00:01:07.439> what<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> ethanol<00:01:08.010> content

you don't know what the ethanol content
is<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.360> need<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.689> run<00:01:09.780> flex<00:01:10.110> fuel

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
is going to be you need to run flex fuel

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.200 
is going to be you need to run flex fuel
if<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> other<00:01:11.310> hand<00:01:11.549> you're<00:01:11.760> only<00:01:11.939> running

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
if on the other hand you're only running

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.010

85<00:01:13.159> on<00:01:14.159> race<00:01:14.460> car<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:14.850> example<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.780> don't

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
85 on race car for example and you don't

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.749 
85 on race car for example and you don't
need<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> set<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.560> flex<00:01:16.890> fuel<00:01:17.100> also<00:01:17.400> some

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
need to set up flex fuel also some

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
need to set up flex fuel also some
people<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.240> asked<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:18.990> use<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.439> dual

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
people have asked can we use the dual

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.730 
people have asked can we use the dual
map<00:01:19.860> function<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.299> map<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.780> 85<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
map function and have one map for 85 and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.070 
map function and have one map for 85 and
one<00:01:22.830> map<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.310> pump<00:01:23.580> gas<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.750> but

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
one map for pump gas you can do it but

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.390 
one map for pump gas you can do it but
the<00:01:25.200> downside<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.250> need

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the downside with that is that you need

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.130 
the downside with that is that you need
to<00:01:26.549> drain<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> fuel<00:01:27.060> tank<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.900> entire

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to drain the fuel tank and the entire

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.690 
to drain the fuel tank and the entire
fuel<00:01:28.439> system<00:01:28.470> each<00:01:28.979> time<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.340> changed<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
fuel system each time we changed the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.520 
fuel system each time we changed the
fuels<00:01:30.000> because<00:01:30.689> there'll<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:30.900> some<00:01:31.110> residual

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
fuels because there'll be some residual

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.649 
fuels because there'll be some residual
from<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> previous<00:01:32.250> fuel<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.909> system<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
from the previous fuel in the system it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.609 
from the previous fuel in the system it
also<00:01:33.750> means<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
also means that you have to have a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.140 
also means that you have to have a
separate<00:01:34.920> switch<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.400> driver<00:01:35.610> has<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.850> know

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
separate switch the driver has to know

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.810

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370

probably won't give you a benefit on its
