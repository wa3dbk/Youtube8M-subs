00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 hi today we are going one 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:12.090
 make flax seed crackers recipe 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.980
 for that we need linseed 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.039
 I usually use blonde but it is possible 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.830
 also with dark linseed 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.189
 Bradley Quinta that is a species 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.880
 soy sauce with such a similar 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:34.710
 taste and himalayan salt and water 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:37.070
 that's it so we start with one and a half 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.070
 cup 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:54.949
 a line to do we others about cup 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.949
 water at 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:19.440
 and then we do the one quarter 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.440
 teaspoon of himalayan salt 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.660
 this is really a very easy recipe and 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.960
 very handy to combine with salad 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.600
 Soup tasty after you can tap it 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.520
 do as in between as me 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.100
 for example, you have little time to rest 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.990
 I get something out of the kitchen cupboard 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.479
 I put some help in a bag and then eat 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.380
 I just get them up in the car 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:52.410
 very handy so what do we do now 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.410
 we leave this linseed for an hour 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.410
 moving in 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.149
 an hour later we have here like you 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.280
 see 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.510
 linseed which has all the water 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.600
 absorbed and we do that for the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.600
 taste 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:31.510
 one and a half tablespoons of the breakage of the liquid amino 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:31.510
 mix scene so well 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.739
 and then leave that for another hour 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.739
 stand 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.910
 well now it's ready to you then 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.510
 to be spread out at the place of 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.510
 the diameter 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.690
 so what do we do 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:14.090
 I personally find blond flax seeds 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:18.049
 look a little nicer so spread out now 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:22.760
 you completely wrote out 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:28.400
 of the via twitter as thin as possible but 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.780
 make sure you don't get any gaps yet 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.780
 a bit like doing 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.379
 and now what it is useful is to get the 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.209
 right one 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.480
 that right sized crackers too 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.480
 to cut 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.710
 Well then you can of course come up with it yourself 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.690
 like that just a bit 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.000
 to make small crackers 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.610
 serves handy and also fun in one 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.010
 we said that I already said a soup 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.050
 or a salad 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.050
 o'right now he goes into the oven 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.979
 and around ten o'clock 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:49.780
 then you take it out and I just got it 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:53.600
 also one prepared with blond linseed 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.660
 and what you can do then is turn it on 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.660
 to 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:04.460
 takes the skin off and he is now he 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.010
 is hard but he is now one 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.080
 slightly soft on the top 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.080
 so you slide it into the summer 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.760
 and then set it to 42 degrees 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.140
 anne you put it at 42 degrees 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.639
 well after I think about five o'clock 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.639
 six 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.069
 the crack is ready and you test it 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.469
 You just have to actually test them 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:02.289
 totally crunchy they are just like 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.909
 his stop completely crunchy 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.560
 So now of course have the result 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:07.560
 already done and these are these 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:14.460
 so a salty trigger with a little 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.460
 soy-like taste 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.900
 really nice with a tap 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.840
 over it 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:34.210
 a little avocado tomato you sprout a little 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.600
 hardest easy for lunch 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.600
 very tasty
