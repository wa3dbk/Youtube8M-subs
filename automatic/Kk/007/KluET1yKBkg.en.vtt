00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:11.200
 in this lesson we will show 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.350
 behind her purl loops not from the side 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.869
 seam surface and from the front 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.680
 smooth for what it is needed it for 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:24.490
 knitting patterns from weight purl 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.490
 loops in which purl rows 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.000
 alternate with facial rows and so 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.519
 the previous lesson we tied half 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.460
 sample purl first method and 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:39.840
 half sample purl 2 ways 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.239
 from the front of our baked 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.010
 arranged differently after knitting 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.280
 purl loops in the second way 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.489
 front loops are located front 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.530
 wall forward and nothing changes we 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.910
 continue to knit suppose we need 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.610
 knit a row 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.340
 hem purl loops and we 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.030
 used to knit we like more 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.979
 knit purl the second way and we 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:12.119
 we knit the same way we insert a needle into a loop 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.310
 picking up the front wall and 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.729
 knit purl rush second 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.729
 in a way 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.190
 This part of the sample in that side is 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.950
 was the first part of the sample we were knitting 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.970
 purl the first way and our 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:59.080
 front fives are located in the back 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.680
 wall forward and if we start 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.800
 knit with purses in the first way 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.080
 picking up 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.539
 its for the front wall of our loop will be 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.239
 twist so when knitting 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.420
 purl first method with facial 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:17.010
 sides need to catch a loop for 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.290
 back wall in order for not 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.320
 twisted so we knit 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:30.700
 purl in the first way we catch 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:33.600
 loop behind the back wall like this working 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:41.850
 the thread we have is Libya 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:47.450
 we put it through the loop like this 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:50.580
 knit purl loop the first way 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.930
 she has not changed her position 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.900
 on the needles since before it was from 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.520
 back wall forward also happened 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:06.510
 ass so again we look the needle is not 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:22.430
 we enter into the loop we catch it by the back 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:28.320
 wall like that picking up the back 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:34.650
 wall workers to the left and draw through 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:38.540
 loops like this and continue the same 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.540
 way to end of row 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.620
 knot row knot edge 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.730
 so we knit the front of the front 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:14.280
 the wall here we knit purl u 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.280
 we got a scar on the front surface and 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.539
 no matter what we have facial 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.599
 loops were previously knitted 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:30.250
 ways were located more accurately 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:35.470
 different loops are not twisted and on 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.449
 this is all subscribe to my 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.169
 channel to be always aware of new 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.169
