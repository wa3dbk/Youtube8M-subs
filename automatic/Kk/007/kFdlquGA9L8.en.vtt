series listed down below any questions

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.700 
series listed down below any questions
let's<00:00:33.239> go<00:00:33.360> through<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> four<00:00:33.989> real<00:00:34.260> quick<00:00:34.500> not

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
let's go through the four real quick not

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.260 
let's go through the four real quick not
going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> go<00:00:34.980> exact<00:00:35.340> specs<00:00:35.700> because<00:00:36.120> they're

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
going to go exact specs because they're

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.110 
going to go exact specs because they're
pretty<00:00:36.540> similar<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.860> some<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.879> quick

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
pretty similar just some just a quick

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.060 
pretty similar just some just a quick
glance<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> knife<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.469> then<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.829> few<00:00:40.980> of

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
glance at the knife and then a few of

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.280 
glance at the knife and then a few of
the<00:00:41.129> bigger<00:00:41.309> differences<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.719> says<00:00:42.930> more<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the bigger differences it says more of a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.720 
the bigger differences it says more of a
square<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:44.550> also<00:00:44.670> has<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> rubber<00:00:45.149> inserts

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
square it also has the rubber inserts

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.970 
square it also has the rubber inserts
than<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> safety<00:00:48.440> that's<00:00:49.440> probably<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
than the safety that's probably the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.369 
than the safety that's probably the
biggest<00:00:50.190> difference<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.449> those<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> four

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
biggest difference so those are the four

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.420 
biggest difference so those are the four
series<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:57.149> here's<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> five<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:59.309> more

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
series and here's the five a little more

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.279 
series and here's the five a little more
contoured<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> handle<00:01:00.510> also<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
contoured to the handle also as the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.869 
contoured to the handle also as the
inserts<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.370> more<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.640> sweeping

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
inserts you can see more of a sweeping

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.570 
inserts you can see more of a sweeping
lines<00:01:03.270> also<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> inside<00:01:07.130> pretty<00:01:08.130> similar

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
lines also on the inside pretty similar

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.719 
lines also on the inside pretty similar
except<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.689> safety<00:01:10.189> this<00:01:11.189> runs<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
except for the safety this runs in a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.660 
except for the safety this runs in a
channel<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.930> hear<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.200> snap<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.860> little

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
channel you can hear that snap a little

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.560 
channel you can hear that snap a little
more<00:01:14.790> retention<00:01:16.460> similar<00:01:17.460> blade<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.420> can

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
more retention similar blade so you can

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.120 
more retention similar blade so you can
see<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> handles<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.170> contoured<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.070> I'll

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
see the handles of contoured so I'll

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.230 
see the handles of contoured so I'll
pick<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> other<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.119> can

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
pick up the other one here so you can

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.450 
pick up the other one here so you can
kind<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> compare<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:21.930> contrast<00:01:22.460> this

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
kind of get a compare and contrast this

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.420 
kind of get a compare and contrast this
is<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> four<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> five<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> if

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
is the four and this is the five so if

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.679 
is the four and this is the five so if
you<00:01:26.520> kind<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.729> think<00:01:26.790> about<00:01:27.090> which<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.540> get

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
you kind of think about which one to get

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.469 
you kind of think about which one to get
farther<00:01:28.409> looks<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.820> take<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> look<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
farther looks you can take a look at the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.600 
farther looks you can take a look at the
knives<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:31.829> I'll<00:01:31.920> talk<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> little<00:01:32.490> bit

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
knives and then I'll talk a little bit

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
knives and then I'll talk a little bit
about<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.180> mean<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> main<00:01:34.170> difference<00:01:34.530> is

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
about the I mean the main difference is

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.899 
about the I mean the main difference is
the<00:01:34.950> safety<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.450> think<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.780> improved<00:01:37.909> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the safety and I think it's improved the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.850 
the safety and I think it's improved the
biggest<00:01:39.180> problem<00:01:39.479> we've<00:01:39.600> had<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.650> four

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
biggest problem we've had on the four

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.649 
biggest problem we've had on the four
series<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:43.009> right<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:44.700> unsafe<00:01:45.119> so

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
series is right now it's not unsafe so

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.840 
series is right now it's not unsafe so
that's<00:01:45.840> safe<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.130> safe<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> biggest

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that's safe it's not on safe the biggest

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.950 
that's safe it's not on safe the biggest
problem<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.240> when<00:01:48.360> you're<00:01:48.450> using<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.780> knife

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
problem is when you're using the knife

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.230 
problem is when you're using the knife
the<00:01:49.680> safety<00:01:50.040> will<00:01:50.130> actually<00:01:50.399> pop<00:01:50.610> back<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the safety will actually pop back to the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.069 
the safety will actually pop back to the
safe<00:01:51.479> mode<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.990> then<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.439> can't<00:01:52.740> close<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
safe mode and then you can't close it

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.359 
safe mode and then you can't close it
causes<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> little<00:01:55.200> bit<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> problem<00:01:55.710> because

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
causes a little bit of a problem because

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
causes a little bit of a problem because
there's<00:01:56.579> not<00:01:56.670> as<00:01:56.790> much<00:01:56.880> retention<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.649> for

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
there's not as much retention there for

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.679 
there's not as much retention there for
series<00:01:59.100> either<00:01:59.579> bigger<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.060> lot<00:02:00.270> bigger<00:02:00.329> than

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
series either bigger a lot bigger than

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.679 
series either bigger a lot bigger than
the<00:02:00.780> mp3<00:02:01.350> series<00:02:01.820> nice<00:02:02.820> bigger<00:02:03.090> knife<00:02:03.299> looking

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the mp3 series nice bigger knife looking

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.859 
the mp3 series nice bigger knife looking
for<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> tactical<00:02:04.350> knife<00:02:04.850> maybe<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.090> on<00:02:06.390> duty

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
for a tactical knife maybe on on duty

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.510 
for a tactical knife maybe on on duty
knife<00:02:07.429> nice<00:02:08.429> nice<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.479> do<00:02:09.629> think<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.520> mp5

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
knife nice nice but I do think the mp5

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.780 
knife nice nice but I do think the mp5
series

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
series

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.920 
series
a big<00:02:13.209> step<00:02:13.599> up<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:15.209> like<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.329> guess<00:02:16.599> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
a big step up I like to guess the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.539 
a big step up I like to guess the
styling<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.319> little<00:02:17.469> bit<00:02:17.620> more<00:02:17.799> but<00:02:18.219> mostly

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
styling a little bit more but mostly

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.360 
styling a little bit more but mostly
just<00:02:18.969> the<00:02:19.060> safety<00:02:19.329> I<00:02:19.920> mean<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.010> can't<00:02:21.219> go

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
just the safety I mean you can't go

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.449 
just the safety I mean you can't go
wrong<00:02:21.579> there<00:02:21.989> when<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.079> deploy<00:02:23.349> that<00:02:23.469> that's

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
wrong there when you deploy that that's

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.559 
wrong there when you deploy that that's
not<00:02:24.700> going<00:02:24.879> back<00:02:25.150> down<00:02:25.469> unless<00:02:26.469> you<00:02:26.620> push<00:02:26.950> it

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
not going back down unless you push it

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.089 
not going back down unless you push it
so<00:02:28.569> quick<00:02:29.200> look<00:02:29.409> just<00:02:29.590> want<00:02:29.829> me<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.980> talk<00:02:30.069> a

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
so quick look just want me to talk a

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.890 
so quick look just want me to talk a
little<00:02:30.250> bit<00:02:30.430> about<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.670> safety<00:02:30.909> had<00:02:31.689> some

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
little bit about the safety had some

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.050 
little bit about the safety had some
issues<00:02:32.170> out<00:02:32.349> there<00:02:32.650> check<00:02:33.489> them<00:02:33.609> out

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
issues out there check them out

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.789 
issues out there check them out
Smith<00:02:34.450> &amp;<00:02:34.599> Wesson<00:02:35.579> SW<00:02:36.579> for<00:02:36.879> L<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.359> the<00:02:37.450> 5l<00:02:37.900> both

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
Smith &amp; Wesson SW for L and the 5l both

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.699 
Smith &amp; Wesson SW for L and the 5l both
series<00:02:39.280> both<00:02:40.150> quality<00:02:40.510> knives<00:02:40.689> I<00:02:41.079> just<00:02:41.530> think

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
series both quality knives I just think

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.429 
series both quality knives I just think
it's<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:41.889> 5<00:02:42.370> series<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.700> little<00:02:42.790> more<00:02:43.000> improved

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
it's the 5 series a little more improved

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.539 
it's the 5 series a little more improved
so<00:02:44.439> if<00:02:44.590> you're<00:02:44.709> deciding<00:02:44.950> between<00:02:45.129> the<00:02:45.370> two

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
so if you're deciding between the two

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.729 
so if you're deciding between the two
here's<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.879> quick<00:02:46.060> look<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:47.590> main

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
here's a quick look and the main

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.949 
here's a quick look and the main
difference<00:02:48.099> is<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.280> safety<00:02:48.609> so<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.840> take

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
difference is the safety so just take

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.000 
difference is the safety so just take
that<00:02:49.989> into<00:02:50.230> consideration

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
that into consideration

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.059 
that into consideration
see<00:02:51.549> if<00:02:51.669> the<00:02:51.939> the<00:02:52.239> looks<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.930> four<00:02:53.260> if<00:02:53.560> you

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
see if the the looks of the four if you

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.879 
see if the the looks of the four if you
like<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.489> better<00:02:54.579> if<00:02:54.849> it's<00:02:55.030> worth<00:02:55.269> the

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
like it better if it's worth the

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.319 
like it better if it's worth the
drawback<00:02:56.889> in<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.159> safety<00:02:57.430> or<00:02:57.819> if<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.299> just

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
drawback in the safety or if you just

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.000 
drawback in the safety or if you just
like<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.689> 5<00:02:58.870> series<00:02:59.260> here's<00:02:59.379> a<00:02:59.470> quick<00:02:59.680> look<00:02:59.829> at

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
like the 5 series here's a quick look at

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.849 
like the 5 series here's a quick look at
it<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.370> then<00:03:01.239> you'll<00:03:01.329> improve<00:03:01.599> safety<00:03:01.859> check

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
it and then you'll improve safety check

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.369 
it and then you'll improve safety check
