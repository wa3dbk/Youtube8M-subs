 I will teach all those who 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:20.279
 you have the anaya books and you are in 1st 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.279
 3rd or 4th of 1st of that 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.060
 I say first of that because in my case I 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.070
 I'm first 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.189
 as many of you will already know if 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.410
 You are my friends or classmates 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.989
 Well then I will teach you 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.630
 page you can put to see all 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.030
 the answers 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.030
 It's not mine with the sidewalks 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:51.640
 open our browser that we like 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.640
 and you put this 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.280
 and there shall is 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.540
 it's only the math ones 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.540
 which is in fact the most difficult 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:25.140
 and as you can see this is the link http the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:30.750
 points www points 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.990
 you go hard francisco point or heretic of 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.320
 good math text like vice tal de 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.640
 first of that second of that 3rd of that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.390
 quarter of that 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.600
 good as I was saying you can put a 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:51.450
 here in extensions depending on what 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.450
 course you are I will get into this 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.760
 since without first I will teach you and 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.040
 how 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.600
 download it or just watch it for 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.370
 see it now more you just have to avoid 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.960
 here and you will get a page where 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.340
 you can see it but if you want 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.679
 download you have to see what 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.859
 I'm going to do now 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.189
 forgive me but my computer does not want 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.189
 reply 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.370
 scooter 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.980
 I leave the link copied 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.980
 you do not leave because surely 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.090
 surely if I have loaded you since not 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.069
 is internet go so slow it happens 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.420
 which is that I have the route in the 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.740
 dining room and I'm in my room 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.740
 then we go slow 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.590
 I hope I was in charge 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.590
 good how was saying 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.130
 you put here 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.630
 here 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.049
 do not get lost and as you can see here they come out 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.280
 all the issues do not pay attention to the 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.360
 number 2 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.370
 just click and you're done 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.350
 if you are by the metric system 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.070
 decimal that for example because I'm 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.190
 by pinchÃ¡is is an exterior example 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.180
 because I already have it so I click on a 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.180
 theme any 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.130
 fourth operations 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.430
 flat figures for example 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.430
 and it's a very nice subject 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:56.489
 good as you see here is from page 318 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.489
 and as you can see here is 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.960
 as you see 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.860
 here is everything 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.980
 see for example put abcd 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.440
 sometimes to use 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.280
 Well, if you want to download it simply 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.280
 you will have to click here 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.660
 you click and you just give it where 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.030
 you want to download and put the name that 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.720
 you want, I'm going to leave that one because it's the 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.969
 that will have in my case the desk 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.429
 I would keep it loose 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:40.029
 and as you can see now it will come out in 

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:40.029
 the desk 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.840
 and here is 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.890
 and good that everything is simply you open it 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.250
