00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:06.080
 saturday can't beat bandung to see 500,000 a year even when i do 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.080
 about ten years after her, Natalee sank 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:11.579
 and that's what it's all about 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.949
 that's where I have a nice challenge here 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.329
 but true and I think that 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.359
 thereby looking at the north cape 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:20.359
 there you go her 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.659
 the car the man is on 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:25.659
 the fact that is coming 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.449
 but I can't get stuck 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.449
 That's completely right 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.290
 I can just go by after half a year 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.290
 at the campsite last weekend 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.810
 in March and April also a little at a different time just china and the dates 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.440
 but it may have been announced 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.200
 I still have to get used to you but yes that is almost impossible 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.280
 there are still cards in addition the company offers know 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.470
 the 21 year old 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.230
 I can not do anything else 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.200
 Are you a spot the FFC smaller for which the parties are not yet known eventually 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.190
 became Gbagbo by top top top top he points to a contraction 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.490
 the in each other 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.520
 haacht 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.520
 9 but 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.000
 to grab 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.880
 in papua beh 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.190
 but I also have some bad luck 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.320
 But in the end by doing so I think it will be bad 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.120
 do not adjust working hours 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.220
 cards in the hands we think about it 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.960
 I can do nothing but this year but I can wonder why I always have it 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.740
 all year 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.290
 we look at the judge 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.159
 prof 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:09.569
 I have a number of jobs 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.890
 Last year, the court in Alkmaar spent the entire week there 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:18.359
 then with it was let think along 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.349
 that party has a number of cda MPs 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.769
 that is probably unwell 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.139
 he hears 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:02:59.779
 I will just stand by it 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.299
 that's why I want 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.299
 luckily it hurts my heart 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.179
 later this year 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.139
 when the money runs out 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.099
 also complained about it before 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.339
 in-house 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.919
 yes each other 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.959
 I add to that 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.559
 looking forward to it but after a year my wife can and I can't go through 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:11.759
 the a13 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:14.009
 a year together 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:16.629
 but he too could be 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:20.009
 This makes an important contribution to the table as he died
