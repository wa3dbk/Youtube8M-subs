00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.269
 franz at previous levels devaluation 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.689
 meeting with them 3 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.929
 in the company years 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.079
 however, we remember 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.419
 This board is probably the most obse 5 62 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:29.429
 ruble 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.580
 but not implemented in this model 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.580
 there are four soldier casino specifications 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.230
 You can set up to 16 gigabytes of operational 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.979
 of memory 

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.850
 experts 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.830
 also not involved 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.980
 artists say 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.810
 Boris Biba Commission 3 0 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.430
 and the interface system with it 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.870
 money is really what they themselves give the opportunity 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.540
 headset connection 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.370
 at the same time what else is there to fall this 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.250
 text grew companion will start transport 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.570
 which can be used for 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.150
 connecting to such measures 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.870
 there is a guy after the spill 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.700
 for getting passion everywhere 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
 out wagons 4 pin plug for me 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.170
 also worth noting the presence of this topic 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.300
 condensate 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.580
 lack of processor power themes 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.370
 now think ernst young man 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.640
 given she is convinced dpa 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.649
 real situation of enterprises 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.219
 oxygen jumpers which citizens 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.219
 have to 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.430
 on the contrary, he rolled that again with an inhaler 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.619
 surrounding interest we have rights 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.960
 the helicopter does not affect the place 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.490
 what's up taking the mounting 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.009
 and dropping or picking mode 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.970
 besides standard elements and bye 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.840
 driver disk stubs and 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.540
 Petrovsky there are four whales of a cable with 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.390
 metal snaps as well 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.580
 external front standard and 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.250
 Carpathian stub 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.240
 I wonder what attacks can do 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.870
 work without connecting further 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.870
 however removed data rates 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.909
 her bb's barge who is heavier to me 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:29.569
 the station fell asleep istanbul 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.669
 but victory is victory 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.059
 young 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.009
 floor below expectations 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:38.219
 true this pair of shoes home stands 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.789
 the guy is registered in fourth place 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.019
 in front 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.989
 this more 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.609
 so not breathing 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.590
 now speakers 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.979
 in year 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.439
 investigation of the limit continues 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.969
 one thing on the street is not reported finally 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:58.549
 there is everywhere 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.949
 in the period amounted to 2 6 times the Russian language 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.289
 which is very very rare 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:05.829
 and the translation is professional 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.839
 it is impossible to understand 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.139
 one thread possible collision would 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.169
 we connect to the fan board 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.889
 one of which is lower the radiator 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.779
 so you can wait for different modes 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.779
 work including almost silently 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.289
 you can also the fastest transition 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:23.210
 temperatures 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.590
 after which candidates will start 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.189
 cruise speed 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.969
 this is after all the edition you can choose then 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:29.629
 mode 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.510
 and then the processor will work on 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.269
 frequency of 2164 megahertz 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.459
 and this is a 35 percent increase without 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.079
 boost voltage 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.839
 for example overclocking standards 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:42.219
 processor amd e 350 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.789
 the motherboard so on is 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:48.579
 1550 non-registration technology support 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.760
 energy saving 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.989
 and moments simple purity goes down 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.809
 below a thousand stability 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.429
 radiators cling fan diameter 4 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:57.549
 centimeter 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.719
 on speed of rotation of blades to 4500 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.279
 revolutions per second but thanks quotes 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.279
 noise level no load system 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.219
 state of this method is pretty 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.979
 low 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.649
 and is October 31 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:12.069
 actually competing 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.019
 platforms and this vitamin d 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.049
 and came to the conclusion that it is due to the turbo 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.509
 overclocking and architecture and these are people 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.289
 work almost was faster 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.809
 in the game starcraft 2 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:25.059
 24 frames per second instead of yourself 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:26.889
 latest version cop 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.229
 11 and not 8 as a second 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.610
 she sang the tournament 2004 eighty frames in 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.639
 second they are 55 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.979
 indoor arena feeds speeds higher 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.749
 cost per second 

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:41.069
 judging by the posts alibi 64 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.749
 at the same time for a country on a dual atlas 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.449
 peak 2 64 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:46.669
 as well as bad 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:47.840
 portal 2 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.260
 maximum debt balance such here 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.409
 can not be trusted 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.360
 since shipments up to sixteen when 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.139
 give me a sec 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.770
 infusion will lower the resolution of $ 1,280 to 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.189
 720 points 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.879
 the second lane is quite large enough 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.879
 This platform for the nation for example for 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.039
 country 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.319
 the touch will come out on 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.589
 CPU usage is only 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:12.839
 14 15 percent 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:14.719
 these rates makes the process relatively 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:15.940
 recently 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.840
 this is done to 70 families 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.839
 eighty five degrees 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:21.669
 but if it means that this mode 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.650
 up to sixty six degrees all together 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.660
 generally quite tolerable tours themselves 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.050
 with which the system will work for years 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.880
 in the group here i am 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.830
 ok enough 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.150
 masters and different from the plan 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.669
 by the us and nato awards 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.120
 Sevastopol 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.680
 and at meetings
