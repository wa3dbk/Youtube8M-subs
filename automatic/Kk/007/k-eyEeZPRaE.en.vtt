00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.250
 at the match on tuesday they had the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.560
 hachinger with severe conditions against 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.470
 waving wiesbaden to fight the snow bar 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.900
 in the sports park and today as you can see 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.070
 field is free the lawn is green and the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.930
 connection can come 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.820
 The game on Tuesday actually went 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.769
 off hook relatively quickly because that was 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.170
 under irregular conditions in the 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.670
 Snowfall is annoying if you whole 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.989
 year what is in it and then in one 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.820
 actually play it all 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.739
 had to make the last game come 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.710
 so far we have the whole deal 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.420
 against inter waves second vfl osnabrück 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.930
 Of course, that's a tough game too 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.160
 expect 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.020
 and there is the game association 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.660
 unterhaching certainly already with 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.829
 a point satisfied 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.379
 from the backlash we know that osnabrück 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.820
 Super Team is one of the three 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.559
 best teams in the league the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.860
 my players are technically good 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.509
 have football with the guide arrangement 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.270
 with opinion to the west 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.399
 deadly player in her squad and us 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.050
 have to be careful when we play our game 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.280
 start today was a good team 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.149
 racing come in that we ourselves 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.399
 auskontern 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.600
 because she should be a relative frequent 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.670
 go deep and then the balls long 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.990
 It demands that we know and it was great 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.580
 to prevent 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.740
 who also mean the point today 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.630
 Satisfied if you go against a first 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.369
 play or second on the goal difference 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.880
 Of course you are with the point 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.770
 satisfied 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.420
 that is not the point then 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.890
 as well as the last games 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 at a very restrained 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.509
 initial phase in the young team 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.960
 already after 22 minutes with 2 0 back 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.570
 was 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.689
 yes, we only have to stop again 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.880
 but how could you connect? 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.649
 just two goals in a row and the same 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.030
 then it is usually already we believe 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.460
 have seen the first half of the year today 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.689
 why dismantling is three 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.820
 chances to score two goals 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.140
 if you auskontern in your own stadium 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.060
 let something happen in no case there 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.159
 very disappointing that we two 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.439
 different sides show the game in the game 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.530
 first increase clearly lapses minutes 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.990
 again 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.250
 Two counter gates are received 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.690
 then better come into play in the game 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.700
 first half then would have 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.370
 There will be two more chances from the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.520
 You do not have to say anything because he marks that 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.410
 Tor makes the stefan of the 2010 format 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.910
 Opportunities for us is the gate like 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.530
 I also do not know we need to get nailed 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.150
 just fight it out of us 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.070
 addressed great chance of markus 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.630
 Schwabe would have arrived shortly before half-time 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.160
 quite the game again quite a 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.230
 other twist and the young team 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.580
 give it another boost 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.980
 but defended the clever ones 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.050
 osnabrücker their 2 0 lead sovereign 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.980
 to the end and finally won 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.230
 also earned 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.640
 It is the fifth game where we each 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.380
 have played well halfway and it 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.560
 unfortunately not enough 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.930
 to make the money that the bankruptcy series 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.670
 the young player is unsure in 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.209
 many situations in the game clearly 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.400
 recognize 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.810
 but he never and manuel tree 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.790
 know the situation very well 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.350
 assess 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.959
 yes you can already see on the game because 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.090
 much as for us government but we 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.070
 have to fight us out as a team 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.480
 and yes, we have to go if I have 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.489
 I saw the second half there 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.260
 we gave it full throttle with opportunities 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.600
 created and I mean that makes hope 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.519
 for the next games we have pressure 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.620
 We could therefore because you absolutely 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.540
 must pursue now or you have to 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.239
 not realized for the hachinger 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.760
 As yasin yilmaz said, that was the gate 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.239
 unfortunately we nailed up now hope 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.000
 next saturday against arminia bielefeld 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.260
 away and 2 pm 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.260
 Give everything and try three points
