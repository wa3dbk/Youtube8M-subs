the ball and drive forward that in this

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.379 
the ball and drive forward that in this
particular<00:02:50.200> team<00:02:50.829> I<00:02:51.040> feel<00:02:51.880> he<00:02:51.970> picks<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.269> ball

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
particular team I feel he picks the ball

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.210 
particular team I feel he picks the ball
up<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.750> time<00:02:53.049> it<00:02:53.260> doesn't<00:02:53.410> need<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.799> go<00:02:53.950> tight

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
up to time it doesn't need to go tight

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.860 
up to time it doesn't need to go tight
because<00:02:54.549> he's<00:02:54.700> got<00:02:54.910> consum<00:02:55.389> and<00:02:55.540> if<00:02:55.630> Thompson

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
because he's got consum and if Thompson

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.839 
because he's got consum and if Thompson
got<00:02:56.230> their<00:02:56.410> hand<00:02:56.590> Donnie<00:02:56.829> normally<00:02:57.459> plays<00:02:57.669> it

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
got their hand Donnie normally plays it

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.759 
got their hand Donnie normally plays it
and<00:02:58.060> all<00:02:58.389> three<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.690> them<00:02:58.870> seem<00:02:59.079> to<00:02:59.109> be<00:02:59.620> falling

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
and all three of them seem to be falling

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.800 
and all three of them seem to be falling
over<00:03:00.160> themselves<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.760> very<00:03:01.299> first<00:03:01.569> gun
