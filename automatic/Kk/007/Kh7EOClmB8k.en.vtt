I mean that doesn't have anything to do
with<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.649> because<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.190> two<00:00:53.399> by<00:00:53.579> two<00:00:53.640> now

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
with it just because it's two by two now

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
with it just because it's two by two now
you<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.199> five<00:00:55.500> icons<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.489> folder

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
you see I have five icons in this folder

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.090 
you see I have five icons in this folder
here<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.840> let's<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.170> back<00:00:58.350> out<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.890> see

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that still has a two but two appearance

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.549 
that still has a two but two appearance
so<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:02.129> know<00:01:02.250> that's<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.730> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.120> change

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
so you know that's not going to change

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.820 
so you know that's not going to change
if<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.890> did<00:01:05.070> add<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.519> more<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:07.530> would<00:01:07.710> make

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
if we did add one more that would make

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.910 
if we did add one more that would make
six<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.170> well<00:01:10.170> actually<00:01:10.409> there's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it to be a 3 by 2 then you can just do

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.310 
it to be a 3 by 2 then you can just do
that<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.790> does<00:01:30.000> require<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.450> respring<00:01:31.140> you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
that but it does require a respring you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.670 
that but it does require a respring you
say<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.950> save<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.460> respring<00:01:32.880> and

say you have to save and respring and

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.609 
say you have to save and respring and
one<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.860> comes<00:01:35.070> back<00:01:35.340> up<00:01:35.640> you'll<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.619> two

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
one that comes back up you'll have two

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.179
