00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.189
 a lamp is the use of it itself 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.980
 lamp because you can therefore nothing 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.980

 wood hole punch pass the wire 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.220

 for the environment is not just put on the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.350

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.010
 different sizes neco natural is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.960
 very nice bonnet and can also decorate 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.070
 fear of the press can be active too 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.840
 Health task saw the red is 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.559
 Beautiful, beautiful, I can not run into this 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.879
 Christmas 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.219
 q ta al her work model 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.940
 we make this lamp we use 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.660
 string of color you want none 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.260
 the school normal white scissors with the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.159
 brush the glass to make the measurement in 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.189
 time to pass the wire and a ball the ball 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.960
 It does not need to be all filled up very hard. 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.570
 malleable door 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:25.590
 the ball is how we 're going to make people 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.430
 Go and see where the goal is here. 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.420
 We'll get the glass and put the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.420
 team to score 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.210
 let's do a circus 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:46.000
 around what we mark 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:48.790
 most hi you can do that ball 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.410
 big surprise waiting park gives to 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.270
 to do with that big one too 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.800
 done five it gets you get the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.490
 string 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.360
 You're not going to tie it here, it's not like that. 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.550
 and so 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.990
 as if it were the ball had the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:33.700
 waist would be the waist of the ball is at 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:38.020
 cast search will get the wire 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.989
 tied here and the space but we left 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.100
 with one with the mark here of the son of that 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.019
 who will insure she does not leave the place 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.540
 It is good that you put a roll of string 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:55.720
 on the floor and you stand and you go 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.769
 dance and twist lightly 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.810
 every ball that changes so that it does not 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.480
 stay one side too full other side 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.970
 very empty with the holes and goes always 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.450
 leaving here if it's for you not people in 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.190
 Up the dick this space here looking for 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.190
 always put the child that passes in the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.190
 side of the circus lyon we did 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:56.239
 and I have seen so many times in the same 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:04:01.010
 sense has always passed 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.720
 Different now I do not know that here it is 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.550
 getting a little I'll try to fill out 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.790
 This part here is start of the turns 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.530
 Only I can fill it out because 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.870
 When you go passing thread you have 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.310
 that is keep an eye on where and passing 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.049
 if you do not go through it several times 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.910
 place will get lots of space and it 's not that 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.400
 are always correct 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.460
 there I do not vote for the thickness that I 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:30.919
 I want you right 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:34.250
 Then I come short, you're going to tie the thread. 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:39.350
 here is also more effect here 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.530
 you'll just get it will give our 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.530
 rhythm 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:58.160
 this is it, you cut it is made base 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:03.790
 there you will need support the case of 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:08.360
 local cola always try to preserve it 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.100
 public or private property and is now 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:18.890
 Simple now we'll get it and go 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:21.440
 is soaked with cola since it was there 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.390
 you'll just dump the same glue will 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.960
 very string material is little but it is 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.670
 too string a lot of tone do not worry 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.020
 say so the teacher will stay 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.100
 You noticed that she is 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.100
 transparent right 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:21.979
 then you jarraud well the ball with 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:24.800
 glue the string a little here is 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:28.550
 only you now put her if preference 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.430
 where is the respect in the morning at two 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.490
 The afternoon was late. 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:44.990
 It was hot but if it did not it would stay 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:46.400
 ready only tomorrow and then you can 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.280
 to think that it already is not 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.680
 op because you will only going to play in it 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.409
 do not have a hard time and need a school 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.479
 after it is dry is only you 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:59.000
 want to dry take out the piddac 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:02.380
 he will pull the ball will get out of exemption 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.380
 will be ready
