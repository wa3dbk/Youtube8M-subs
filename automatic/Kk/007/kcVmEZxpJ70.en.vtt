00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
people with both low end systems who

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.689 
people with both low end systems who
just<00:00:25.710> need<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.920> get<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> game<00:00:26.279> running<00:00:26.490> really

just need to get the game running really
well<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.240> people<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:27.869> higher<00:00:28.109> end<00:00:28.380> systems

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
well and people with higher end systems

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.380 
well and people with higher end systems
who<00:00:28.859> want<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.130> be<00:00:29.310> able<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.550> get<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> most<00:00:30.090> mods

sort<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.180> things<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.800> guess<00:00:35.100> we

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
sort of things like that so I guess we

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
sort of things like that so I guess we
start<00:00:35.489> talking<00:00:35.579> about<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.059> topic<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.780> today's

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
start talking about the topic of today's

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.900 
start talking about the topic of today's
episodes<00:00:37.590> which<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> large<00:00:38.430> address

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
episodes which is a large address

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.330 
episodes which is a large address
awareness<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.649> fix<00:00:40.950> that's<00:00:41.129> only

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
awareness this is a fix that's only

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.860 
awareness this is a fix that's only
going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.640> affect<00:00:41.879> people<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.149> 64-bit

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
going to affect people with 64-bit

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.330 
going to affect people with 64-bit
operating<00:00:43.230> systems<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:43.980> than<00:00:44.160> three

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
operating systems and more than three

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.799 
operating systems and more than three
gigabytes<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.820> RAM<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.450> don't<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
gigabytes of RAM so you don't have that

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.740 
gigabytes of RAM so you don't have that
I'm<00:00:46.620> sorry<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.700> probably<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.570> not

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
we're gonna be using cff Explorer to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.099 
we're gonna be using cff Explorer to
make<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> game<00:00:56.670> large<00:00:56.969> address<00:00:57.210> aware<00:00:57.600> I'm

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
make the game large address aware I'm

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.630 
make the game large address aware I'm
going<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> explain<00:00:58.649> these<00:00:58.829> terms<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> little

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.889 
going to explain these terms in a little
bit<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.059> first<00:01:00.300> let<00:01:00.510> me<00:01:00.570> get<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
bit but first let me get to the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.990 
bit but first let me get to the
intentions<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> allow<00:01:02.850> your

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
intentions this is going to allow your

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.560 
intentions this is going to allow your
game<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.449> use<00:01:03.570> more<00:01:03.960> than<00:01:04.939> 1.8<00:01:05.939> gigabytes<00:01:06.420> of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
game to use more than 1.8 gigabytes of

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.570 
game to use more than 1.8 gigabytes of
RAM<00:01:06.990> which<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.350> pretty<00:01:07.799> much<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.130> limit

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
RAM which is pretty much the limit

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.179 
RAM which is pretty much the limit
you're<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> hit<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.659> oblivion<00:01:10.260> this

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you're going to hit with oblivion this

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.340 
you're going to hit with oblivion this
is<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> total<00:01:11.760> memory<00:01:12.000> increase<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:12.630> well<00:01:12.840> you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
is a total memory increase as well you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.080 
is a total memory increase as well you
have<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> realize<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.400> graphics<00:01:14.850> card

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
have to realize that your graphics card

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.920 
have to realize that your graphics card
also<00:01:15.479> uses<00:01:15.780> memory<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:17.130> plus<00:01:17.939> your<00:01:18.630> RAM

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
also uses memory and that plus your RAM

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.630 
also uses memory and that plus your RAM
is<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> games<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.250> use<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.549> if

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
is all that the games going to use so if

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640 
is all that the games going to use so if
you<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> gig<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.360> ram<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:22.259> graphics

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you have a gig of ram on your graphics

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.609 
you have a gig of ram on your graphics
card<00:01:22.920> or<00:01:23.250> more<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:24.509> could<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:24.960> hampered<00:01:25.409> or

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
card or more that could be hampered or

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.830 
card or more that could be hampered or
vice<00:01:25.920> versa<00:01:26.450> it's<00:01:27.450> going<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> improve

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
vice versa it's going to improve

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960 
vice versa it's going to improve
performance<00:01:28.500> by<00:01:28.560> quite<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.400> as<00:01:29.579> its<00:01:29.820> going

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
performance by quite a bit as its going

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270 
performance by quite a bit as its going
to<00:01:30.060> enable<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.990> use<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.350> higher<00:01:31.560> texture<00:01:32.070> mods

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
to enable the use of higher texture mods

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.030 
to enable the use of higher texture mods
without<00:01:32.670> causing<00:01:33.270> crashes<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.500> texture

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
without causing crashes or texture

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.069 
without causing crashes or texture
errors<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.549> may<00:01:35.729> even<00:01:36.119> lead<00:01:36.270> textures<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.990> be

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
errors that may even lead textures to be

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.719 
errors that may even lead textures to be
missing<00:01:37.619> from<00:01:37.799> your<00:01:38.009> game<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
missing from your game so this is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.789 
missing from your game so this is
actually<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> very<00:01:39.479> useful<00:01:39.750> fix<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.500> those<00:01:40.650> of

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
actually a very useful fix for those of

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.649 
actually a very useful fix for those of
you<00:01:40.950> who<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> hardware<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.420> software

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you who have the hardware and software

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.289 
you who have the hardware and software
capable<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.530> doing<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.040> all<00:01:44.549> right<00:01:44.939> now<00:01:45.090> what

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
capable of doing it all right now what

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.960 
capable of doing it all right now what
is<00:01:45.479> large<00:01:45.810> address<00:01:46.140> aware<00:01:46.560> well<00:01:46.890> basically<00:01:47.520> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
is large address aware well basically to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.880 
is large address aware well basically to
make<00:01:48.600> your<00:01:48.780> game<00:01:48.930> larger<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.409> aware<00:01:49.649> you're

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
make your game larger just aware you're

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.740 
make your game larger just aware you're
enabling<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.520> game<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.970> use<00:01:51.119> more<00:01:51.390> than<00:01:51.540> two

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
enabling the game to use more than two

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.069 
enabling the game to use more than two
gigabytes<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.350> total<00:01:52.799> memory<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.119> video

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
gigabytes of total memory this is video

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.859 
gigabytes of total memory this is video
memory<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.829> system<00:01:56.430> memory<00:01:56.549> put<00:01:56.880> together<00:01:57.030> so

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
memory and system memory put together so

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.120 
memory and system memory put together so
there<00:01:58.409> are<00:01:58.469> two<00:01:58.560> separate<00:01:58.799> things<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.070> you

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
there are two separate things if you

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.920 
there are two separate things if you
didn't<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.399> by<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.579> way<00:01:59.790> basically<00:02:00.600> it

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
didn't know by the way basically it

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.480 
didn't know by the way basically it
allows<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> use<00:02:01.439> more<00:02:01.649> than<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.310> if

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
allows you to use more than that and if

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.370 
allows you to use more than that and if
you<00:02:02.610> know<00:02:02.729> anything<00:02:03.180> about<00:02:03.299> RAM<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.079> memory

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you know anything about RAM and memory

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.870 
you know anything about RAM and memory
usage<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> game<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.310> will<00:02:05.430> realize<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
usage for the game you will realize that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.940 
usage for the game you will realize that
you're<00:02:06.180> going<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> hit<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.719> ceiling<00:02:07.020> pretty

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
you're going to hit that ceiling pretty

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.240 
you're going to hit that ceiling pretty
much<00:02:08.220> instantly<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.450> mean<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.039> eight

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
much instantly I mean if you have eight

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.770 
much instantly I mean if you have eight
gigs<00:02:11.520> around<00:02:11.700> you're<00:02:12.090> only<00:02:12.239> really<00:02:12.510> going<00:02:12.720> to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
gigs around you're only really going to

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.620 
gigs around you're only really going to
be<00:02:12.870> using<00:02:13.200> about

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
be using about

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.590 
be using about
1.5<00:02:14.290> gig<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.310> game<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.360> can

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
1.5 gig of it on the game and that can

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.730 
1.5 gig of it on the game and that can
cause<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.810> lot<00:02:16.960> of<00:02:17.020> problems<00:02:17.320> especially<00:02:17.470> with

more performance increase out of this

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.190 
more performance increase out of this
but<00:02:28.180> either<00:02:28.330> way<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.540> would<00:02:28.660> recommend<00:02:29.110> going

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
well but fortunately Bethesda finally

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.150 
well but fortunately Bethesda finally
patched<00:02:37.570> that<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.590> without<00:02:38.740> further<00:02:38.920> ado

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160

clock speed we can see the installed
amount<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.340> RAM<00:03:06.580> so<00:03:06.880> I<00:03:06.910> have<00:03:07.060> 12<00:03:07.300> gigabytes<00:03:07.780> of

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
amount of RAM so I have 12 gigabytes of

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.140 
amount of RAM so I have 12 gigabytes of
RAM<00:03:08.110> that's<00:03:08.800> pretty<00:03:09.100> good<00:03:09.250> but<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.880> big<00:03:10.120> thing

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
RAM that's pretty good but the big thing

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.570 
RAM that's pretty good but the big thing
is<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.690> system<00:03:10.990> type<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.620> is<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.740> 64-bit

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
is the system type it is a 64-bit

once that's done you will be able to
find<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:23.950> oblivion<00:05:24.370> exe<00:05:25.120> right<00:05:25.870> click<00:05:26.110> on<00:05:26.260> it

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
and open it with cff explorer but not

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.260 
and open it with cff explorer but not
after<00:05:28.900> copying<00:05:29.890> it<00:05:30.040> so<00:05:30.730> I<00:05:30.760> recommend<00:05:31.240> just

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
after copying it so I recommend just

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.750

creating a nice copy and pasting that

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.390 
creating a nice copy and pasting that
