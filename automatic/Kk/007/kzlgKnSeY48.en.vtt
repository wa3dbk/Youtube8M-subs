 Nikita is an unusual to go out once in 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.380
 few years but always around them so 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.190
 hype and always involved everyones 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.350
 film festivals and in rewards here 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.610
 such a disk and actually a long time ago 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:20.130
 ordered a wallet that Jules 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:27.670
 cantal film a little bit like that 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:30.040
 such a wallet ordered it with bmf will 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.770
 dot com there are all sorts of on 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:41.560
 the choice is there are cards convenient times distract 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:43.570
 the video card is only confusing 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.340
 he does not have any how many just bought 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.870
 anyway no bonuses no I don't know 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.340

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:57.060
 for example all sorts of points to give video 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.060
 bonuses what's the point zero oh left

 so here's a wallet 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.790
