00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.309
 one way or another will affect 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.539
 fighter behavior due to the unique 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.339
 personal preferences 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.009
 also called potentials of different 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.109
 the militias may like different people 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.829
 different phenomena 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.089
 and if we say smog and the girl is better 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.629

 misses opportunities to show off knowledge and 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.369
 in front of subordinates 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.849
 although the combat system is intuitive 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.789
 easy to learn and she tells 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.869
 how much hit by the enemy is required 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:57.999
 to kill him some missions 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:02:59.679
 requires careful preparation and 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:00.629
 planning 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.389
 competent distribution of members 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:03.090
 squad 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.110
 all militias are systematized by 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.940
 grades according to their talent 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.100
 pumped over classes too 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.820
 no level is provided for each fighter 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.500
 experience is spent on raising 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500
 qualifications of all fighters at once 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.199
 Valkyrie CRO Nicolas generally a lot 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.529
 subtleties allowing for 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:22.469
 consider differently 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.769
 passing different missions and not 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.899
 always ill-considered offensive shock to the corpse 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.109
 previously machine gunners justifies itself because 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.899
 it is often required not to destroy everyone 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:33.849
 enemy soldiers but pay all bases 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.299
 and more convenient to do it with a scout 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.049
 able to run far and in the case 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.959
 unforeseen danger and aptly 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:40.859
 shoot 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.109
 how do players act in such situations 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.889
