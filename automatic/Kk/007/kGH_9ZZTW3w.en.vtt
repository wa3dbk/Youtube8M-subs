liquid so let's just quickly go into the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.170 
liquid so let's just quickly go into the
world<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:15.470> yeah<00:00:16.470> okay<00:00:16.980> finally<00:00:17.850> cooled<00:00:18.060> is

world here yeah okay finally cooled is

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.380 
world here yeah okay finally cooled is
all<00:00:18.359> about<00:00:18.600> water<00:00:19.080> not<00:00:19.560> being<00:00:19.949> infinite<00:00:20.910> so

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
all about water not being infinite so

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.230 
all about water not being infinite so
fine<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.769> what<00:00:23.250> he<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.490> already<00:00:23.670> see<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
fine it so what he can already see is

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.630 
fine it so what he can already see is
that<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.310> like<00:00:26.310> non<00:00:27.619> minecraftian

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
that this is like non minecraftian

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.370 
that this is like non minecraftian
because<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.939> water<00:00:30.119> isn't<00:00:30.449> up<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.349> full

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
because this water isn't up to full

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.970 
because this water isn't up to full
block<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.870> let's<00:00:33.870> pretend<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.739> want<00:00:34.920> to

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
block and let's pretend we want to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.920 
block and let's pretend we want to
support<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.399> villagers<00:00:35.790> with<00:00:36.000> some<00:00:36.660> water

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
support the villagers with some water

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.270 
support the villagers with some water
okay<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.340> let's<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.910> quickly<00:00:39.950> grab<00:00:40.950> some

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
okay so let's just quickly grab some

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.729 
okay so let's just quickly grab some
pipes<00:00:41.940> from<00:00:42.540> too<00:00:42.750> many<00:00:42.870> atoms<00:00:44.329> boo-yeah

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
pipes from too many atoms boo-yeah

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.869 
pipes from too many atoms boo-yeah
quickly<00:00:46.739> build<00:00:47.039> some<00:00:47.309> pumping<00:00:47.789> stations<00:00:50.660> and

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
quickly build some pumping stations and

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:00.470 
quickly build some pumping stations and
boom<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:57.920> let's<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.309> build<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.000> piping

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
boom and let's then build a piping

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.440 
boom and let's then build a piping
system<00:01:01.430> again<00:01:03.320> support<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.500> house<00:01:04.860> first

yes you can just simply got well no more
but<00:01:24.750> will<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.990> where<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
but will do is that's like where the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.880 
but will do is that's like where the
water<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.380> supposed<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:29.450> basically<00:01:30.450> do

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
water is supposed to be basically do

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:39.350 
water is supposed to be basically do
boom<00:01:33.290> there<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:35.100> oh<00:01:35.460> well<00:01:37.280> mmm<00:01:38.280> where's<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
pump their place right there and right

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.440 
pump their place right there and right
click<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:44.310> starts<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.939> pump<00:01:45.149> water

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
click it and it starts to pump water

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.039 
click it and it starts to pump water
from<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.960> sea<00:01:46.409> from<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> lake<00:01:48.049> thrillist

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
from the sea from the lake thrillist

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.219 
from the sea from the lake thrillist
pipes<00:01:49.320> right<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:50.790> yes<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.540> fills<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
pipes right in here yes it fills up and

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.719 
pipes right in here yes it fills up and
as<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.350> see<00:01:52.680> well<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.159> should<00:01:53.340> stop<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> right

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
as you see well we should stop it right

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.990 
as you see well we should stop it right
here<00:01:53.970> well<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.540> already<00:01:54.810> full<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.880> what<00:01:56.880> we

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
here well it's already full and what we

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.850 
here well it's already full and what we
will<00:01:57.149> see<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.780> decreases<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:58.560> fine

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
will see is that this decreases now fine

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.139 
will see is that this decreases now fine
stripe<00:01:59.490> locks<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:01.290> make<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.740> bigger<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.909> will

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
stripe locks and make it bigger it will

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.109 
stripe locks and make it bigger it will
decrease<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:05.100> water<00:02:05.310> will<00:02:05.490> go<00:02:05.610> down<00:02:05.820> if

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
decrease like the water will go down if

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.280 
decrease like the water will go down if
I<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.360> start<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.350> up<00:02:07.409> again<00:02:07.940> fold<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.060> up

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
I then start it up again fold this up

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.090 
I then start it up again fold this up
well<00:02:11.790> stop<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:12.940> again<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:14.140> there<00:02:14.560> are<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.830> lot<00:02:15.069> of

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
well stop it again so there are a lot of

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.740 
well stop it again so there are a lot of
mechanics<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:15.940> be<00:02:16.090> used<00:02:16.300> for<00:02:16.450> comes

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
mechanics that can be used for comes

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.680 
mechanics that can be used for comes
these<00:02:16.930> pumps<00:02:17.830> right<00:02:18.730> here<00:02:18.970> could<00:02:19.630> be

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
these pumps right here could be

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.750 
these pumps right here could be
activated<00:02:20.350> with<00:02:20.440> redstone<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.220> when<00:02:21.670> you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
activated with redstone and when you

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.100 
activated with redstone and when you
might<00:02:21.940> cease<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.510> all<00:02:22.630> right<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.900> water

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
might cease that all right the water

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.650 
might cease that all right the water
here<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.470> going<00:02:23.800> down<00:02:24.040> well<00:02:24.490> no<00:02:24.940> not<00:02:25.180> yet<00:02:25.420> but

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
here is going down well no not yet but

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.220 
here is going down well no not yet but
well<00:02:26.650> let's<00:02:26.980> support<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.840> let<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.110> house

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
well let's support just let the house

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.640 
well let's support just let the house
with<00:02:29.440> water<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.830> let<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.040> over<00:02:30.580> flood<00:02:31.650> so

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
with water and let it over flood so

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:42.240 
with water and let it over flood so
let's<00:02:33.100> just<00:02:33.310> do<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.930> let's<00:02:38.610> go<00:02:41.250> we'll

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
intelligent spot to go to and basically

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.080 
intelligent spot to go to and basically
it's<00:02:53.590> going<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.800> flood<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.250> whole<00:02:54.489> entire

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
it's going to flood this whole entire

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.640 
it's going to flood this whole entire
area<00:02:55.510> until<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:56.080> empty<00:02:56.620> like<00:02:57.400> right<00:02:57.610> now

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
area until this empty like right now

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.900 
area until this empty like right now
it's<00:02:59.650> almost<00:02:59.860> empty<00:03:02.310> yeah<00:03:03.310> but<00:03:03.489> I<00:03:03.519> could<00:03:03.760> do

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
it's almost empty yeah but I could do

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.080 
it's almost empty yeah but I could do
this<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:04.600> we'll<00:03:04.780> be<00:03:04.900> like<00:03:05.050> in<00:03:06.090> circle

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
this and then we'll be like in circle

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.630 
this and then we'll be like in circle
the<00:03:07.269> whole<00:03:07.420> time<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:08.319> we'll<00:03:08.560> get<00:03:08.769> sect<00:03:09.430> in

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
the whole time so we'll get sect in

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.330 
the whole time so we'll get sect in
right<00:03:09.819> there<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.900> if<00:03:11.319> we<00:03:11.350> also<00:03:11.590> do<00:03:14.340> yeah

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
right there and if we also do yeah

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.680 
right there and if we also do yeah
there's<00:03:15.579> a<00:03:15.670> lot<00:03:15.820> of<00:03:15.850> stuff<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.209> can<00:03:16.329> do<00:03:16.480> with<00:03:16.510> a

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
there's a lot of stuff you can do with a

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.009 
there's a lot of stuff you can do with a
smart<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.350> also<00:03:17.650> adds<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.840> different<00:03:19.840> blocks

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
smart it also adds and different blocks

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.170 
smart it also adds and different blocks
like<00:03:20.230> these<00:03:20.410> who<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:20.829> the<00:03:21.040> ocean<00:03:21.519> blog<00:03:21.880> and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
like these who this the ocean blog and

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.390 
like these who this the ocean blog and
the<00:03:22.350> water<00:03:23.350> block<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:23.829> ocean<00:03:24.190> block

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
the water block this ocean block

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.990 
the water block this ocean block
basically<00:03:25.030> at<00:03:25.269> it's<00:03:25.750> like<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:27.400> like<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.640> water

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
basically at it's like it's like a water

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.530 
basically at it's like it's like a water
block<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.489> is<00:03:30.640> basically<00:03:30.850> also<00:03:31.299> water

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
block and this is basically also water

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.840 
block and this is basically also water
buck<00:03:31.720> but<00:03:31.900> it's<00:03:32.049> just<00:03:32.260> like<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.620> little<00:03:33.310> sand<00:03:33.610> it

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
buck but it's just like a little sand it

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.630 
buck but it's just like a little sand it
doesn't<00:03:34.299> move<00:03:34.690> because<00:03:35.049> it's<00:03:35.260> like<00:03:35.640> cheated

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
doesn't move because it's like cheated

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.090 
doesn't move because it's like cheated
so<00:03:37.000> yeah<00:03:38.190> well<00:03:39.780> what<00:03:40.780> is<00:03:40.900> this<00:03:41.109> not<00:03:41.530> work<00:03:41.920> right

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
so yeah well what is this not work right

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.270

it's like this and if you pout with

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.649 
it's like this and if you pout with
redstone<00:04:08.159> it<00:04:08.549> won't<00:04:08.849> let<00:04:09.030> water<00:04:09.239> through<00:04:10.190> and

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
redstone it won't let water through and

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.710 
redstone it won't let water through and
um<00:04:13.010> well<00:04:14.010> there's<00:04:14.190> some<00:04:14.879> more<00:04:15.209> stuff<00:04:15.480> looking

um well there's some more stuff looking
just<00:04:15.959> well<00:04:16.769> yeah<00:04:17.070> these<00:04:17.310> are<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:18.019> packets

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
just well yeah these are the packets

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.700 
just well yeah these are the packets
these<00:04:20.699> are<00:04:20.880> like<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.299> little<00:04:21.930> bit<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.109> lava<00:04:22.380> and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
these are like a little bit of lava and

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.610 
these are like a little bit of lava and
other<00:04:23.340> things<00:04:23.550> like<00:04:23.729> a<00:04:23.820> little<00:04:24.090> water<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.440> is

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
other things like a little water this is

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.360 
other things like a little water this is
you<00:04:25.889> craft<00:04:26.190> done<00:04:26.430> with<00:04:26.669> um<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:28.020> know<00:04:29.010> what<00:04:29.220> is

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
you craft done with um I know what is

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.070 
you craft done with um I know what is
called<00:04:32.120> well<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.150> can<00:04:33.389> find<00:04:33.600> right<00:04:33.810> now<00:04:33.900> but

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
called well I can find right now but

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.379 
called well I can find right now but
it's<00:04:34.320> like<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:34.680> one<00:04:35.660> specific<00:04:36.680> stone<00:04:37.680> and

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
it's like this one specific stone and

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:45.580 
it's like this one specific stone and
well<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:40.070> yeah<00:04:41.070> it's<00:04:41.400> called<00:04:41.900> me<00:04:42.900> thin<00:04:43.289> yeah

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
well and yeah it's called me thin yeah

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.170 
well and yeah it's called me thin yeah
so<00:04:46.590> that's<00:04:46.860> basically<00:04:47.070> how<00:04:48.169> this<00:04:49.169> works<00:04:49.500> but

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
so that's basically how this works but

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.629 
so that's basically how this works but
they're<00:04:51.180> really<00:04:51.479> cool<00:04:51.900> structures<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:53.490> they

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
they're really cool structures and they

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.029 
they're really cool structures and they
can<00:04:53.820> believe<00:04:54.120> this<00:04:54.240> i'm<00:04:54.419> just<00:04:54.720> gonna<00:04:54.870> em<00:04:55.229> cut

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
can believe this i'm just gonna em cut

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.950 
can believe this i'm just gonna em cut
this<00:04:56.220> video<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.970> then<00:04:57.300> show<00:04:57.630> you<00:04:57.690> one

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
this video and then show you one

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.090 
this video and then show you one
structure<00:04:58.350> i'm<00:04:58.410> just<00:04:58.560> going<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.710> build<00:04:58.919> right

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
structure i'm just going to build right

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.960 
structure i'm just going to build right
here<00:04:59.370> so<00:04:59.970> yeah<00:05:00.479> see<00:05:01.229> you<00:05:01.350> in<00:05:01.500> some<00:05:01.970> seconds

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
here so yeah see you in some seconds

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.020 
here so yeah see you in some seconds
probably<00:05:03.389> my<00:05:04.250> earns<00:05:06.740> solo<00:05:07.740> guys<00:05:07.979> yeah<00:05:08.490> this<00:05:08.820> is

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
probably my earns solo guys yeah this is

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.320 
probably my earns solo guys yeah this is
one<00:05:09.270> stretch<00:05:09.539> i'm<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:10.020> really<00:05:10.410> quickly<00:05:10.889> so

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
one stretch i'm a really quickly so

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.580 
one stretch i'm a really quickly so
basically<00:05:12.330> what<00:05:12.599> happens<00:05:12.990> here<00:05:13.229> is<00:05:13.260> that<00:05:13.320> the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
basically what happens here is that the

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.950 
basically what happens here is that the
water<00:05:13.770> gets<00:05:13.979> pumped<00:05:14.400> out<00:05:14.490> of<00:05:14.669> here<00:05:14.880> well<00:05:15.630> then

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
water gets pumped out of here well then

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.440 
water gets pumped out of here well then
so<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.950> seeds<00:05:17.220> get<00:05:17.460> fresh<00:05:17.849> water<00:05:18.180> and

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
so that the seeds get fresh water and

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.890 
so that the seeds get fresh water and
then<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.349> dirty<00:05:19.740> water<00:05:19.919> gets<00:05:20.220> pumped<00:05:20.700> out

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
then the dirty water gets pumped out
