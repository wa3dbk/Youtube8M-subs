finger placement out c e CB me now this

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.510 
finger placement out c e CB me now this
can<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.989> difficult<00:00:40.170> because<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> string<00:00:41.399> is

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
can be difficult because the a string is

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.369 
can be difficult because the a string is
pretty<00:00:41.910> high<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.809> look<00:00:42.960> how<00:00:43.050> much<00:00:43.200> I'm
