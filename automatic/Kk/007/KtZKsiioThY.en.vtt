the<00:00:57.650> effectiveness<00:00:59.080> okay<00:01:00.080> you<00:01:00.710> show<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:01.010> that

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
the effectiveness okay you show you that

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.219

again

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.200 

that's<00:01:04.949> perfect<00:01:05.700> see<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.439> then<00:01:08.210> you

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that's perfect see that and then you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.580 
that's perfect see that and then you
should<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> three<00:01:10.079> it's<00:01:10.259> easier

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
should do with the three it's easier

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.469 
should do with the three it's easier
because<00:01:10.770> when<00:01:11.039> you<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:12.090> when<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.329> do<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
because when you do like when you do the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.169 
because when you do like when you do the
undies<00:01:12.929> you<00:01:13.909> have<00:01:14.909> three<00:01:15.210> fingers<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.549> you

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
undies you have three fingers so you

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.690 
undies you have three fingers so you
take<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:18.450> smudge<00:01:18.960> card<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.369> put<00:01:20.579> it

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
take your smudge card and you put it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.179 
take your smudge card and you put it
under<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.240> normal<00:01:21.899> card<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.649> one<00:01:22.799> card<00:01:22.979> it's

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
under the normal card and one card it's

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.609 
under the normal card and one card it's
much<00:01:23.429> much<00:01:23.819> higher<00:01:24.119> now<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.170> an<00:01:25.289> earnest

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
much much higher now you do an earnest

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.380
