00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello people and welcome to a 24th 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.180
 have to follow games 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.920
 today's topic will be something 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.590
 interesting but a little bit less 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.650
 be scary because the subject should be 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.890
 it's about people zelda no and that 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.660
 is not the sound but today 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.500
 it's about three very interesting 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.840
 must play 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:32.040
 I'll tell you that first now 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.780
 myth muslim background music the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.730
 legend of zelda ocarina of time was a 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.180
 huge success finds endo and her 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.379
 then console nintendo 64 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.300
 Overall, the title sold far 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.860
 over seven million times and will too 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.570
 at the present time of many players 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.860
 as the best game of the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.030
 Video game story titled this 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.449
 fact makes the game natural 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.360
 perfect for myths and so I have too 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.949
 some already found 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.070
 one of the most famous myths of all 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.930
 background music in fire temple 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.390
 this is supposed to be Islamic prayer calls 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.510
 contain which in subsequent 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.740
 versions have been taken out again 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.650
 before continuing with the myth 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.000
 busy one must first explain whether 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.710
 there are different versions at all 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.380
 play the legend of zelda ocarina of 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.990
 time has given and yes the artist 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.700
 given 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.990
 There were three versions in total 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.740
 1.0 version 1.1 and version 1.2 live 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.500
 all in this order 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.689
 publishes the white innovations 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.220
 relate graphically or play technical 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.619
 Errors or problems of the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.659
 play in the first one 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.920
 but in the version 1.2 became 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.799
 actually the background music 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.600
 it would make sense to change it but it was 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.689
 The Islamic prayers really call the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.729
 were heard 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.649
 in fact, you should be clear in the background 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.280
 and clearly typical prayer calls of the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.990
 izlam so shall the call i for example 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.149
 testify that there is no god but Allah 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.240
 results so in this background music 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.219
 included are understandably of 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.380
 Muslims do not particularly like this fact 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.330
 Great especially the music even a friend 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.569
 fire temple is to hear which of the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.390
 imagination of hell 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.579
 of course could come because of this 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.620
 by nintendo not intended and so 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.319
 changed the background music from the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.060
 version 1.2 and put it beyond 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.999
 also some more symbols which the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.709
 symbolize islam 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:28.709
 why nintendo used this music 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.239
 is still not clear 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.560
 some explanations come to the 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.450
 decided that nintendo in one 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.329
 database of music pieces after one 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.400
 breathed oriental 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.829
 background music was searched for and possibly 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.959
 The Islamic prayer court as well 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.200
 most popular result displayed 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.540
 has to match it was probably looking for synonymous 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.689
 after oriental symbols and got 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.010
 corresponding results delivered 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.379
 this theory is underpinned by this 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.409
 since the corpse of the back music even one 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.900
 another one included in 64 games is in 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.689
 the route kellinghusen the previously 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.549
 formal cruising world can be heard 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.370
 namely the same prayer calls 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.870
 in the background apparently had 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.000
 nintendo so this music on his 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.879
 database used without knowing what 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.979
 this is what you are 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.509
 Sorry the apologized briefly 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:27.069
 after announcement for this adversity 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:29.079
 create epona in the second myth 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.720
 legend of zelda row has left a horse 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:34.419
 which is that his parish priest is 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.340
 in the game the legend of zelda ocarina of 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.079
 time should this horse by a 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.299
 glitch also another designer 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.150
 namely take to a shadow 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.889
 black ivona are in the majority 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.870
 playing zelda are as bosses or 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.790
 opponent so-called shadow left 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.030
 or how to divide coal 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.989
 to find the black link 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.689
 these are just like that 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.430
 However, protagonists have a complete one 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.900
 black coloring and for example 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.879
 rotor which makes them very dangerous 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.310
 the glitch requires that one be 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.219
 type underground areal finds which ones 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.169
 unusual opponents are 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:13.900
 you should now be your own 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:17.320
 kill the horse before you even get the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.219
 If you attack the horse , if you attack the horse 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.110
 The horse dies takes a cutscene 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:24.500
 whereupon a dead epona from the ground 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.600
 goes out 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.760
 after the cutscene is over is 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.440
 the player returns to cairo and 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.390
 today the possibility now this death 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.100
 bronner what a pity only that 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.780
 black bean is called to ride 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.000
 however , link should always have one 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.310
 Wear light if he does 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.960
 the actually dead horse rides when 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.540
 left life energy perfect 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.180
 is used up again a raid 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.260
 Shine the black link there 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.470
 actually in the game 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.220
 this is not a secret, but it is also there 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.200
 a boeing with the same shape alone 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.780
 a sparse explained procedure 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.880
 how to shadow this or black 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.240
 Bean keeps you noticed that here 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.070
 Some things have to be invented exactly 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.380
 everything is taken here just to the 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.770
 hair pulled and such 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:24.050
 epona does not exist in any zelda game 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:31.020
 So this myth is definitely wrong 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:32.580
 and the third myth triforce fusion 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.950
 many rumors at legend of zelda 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.780
 ocarina of time around the symbol of the carrier 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.710
 Zelda series the happy relic 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.300
 Triforce is really incredible 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.640
 many theories and myths about this 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.950
 Relic as you would expect 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.180
 to get it in the game 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.040
 after all, it is about 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.860
 a basic elementary objects 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.720
 story of the game to be soldered 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.210
 have contributed numerous photos and 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.230
 videos which all fakes so 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.310
 are wrong 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.500
 In addition, the creator of the series made 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.210
 shigeru miyamoto in an interview the 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.070
 statement that the fans of ocarina of 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.320
 time is not an important detail in the game 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.580
 discovered 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.800
 what he means exactly is until today 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.970
 not clarified 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.190
 Maybe he just wanted the players 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.780
 bind longer to the game or the 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.910
 fascination for this game longer 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.230
 maintain 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.970
 nevertheless there are many on the internet 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.860
 instructions to receive the tri 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.860
 force should ensure and continue 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.360
 be believed and spread 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.840
 so far, however, no proven 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.010
 method which leads to the triforce and 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.689
 this will probably be synonymous movies 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.960
 stay 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:43.870
 yes these were the three interesting ones 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.060
 legend of zelda with times so I what 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.800
 really interesting that is with 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.310
 the research that the islamic 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:55.990
 background music that is strange 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:59.469
 I also heard such a rumor that that 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.210
 team so that the tenno meadow choral music 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:04.240
 so worked at Islamic music there 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.050
 at nintendo she has been behind 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.560
 have taken 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:12.250
 kinda weird or and with that 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.990
 Strauss so I have such a casual 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.919
 mirror plays and this dress 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:21.659
 princess yes and almost in every legend of 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:23.949
 Zelda game comes this sign 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:26.590
 probably you have to somehow im 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.569
 gotten but until today was 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.240
 not clear how I think so 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:33.819
 quite interesting 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.680
 yes that was the 24 episode played if 

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:36.580
 you have more minutes for me seems 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.680
 me in the comments 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.710
 I would do my best to help you 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.990
 then put it out if it is you 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.909
 Please subscribe commented me

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:51.430
 and put her you will not regret it 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:54.060
 yes, in this sense be shot and we 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:59.650
 see us at the 25 episode played 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:01.340
 both 25 25 follow people will be right 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.030
 creepy 

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.030
 it was good
