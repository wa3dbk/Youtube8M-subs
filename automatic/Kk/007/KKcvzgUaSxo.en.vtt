rosetta is going to provide us with an

rosetta is going to provide us with an
unprecedented<00:01:22.170> characterization<00:01:23.170> of<00:01:23.290> a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
unprecedented characterization of a

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.550 
unprecedented characterization of a
comet<00:01:23.800> that<00:01:24.190> provides<00:01:24.610> us<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.910> window<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:26.470> the

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
comet that provides us a window to the

early phases of the solar system I like

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.170 
early phases of the solar system I like
to<00:01:32.710> think<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.100> is<00:01:33.220> we're<00:01:33.880> essentially

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
to think of it is we're essentially

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.870 
to think of it is we're essentially
doing<00:01:34.590> archeology<00:01:35.590> of<00:01:35.800> our<00:01:36.280> own<00:01:36.430> solar<00:01:36.790> system

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
doing archeology of our own solar system

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.470 
doing archeology of our own solar system
it<00:01:37.570> may<00:01:37.870> tell<00:01:38.080> us<00:01:38.110> where<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.970> origin<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:40.150> the

it may tell us where the origin of the

it may tell us where the origin of the
water<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:41.290> we<00:01:41.410> have<00:01:41.440> on<00:01:41.650> earth<00:01:41.860> came<00:01:42.280> from

elsewhere<00:01:54.690> we<00:01:55.690> wouldn't<00:01:55.990> be<00:01:56.080> going<00:01:56.260> there<00:01:56.620> if

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
elsewhere we wouldn't be going there if

elsewhere we wouldn't be going there if
we<00:01:57.190> already<00:01:57.370> knew<00:01:57.729> what<00:01:57.970> was<00:01:58.090> there<00:01:58.330> one<00:01:58.840> of

we already knew what was there one of

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.680 
we already knew what was there one of
the<00:01:59.020> reasons<00:01:59.440> we<00:01:59.890> do<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.340> is<00:02:00.610> we<00:02:01.210> hope<00:02:01.450> for

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
the reasons we do this is we hope for

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.870 
the reasons we do this is we hope for
surprises<00:02:02.260> scientifically<00:02:03.250> that's<00:02:03.490> why<00:02:03.700> we

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
surprises scientifically that's why we

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.670 
surprises scientifically that's why we
do<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.180> that's<00:02:04.420> why<00:02:04.540> we<00:02:04.750> do<00:02:04.930> Rosetta<00:02:05.440> is

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
do this that's why we do Rosetta is

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.130 
do this that's why we do Rosetta is
difficult<00:02:06.310> it's<00:02:06.790> gonna<00:02:07.060> give<00:02:07.360> us<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:07.900> much

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
difficult it's gonna give us so much

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.889 
difficult it's gonna give us so much
information<00:02:08.440> so<00:02:08.830> much<00:02:09.190> science<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:10.660> we're

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
information so much science so we're
