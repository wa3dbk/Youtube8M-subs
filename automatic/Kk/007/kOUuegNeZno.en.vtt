00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.520
 very good everyone here we are in the 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.350
 game that 15 could not a game free 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.510
 to play totally free you can 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.100
 download all of you and this time in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.800
 a game that we are called guardian 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.270
 of the war game of the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.680
 good for now all the planes that I have 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.590
 seen are from World War II 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.500
 they are rather old but I do not know if 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.200
 they will have included newer planes 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.210
 is to say that this game played three 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.130
 Sometimes it's too little to talk 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.600
 much but I've played has me 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.350
 liked enough nothing to be 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.860
 totally free like shelves 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.380
 and it's a game in which 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.570
 the objective is to fight against the enemy 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.400
 but apart from that there are also units 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.870
 of earth that controls the machine and 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.090
 just we have to do is because 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.869
 Cooperate with friends to 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.810
 to win it and the truth is very good 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.119
 I advise you that if you molanes all the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.560
 airplane games and so on, you can 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.640
 download and see studies like 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.170
 same 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.790
 and nothing more 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.020
 what I liked the most about the game 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.180
 graphic aspect the truth that is 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.250
 pretty real 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.410
 as to 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.480
 Game possibilities missions and 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.880
 others does not contribute much either 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.820
 giving but we are going but fine for back 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.659
 I do not know I do not know very well what I do 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.659
 the only one that 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.970
 more or less averages 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.460
 the only thing that said that the game is missing 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.100
 I have seen the lack despite 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.009
 that I have played very very little is a little 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.180
 more than possibilities of missions and others 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.190
 but it's pretty good enough 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.709
 well and as I say the graphic project 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.959
 is very good right now and a 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.300
 sensitivity of the host I do not know why 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.360
 I have so much and I can not even handle the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.200
 airplane almost nothing 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.480
 the more I take out the plane 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.599
 but well, I hope you liked the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.599
 game 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.140
 I will bring you more as he says in the 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.160
 previous more games of this type nothing 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.720
 using everyone 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.720
 see you next goodbye
