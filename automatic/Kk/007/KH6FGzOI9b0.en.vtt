00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hi to all without ending up in january 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:13.230
 with a new video a minute 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:14.790
 a trick we left often we have 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.800
 badly to put himself durably he correctly 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.180
 especially there and without overflowing to find 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.320
 a solution then clearly I do 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.539
 I did not invent makeup artists 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.980
 professionals do it often and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.380
 her ideas she does to make up 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.720
 bottom lashes without swerve of this is 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.400
 just perfect and it really works to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.679
 all the shots so you just 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.050
 to have theirs is it you use 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.010
 currently and a small brush so 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.379
 no matter it just needs to be 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.149
 also with hairs at his ends they 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.410
 be bevelled or not afterwards if there is 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.590
 not important but here it is 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.300
 really the trick that goes is great for 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.010
 make up the esteem esteem biba 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 how does it work for example i love su 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.030
 of all faced who is right who is 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.489
 perfect what he dies is good 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.160
 eyelashes he also cancels them except 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.870
 that brush and is very cluttered in 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.190
 made of products when you camp you 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.199
 go out and it's true that for 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.090
 make up if you go beyond practice 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.850
 at all so suddenly 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.290
 the ideal is just to discover your 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.580
 story to make up your eyelashes 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.590
 high point that you have opened your 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.320
 life if you take it with your 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.330
 brush so here it is enough to put 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.780
 a little bit everywhere on the tip and 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.000
 after with a colored water mirror the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.130
 bottom eyelashes and it's just awesome because 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.799
 that it allows you to mom in 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.570
 apply it slightly already that that you 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.439
 make a lot more makeup 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.439
 work 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.250
 and it's just perfect to fill even 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.810
 the small islands that are on the edge and 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.520
 this way there suddenly you do not put 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.290
 absolutely not next 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.000
 and you 're not going to have to do a 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:52.440
 catching cotton rod and 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.440
 cleanser it's just perfect 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.780
 once you've made a first 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.240
 layer 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.340
 you can let dry pass to 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.070
 the other she would come to you then in 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.810
 may one tell you a layer when 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.140
 it will be pushed to have six 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.119
 most not so well am really 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.910
 I use 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.709
 when I lose a makeup which by 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.390
 in fact it's really quite simple but 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.450
 it's just the ideal when you want 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.620
 have a more sophisticated makeup 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.090
 clear and not want to make 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.690
 editing is enough for him that you have the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.340
 make up eyes 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.870
 it's true that when we use a 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.730
 cotton swab we often tend to 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.739
 remove either the base on the dark circles 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.500
 so that's it if you want a makeup 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.780
 nor mickaÃ«l it's really the trick to this 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.430
 Service maybe you'll put 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.080
 three more minutes but being 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.550
 this is often canton 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.230
 does retouching we also lose a 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.030
 little more than the little trick you 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.920
 will please tell me if you 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.970
 knew or if you will use I 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.890
 think it can be nice 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.810
 in the meantime and we make big kisses 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.810
 I'll see you soon hi me
