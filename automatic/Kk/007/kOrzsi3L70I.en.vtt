00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.329
 they sent me this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.800
 like avermedia on the side we have a very 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.390
 interesting possibilities is written here 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.000
 of this card 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.260
 wall requirements well, it’s also written here 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.740
 so just specially 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.990
 I took off the film that I found on top 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.220
 so I will put it right now like this 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.220
 box so you could be seen taking 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.520
 cover and let's 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:06.479
 I'll put someone over here 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.810
 us lies the capture card like the world 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:16.470
 the party was let's get shot in 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.300
 the film can be broken so here we are and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.220
 bit card here it says avermedia live 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.150
 gamer portable is written again 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.820
 Now I fisher crafting the century see here 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.840
 this button by clicking on it has no sounds 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.490
 identical to the click we still what's interesting 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.380
 if you click once started 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.120
 record click twice record 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.460
 pauses not until the end on 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.549
 fresh by color on continue lowered 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.860
 here press again headquarters end for 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.310
 just bother to stop recording and here we are 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.830
 there is an input hdmi audio input 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.890
 they are here even two inches, as I understand it 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.930
 as a sticker but oh well, it doesn’t bother much 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.090
 so back we have nothing interesting weighs 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.250
 Incidentally, this is a capture card 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.229
 we learn Alan pretty easy not knowing 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.689
 I can compare it in my studies 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.090
 honest steelseries xai 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.080
 all this at times less than this here 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.920
 gizmo to 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.480
 well let's remove this thing aside 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.340
 I wonder I think I will make a video 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.300
 tell you about tell your opinion about 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.710
 what is she to 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.490
 I also used us here 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.580
 is now inconvenient to get 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.850
 there is a license x for someone who is not 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.010
 this allows you to stream video to 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.660
 youtube and not to twitch and yutyube and 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.990
 given for three months completely 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.270
 free from avermedia that is us 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.530
 attached is also pretty interesting 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.860
 and I think it's convenient, so let's remove too 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.390
 throw the side here so take this 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.720
 give box will get now 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:57.330
 Often she not bad so sits a box here 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:00.780
 it is well packed it is reliable to you 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.670
 I will say this right here put on it all 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:11.190
 set aside so that we have all the Dubna visible 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:13.950
 so down below we have some critic critic 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.010
 Gamer zones this me just advertising 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.160
 site such that there drive 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.680
 okay some sort of this instruction 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.140
 on application by using live gamer 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.670
 portable that is it pretty 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.300
 a big 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.080
 that is, by buying this device you 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.610
 just do not get confused and understand how it is 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.069
 use the fact that well it is impossible 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.870
 There is such an instruction that you are takasi 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.830
 can only read if so well and then 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.540
 there are video guides 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.930
 so sorry for this let's now 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.480
 open this box so here we have 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.300
 there is a wire 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.530
 what kind of wires I will tell you now 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.500
 in this attack for consoles 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.739
 it doesn't bother me because i 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.799
 I connect especially I understand but this is a cable. 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:10.290

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:15.420
 let's go here and this we have some on 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:20.459
 mini yusb cable so you can see here such 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:24.840
 like that apologize for the hands in the outside well 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:28.290

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.850

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.470

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.169
 true to connect but by the way here 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.780
 hdmi cable is well 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.030

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.970
 This is how to insert how to shoot 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.940
