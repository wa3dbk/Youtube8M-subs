for<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.870> change<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:47.489> only<00:02:47.670> thing<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:47.910> can

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
for the change the only thing I can

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.300 
for the change the only thing I can
think<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.450> if<00:02:48.660> they<00:02:48.840> do<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.350> fact<00:02:49.380> include

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
think of is if they do in fact include

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.370 
think of is if they do in fact include
another<00:02:50.670> elimination<00:02:51.300> match<00:02:51.840> which<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.200> don't

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
another elimination match which I don't

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.540 
another elimination match which I don't
think<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.650> they're<00:02:52.769> necessarily<00:02:53.250> going<00:02:53.489> to

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
think that they're necessarily going to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.160 
think that they're necessarily going to
know<00:02:53.700> there's<00:02:54.180> also<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.600> rumor<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.930> they

so I'll give me credit for that that
that's<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:10.170> whole<00:04:10.350> lot<00:04:10.470> better<00:04:10.500> than<00:04:10.709> what<00:04:10.920> they

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
that's a whole lot better than what they

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.310 
that's a whole lot better than what they
could<00:04:11.250> have<00:04:11.280> done<00:04:11.420> but<00:04:12.420> at<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.870> same<00:04:13.049> time

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
it's a shame that they couldn't kind of

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.310 
it's a shame that they couldn't kind of
do<00:04:15.269> something<00:04:15.600> else<00:04:15.750> it's<00:04:15.989> another<00:04:16.200> thing

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
