off that exposes our sa and as B fuse
panel<00:00:44.610> technically<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.809> box<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.379> there

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
panel technically is one box but there

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.340 
panel technically is one box but there
is<00:00:46.620> few<00:00:47.010> two<00:00:47.190> fuse<00:00:47.520> panels<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:48.840> just

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
is few two fuse panels in that now just

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.139 
is few two fuse panels in that now just
like<00:00:49.469> testing<00:00:49.800> any<00:00:49.920> other<00:00:50.129> fuse<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
like testing any other fuse I like to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.869 
like testing any other fuse I like to
use<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> power<00:00:51.660> probe<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.469> fast<00:00:52.860> its<00:00:53.399> audio

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
use a power probe it's fast its audio

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.299 
use a power probe it's fast its audio
and<00:00:54.120> video<00:00:54.629> confirmation<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.559> good<00:00:55.800> or<00:00:56.010> bad

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and video confirmation of a good or bad

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.549 
and video confirmation of a good or bad
fuse<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:57.539> normally<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.020> would<00:00:58.140> want<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> have

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
fuse now normally you would want to have

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
fuse now normally you would want to have
your<00:00:58.710> car<00:00:58.920> running<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.489> if<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.699> had<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> car

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
your car running but if I had the car

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.279 
your car running but if I had the car
running<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.480> guys<00:01:00.629> probably<00:01:00.870> wouldn't<00:01:01.079> be

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
running you guys probably wouldn't be

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.569 
running you guys probably wouldn't be
able<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.500> hear<00:01:01.710> me<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:01.920> I'm<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.070> gonna<00:01:02.219> buzz

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
able to hear me so I'm just gonna buzz

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.700 
able to hear me so I'm just gonna buzz
these<00:01:02.789> fuses<00:01:03.359> really<00:01:03.780> quick<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> car

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
these fuses really quick with the car

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.070 
these fuses really quick with the car
off<00:01:04.979> again<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.970> properly<00:01:06.330> test<00:01:06.600> them<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.869> want

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
off again to properly test them you want

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.370 
off again to properly test them you want
to<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> car<00:01:07.680> running<00:01:08.510> that's<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:10.320> is

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
to have the car running that's this is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.539 
to have the car running that's this is
the<00:01:10.619> sound<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.310> good<00:01:11.610> power<00:01:12.330> source<00:01:12.780> power

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
as a ground testing relays isn't so

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.929 
as a ground testing relays isn't so
simple<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.070> we'll<00:01:41.159> cover<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.670> another

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
simple and we'll cover that in another

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.630 
simple and we'll cover that in another
video<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:42.840> let's<00:01:43.590> move<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.130> passenger

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640

we<00:01:52.320> need<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.680> remove<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.540> in<00:01:54.540> order<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.930> remove

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
we need to remove it in order to remove

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.749 
we need to remove it in order to remove
it<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.500> need<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.710> open<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.369> squeeze

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
it what you need to open it and squeeze

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.630 
it what you need to open it and squeeze
the<00:01:57.060> two<00:01:57.240> tracks<00:01:57.960> together<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:59.070> much<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.520> we

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
the two tracks together as much as we

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.639 
the two tracks together as much as we
can<00:01:59.880> kind<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.840> rock<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.049> back<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.409> forth

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
can kind of rock it back and forth

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.980 
can kind of rock it back and forth
you'll<00:02:02.549> see<00:02:02.969> right<00:02:03.270> here<00:02:03.329> there's<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.810> little

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you'll see right here there's a little

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.719 
you'll see right here there's a little
tab<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.560> there's<00:02:04.680> one<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> other<00:02:05.280> side<00:02:05.579> as

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
tab and there's one on the other side as

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.730 
tab and there's one on the other side as
well<00:02:05.759> when<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.630> hits<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.049> spot<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.619> can

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
well when it hits this spot we can

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.100 
well when it hits this spot we can
actually<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.190> pull<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.700> down<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.209> out<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
actually just pull it down and out and

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.770 
actually just pull it down and out and
remove<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.039> all<00:02:11.129> together<00:02:11.340> now<00:02:12.300> as<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.660> can

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
remove it all together now as you can

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.640 
remove it all together now as you can
see<00:02:12.989> we've<00:02:13.170> gained

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
see we've gained

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.559 
see we've gained
access<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:13.980> our<00:02:14.280> fuse<00:02:14.579> panel<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.180> we're<00:02:15.480> gonna

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
access to our fuse panel and we're gonna

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.539 
access to our fuse panel and we're gonna
test<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.959> fuses<00:02:16.319> exactly<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.069> we<00:02:17.220> did<00:02:17.400> on

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
test the fuses exactly like we did on

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.500 
test the fuses exactly like we did on
the<00:02:17.640> ones<00:02:17.849> under<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.209> hood<00:02:20.150> with<00:02:21.150> our<00:02:21.299> power

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the ones under the hood with our power

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.690 
the ones under the hood with our power
probe<00:02:24.590> now<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.829> see<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.129> green<00:02:26.340> light<00:02:26.519> up

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
probe now you can see the green light up

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.059 
probe now you can see the green light up
as<00:02:26.879> well<00:02:27.120> as<00:02:27.299> hear<00:02:27.689> the<00:02:27.900> noise<00:02:28.110> as<00:02:28.470> we<00:02:28.799> test

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
as well as hear the noise as we test

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.770 
as well as hear the noise as we test
each<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.459> every<00:02:29.610> fuse<00:02:29.909> now<00:02:30.359> a<00:02:30.390> lot<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.629> you

started going through this entire car

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.000 
started going through this entire car
and<00:02:50.280> telling<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.790> what<00:02:50.970> each<00:02:51.180> fuse<00:02:51.510> was<00:02:52.010> next

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
and telling you what each fuse was next

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.160 
and telling you what each fuse was next
year<00:02:53.190> they<00:02:53.310> may<00:02:53.459> change<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:54.000> or<00:02:54.150> your<00:02:54.810> vehicle

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
year they may change it or your vehicle

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.899 
year they may change it or your vehicle
might<00:02:55.530> have<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> different<00:02:56.010> trim<00:02:56.340> package<00:02:56.730> so

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
might have a different trim package so

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.759 
might have a different trim package so
the<00:02:57.030> fuses<00:02:57.420> won't<00:02:57.629> be<00:02:57.780> applicable<00:02:58.079> to<00:02:58.349> your

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
the fuses won't be applicable to your

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.589 
the fuses won't be applicable to your
car<00:02:59.040> like<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.430> would<00:02:59.579> this<00:02:59.790> one<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.450> what<00:03:00.569> i

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
car like that would this one so what i

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.449 
car like that would this one so what i
always<00:03:00.900> recommend<00:03:01.049> even<00:03:01.829> to<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> guys<00:03:02.189> in<00:03:02.220> the

shop if you're gonna have to check one

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.539 
shop if you're gonna have to check one
fuse<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.409> break<00:03:04.829> out<00:03:04.980> something<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.489> a

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
fuse and break out something like a

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.610 
fuse and break out something like a
power<00:03:05.849> probe<00:03:06.239> just<00:03:06.959> check<00:03:07.170> them<00:03:07.319> all<00:03:07.439> you

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
power probe just check them all you

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.470 
power probe just check them all you
already<00:03:07.829> have<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.220> tool<00:03:08.430> out<00:03:08.459> you're<00:03:09.180> right

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
already have the tool out you're right

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.539 
already have the tool out you're right
there<00:03:09.720> buzz<00:03:10.260> all<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.709> fuses<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.099> make<00:03:11.400> sure

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
there buzz all the fuses and make sure

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.240 
there buzz all the fuses and make sure
everyone<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.269> good<00:03:12.510> don't<00:03:13.019> focus<00:03:13.349> on<00:03:13.620> one<00:03:13.920> fuse

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
everyone is good don't focus on one fuse

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.309 
everyone is good don't focus on one fuse
cuz<00:03:14.430> even<00:03:14.670> if<00:03:14.909> in<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.329> wiring<00:03:15.599> diagram<00:03:16.049> it

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
cuz even if in the wiring diagram it

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.939 
cuz even if in the wiring diagram it
says<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.430> know<00:03:17.549> fuse<00:03:17.879> SC<00:03:18.449> 14<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.590> for<00:03:19.829> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
wiring diagram might actually be wrong

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.670 
wiring diagram might actually be wrong
it<00:03:24.389> wouldn't<00:03:24.750> be<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.959> first<00:03:24.989> time<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.410> I've

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
it wouldn't be the first time that I've

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.289 
it wouldn't be the first time that I've
ever<00:03:25.709> seen<00:03:26.129> that<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.730> if<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:26.910> have<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.150> break

ever seen that so if you have to break
