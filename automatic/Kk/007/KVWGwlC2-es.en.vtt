00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:30.899 
before really everybody grew up in this

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.470 
before really everybody grew up in this
family<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.499> the<00:00:32.219> colors<00:00:32.579> are<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> longer

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
family and the colors are not a longer

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.689 
family and the colors are not a longer
needed<00:00:33.780> they<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.289> some<00:00:34.530> more<00:00:35.129> neutral

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
colors and so what happens is that

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.810
