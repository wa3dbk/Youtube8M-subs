my<00:00:18.060> trusty<00:00:18.690> little<00:00:20.180> limited<00:00:21.180> edition

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
my trusty little limited edition

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.009 
my trusty little limited edition
checklist<00:00:23.390> so<00:00:24.390> there's<00:00:24.570> not<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.869> many

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
checklist so there's not that many

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.220 
checklist so there's not that many
limited<00:00:25.470> editions<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.070> get<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.050> looks

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
limited editions to get and it looks

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.800 
limited editions to get and it looks
like<00:00:28.289> they're<00:00:28.560> all<00:00:28.769> common<00:00:29.340> which<00:00:30.269> makes<00:00:30.660> no

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
like they're all common which makes no

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.659 
like they're all common which makes no
sense<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.170> me<00:00:31.230> because<00:00:31.470> if<00:00:31.710> they're<00:00:32.219> limited

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
sense to me because if they're limited

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.580 
sense to me because if they're limited
edition<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.360> they're<00:00:34.350> white<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.690> mean<00:00:36.690> they

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
edition and they're white I mean they

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.930 
edition and they're white I mean they
have<00:00:37.710> little<00:00:37.890> white<00:00:38.129> bars<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.790> means

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
have little white bars that means

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.990 
have little white bars that means
there's<00:00:39.180> nothing<00:00:39.510> special<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:41.000> but
