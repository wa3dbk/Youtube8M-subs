00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.870
 and the cereals and the advantages of their 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.819
 daily consumption cereals are coming 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.799
 cultivating for centuries in all 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.690
 the corners of the planet and have always 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.670
 been the basis of feeding the 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.129
 different peoples and cultures of the world 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.470
 cereals are the seeds of 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.340
 oats grass barley wheat plants 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.350
 rye rice millet corn et cetera all 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.539
 those that preserve their bark are 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.750
 the so-called richer integrals in 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.550
 minerals vitamins and vegetable fibers 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.590
 the grain structure of cereal is 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.260
 formed by an interior rich in starch 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.570
 covered by layers rich in proteins and 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.510
 its external part saved is 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.100
 constituted by a very fibrous tissue in 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.320
 one of the ends is the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.059
 protein-rich germ iron and 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.130
 vitamins vitamin by 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.170
 when the flours are made both the 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.780
 germ like the bran are eliminated 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.760
 nowadays we can say that the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.620
 cereals are the food that allows 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.480
 many populations can survive 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.180
 in the face of the chronic famine to which 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.879
 Some countries are subject to 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.740
 nutrients bring the cereals nothing 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.340
 better than bread or pasta made with 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.039
 cereals 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.649
 balance diet provide energy and a 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.780
 minimum fat carbohydrates 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.509
 always it is located to the cereals like 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.649
 source of complex carbohydrates 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.009
 always forgetting their good contribution 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.020
 protein contain about a 75 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.689
 percent polysaccharide starch 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.729
 formed by glucose the absorption of 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.380
 Starch is slow and gradual so 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.060
 cereals provide energy to 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.149
 organism for a long period of 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.899
 time proteins cereals contain 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.579
 Between 8% to 12% of proteins gluten is 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.069
 the protein that contains the most 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.289
 the cereals the gluten can not be 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.780
 digested by certain people the 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.270
 celiac since it would cause them a serious 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.069
 intestinal damage also in the newly 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.409
 born due to the immaturity of their 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.229
 intestine should eat up to 9 months 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.060
 old gluten-free cereals fats the 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.429
 whole grains of cereals contain 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.799
 about 2 percent fat 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.289
 but oats for example contains a 7 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.049
 percent the fat of the cereals is 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.759
 composed of poly fatty acids 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:13.280
 monounsaturated these fatty acids 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.810
 they are very beneficial to maintain 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.750
 in good condition our system 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.880
 cardiovascular vitamins vitamins 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.970
 of the b complex like vitamin b1 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.250
 vitamin b2 and vitamin b12 along with the 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.200
 folic acid are the most abundant in 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.910
 the cereals themselves are 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.440
 indispensable for the right 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.100
 development and operation of the system 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.930
 nervous otherwise the vitamin and it 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.239
 found in high doses in the germ of 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.130
 cereal grains when cereals 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.550
 are subjected to the process of refinement 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.200
 The loss of these vitamins is notorious 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.780
 minerals cereals provide us 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.209
 mainly phosphorus zinc silicon 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.820
 iron the contribution in calcium and sodium is 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.920
 very reduced fiber the fiber of the 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.870
 cereals is mainly cellulose 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.180
 which is in the outer layer of 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.430
 the grains it is worth clarifying that the cereals 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.500
 integrals are the ones who contribute the most 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.540
 amount of fiber since when they are 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.940
 refined lose most of the 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.620
 same cereal every day 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.450
 pasta made with cereals 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.269
 cereals are the basis of many foods 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.910
 that we eat on a daily basis such is the case 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.799
 white bread or wholemeal pasta 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.910
 cereal flakes flours and semolina 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.830
 as 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.410
 and all the pastry mixes and the 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.480
 pastries in the mentioned foods 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.790
 there is a big difference 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.650
 caloric and the same is given by the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.690
 amount of fat with which the pastry is 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.940
 elaborated the final product of the 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.290
 kneaded if the pastry 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.270
 unfortunately it contains a lot of fat and 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.800
 this fat is of animal origin so 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.230
 what the cholesterol content of 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.910
 these foods is very high to 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.250
 consume these products is very 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.770
 important to read the labels and it should be 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.660
 avoid consuming them daily 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.850
 It is also important to note that 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.680
 those labels that say elaborate 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.690
 with coconut or palm oil are 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.640
 harmful to health since a 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.380
 despite being vegetable oils are 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.690
 very saturated fats that increase the 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.160
 blood cholesterol fats 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.920
 partially or totally vegetable 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.930
 hydrogenated are even more harmful since 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.110
 besides being hypercholesterolemia before 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.120
 are carcinogenic with this we want to leave 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.250
 very clear that when choosing some 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.109
 product made with cereals nothing 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.209
 better than bread or pasta that does not 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.220
 they contribute practically no fat to 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.080
 organism balance the daily diet and 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.080
 they give us a lot of energy
