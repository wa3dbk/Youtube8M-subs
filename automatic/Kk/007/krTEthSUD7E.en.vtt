 five 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.610

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.140
 15 to fight on the 2100 meters of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.970
 the big track 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.109
 damien it's true that it's a pond 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.609
 not necessarily very beautiful 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.140
 quinté events 5.5 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.640
 we can say we really have each other 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.989
 quality me and not a lot of starters 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.430
 you saw the color of my thigh and 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.600
 black is black there is no hope but 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.149
 there we can still have I think 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.290
 in this event we have good bases 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.920
 foreign players but we know 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.870
 perfectly 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.370
 especially that horses that I placed 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.750
 at the top of the pronoun of the right number 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.879
 behind the autostart what gives us 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.280
 a lot of hope for probably 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 hit the 5-5 good touch 5 5 and well 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.969
 other ways it takes now 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.370
 give your selection to hit the 3 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.500
 chelsea jars on 6 scarlets turgot on 8 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.050
 vincennes le 2 very nice marceau the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.420
 this princess claw the 14th 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.390
 huszti 9 duvivier as sissi morin and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.860
 the 5th of september favorite no3 chelsea 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.360
 beaucourt last time it's true 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.900
 that he was unlucky is to be near 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.060
 from luxembourg 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.580
 we already expected we were already in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.900
 live on her this mom this same 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.670
 place for the price of luxembourg 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.990
 he had shot number 10 behind 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.460
 the autostart we knew it was going to be 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.930
 complicated yet they were streets 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.490
 rookie also on arrival but 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.390
 found himself too far at the beginning of the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.130
 straight line he regained a ground 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.890
 it was too late 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.930
 hope for a better ranking well gogh 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.030
 will not be his sulky my father board at 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.909
 franck nivard who will be behind him 2 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.229
 on 2 on the course and he has already won 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.640
 on the 2100 meters of the big track 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.290
 since he won the Lille prize 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.000
 he was beating that day four 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.770
 competitors who will find here we have 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.509
 everything for you there is no reason 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.549
 they are not in the five bases 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.759
 integrating integral basis in addition it's a 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.860
 horse on wanted to oppose 2.6 scarlett 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.110
 turgot it's our mini arnaud pitches 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.719
 lecomte and was precisely the meeting 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.240
 of Eric Raffin who will be the pilot of 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.439
 scarlett 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.390
 eric raffin you with sky drivers 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.280
 early in the saturday of saturday the price of 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.670
 munich the mare returns to the 2100 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.069
 meters 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.450
 does that worry you no that's it in 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.470
 full wind on what yannick tells me that 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.849
 wicked inherited a good number 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.410
 now the direction opposition is this 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.440
 that it will be this one a lot that had 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.560
 reduced also indexed in Europe on 3 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.379
 november hide that I say it in the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.239
 cat and have even made the podium even 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:34.280
 delete these events is this what 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.280
 starting at 10 vincennes so 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.439
 good eric raffin made the paper with 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.659
 you this very confident chango notebook 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.159
 and it will have to beat chelsea a lot and 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.719
 we can even add that she ran a 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.250
 time on the course she had won 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.670
 so no worries for the 2100 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.930
 meters 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.430
 another thing also is that she 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.959
 had the opportunity to run the prize 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.540
 jules roucayrol which is the same day 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.709
 but at cagnes-sur-mer and finally they 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.000
 yannick alain briand he ran to 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.829
 vincennes because, moreover, he's washing 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.090
 always said she transcend herself to 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.989
 vincennes so much to go on the 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.639
 track where she does her best 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.900
 results in the drill that made it 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.939
 something amazing breastfed at 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.379
 gallop start and she had come back from 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.639
 devil vauvert take second place 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.400
 it was an attempt that day 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.049
 quite exceptional she too is a 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.099
 pascal base galeote never a very good 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.629
 number behind the autostart 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.409
 we have two good bases now she 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.659
 in addition she likes to go in front 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.769
 exactly she can use all 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.689
 tactics one could possibly 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.489
 pass this one bocco if he 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.409
 must I actually think we were worth 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.389
 head and rope with her in third 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:31.079
 position to place the 8 vincennes 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:33.299
 mare who has achieved a winter for the 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.560
 no moment but in any case it changes 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.209
 a little bit at the hardware 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.919
 especially then gross performance 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.840
 are not very good at first I'm friend 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.220
 fifth game the third lifts 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.449
 you were with me during the weekend 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.250
 from the america price we heard some 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.750
 cloakroom sounds on the day of 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.579
 luxembourg it is michel houel who him 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.019
 was associated with the paper she had 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.979
 not very lucky it's also 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.180
 for this reason that during the course 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.189
 we have against a little bit every 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.599
 sides today we see what we see 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.889
 barefooted four feet jean michel 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.609
 bazire good numbers early star is not 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.620
 exceptional 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.000
 it may be the little catch but it puts 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.379
 awake when we go jean michel bazire 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.599
 free of four feet for fabrice 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.280
 souloy the latest performances are 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.750
 not extraordinary it's true but 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.000
 vincennes at the same time been judged worthy 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.699
 to participate in the tenors of good we have 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.199
 probably a big respect for her 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.639
 and this is the funny underdog and 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.019
 why not try to learn it in 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.519
 bass to try to spice up a little 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.959
 the reports otherwise put her in a field 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.579
 reduced harvest with deferré of the four 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.710
 feet me well built as paul 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.940
 myrtle vaulting bowels second of the 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.860
 price of america on this line there 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.960
 suggests that she really has a 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.190
 good luck and it was over 2150 meters 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.080
 in addition so that means that the speed 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.030
 is his thing in fourth 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.190
 you place the 2 0 nice marceau him 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.659
 it's the class horse 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.110
 he could also have run the price jules 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.940
 Roucayrol 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.440
 good there suddenly he finds himself there his 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.000
 coach actually hopes the right choice 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.349
 actually it's been twice 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.129
 besides that his coach in a row 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.389
 he has choices to make since 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.339
 dana once it was the deaf between the 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.509
 tenor of baune and belgium price 

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:51.009
 coach had finally taken 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.199
 belgium it was necessarily the right choice 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.669
 since he finished 3rd and suddenly he 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.639
 could not qualify for the 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.889
 nice race here he decided to take the 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.419
 beautiful munich prices by name the 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.649
 tosar number is not bad anyway 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.909
 give him reason for the moment draw 

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:05.949
 by lot since it's number two 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.360
 of al autostar the limes argues in his 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.769
 favor especially the last of a prize 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.909
 of belgium 2100 meters it should 

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:12.159
 also not disturb him too much 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.719
 it's a good chance it can be 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.789
 barred by the chelsea jars and and 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.740
 scarlett urgo but he too should 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.849
 to be on arrival I have the impression 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.429
 with bonds actually in the race 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.099
 mans land when we leave confident and 

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:25.959
 finally this princess is also fel 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.490
 second to all souloy fabrice and 

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:28.629
 realizes a very good yves herman and then 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.219
 that she comes crowned by a 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.809
 victory in the price of brest it was 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.069
 a great performance we did not expect 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.580
 for it to come to win albat and 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.919
 villeroy 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.529
 but the king is finished second in the price 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.189
 baune tenor the performances are 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.419
 very good 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.490
 there is still a problem with the 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.899
 course ran four times to the 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.889
 finish only once had it in 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:47.169
 more it was not a performance 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.339
 exceptional quality that 5th is the 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.059
 little that's why I mix them 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.559
 5th 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.659
 if we take his last performance 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:55.209
 raw that read hall is a first 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:57.039
 luck if we start to bring in the 

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:58.240
 data like including the 2100 meters 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.889
 we went down a little bit in a 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.169
 ranking and we learn more dishes in 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.459
 down this forgiveness we put it in a field 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.199
 reduced whatever happens but we'll 

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:07.240
 maybe refrain from learning it in 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.279
 chord base could listen to amiens 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.099
