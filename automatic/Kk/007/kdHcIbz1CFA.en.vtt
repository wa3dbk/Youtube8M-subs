00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
like I said it was a September 2009 and

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.910 
like I said it was a September 2009 and
I<00:04:19.120> was<00:04:19.209> really<00:04:19.630> stressed<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.350> my<00:04:20.530> hair<00:04:20.769> was

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
I was really stressed and my hair was

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.070 
I was really stressed and my hair was
shedding<00:04:21.340> out<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:22.000> what<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.390> mean<00:04:22.600> by<00:04:22.750> shedding

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
shedding out and what I mean by shedding

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.810 
shedding out and what I mean by shedding
out<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.620> was<00:04:23.770> shedding<00:04:24.100> out<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.610> point

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
out it was shedding out to the point

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.340 
out it was shedding out to the point
where<00:04:24.940> I<00:04:24.970> was<00:04:25.060> thinning<00:04:25.570> at<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.840> same<00:04:26.050> time

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
where I was thinning at the same time

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.650 
where I was thinning at the same time
because<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.830> was<00:04:26.920> excessive<00:04:27.550> shedding<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.570> it

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
because it was excessive shedding and it

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.600 
because it was excessive shedding and it
was<00:04:28.780> due<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.110> stress<00:04:29.500> um<00:04:31.800> yeah<00:04:32.800> so<00:04:33.280> that's<00:04:33.460> when

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
was due to stress um yeah so that's when

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.790 
was due to stress um yeah so that's when
I<00:04:33.700> started<00:04:34.000> my<00:04:34.120> hair<00:04:34.330> journey<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.470> reason

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
I started my hair journey and the reason

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.200 
I started my hair journey and the reason
why<00:04:35.980> I<00:04:36.010> started<00:04:36.400> because<00:04:36.790> my<00:04:36.940> hair<00:04:37.180> was

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
why I started because my hair was

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.780 
why I started because my hair was
thinning<00:04:37.600> out<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.200> I<00:04:38.800> was<00:04:39.010> searching<00:04:39.220> YouTube
