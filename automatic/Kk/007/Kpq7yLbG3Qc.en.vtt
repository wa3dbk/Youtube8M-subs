00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
sting 30 you must be feeling amazing was

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.820 
sting 30 you must be feeling amazing was
it<00:00:35.260> as<00:00:35.350> easy<00:00:35.440> as<00:00:35.650> it<00:00:35.739> looked<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:38.170> it's<00:00:38.590> never

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
it as easy as it looked it's it's never

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.970 
it as easy as it looked it's it's never
easy<00:00:39.720> just<00:00:40.720> like<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.019> last<00:00:41.140> times<00:00:41.440> I<00:00:41.589> played

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
easy just like the last times I played

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.500 
easy just like the last times I played
against<00:00:42.250> sting<00:00:42.580> and<00:00:42.760> you<00:00:43.059> know<00:00:43.180> he's<00:00:43.330> not<00:00:43.450> a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
against sting and you know he's not a

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.229 
against sting and you know he's not a
player<00:00:43.660> you<00:00:43.870> can<00:00:43.989> take<00:00:44.110> lightly<00:00:45.239> fortunately

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
player you can take lightly fortunately

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.680 
player you can take lightly fortunately
he<00:00:46.629> was<00:00:46.809> being<00:00:47.079> aggressive<00:00:47.500> and<00:00:48.570> tended<00:00:49.570> to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
he was being aggressive and tended to

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.840 
he was being aggressive and tended to
use<00:00:49.809> bio<00:00:50.050> play<00:00:50.320> so<00:00:51.160> that<00:00:51.309> was<00:00:51.430> really<00:00:51.460> good<00:00:51.730> for

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
use bio play so that was really good for

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.220 
use bio play so that was really good for
me<00:00:51.969> I<00:00:52.000> could<00:00:52.180> easily<00:00:52.270> see<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.750> pushes<00:00:53.110> in

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
me I could easily see the pushes in

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.680 
me I could easily see the pushes in
advance<00:00:53.530> and<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:53.770> kept<00:00:54.010> sending<00:00:54.280> in<00:00:54.489> links<00:00:54.760> up

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
advance and I kept sending in links up

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.770 
advance and I kept sending in links up
front<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.110> see<00:00:56.260> if<00:00:56.320> he<00:00:56.410> was<00:00:56.559> pushing<00:00:56.739> out<00:00:56.920> and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
front to see if he was pushing out and

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.229 
front to see if he was pushing out and
just<00:00:58.780> by<00:00:59.050> just<00:00:59.739> by<00:00:59.860> thinking<00:01:00.520> of<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.879> timing

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
just by just by thinking of the timing

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.639 
just by just by thinking of the timing
so<00:01:01.270> I<00:01:01.360> was<00:01:01.480> able<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.750> stop<00:01:01.989> drowning<00:01:02.199> in<00:01:02.469> time

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
so I was able to stop drowning in time

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.499 
so I was able to stop drowning in time
and<00:01:02.890> make<00:01:03.219> links<00:01:03.520> in<00:01:03.609> time<00:01:03.760> just<00:01:04.210> based<00:01:04.420> on

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
and make links in time just based on

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.480 
and make links in time just based on
experience<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.350> from<00:01:05.649> the<00:01:05.860> scouting<00:01:06.220> i<00:01:06.340> also

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
experience and from the scouting i also

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.460 
experience and from the scouting i also
got<00:01:06.700> in<00:01:06.850> addition<00:01:07.180> I<00:01:07.330> knew<00:01:07.869> exactly<00:01:07.990> when<00:01:08.440> to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
got in addition I knew exactly when to

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.040 
got in addition I knew exactly when to
start<00:01:08.950> making<00:01:09.160> links<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:10.600> prepare<00:01:10.780> my

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
start making links and to prepare my

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.970 
start making links and to prepare my
defenses<00:01:11.500> so

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.100 

it<00:01:14.460> wasn't<00:01:14.820> exactly<00:01:14.940> easy<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.750> almost

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it wasn't exactly easy I almost

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.020 
it wasn't exactly easy I almost
overextended<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.010> few<00:01:17.160> times<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.580> made<00:01:17.790> some

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
overextended a few times and made some

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.120 
overextended a few times and made some
quite<00:01:18.630> bad<00:01:18.870> control<00:01:19.290> mistakes<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
quite bad control mistakes like in the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.340 
quite bad control mistakes like in the
last<00:01:20.460> game<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.640> whirlwind<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.450> lost<00:01:21.720> quite<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
last game on whirlwind I lost quite a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.050 
last game on whirlwind I lost quite a
lot<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.770> Units<00:01:23.040> sometimes<00:01:23.400> where<00:01:23.760> I<00:01:23.790> shouldn't

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
lot of Units sometimes where I shouldn't

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.790 
lot of Units sometimes where I shouldn't
touch

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
touch

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.220 
touch
so<00:01:26.430> yeah<00:01:26.550> it<00:01:26.640> wasn't<00:01:26.790> easy<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.600> felt<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:27.990> I

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
so yeah it wasn't easy but I felt like I

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.760 
so yeah it wasn't easy but I felt like I
was<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.380> control<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.980> most<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.030> games<00:01:30.770> now

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
was in control of most of the games now

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.010 
was in control of most of the games now
we're<00:01:32.730> using<00:01:32.970> rather<00:01:33.210> control<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> games

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
we're using rather control of the games

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.630 
we're using rather control of the games
you<00:01:34.140> pretty<00:01:34.440> much<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.680> map<00:01:34.890> control<00:01:35.250> over

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
you pretty much have map control over

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.720 
you pretty much have map control over
with<00:01:35.880> your<00:01:36.030> use<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.450> links<00:01:37.460> do<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.550> think

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
with your use of the links do you think

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.580 
with your use of the links do you think
this<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.910> like<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.570> new<00:01:39.750> way<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> play<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
this is like the new way to play for you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.860 
this is like the new way to play for you
or<00:01:41.010> is<00:01:41.160> this<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:42.510> Zerg<00:01:42.750> play<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.110> general

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.410 

I<00:01:45.930> prefer<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.980> like<00:01:47.160> before<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.090> wings<00:01:48.270> of

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
I prefer it like before in wings of

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
I prefer it like before in wings of
liberty<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.900> would<00:01:49.080> always<00:01:49.350> open<00:01:49.620> up<00:01:49.710> with

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
liberty I would always open up with

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.890 
liberty I would always open up with
roaches<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:52.580> sting<00:01:53.580> didn't<00:01:54.210> opt<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.780> lots

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
roaches and sting didn't opt in for lots

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.350 
roaches and sting didn't opt in for lots
of<00:01:55.020> aliens<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:56.190> links<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:56.970> bindings<00:01:57.240> are

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
of aliens so links and bindings are

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.760 
of aliens so links and bindings are
really<00:01:57.480> good<00:01:57.780> against<00:01:58.140> players<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.680> don't

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
really good against players that don't

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.290 
really good against players that don't
Italians<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.580> hell<00:01:59.820> bats<00:02:00.030> very<00:02:00.270> much<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:02.300> it

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
Italians or hell bats very much so it

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
far worse for the player that actually

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.260 
far worse for the player that actually
has<00:03:50.440> technical<00:03:50.890> problems<00:03:51.280> i<00:03:51.370> can<00:03:51.550> imagine<00:03:51.880> if
