00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.340
 ah ah 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.740
 we are on horseback would kill her 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.299
 that arthur hello fund art after 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.080
 have brought the horse you are going 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:18.390
 it seems if we look so I start 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.759
 by watching the plomÃ©e horse serves 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.369
 how he puts his foot 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.630
 there i see i overload the external and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.180
 it grows more internally 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:34.470
 so I'll have to cut a little 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:36.180
 Just over inside walls cure the game 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:44.550
 foot story to see a little bit yes 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:51.750
 I'm going to give my degree of trimming in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.800
 removing a chip in pincer so there the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.360
 know that I can cut 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.360
 so far I'm having a good time 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.820
 but the study 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.400
 no no that's how we cut off 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.400
 nails 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:24.800
 it's exactly the same while 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:27.340
 respecting the bars can remove them a 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.340
 fork 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.630
 he 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.260
 I cut the parish that pushed 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:54.950
 and my little rasp shot to put 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:58.090
 all purchases - red made 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.090
 conclusions it's not blood 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.940
 it's my call you let me 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.810
 and ends with the parietal which 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.520
 is to recall the parish for 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.520
 give a more armed shape the options 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:55.610
 if ever you are too small patapon 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:57.409
 narcissus does not cost it can 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.180
 harm the joints tendons 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:04.249
 and went back and six cuts too 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.960
 but it's like when we get 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:09.289
 find too much nails it hurts 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.029
 when it makes them limp no it's 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:14.409
 really, otherwise you must not go too much 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.409
 far but during the 7 enthroned 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.129
 of apprehension a little bit divided 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:28.330
 yeah I left a little bit 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:28.330
 too nice dead end the opposite thank you
