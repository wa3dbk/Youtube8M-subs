all the high frequency stuff that's

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.710 
all the high frequency stuff that's
great<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.460> speaking<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:57.030> carbon<00:01:57.330> fiber<00:01:57.540> of

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
great and speaking of carbon fiber of

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.810 
great and speaking of carbon fiber of
course<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.560> we're<00:01:58.710> craigs<00:01:59.040> built<00:01:59.400> his<00:01:59.580> name

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
course so we're craigs built his name

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.150 
course so we're craigs built his name
and<00:02:00.000> we're<00:02:00.120> looking<00:02:00.240> over<00:02:01.080> here<00:02:01.380> at<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.620> new

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
and we're looking over here at a new

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.950 
and we're looking over here at a new
carbon<00:02:02.550> fiber<00:02:02.790> tantum<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.660> it<00:02:03.750> looks<00:02:03.870> like

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
carbon fiber tantum and it looks like

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.590 
carbon fiber tantum and it looks like
its<00:02:04.200> belt<00:02:05.160> driven<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.790> little<00:02:06.300> bit<00:02:06.390> more<00:02:06.510> about

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
its belt driven a little bit more about

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.740 
its belt driven a little bit more about
this<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.500> coupler<00:02:08.070> tandem<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.790> fits

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
this this is a coupler tandem that fits

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.650 
this this is a coupler tandem that fits
in<00:02:09.869> these<00:02:10.020> two<00:02:10.200> cases<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.820> featuring<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
in these two cases and it's featuring a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.070 
in these two cases and it's featuring a
new<00:02:13.200> carbon<00:02:14.190> drive<00:02:14.400> belt<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.390> actually<00:02:15.960> got

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
new carbon drive belt so actually got

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.110 
new carbon drive belt so actually got
carbon<00:02:16.320> fiber<00:02:16.680> inside<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.490> belt<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.000> it's

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
carbon fiber inside the belt so it's

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.230 
carbon fiber inside the belt so it's
incredibly<00:02:18.630> still<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.490> do<00:02:20.640> notice<00:02:20.880> these

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
incredibly still and you do notice these

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.840 
incredibly still and you do notice these
increase<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:21.990> stiffness<00:02:22.340> when<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.460> when<00:02:23.820> you

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
increase in stiffness when you when you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.930 
increase in stiffness when you when you
stomp<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:24.780> got<00:02:25.620> immediate<00:02:26.190> transfer

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
stomp on it it's got immediate transfer

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.330 
stomp on it it's got immediate transfer
of<00:02:27.060> energy<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.630> rear<00:02:27.900> wheel<00:02:28.110> better<00:02:29.040> than

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
of energy to the rear wheel better than

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.520 
of energy to the rear wheel better than
a<00:02:29.370> chain<00:02:29.670> actually<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:31.020> course<00:02:31.050> it's

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
a chain actually and of course it's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.229 
a chain actually and of course it's
clean<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.280> when<00:02:32.459> you're<00:02:32.610> undoing<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
clean so when you're undoing the

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.750 
clean so when you're undoing the
couplers<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.630> traveling<00:02:34.430> packages<00:02:35.430> into<00:02:35.550> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
couplers and traveling packages into the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.190 
couplers and traveling packages into the
cases<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.480> don't<00:02:36.510> get<00:02:36.750> your<00:02:36.840> hands<00:02:37.050> all

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
cases you don't get your hands all

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.650 
cases you don't get your hands all
greasy<00:02:37.470> yep<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.489> that's<00:02:38.670> very<00:02:38.970> convenient<00:02:39.360> is

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
greasy yep so that's very convenient is

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.090 
greasy yep so that's very convenient is
there<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> weight<00:02:40.170> difference<00:02:40.530> between<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
there a weight difference between the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.740 
there a weight difference between the
belt<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.400> chain<00:02:41.610> yeah<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.209> about<00:02:42.390> half<00:02:42.720> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
belt the chain yeah it's about half the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.059 
belt the chain yeah it's about half the
weight<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.290> chain

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
weight of a chain

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.130 
weight of a chain
and<00:02:44.159> it<00:02:44.280> lasts<00:02:44.519> three<00:02:44.879> times<00:02:44.909> longer<00:02:45.329> Wow<00:02:45.930> and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
and it lasts three times longer Wow and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.989 
and it lasts three times longer Wow and
it<00:02:46.200> doesn't<00:02:46.499> stretch<00:02:46.829> doesn't<00:02:47.609> stretch<00:02:47.819> at

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:47.999 
it doesn't stretch doesn't stretch at

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:53.140 
it doesn't stretch doesn't stretch at
all<00:02:48.590> wow<00:02:49.590> that's<00:02:50.400> impressive

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.740
