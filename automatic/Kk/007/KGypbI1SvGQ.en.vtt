00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
being I said tutorial on how to code a

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.309 
being I said tutorial on how to code a
minecraft<00:00:05.250> client<00:00:05.819> in<00:00:06.089> this<00:00:06.870> one<00:00:07.020> we're<00:00:07.170> going

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
minecraft client in this one we're going

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.009 
minecraft client in this one we're going
to<00:00:07.410> be<00:00:07.529> coding<00:00:07.859> no<00:00:08.460> fall<00:00:08.760> basically<00:00:09.750> what<00:00:09.870> no

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
to be coding no fall basically what no

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.669 
to be coding no fall basically what no
fall<00:00:10.230> does<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.880> disables<00:00:11.990> fall<00:00:12.990> damage<00:00:13.410> so

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
fall does is disables fall damage so

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.589 
fall does is disables fall damage so
pretty<00:00:14.190> much<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.700> can't<00:00:14.969> take<00:00:15.179> any<00:00:15.360> fall

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
pretty much you can't take any fall

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.710 
pretty much you can't take any fall
damage<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.740> like<00:00:17.490> always<00:00:17.910> make<00:00:18.180> sure<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.480> have

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
damage so like always make sure you have

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.870 
damage so like always make sure you have
your<00:00:19.080> boo<00:00:19.680> mean<00:00:19.920> set<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.460> I'm<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.820> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
your boo mean set up and I'm going to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.250 
your boo mean set up and I'm going to
make<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> quick<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.900> show<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.080> guys

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
make a quick one just to show you guys

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.620 
make a quick one just to show you guys
how<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.560> make<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.130> don't<00:00:23.310> know<00:00:23.490> how<00:00:23.640> so

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
how to make it if you don't know how so

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.220 
how to make it if you don't know how so
basically<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.760> leaps<00:00:26.760> should<00:00:27.539> look<00:00:27.810> like<00:00:27.840> this

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
basically it leaps should look like this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.160 
basically it leaps should look like this
and<00:00:28.500> if<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.580> don't<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:31.140> I

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
and if you don't know what I'm what I

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.749 
and if you don't know what I'm what I
just<00:00:31.410> did<00:00:31.590> or<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.250> want<00:00:32.430> an<00:00:32.520> explanation

on what I just did you can look back at

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.840 
on what I just did you can look back at
our<00:00:35.160> basics<00:00:35.700> tutorial<00:00:36.230> but<00:00:37.309> after<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.430> also

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
our basics tutorial but after that also

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.430 
our basics tutorial but after that also
make<00:00:39.000> sure<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.540> your<00:00:39.570> check<00:00:39.930> key<00:00:40.110> set<00:00:40.320> up

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
make sure you have your check key set up

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.069 
make sure you have your check key set up
this<00:00:41.070> says<00:00:41.309> auto<00:00:41.520> tool<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.300> should<00:00:42.660> say<00:00:42.870> no

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
this says auto tool but it should say no

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.100 
this says auto tool but it should say no
fall<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.059> this<00:00:45.059> should<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:45.539> variables

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
fall and this should be your variables

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.229 
fall and this should be your variables
class<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.920> ADA<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.879> yeah<00:00:48.300> um<00:00:49.399> alright<00:00:50.399> so

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
class not my ADA so yeah um alright so

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.330 
class not my ADA so yeah um alright so
basically<00:00:51.539> we're<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.590> focusing<00:00:52.800> on

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
basically we're going to be focusing on

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.650 
basically we're going to be focusing on
three<00:00:54.050> not<00:00:55.050> packages<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:55.800> classes<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:57.390> first

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
three not packages but classes the first

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.080 
three not packages but classes the first
one<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.379> packet<00:00:59.190> 11<00:00:59.699> player

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
one is going to be packet 11 player

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.889 
one is going to be packet 11 player
position<00:01:00.690> dot<00:01:00.840> Java<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.640> basically<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
position dot Java and basically as the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.670 
position dot Java and basically as the
name<00:01:04.670> suggests<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.450> talking<00:01:07.049> about<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
name suggests it is talking about the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.550 
name suggests it is talking about the
position<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> player<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:10.260> first

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
position of the player and the first

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.590 
position of the player and the first
thing<00:01:10.680> you'll<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:11.070> would<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.210> ground

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
thing you'll see would be on ground

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.310 
thing you'll see would be on ground
equals<00:01:12.869> 49<00:01:13.850> now<00:01:14.850> pretty<00:01:15.600> much<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.080> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
equals 49 now pretty much that is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.070 
equals 49 now pretty much that is
telling<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.189> server<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.939> you're<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
telling the server if you're on the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.140 
telling the server if you're on the
ground<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.500> if<00:01:19.619> you're<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> ground<00:01:20.400> so

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
ground or if you're not on the ground so

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.749 
ground or if you're not on the ground so
we're<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.570> change<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.280> always

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
we're going to change that if you always

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.249 
we're going to change that if you always
want<00:01:24.030> no<00:01:24.180> fault<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.080> just

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
want no fault to be on you can just

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.160 
want no fault to be on you can just
change<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.920> true<00:01:26.299> but<00:01:27.299> since<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.869> don't

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
change this to true but since I don't

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.649 
change this to true but since I don't
always<00:01:28.409> want<00:01:28.770> no<00:01:28.950> fall<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.700> want<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.570> able

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
always want no fall on I want to be able

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.840 
always want no fall on I want to be able
to<00:01:30.900> toggle<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:32.130> make<00:01:32.430> an<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.729> statement

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
to toggle it I can make an if statement

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.249 
to toggle it I can make an if statement
within<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:34.460> class<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.180> i'm<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> put<00:01:36.540> if

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.060 

my<00:01:40.259> variables<00:01:40.740> class<00:01:41.040> snowfall<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.920> i'm

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
my variables class snowfall and i'm

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.160 
my variables class snowfall and i'm
going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> open<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.640> up<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:45.420> these<00:01:45.659> brackets

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
going to open it up with these brackets

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.569 
going to open it up with these brackets
and<00:01:46.680> i<00:01:46.890> don't<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.100> what<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.250> hell<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.430> is

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and i don't know what the hell that is

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.069 
and i don't know what the hell that is
and<00:01:47.939> i'm<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> put<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.590> ground<00:01:50.479> equals<00:01:51.479> 2

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
and i'm going to put on ground equals 2

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.920 
and i'm going to put on ground equals 2
and<00:01:52.909> then<00:01:53.909> after<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.420> i'm<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> put<00:01:54.840> an

else statement and i'm going to open it

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.389 
else statement and i'm going to open it
up<00:01:57.119> again<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:58.409> I'm<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.829> put<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.070> on

ground<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> goes<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.210> 9<00:02:00.420> i'm<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> cut

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
ground it goes for 9 i'm going to cut

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.350 
ground it goes for 9 i'm going to cut
that<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.799> i'm<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> paste<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:02.850> in

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
that and i'm going to paste it right in

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.560 
that and i'm going to paste it right in
here<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.710> basically<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.729> small<00:02:06.420> piece

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
here so basically what this small piece

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.290 
here so basically what this small piece
of<00:02:06.630> code<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.049> saying<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.520> if<00:02:09.619> no<00:02:10.619> fall<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.039> on

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
of code is saying is if no fall is on

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.280 
of code is saying is if no fall is on
it'll<00:02:12.300> say<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.750> on

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
it'll say that on

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.869 
it'll say that on
it<00:02:13.469> was<00:02:13.620> true<00:02:13.890> which<00:02:14.099> is<00:02:14.250> telling<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.640> server

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
it was true which is telling the server

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.839 
it was true which is telling the server
that<00:02:15.150> you're<00:02:15.299> on<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.569> ground<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.670> when<00:02:17.670> it's

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
that you're on the ground and when it's

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.110 
that you're on the ground and when it's
not<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.319> it's<00:02:19.319> telling<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.159> that<00:02:20.430> you're

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
not on it's telling you that you're

not on it's telling you that you're
basically<00:02:21.629> either<00:02:22.409> on<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.890> ground<00:02:22.920> or<00:02:23.250> you're

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
basically either on the ground or you're

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.050 
basically either on the ground or you're
not<00:02:23.489> on<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.700> ground<00:02:23.939> so<00:02:24.750> yeah<00:02:25.129> once<00:02:26.129> you<00:02:26.370> once

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
not on the ground so yeah once you once

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.280 
not on the ground so yeah once you once
you're<00:02:27.239> done<00:02:27.359> with<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.689> can<00:02:27.959> just<00:02:28.019> X

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
you're done with that you can just X

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.280 
you're done with that you can just X
that<00:02:28.890> out<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.000> then<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.780> next<00:02:30.810> one<00:02:31.140> we're

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that out and then the next one we're

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.770 
that out and then the next one we're
going<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.680> be<00:02:31.799> looking<00:02:31.980> at<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.489> packet<00:02:33.060> 12<00:02:33.359> pair

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
going to be looking at is packet 12 pair

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.280 
going to be looking at is packet 12 pair
player<00:02:34.349> look<00:02:34.769> Java<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:36.019> again<00:02:37.019> you're<00:02:37.200> going

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
player look Java and again you're going

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.280 
player look Java and again you're going
to<00:02:37.379> see<00:02:37.560> on<00:02:37.590> ground<00:02:38.040> equals<00:02:38.340> par<00:02:38.970> 3<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.540> we're

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
to see on ground equals par 3 and we're

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.780 
to see on ground equals par 3 and we're
going<00:02:40.409> to<00:02:40.470> do<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.709> same<00:02:40.920> exact<00:02:41.310> thing<00:02:41.959> if<00:02:42.959> my

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
going to do the same exact thing if my

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.379 
going to do the same exact thing if my
variables<00:02:44.790> class<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.269> know<00:02:45.450> fall<00:02:45.750> open<00:02:46.709> it<00:02:46.799> up

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
variables class I know fall open it up

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:52.610 
variables class I know fall open it up
else<00:02:48.389> open<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.409> up<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.269> again<00:02:51.269> on<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.439> ground

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
else open it up and again on the ground

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.309 
else open it up and again on the ground
it<00:02:52.829> goes<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:54.230> cut<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.470> out<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:57.049> place<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.230> in

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
it goes to cut this out and place it in

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.699 
it goes to cut this out and place it in
there<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:59.780> again<00:03:00.780> that's<00:03:00.989> pretty<00:03:01.530> much<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
there and again that's pretty much the

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.699 
there and again that's pretty much the
same<00:03:02.099> thing<00:03:02.400> does<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.939> same<00:03:03.150> thing<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.709> means

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
same thing does the same thing and means

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.099 
same thing does the same thing and means
the<00:03:04.829> same<00:03:05.010> thing<00:03:05.069> so<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:06.299> last<00:03:06.540> packet<00:03:06.989> we're

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
the same thing so the last packet we're

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.309 
the same thing so the last packet we're
going<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.409> doing<00:03:07.530> or<00:03:08.030> changing<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.319> packet

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
going to be doing or changing is packet

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.449 
going to be doing or changing is packet
13<00:03:10.739> player<00:03:11.189> look<00:03:11.489> move<00:03:11.930> now<00:03:13.310> don't<00:03:14.310> get

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
confused there is packet 13 0 13 1 and

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.240 
confused there is packet 13 0 13 1 and
13<00:03:18.810> 2<00:03:19.049> we're<00:03:20.040> looking<00:03:20.430> for<00:03:20.639> 13<00:03:21.239> not<00:03:21.659> not<00:03:22.290> 13-0
