out<00:03:30.560> of<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:30.889> menu<00:03:31.129> it's<00:03:31.790> now<00:03:32.060> transformed

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
out of this menu it's now transformed

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.720

this<00:03:33.019> from<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.349> trainer<00:03:33.650> battle<00:03:34.010> into<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.340> wild

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
this from a trainer battle into a wild

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.879 
this from a trainer battle into a wild
Pokemon<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.299> all<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:36.109> can<00:03:36.290> now<00:03:36.379> just<00:03:36.410> run

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
Pokemon that all and I can now just run

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.009 
Pokemon that all and I can now just run
away<00:03:37.010> from<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.430> trainer<00:03:37.639> battle<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.150> that

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
away from the trainer battle and that

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.920 
away from the trainer battle and that
works<00:03:39.230> for<00:03:39.530> any<00:03:39.919> trainer<00:03:40.250> battle<00:03:40.549> in<00:03:40.639> the<00:03:40.730> game

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
works for any trainer battle in the game

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.199 
works for any trainer battle in the game
so<00:03:41.930> once<00:03:42.829> you've<00:03:43.010> done<00:03:43.220> that<00:03:43.489> you<00:03:44.000> can<00:03:44.030> then

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
so once you've done that you can then

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.420 
so once you've done that you can then
not<00:03:45.049> have<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.379> do<00:03:45.500> another<00:03:45.709> single<00:03:45.980> battle<00:03:46.340> in

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
not have to do another single battle in

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.819 
not have to do another single battle in
the<00:03:46.519> game<00:03:47.169> unfortunately<00:03:48.169> the<00:03:48.319> earliest

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
the game unfortunately the earliest

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.619 
the game unfortunately the earliest
place<00:03:49.069> that<00:03:49.340> I<00:03:49.370> know<00:03:49.489> in<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:49.970> game<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.449> get

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
place that I know in the game to get

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.809 
place that I know in the game to get
point<00:03:51.019> mech<00:03:51.169> berries<00:03:51.560> is<00:03:51.799> directly<00:03:52.639> before

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
point mech berries is directly before

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.509 
point mech berries is directly before
forgery<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.379> would<00:03:54.709> still<00:03:54.949> have<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.310> play

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
forgery so you would still have to play

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.220 
forgery so you would still have to play
through<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.849> game<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:56.269> fair<00:03:56.569> bit<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.959> get<00:03:57.109> this

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
through the game a fair bit to get this

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.670 
through the game a fair bit to get this
to<00:03:57.470> work<00:03:59.410> but<00:04:00.410> yeah<00:04:00.829> obviously<00:04:01.519> it's<00:04:01.940> pretty

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
to work but yeah obviously it's pretty

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.129 
to work but yeah obviously it's pretty
significant<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.849> it<00:04:04.849> would<00:04:05.060> allow<00:04:05.299> for<00:04:05.329> a

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
significant and it would allow for a

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.050 
significant and it would allow for a
glitch<00:04:06.650> category<00:04:07.160> of<00:04:07.310> this<00:04:07.459> game<00:04:07.699> to

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
glitch category of this game to

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.020 
glitch category of this game to
significantly<00:04:09.019> be<00:04:09.709> able<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.160> beat<00:04:10.370> the

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
significantly be able to beat the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.119 
significantly be able to beat the
current<00:04:11.389> record<00:04:11.629> of<00:04:12.019> this<00:04:12.260> game<00:04:12.500> from<00:04:13.040> a

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
current record of this game from a

current record of this game from a
speedrunning<00:04:13.549> perspective<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.799> now<00:04:15.799> this

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
speedrunning perspective and now this

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.490 
speedrunning perspective and now this
might<00:04:16.250> not<00:04:16.280> be<00:04:16.630> technically<00:04:17.630> an<00:04:17.959> instant

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
might not be technically an instant

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.039 
might not be technically an instant
victory<00:04:18.829> glitch<00:04:19.160> but<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:20.209> more<00:04:20.810> just

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
victory glitch but a more just

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.080 
victory glitch but a more just
transforming<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:21.979> trainer<00:04:22.190> battle<00:04:22.490> into<00:04:22.820> a

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.170 
wild Pokemon battle
I<00:04:24.220> did<00:04:24.940> have<00:04:25.150> an<00:04:25.300> earlier<00:04:25.660> instance<00:04:26.170> where

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
I did have an earlier instance where

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.820 
I did have an earlier instance where
once<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.450> got<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.810> glitch<00:04:29.050> moves<00:04:29.380> on<00:04:29.680> my

glitch<00:04:31.840> moves<00:04:32.140> I<00:04:32.410> didn't<00:04:32.770> even<00:04:32.920> have<00:04:33.130> to

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
glitch moves I didn't even have to

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.370 
glitch moves I didn't even have to
escape<00:04:33.670> as<00:04:33.910> soon<00:04:34.120> as<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.360> exited<00:04:34.780> this<00:04:34.990> menu

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
escape as soon as I exited this menu

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.860 
escape as soon as I exited this menu
right<00:04:35.560> here<00:04:36.010> I<00:04:36.160> could<00:04:36.280> just<00:04:36.490> escape<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.600> dad

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
I didn't even have to run away and

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.770 
I didn't even have to run away and
because<00:04:42.550> I<00:04:42.790> mean<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.180> thinks<00:04:43.390> it's<00:04:43.510> a<00:04:43.540> wild

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
because I mean it thinks it's a wild

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.600 
because I mean it thinks it's a wild
bergamot<00:04:43.930> also<00:04:44.620> because<00:04:44.860> this<00:04:45.010> ninja<00:04:45.370> has

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
bergamot also because this ninja has

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.260 
bergamot also because this ninja has
greater<00:04:45.850> speed<00:04:46.150> than<00:04:46.180> me<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:46.660> can't<00:04:46.990> escape

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
greater speed than me I can't escape

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.150 
greater speed than me I can't escape
first<00:04:49.270> turn<00:04:49.600> just<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.960> bit<00:04:50.080> unlucky<00:04:50.320> you<00:04:50.980> can

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
first turn just a bit unlucky you can

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.070 
first turn just a bit unlucky you can
just<00:04:51.370> use<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.520> fluffy<00:04:51.820> tail<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:52.300> escape<00:04:52.630> if<00:04:52.840> this

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
just use a fluffy tail to escape if this

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.060 
just use a fluffy tail to escape if this
was<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.290> case<00:04:53.560> there<00:04:57.480> so<00:04:58.480> as<00:04:58.600> you<00:04:58.750> can<00:04:58.870> see

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
was the case there so as you can see

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.830 
was the case there so as you can see
clearly<00:05:00.150> allows<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.300> to<00:05:01.390> beat<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.660> game<00:05:01.810> a

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
clearly allows you to beat the game a

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.560 
clearly allows you to beat the game a
lot<00:05:02.080> faster<00:05:02.820> but<00:05:03.820> yeah<00:05:03.940> I'm<00:05:04.120> sure<00:05:04.330> more

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
lot faster but yeah I'm sure more

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.540 
lot faster but yeah I'm sure more
developments<00:05:05.110> will<00:05:05.260> be<00:05:05.350> found<00:05:05.620> with<00:05:06.400> this
