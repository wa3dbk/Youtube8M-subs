 how could you copy your transport 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.660
 but with the help of buying a property that is 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.470
 you had to spend money in order 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 to copy this dream and transport 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.210
 arc well for many now this method is not 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.300
 relevant as rockstar 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.280

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.549

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.130
 and let your friend stay in the garage 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.380
 also ask your friend to contact 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.750

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.970
 the car you want to get yourself 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.250
 after you left the garage 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.729
 sit down tanks and become flax against 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.570
 garage and wait for your friend to come out 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.780

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.380
 and you will see that the player who was in 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.540
 she put the car alive small 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.579
 amendment is your friend 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.590
 died i mean you killed him that means that 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.630
 you are too early or too late 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.320
 destroyed his transport between find 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.039
 some sort of specific point after 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.899
 of how he survived tell your friend 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.790
 let him get in the tank he right there 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.670
 teleports somewhere else 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.099
 well you will see not far nearby on the map 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.440
 somewhere about three hundred meters there is no more 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.739
 next just ask your friend 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.620
 so he drove away far away from 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.830
 citizens to hell because he 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.510
 now he must call the mechanic 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.800
 can call a mechanic if you will 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.470
 close to the garage 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.110
 once again let you rate 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.000
 far away from your garage and let your friend 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.069
 call him a mechanic let him call 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.519
 that car that you want that is 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.250
 Sultan for example, see my case here 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.790
 came the sultan and for some reason on 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.800
 this sultan does not have a tracker that is what 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.900
 that means i can drive in los 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.150
 santos castes sell it i can 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.269
 pick up your garage and put it to yourself 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.599
 in the garage, that is, it turns out that I have 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.530
 now there is a friend of mine and transport 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.720
 This transport also remained a friend 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.629
 I would like to make 2 notes 1 note 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.970
 I'm not sure that this mushroom works 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.310
 by all cars I'm not sure what you are 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.819
 You can for example copy Adare arc 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.019
 for this you have to try it yourself and 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.720
 write in the comments that you have 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.060

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.950
 on YouTube how can you write your 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.959
 nickname and and find each other and 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.450
 we will copy our transport 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.230
 for example there write your iksbox some 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.849
 or playstation 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.799
 I also want to ask you to 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.680

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.840
