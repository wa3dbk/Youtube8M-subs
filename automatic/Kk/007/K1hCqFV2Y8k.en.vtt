00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.790 
better shoe for lesser price and that's
definitely<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:34.149> case<00:00:34.329> here<00:00:34.659> with<00:00:34.690> Asics<00:00:35.320> the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
definitely the case here with Asics the

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.489 
definitely the case here with Asics the
quality<00:00:36.219> on<00:00:36.249> these<00:00:36.519> is<00:00:37.019> no<00:00:38.019> different<00:00:38.440> than

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499 
quality on these is no different than

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.470 
quality on these is no different than
the<00:00:38.620> high-end<00:00:38.949> models<00:00:39.309> you're<00:00:40.149> paying<00:00:40.390> less

the high-end models you're paying less

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.149 
the high-end models you're paying less
of<00:00:40.749> a<00:00:40.809> price<00:00:41.019> simply<00:00:41.319> because<00:00:41.589> this<00:00:41.769> is<00:00:41.949> the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
of a price simply because this is the

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:43.979 
of a price simply because this is the
synthetic<00:00:42.399> leather<00:00:42.940> model<00:00:43.390> as<00:00:43.539> opposed<00:00:43.870> to

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
synthetic leather model as opposed to

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.919 
synthetic leather model as opposed to
the<00:00:44.140> natural<00:00:44.679> kangaroo<00:00:45.219> leather<00:00:45.429> model<00:00:45.909> but<00:00:46.899> I

the natural kangaroo leather model but I

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.329 
the natural kangaroo leather model but I
can<00:00:47.199> tell<00:00:47.409> you<00:00:47.499> that<00:00:47.589> the<00:00:47.769> synthetic<00:00:47.949> leather

on<00:00:48.579> that<00:00:48.819> Asics<00:00:49.179> is<00:00:49.300> using<00:00:49.659> is<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:51.010> really

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
on that Asics is using is really really

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.540 
on that Asics is using is really really
good<00:00:51.670> quality<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.989> not<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.319> thin<00:00:53.620> zero

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
good quality it's not the thin zero

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.520

like synthetic leather that if you

didn't tell me if it was synthetic I

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.709 
didn't tell me if it was synthetic I
would<00:01:00.159> probably<00:01:00.339> guess<00:01:00.609> it<00:01:00.789> was<00:01:00.879> leather<00:01:01.059> it's

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719

definitely nice to see you of course get
the<00:02:30.940> HG<00:02:31.420> 10<00:02:31.660> millimeters<00:02:32.200> which<00:02:32.470> stands<00:02:32.709> for

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
the HG 10 millimeters which stands for

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.770 
the HG 10 millimeters which stands for
the<00:02:33.010> heel<00:02:33.250> gradient<00:02:33.760> if<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.270> see<00:02:34.390> me<00:02:34.510> explain

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
the heel gradient if you see me explain

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.840 
the heel gradient if you see me explain
it<00:02:34.870> before<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.160> nothing<00:02:36.520> new<00:02:36.550> but<00:02:36.760> if

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
it before this is nothing new but if

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.580 
it before this is nothing new but if
you're<00:02:36.970> new<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.150> new<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.810> Asics<00:02:38.140> video<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
you're new to new to the Asics video the

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.920 
you're new to new to the Asics video the
ASA<00:02:38.860> cues<00:02:39.340> here<00:02:39.550> they<00:02:39.940> most<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.540> them<00:02:40.720> feature

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
ASA cues here they most of them feature

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.300 
ASA cues here they most of them feature
this<00:02:41.170> heel<00:02:41.440> gradient<00:02:41.800> which<00:02:41.920> means<00:02:42.130> that

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
this heel gradient which means that

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.310 
this heel gradient which means that
there<00:02:42.430> is<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.550> 10<00:02:43.300> millimeter<00:02:43.630> left<00:02:44.050> in<00:02:44.230> the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
there is a 10 millimeter left in the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.800 
there is a 10 millimeter left in the
heel<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.610> heel<00:02:45.880> is<00:02:45.910> 10<00:02:46.330> millimeters

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
heel so that the heel is 10 millimeters

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.410 
heel so that the heel is 10 millimeters
higher<00:02:47.050> than<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.860> toe<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:48.700> like<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> running

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
higher than the toe so like a running

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.910 
higher than the toe so like a running
shoe<00:02:49.570> you're<00:02:49.750> you're<00:02:50.080> angled<00:02:50.500> ever<00:02:50.709> so

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
shoe you're you're angled ever so

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.250 
shoe you're you're angled ever so
slightly<00:02:51.190> on<00:02:51.520> your<00:02:51.730> toes<00:02:52.140> shifting<00:02:53.140> your

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
slightly on your toes shifting your

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.350 
slightly on your toes shifting your
weight<00:02:53.290> forward<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.190> logic<00:02:55.120> here<00:02:55.150> is

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
weight forward and the logic here is

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.350 
weight forward and the logic here is
that<00:02:55.800> soccer<00:02:56.800> is<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> writing<00:02:57.280> sport<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.850> a<00:02:58.239> lot

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
that soccer is a writing sport and a lot

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.440 
that soccer is a writing sport and a lot
of<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.540> injuries<00:02:58.900> are<00:02:58.930> caused<00:02:59.500> by<00:02:59.739> overuse<00:03:00.450> so

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
of the injuries are caused by overuse so

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.630 
of the injuries are caused by overuse so
transferring<00:03:02.320> your<00:03:02.410> weight<00:03:02.470> forward<00:03:02.890> puts

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
transferring your weight forward puts

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.940 
transferring your weight forward puts
your<00:03:03.760> body<00:03:03.940> in<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.360> better<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:05.410> better<00:03:05.980> position

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
your body in a better a better position

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.850

weight pressing down on them at all

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.210

millimeter<00:03:24.610> is<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:25.470> mid<00:03:26.470> sole<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:27.040> heel<00:03:27.070> sole

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
millimeter is the mid sole and heel sole

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.449 
millimeter is the mid sole and heel sole
so<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.290> EBA<00:03:29.709> foam<00:03:30.010> which<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.220> this

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
so you have this EBA foam which is this

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.610 
so you have this EBA foam which is this
little<00:03:30.880> yellow<00:03:31.030> strip<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.630> have<00:03:31.780> here<00:03:32.049> which

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
little yellow strip you have here which

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.080 
little yellow strip you have here which
runs<00:03:32.860> through<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.340> again<00:03:33.760> it's<00:03:33.940> like<00:03:34.030> a

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
runs through and again it's like a

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.380 
runs through and again it's like a
running<00:03:34.540> shoe<00:03:35.430> sole<00:03:36.430> so<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.820> actually<00:03:37.060> have

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
running shoe sole so you actually have

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.479 
running shoe sole so you actually have

some extra cushion besides the insole
this<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.850> under<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.269> insole<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:40.810> have<00:03:41.110> the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
this is under the insole you have the

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.870 
this is under the insole you have the
cushion<00:03:41.410> of<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.650> e<00:03:41.739> V<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:41.980> foam<00:03:42.310> as<00:03:42.489> well<00:03:42.730> as<00:03:42.820> the

cushion of the e V a foam as well as the

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.380 
cushion of the e V a foam as well as the
insole<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.570> you're<00:03:43.660> gonna<00:03:43.750> have<00:03:43.900> again<00:03:44.170> less
