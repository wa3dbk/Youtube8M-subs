where you test for development in
children<00:02:46.989> from<00:02:47.989> I<00:02:48.400> believe<00:02:49.400> it's<00:02:49.520> all<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.700> way

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.460 
children from I believe it's all the way
from<00:02:49.820> newborn<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.360> six<00:02:50.660> years<00:02:50.870> old<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.290> that's

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
from newborn to six years old so that's

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.940

really interesting and it's basically a
whole<00:02:55.430> chart<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:57.790> shows<00:02:58.790> where<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.209> certain

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
assessment should because i found it was

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.589

really<00:05:53.840> interesting<00:05:54.200> and<00:05:55.010> everything<00:05:55.910> so<00:05:56.300> I

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
really interesting and everything so I

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.560 
really interesting and everything so I
don't<00:05:57.200> know<00:05:57.260> if<00:05:57.289> at<00:05:57.500> other<00:05:57.770> schools<00:05:58.389> do<00:05:59.389> this

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
don't know if at other schools do this

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.960 
don't know if at other schools do this
or<00:05:59.750> not<00:05:59.930> I<00:06:00.410> think<00:06:00.950> that<00:06:01.160> my<00:06:01.520> teacher<00:06:01.760> said<00:06:01.910> we

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
or not I think that my teacher said we

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.190 
or not I think that my teacher said we
get<00:06:02.090> like<00:06:02.180> a<00:06:02.240> certification<00:06:02.630> when<00:06:03.110> we

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
get like a certification when we

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.779 
get like a certification when we
graduate<00:06:03.590> that<00:06:03.770> says<00:06:03.950> we're<00:06:04.130> certified<00:06:04.430> and

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
graduate that says we're certified and

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:06.460

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
doing to Denver to assessment so that's

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.480
