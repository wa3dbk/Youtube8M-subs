one end on each side and I chose to go

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.700 
one end on each side and I chose to go
through<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.409> went<00:01:52.560> through

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
through with the one that went through

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
through with the one that went through
the<00:01:52.860> entire<00:01:53.189> plunger<00:01:53.670> assembly<00:01:53.780> but<00:01:54.780> of

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the entire plunger assembly but of

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.810 
the entire plunger assembly but of
course<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.380> means<00:01:55.560> holes<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.369> holes<00:01:56.490> leak

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
course that means holes and holes leak

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.700 
course that means holes and holes leak
air<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.450> that's<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:58.049> exactly<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.590> best

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
air and that's not exactly the best

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.319 
air and that's not exactly the best
thing<00:01:58.950> also<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.520> adds<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.759> little<00:01:59.909> bit<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.180> dead

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
thing also it adds a little bit of dead

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.389 
thing also it adds a little bit of dead
space<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.950> much<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.310> all

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
space but it's not that much in all

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.420 
space but it's not that much in all
honesty<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.869> originally<00:02:04.799> when<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.979> finish<00:02:05.280> this

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
honesty so originally when I finish this

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.029 
honesty so originally when I finish this
thing<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:06.030> wasn't<00:02:06.659> shooting<00:02:06.990> all<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.710> well

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
thing it wasn't shooting all that well

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.100 
thing it wasn't shooting all that well
which<00:02:08.610> was<00:02:08.849> extremely<00:02:09.209> disappointed<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.020> was

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
which was extremely disappointed it was

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.320 
which was extremely disappointed it was
shooting<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.739> elite<00:02:11.129> ranges<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.849> mean<00:02:12.180> that's

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
shooting like elite ranges I mean that's

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.710 
shooting like elite ranges I mean that's
not<00:02:12.510> too<00:02:12.660> bad<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:13.170> still

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
not too bad but still

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.280 
not too bad but still
and<00:02:14.260> well<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.550> spent<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.330> lot<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.510> time<00:02:16.750> filling

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
and well I spent a lot of time filling

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.650 
and well I spent a lot of time filling
in<00:02:17.380> holes<00:02:17.590> with<00:02:17.950> glue<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.150> managed<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.570> get

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
in holes with glue and I managed to get

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.990 
in holes with glue and I managed to get
it<00:02:19.780> shooting<00:02:20.140> pretty<00:02:20.500> decently<00:02:20.970> before<00:02:21.970> I

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
it shooting pretty decently before I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.710 
it shooting pretty decently before I
actually<00:02:22.330> shoot<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.960> we<00:02:23.380> will<00:02:23.530> test<00:02:23.830> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
actually shoot it we will test the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.470 
actually shoot it we will test the
plunger<00:02:25.720> seal<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.620> right<00:02:26.890> here<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:28.000> barrel

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
plunger seal this right here is a barrel

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.840 
plunger seal this right here is a barrel
off<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.930> my<00:02:29.110> failed<00:02:29.470> air<00:02:29.800> tech<00:02:30.040> 3000<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.730> was

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
off of my failed air tech 3000 I was

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.910 
off of my failed air tech 3000 I was
building<00:02:31.210> I<00:02:31.420> already<00:02:31.960> had<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.290> pet<00:02:32.500> G<00:02:32.740> with

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
building I already had the pet G with

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.120 
building I already had the pet G with
the<00:02:33.070> brass<00:02:33.280> installed<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.960> all<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.560> did<00:02:35.800> was<00:02:36.010> I

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
the brass installed so all I did was I

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.030 
the brass installed so all I did was I
took<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.490> piece<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.850> PVC<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.690> yeah<00:02:38.260> got<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:38.800> all

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
took a piece of PVC and yeah got it all

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.110 
took a piece of PVC and yeah got it all
nice<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.540> will<00:02:40.660> fit<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.050> there<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:42.120> if

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
nice and so it will fit in there and if

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.750 
nice and so it will fit in there and if
I<00:02:43.210> put<00:02:43.510> my<00:02:43.630> hand<00:02:43.840> on<00:02:43.930> this<00:02:44.140> end<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.830> I<00:02:44.980> keep

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
I put my hand on this end and I keep

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.290 
I put my hand on this end and I keep
that<00:02:45.970> priming<00:02:46.450> handle<00:02:46.780> back<00:02:48.000> you'll<00:02:49.000> see<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
that priming handle back you'll see the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.780 
that priming handle back you'll see the
seals<00:02:49.540> not<00:02:49.720> perfect<00:02:50.200> but<00:02:50.410> it's<00:02:50.790> definitely

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
seals not perfect but it's definitely

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.330 
seals not perfect but it's definitely
workable<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:53.080> is<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.260> problem<00:02:53.800> with<00:02:54.100> this

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
workable and that is a problem with this

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.300 
workable and that is a problem with this
when<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.820> prime<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.360> back<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:56.740> will<00:02:56.920> flop

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
when I prime that back that will flop

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.670 
when I prime that back that will flop
and<00:02:57.970> if<00:02:58.120> your<00:02:58.300> stopped<00:02:58.960> it<00:02:59.110> halfway<00:02:59.530> or

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
and if your stopped it halfway or

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.200 
and if your stopped it halfway or
something<00:03:00.070> not<00:03:00.220> only<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.550> gonna<00:03:00.670> hurt<00:03:00.940> but

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
something not only is it gonna hurt but

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.830 
something not only is it gonna hurt but
it's<00:03:01.840> gonna<00:03:01.960> hurt<00:03:02.170> your<00:03:02.290> ranges<00:03:02.830> so<00:03:03.480> not<00:03:04.480> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
it's gonna hurt your ranges so not the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
it's gonna hurt your ranges so not the
best<00:03:05.910> but<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:08.110> whole<00:03:08.290> screw<00:03:08.590> through<00:03:08.830> the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
best but this whole screw through the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.950 
best but this whole screw through the
entire<00:03:09.250> front<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.850> assembly<00:03:10.210> here<00:03:10.720> means

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
entire front of the assembly here means

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.530 
entire front of the assembly here means
this<00:03:11.080> thing<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.380> rock<00:03:11.650> solid<00:03:11.920> I'll<00:03:12.580> dry<00:03:13.270> fire

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
this thing is rock solid I'll dry fire

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.630 
this thing is rock solid I'll dry fire
that<00:03:13.810> all<00:03:13.960> day<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.290> there's<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.560> K<00:03:14.800> 26<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.490> here

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
that all day and there's a K 26 in here

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.229 
that all day and there's a K 26 in here
so<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.000> absolutely<00:03:16.930> powerful<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.820> why

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
so it is absolutely powerful so why

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.170 
so it is absolutely powerful so why
don't<00:03:19.360> we<00:03:19.390> kind<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.690> fire<00:03:19.840> we've<00:03:20.380> got<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:21.180> we

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
don't we kind of fire we've got this we

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.830 
don't we kind of fire we've got this we

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
although I don't know how that's gonna

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.290

would be even better but I have a
feeling<00:04:24.370> there's<00:04:24.729> just<00:04:24.910> not<00:04:25.150> enough<00:04:25.210> airflow
