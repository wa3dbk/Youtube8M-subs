start off by taking the bridge Reapers
at<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.529> front<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.010> I'm<00:00:29.160> gonna<00:00:29.369> range<00:00:29.670> no

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
at the front and I'm gonna range no

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.760 
at the front and I'm gonna range no
Nexus<00:00:31.019> Nexus<00:00:31.710> no<00:00:32.309> nexus<00:00:33.000> wars<00:00:33.630> no<00:00:34.469> what's<00:00:34.739> that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
Nexus Nexus no nexus wars no what's that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.209 
Nexus Nexus no nexus wars no what's that
actually<00:00:35.070> put<00:00:35.309> up<00:00:35.460> yeah<00:00:36.530> I<00:00:37.530> think<00:00:37.710> he<00:00:37.980> just

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
actually put up yeah I think he just

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.819 
actually put up yeah I think he just
cancelled<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:39.170> he's<00:00:40.170> kinda<00:00:40.500> figured<00:00:40.800> that

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
cancelled it he's kinda figured that

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.619 
cancelled it he's kinda figured that
there<00:00:41.190> was<00:00:41.340> no<00:00:41.550> chance<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:42.000> he<00:00:42.149> would<00:00:42.239> defend

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
there was no chance that he would defend

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.479 
there was no chance that he would defend
it<00:00:42.960> against<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.890> know<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.219> kind<00:00:44.430> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it against that you know this kind of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.400 
it against that you know this kind of
pressure<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.690> Cal<00:00:45.899> saw<00:00:46.260> that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
pressure and I think that Cal saw that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
pressure and I think that Cal saw that
and<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.160> know<00:00:47.280> he<00:00:47.460> thought<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.760> well<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and you know he thought that well the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.060 
and you know he thought that well the
damage<00:00:48.539> has<00:00:48.690> been<00:00:48.719> done<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.320> I'm<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.770> went<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
damage has been done so I'm just went to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.090 
damage has been done so I'm just went to
back<00:00:50.250> off<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.149> point<00:00:51.420> already<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.469> he's

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
back off in this point already just he's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.650 
back off in this point already just he's
gonna<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.699> an<00:00:53.820> economic<00:00:54.210> advantage<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.600> this

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
gonna get an economic advantage at this

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.910 
gonna get an economic advantage at this
point<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.079> very<00:00:55.320> soon<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:55.710> kind<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
point and very soon that's kind of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.740 
point and very soon that's kind of
turned<00:00:56.100> into<00:00:56.219> an<00:00:56.370> advantage<00:00:57.090> actually<00:00:57.600> it's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
turned into an advantage actually it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.260 
turned into an advantage actually it's
no<00:00:57.899> losing<00:00:58.289> his<00:00:58.410> observer<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.010> he<00:00:59.250> will<00:00:59.910> force

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
no losing his observer so he will force

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.410 
no losing his observer so he will force
to<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.960> know<00:01:01.079> use<00:01:01.289> some<00:01:01.530> robotics<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.879> know

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
to you know use some robotics you know

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.750 
to you know use some robotics you know
time<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.899> build<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.409> an<00:01:04.830> observer<00:01:05.220> instead<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
time to build a an observer instead of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.899 
time to build a an observer instead of
going<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.180> another<00:01:06.450> Weaver<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.979> that's<00:01:08.220> also

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
going for another Weaver so that's also

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.120 
going for another Weaver so that's also
some<00:01:09.210> damage<00:01:09.510> we've<00:01:09.659> seen<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.380> pvp<00:01:10.710> s<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130

Fox<00:01:41.420> maybe<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> natural<00:01:42.899> expression

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
Fox maybe it's the natural expression

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.830 
Fox maybe it's the natural expression
yeah<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.610> don't<00:01:45.180> know<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> thought<00:01:45.540> from<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
yeah I don't know I thought from the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
yeah I don't know I thought from the
nexus<00:01:46.350> point<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.649> at<00:01:46.770> nine<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.070> he<00:01:47.159> is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
nexus point on at nine but he is

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.620 
nexus point on at nine but he is
meanwhile<00:01:47.579> putting<00:01:47.820> down<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.149> next<00:01:48.420> at<00:01:48.540> the

meanwhile putting down the next at the
Natural<00:01:49.020> Expo<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:50.299> doesn't<00:01:51.299> really<00:01:51.420> matter

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
Natural Expo and doesn't really matter

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.149 
Natural Expo and doesn't really matter
overall<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.530> okay<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.040> definitely

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
overall because okay that definitely

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.710 
overall because okay that definitely
wasn't<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.700> sure<00:01:53.790> cuz<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.270> almost<00:01:54.479> ready

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
wasn't that sure cuz it's almost ready

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.630 
wasn't that sure cuz it's almost ready
now<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.200> Cal<00:01:55.409> with<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> decisive<00:01:56.280> economic

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
out some brilliant micromanagement to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.449 
out some brilliant micromanagement to
get<00:02:06.930> back<00:02:07.110> into<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.380> game<00:02:07.560> yeah<00:02:08.129> you

get back into this game yeah you

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.590 
get back into this game yeah you
probably<00:02:08.789> have<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.179> go

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
probably have to go

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.540 
probably have to go
you<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.960> take<00:02:10.320> down<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> lot<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.860> pros<00:02:11.220> maybe

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
you know take down a lot of pros maybe

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.550 
you know take down a lot of pros maybe
do<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> river<00:02:12.060> drop<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.540> some<00:02:12.720> sort<00:02:12.960> but<00:02:13.410> then

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
do a river drop of some sort but then

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.260 
do a river drop of some sort but then
again<00:02:13.650> if<00:02:13.860> he<00:02:14.070> does<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.490> he'll<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:14.910> you

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
again if he does that he'll be just you

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.880 
again if he does that he'll be just you
know<00:02:15.390> leaving<00:02:15.690> from<00:02:15.780> someone<00:02:16.140> vulnerable<00:02:16.710> and

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
know leaving from someone vulnerable and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.320 
know leaving from someone vulnerable and
Kel<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.460> actually<00:02:17.790> coming<00:02:17.970> in<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.300> a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
Kel is actually coming in with a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.970 
Kel is actually coming in with a
craftsman<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.930> his<00:02:19.140> own<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.470> he<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.800> he

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
craftsman of his own and he if he

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.830 
craftsman of his own and he if he
manages<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.820> take<00:02:21.030> down<00:02:21.210> some<00:02:21.450> probes<00:02:21.720> that

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
manages to take down some probes that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.470 
manages to take down some probes that
would<00:02:22.050> be<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.320> totally<00:02:22.590> grand<00:02:23.100> but<00:02:23.940> he<00:02:24.090> loses

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
would be like totally grand but he loses

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.910 
would be like totally grand but he loses
he<00:02:24.660> loses<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.020> shuttle<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.470> he's<00:02:25.680> probably

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
he loses the shuttle and he's probably

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.120 
he loses the shuttle and he's probably
going<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.250> lose<00:02:26.460> his<00:02:26.700> two<00:02:26.880> rivers<00:02:27.240> here<00:02:27.480> oh

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
going to lose his two rivers here oh

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.510 
going to lose his two rivers here oh
yeah<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:30.570> actually<00:02:30.690> snow<00:02:31.680> may<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.920> working<00:02:32.220> his

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
yeah so actually snow may be working his

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.310 
yeah so actually snow may be working his
way<00:02:32.550> back<00:02:32.670> into<00:02:33.240> this<00:02:33.420> game<00:02:33.600> this<00:02:33.780> was<00:02:33.930> like<00:02:34.110> a

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
way back into this game this was like a

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.560 
way back into this game this was like a
real<00:02:35.040> mistake<00:02:35.340> from<00:02:35.670> Cal<00:02:35.910> going<00:02:36.300> for<00:02:36.450> this

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
real mistake from Cal going for this

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.410 
real mistake from Cal going for this
kind<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.840> drop<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.850> snow<00:02:38.850> might<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.240> actually

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
kind of drop and snow might be actually

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.360 
kind of drop and snow might be actually
to<00:02:39.690> move<00:02:39.870> out<00:02:39.990> here<00:02:40.110> snow<00:02:40.440> has<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.830> shot<00:02:41.070> on<00:02:41.100> he

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
to move out here snow has a shot on he

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.850 
to move out here snow has a shot on he
has<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.580> lot<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.820> jergens<00:02:42.440> probably<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> similar

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
has a lot of jergens probably a similar

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.010 
has a lot of jergens probably a similar
number<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.210> know<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.570> cows

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
number to the you know to the cows

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.470 
number to the you know to the cows
number<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.400> he<00:02:47.430> will<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:47.730> able<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.180> move<00:02:48.300> out

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
number so he will be able to move out

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.200 
number so he will be able to move out
and<00:02:48.690> maybe<00:02:49.020> pressure<00:02:49.410> cap<00:02:49.740> Cal<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:51.120> know

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
and maybe pressure cap Cal and you know

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.820 
and maybe pressure cap Cal and you know
this<00:02:51.360> kind<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.660> mistakes<00:02:52.080> just<00:02:52.260> turn<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.650> game

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
this kind of mistakes just turn the game

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.540 
this kind of mistakes just turn the game
around<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.690> i<00:02:54.800> think<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.100> position<00:02:56.340> is

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
around so i think that the position is

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.000 
around so i think that the position is
actually<00:02:56.910> no<00:02:57.660> kind<00:02:57.990> of<00:02:58.080> equalize<00:02:58.350> now<00:02:58.710> i<00:02:58.920> would

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
actually no kind of equalize now i would

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.670 
actually no kind of equalize now i would
say<00:02:59.420> yeah<00:03:00.420> i<00:03:00.450> think<00:03:00.570> just<00:03:00.900> says<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.230> was<00:03:01.650> a

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
say yeah i think just says I was a

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.840 
say yeah i think just says I was a
little<00:03:01.890> surprised<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.340> move<00:03:02.550> because<00:03:02.730> he

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
little surprised that move because he

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.400 
little surprised that move because he
had<00:03:02.970> an<00:03:03.120> observer<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.510> there<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.810> was<00:03:03.900> spotting

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
had an observer in there it was spotting

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
to be able to continue this constant

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.670 
to be able to continue this constant
pressure<00:03:38.970> probes<00:03:39.930> I'm<00:03:40.110> being<00:03:40.260> pulled<00:03:40.440> off<00:03:40.500> on

bye<00:03:40.860> bye<00:03:41.100> cal<00:03:41.460> so<00:03:41.730> we're<00:03:41.850> just<00:03:41.880> wondering<00:03:42.360> what

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
bye bye cal so we're just wondering what

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.180 
bye bye cal so we're just wondering what
is<00:03:42.600> actually<00:03:42.810> gonna<00:03:42.900> be<00:03:43.050> able<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.230> put<00:03:43.350> keep

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
is actually gonna be able to put keep

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.830 
is actually gonna be able to put keep
this<00:03:44.340> up<00:03:44.490> has<00:03:44.640> some<00:03:44.790> grooves<00:03:45.120> inside<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.750> his

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
this up has some grooves inside of his

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.960 
this up has some grooves inside of his
base<00:03:45.990> adding<00:03:46.320> in<00:03:46.410> more<00:03:46.440> gateways<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:47.250> think

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
base adding in more gateways I think

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.250 
base adding in more gateways I think
he's<00:03:48.060> going<00:03:48.210> to<00:03:48.270> be<00:03:48.330> able<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.570> rebuild<00:03:48.840> an<00:03:49.020> army

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
he's going to be able to rebuild an army

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.600 
he's going to be able to rebuild an army
quicker<00:03:49.560> than<00:03:49.800> snow<00:03:50.040> snow<00:03:50.220> not<00:03:50.400> gonna<00:03:50.550> be

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
quicker than snow snow not gonna be

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.430 
quicker than snow snow not gonna be
reinforced<00:03:51.330> as<00:03:51.420> quickly<00:03:51.600> so<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.870> think<00:03:51.930> Cal

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
reinforced as quickly so I think Cal

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.630 
reinforced as quickly so I think Cal
definitely<00:03:52.830> still<00:03:53.010> has<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.130> chance<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.490> get

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
definitely still has a chance to get

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.920 
definitely still has a chance to get
back<00:03:53.670> in<00:03:53.850> this<00:03:53.970> also<00:03:54.240> we<00:03:54.510> were<00:03:54.600> coming<00:03:54.840> down

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
back in this also we were coming down

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.910 
back in this also we were coming down
he's<00:03:55.140> gonna<00:03:55.260> be<00:03:55.350> able<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.530> start<00:03:55.680> firing

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
he's gonna be able to start firing

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.920 
he's gonna be able to start firing
scarabs<00:03:56.400> down<00:03:56.940> that<00:03:57.180> ramp<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.630> definitely

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
scarabs down that ramp so I definitely

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.970 
scarabs down that ramp so I definitely
don't<00:03:58.080> think<00:03:58.170> this<00:03:58.380> game<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.560> or<00:03:58.740> me<00:03:58.800> just

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
don't think this game is or me just

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.410 
don't think this game is or me just
really<00:03:59.220> has<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.370> save<00:03:59.640> that<00:03:59.820> Nexus<00:04:00.180> which<00:04:00.300> is

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
really has to save that Nexus which is

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.760 
really has to save that Nexus which is
taking<00:04:00.510> some<00:04:00.750> heavy<00:04:00.960> shield<00:04:01.260> damage<00:04:01.530> at<00:04:01.650> this

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
taking some heavy shield damage at this

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.650 
taking some heavy shield damage at this
point<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.280> think<00:04:02.550> that<00:04:02.880> this<00:04:03.060> was<00:04:03.270> some<00:04:03.420> kind<00:04:03.600> of

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
point I think that this was some kind of

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.630 
point I think that this was some kind of
you<00:04:03.780> know<00:04:03.810> Waypoint<00:04:04.290> damn<00:04:04.530> waypoint<00:04:05.250> mistake

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
you know Waypoint damn waypoint mistake

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.370 
you know Waypoint damn waypoint mistake
from<00:04:05.850> calc<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.240> guys<00:04:06.450> like<00:04:06.630> for<00:04:06.840> two<00:04:07.020> goons<00:04:07.200> in

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
from calc you guys like for two goons in

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.620 
from calc you guys like for two goons in
his<00:04:07.530> base<00:04:07.770> see<00:04:08.310> things<00:04:08.490> like<00:04:08.550> license<00:04:09.330> right

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
his base see things like license right

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.930 
his base see things like license right
now<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:10.020> doing<00:04:10.290> nothing<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.800> it<00:04:11.550> looks<00:04:11.730> yeah

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
now just doing nothing and it looks yeah

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.460 
now just doing nothing and it looks yeah
it<00:04:12.090> looks<00:04:12.270> like<00:04:12.330> he'll<00:04:12.570> be<00:04:12.780> able<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.990> push<00:04:13.290> this

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
it looks like he'll be able to push this

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.910 
it looks like he'll be able to push this
attack<00:04:13.800> back<00:04:14.070> so<00:04:15.080> this<00:04:16.080> game<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.410> just<00:04:16.440> back

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
attack back so this game is just back

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.520 
attack back so this game is just back
and<00:04:17.070> forth<00:04:17.130> i<00:04:17.460> would<00:04:17.580> say<00:04:18.109> non-smoking<00:04:19.109> both

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
and forth i would say non-smoking both

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.720 
and forth i would say non-smoking both
players<00:04:19.830> making<00:04:20.130> mistakes<00:04:20.580> cal<00:04:20.880> doing

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
players making mistakes cal doing

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.370 
players making mistakes cal doing
Cal<00:04:21.850> doing<00:04:22.060> some<00:04:22.270> really<00:04:22.450> nice<00:04:22.690> pincers

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
Cal doing some really nice pincers

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.710 
Cal doing some really nice pincers
around<00:04:23.790> so<00:04:26.310> yeah<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.580> think<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:28.180> position<00:04:28.600> is

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
around so yeah I think the position is

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.840 
around so yeah I think the position is
kind<00:04:29.080> of<00:04:29.140> equalize<00:04:29.650> now<00:04:29.980> but<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.430> know<00:04:30.550> as<00:04:30.700> you

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
kind of equalize now but you know as you

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.350 
kind of equalize now but you know as you
said<00:04:31.950> Cal<00:04:32.950> has<00:04:33.130> been<00:04:33.280> carrying<00:04:33.640> that<00:04:33.670> Nexus<00:04:34.150> up

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
said Cal has been carrying that Nexus up

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.300 
said Cal has been carrying that Nexus up
for<00:04:34.690> longer<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:35.260> have<00:04:35.650> an<00:04:35.830> economic

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
for longer you have an economic

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.370 
for longer you have an economic
advantage<00:04:36.940> at<00:04:37.060> this<00:04:37.150> point<00:04:37.450> so<00:04:38.050> he<00:04:38.230> will<00:04:38.350> be

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
advantage at this point so he will be

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.230 
advantage at this point so he will be
able<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:38.740> reboot<00:04:38.980> his<00:04:39.160> force<00:04:39.430> quicker<00:04:39.760> in

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
able to reboot his force quicker in

at<00:04:42.340> this<00:04:42.460> point<00:04:42.700> so<00:04:43.360> he<00:04:43.600> might<00:04:43.720> be<00:04:43.900> able<00:04:43.960> to

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
at this point so he might be able to

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.160 
at this point so he might be able to
