00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.550
 my name is and that you just do not have web and web 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.540
 It's only possible for you to produce the best oil like Hamilton 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.909
 the most popular one falls behind 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:11.909
 Gellings 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:14.949
 Benchmark general performance and the battery 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.599
 the processor 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.769
 at 800 megahertz, it was slightly smaller than it had 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.689
 better but that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.899
 that was just under 20 percent but that's why it immediately has percent 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.240
 less power 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.850
 No, that's not really there 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.760
 everything is not liquid 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.760
 UNAMA Controller Stockholm 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.970
 Ramallah so pressuring because they are such customer concerns 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.960
 but otherwise 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.960
 Everything is fine 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.780
 because I'm going to try a game and what more then 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 the same can not cut the games 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.650
 could not hold prototypes 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.630
 OK 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.490
 So an operation obviously also play fast through this 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.290
 and I form 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.310
 meanwhile, major British classic to pop with the right one 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 a mountain range that became 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.890
 Reinhildis dimensions can be around and the date of the hamas-functionary 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.180
 you take forms 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.180
 gux us-scientist shot 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.320
 Merkel 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.100
 Bridges Bring finished products then give the cash registers 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.290
 In any case, it sounds so much better that you can play well 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.470
 and catch up with his little benchmark whatever music was 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.859
 you have to repair as needed 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.069
 default 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.309
 why he? I'll go in there 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.309
 and sometimes it bursts 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.699
 now rank three b text as that can go 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.980
 one should soon forgive it as soon as it is finished we know exactly 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.969
 how many points he has 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:10.989
 now still doping percent one 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.709
 quadrant 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.129
 OK 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.129
 Another novelty is taken care of 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:20.749
 Warmth and shine 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:22.539
 below it is 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.969
 Motorola competes 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.969
 that would indeed see the VDMA worry here 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.649
 Miltenberg Bogner 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.909
 The Samsung Galaxy s occupies about 800 points 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:36.150
 that makes us dwell 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.109
 Picture SWR 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.609
 you have something nice women have Kristina Groves 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.519
 He did not associate with Hamilton 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.309
 Mamma Mia blamed therefore value is 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.899
 we also a box the Melt 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.909
 almost 3600 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.079
 Compper 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.089
 and so Frais was interested 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:58.469
 so they are very information 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:59.659
 century 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.619
 Warsaw is installed 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:03.359
 and 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.359
 currently the fewest artists where that is mine 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.950
 Barrett Umbra 7 protests and a presence and 806 megahertz quarters 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:16.149
 but that's how it's got to be crafted 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.799
 Munich 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.230
 where they are even more successful to the battery 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.800
 2 percent lower 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.039
 to become old 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.000
 On average we were the same that you find yourself through the pictures 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.659
 especially enduring or 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:35.169
 is not very good either 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.050
 so my purpose as worrying is currently there on 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.620
 which possibility on half 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.770
 under the wheels 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.129
 and to load every second day at Anton for every Cottbus 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.669
 I also have you just 3 times 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:50.819
 for days 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.819
 quite normal therefore some cell phone used 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.740
 Of course, that's not every episode, nothing great and that 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.599
 but also possible 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.580
 now come to the general 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.580
 wait for his time to wait 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.439
 now waited therefore is asked the last rank 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.699
 accompanied for a few weeks 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.919
 around 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.530
 the Finnish or they are now going to have to go Machule has to go 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.949
 because maybe very much to the Weser good I accompanied my everyday life 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.939
 Camera from Alpiq phone book from was 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:28.889
 All in all, good players 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.389
 played as well 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.849
 That's always an eye-catcher with the keyboard 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.579
 and it really did go well with me and accompanied my everyday life 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.600
 I thank you and you all looked like the tests or just 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.189
 but already ennobled 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:51.270
 and if already set a daytime tomorrow morning here after this one 

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:52.569
 Video is watching 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.210
 The association demands the same feeling 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.759
