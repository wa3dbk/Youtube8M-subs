sold out so well I got it the kid second
time<00:02:49.580> around<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:49.970> was<00:02:50.060> quite<00:02:50.209> lucky<00:02:50.570> you

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
time around and it was quite lucky you

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.860 
time around and it was quite lucky you
can<00:02:51.410> see<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:51.680> like<00:02:51.800> vacation<00:02:52.280> is<00:02:52.370> very<00:02:52.870> I

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
can see it's like vacation is very I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.350 
can see it's like vacation is very I
would<00:02:54.320> see<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:55.030> simplified<00:02:56.680> box<00:02:57.790> akin<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.820> Apple

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
would see a simplified box akin to Apple

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.880 
would see a simplified box akin to Apple
but<00:02:59.630> you<00:02:59.750> know<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.110> instead<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.620> white

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
but you know that instead of the white

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.510 
but you know that instead of the white
color<00:03:01.550> as<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.209> normal<00:03:02.840> brown<00:03:03.140> box<00:03:03.520> which

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
color as this normal brown box which

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.910 
color as this normal brown box which
showing<00:03:04.850> is<00:03:05.060> it's<00:03:05.510> this<00:03:06.110> fine<00:03:06.320> actually<00:03:06.530> let's

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
showing is it's this fine actually let's

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:16.260 
showing is it's this fine actually let's
open<00:03:07.130> up<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:12.260> here<00:03:12.530> we<00:03:12.560> have<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:13.040> phone

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.870 

so<00:03:16.870> regular<00:03:17.320> 1s<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:18.570> similar<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.750> rittany<00:03:20.880> as

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
so regular 1s is similar to rittany as

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.930 
so regular 1s is similar to rittany as
in<00:03:22.780> he<00:03:22.930> has<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.140> false<00:03:23.530> 4.7<00:03:24.400> inch<00:03:24.550> screen

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
in he has a false 4.7 inch screen

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.650 
in he has a false 4.7 inch screen
similar<00:03:25.810> control<00:03:26.470> similar<00:03:27.130> shape<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:28.450> only

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
similar control similar shape the only

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.690 
similar control similar shape the only
difference<00:03:29.110> is<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.650> becomes<00:03:30.340> evil

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
difference is that becomes evil

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.080 
difference is that becomes evil

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
extra memory those fluent self like you

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.150 
extra memory those fluent self like you
see<00:03:45.790> it's<00:03:46.200> everything's<00:03:47.200> covered<00:03:47.380> it's<00:03:47.770> it's

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
see it's everything's covered it's it's

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.730 
see it's everything's covered it's it's
packaged<00:03:48.520> quite<00:03:48.790> nicely<00:03:49.000> in<00:03:49.330> fact<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:49.840> think<00:03:50.260> I

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
packaged quite nicely in fact I think I

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.590 
packaged quite nicely in fact I think I
think<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.250> would<00:03:51.400> probably<00:03:51.850> survive<00:03:52.210> some

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
think it would probably survive some

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.100 
think it would probably survive some
tumble<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.200> pant<00:03:53.890> Dumbo<00:03:54.190> worshipping<00:03:54.640> and

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
tumble and pant Dumbo worshipping and

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.630 
tumble and pant Dumbo worshipping and
you<00:03:56.110> see<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.320> unless<00:03:57.100> itself<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:57.550> actually

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
you see a unless itself is actually

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.900 
you see a unless itself is actually
protected<00:03:57.940> by<00:03:58.330> this<00:03:58.510> plastic<00:03:59.520> so<00:04:00.520> let's<00:04:00.700> take

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
protected by this plastic so let's take

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.260 
protected by this plastic so let's take
it<00:04:01.060> off

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.770 

and<00:04:04.810> they

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.850 

so<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:11.180> thing<00:04:11.360> is<00:04:11.390> um<00:04:11.840> currently<00:04:12.770> in

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
so the thing is um currently in

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.460 
so the thing is um currently in
Singapore<00:04:13.250> it's<00:04:13.430> only<00:04:13.640> available<00:04:13.990> with<00:04:14.990> the

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
Singapore it's only available with the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.949 
Singapore it's only available with the
