00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
that's gonna be the best idea because

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.410 
that's gonna be the best idea because
know<00:03:12.500> sometimes<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.459> placed<00:03:13.880> up<00:03:14.060> too<00:03:14.269> much

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420

they'll<00:03:14.630> just<00:03:14.720> get<00:03:14.840> agitated<00:03:15.049> with<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.680> gleam

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
they'll just get agitated with the gleam

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.210 
they'll just get agitated with the gleam
and<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:16.310> lose<00:03:16.459> interest<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:17.329> and

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
and you lose interest in it and

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.440 
and you lose interest in it and
you<00:03:18.310> know<00:03:18.430> you'll<00:03:18.640> get<00:03:18.760> angry<00:03:19.270> or
