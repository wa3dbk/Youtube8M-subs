00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.919 

so<00:00:01.740> I'm<00:00:02.040> going<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.250> talk<00:00:02.460> about<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:03.030> French

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
so I'm going to talk about the French

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.670 
so I'm going to talk about the French
nymph<00:00:04.560> setup<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.509> the<00:00:06.509> most<00:00:06.690> important<00:00:07.290> fly

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
nymph setup and the most important fly

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.700 
nymph setup and the most important fly
on<00:00:08.069> most<00:00:08.490> heavyweight<00:00:08.910> nymph<00:00:09.150> rigs<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
on most heavyweight nymph rigs is the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.360 
on most heavyweight nymph rigs is the
pipe<00:00:10.950> fly<00:00:11.280> which<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.740> fly<00:00:13.740> which<00:00:13.980> fishes

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
pipe fly which is the fly which fishes

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.540 
pipe fly which is the fly which fishes
on<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.610> bottom<00:00:14.969> now<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.570> my<00:00:15.780> own

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
on the bottom now this is one of my own

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.109 
on the bottom now this is one of my own
special<00:00:17.550> tangs

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
special tangs

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.040 
special tangs
it's<00:00:18.420> called<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.840> Polly<00:00:19.080> fetus<00:00:19.590> and

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
it's called the Polly fetus and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.950 
it's called the Polly fetus and
basically<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.550> tungsten<00:00:23.550> bead<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.330> mounted<00:00:24.840> on

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
basically a tungsten bead is mounted on

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.950 
basically a tungsten bead is mounted on
a<00:00:24.990> pin<00:00:25.350> which<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.220> then<00:00:26.640> shaped<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> pair

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
a pin which is then shaped with a pair

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.580 
a pin which is then shaped with a pair
of<00:00:27.990> pliers<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:29.369> about<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> 45<00:00:30.269> degree<00:00:30.300> angle

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.900 

now<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.649> reason<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.579> makes<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
now the reason for that is it makes the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.530 
now the reason for that is it makes the
whole<00:00:36.329> point<00:00:37.250> point<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:38.940> we're<00:00:39.120> fishing

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
whole point point and when we're fishing

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.610 
whole point point and when we're fishing
limps<00:00:40.350> along<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.770> bottom<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.730> prevents

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
limps along the bottom this prevents

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.490 
limps along the bottom this prevents
certainly<00:00:43.620> lessens<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.090> degree<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.500> foul-ups

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
certainly lessens the degree of foul-ups

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.580 
certainly lessens the degree of foul-ups
or<00:00:47.300> accidentally<00:00:48.300> hooking<00:00:48.719> tree<00:00:49.050> branches

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
or accidentally hooking tree branches

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.049 
or accidentally hooking tree branches
etc<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.219> bottom<00:00:50.550> now<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:50.789> you're<00:00:50.940> doing

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
etc on the bottom now if you're doing

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.310 
etc on the bottom now if you're doing
these<00:00:51.270> techniques<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.930> you're<00:00:52.020> doing<00:00:52.199> them

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
these techniques and you're doing them

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.250 
these techniques and you're doing them
properly<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.430> should<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.760> doing<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
properly then you should be doing that

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.889 
properly then you should be doing that
every<00:00:55.260> stream<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.340> every<00:00:57.149> angler<00:00:57.420> will<00:00:57.690> have

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
every stream and every angler will have

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.529 
every stream and every angler will have
a<00:00:57.989> different<00:00:58.440> opinion<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:59.160> how<00:00:59.640> best<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
a different opinion of how best is to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.180 
a different opinion of how best is to
fish<00:01:00.719> these<00:01:00.930> weighted<00:01:01.410> flies<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.949> water

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
fish these weighted flies in water

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.670 
fish these weighted flies in water
you'll<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.030> some<00:01:03.690> anglers<00:01:03.989> prefer<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> more

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you'll see some anglers prefer a more

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.880 
you'll see some anglers prefer a more
across<00:01:05.519> approach<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.360> some<00:01:06.720> hurt

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
across approach and some hurt

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.770 
across approach and some hurt
fish<00:01:08.040> more<00:01:08.310> upstream<00:01:08.729> today<00:01:09.390> I'm<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> be

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
fish more upstream today I'm going to be

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.740 
fish more upstream today I'm going to be
fishing<00:01:10.020> predominantly<00:01:11.210> upstream<00:01:12.210> it's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
fishing predominantly upstream it's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.730 
fishing predominantly upstream it's
quite<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> small<00:01:13.470> stream<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:15.080> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.259> quieter

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
quite a small stream and in the quieter

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.289 
quite a small stream and in the quieter
areas<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> stream<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.790> not<00:01:17.939> really

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
areas of the stream that's not really

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.330 
areas of the stream that's not really
very<00:01:18.330> much<00:01:18.659> glow<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.140> only<00:01:19.350> right<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
very much glow it's only right in the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.679 
very much glow it's only right in the
heads<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> stream<00:01:21.180> where<00:01:21.360> we're<00:01:21.479> getting

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
heads of the stream where we're getting

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.289 
heads of the stream where we're getting
any<00:01:21.810> flow<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.259> river<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.590> very<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:23.100> low<00:01:23.299> I'll

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
any flow the river is very very low I'll

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.760 
any flow the river is very very low I'll
talk<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> little<00:01:24.810> bit<00:01:24.990> about<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.350> technique

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
talk a little bit about the technique

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.440 
talk a little bit about the technique
because<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.820> technique<00:01:27.240> that's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
because it's a technique that's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.100 
because it's a technique that's
surrounded<00:01:28.049> by<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.799> immense<00:01:29.130> amount<00:01:29.369> of

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
surrounded by an immense amount of

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.380 
surrounded by an immense amount of
mystery<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.770> all<00:01:31.920> new<00:01:32.520> techniques<00:01:33.090> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
mystery as with all new techniques and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.510 
mystery as with all new techniques and
there's<00:01:34.020> nothing<00:01:34.409> particularly<00:01:35.100> clever

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
there's nothing particularly clever

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.740 
there's nothing particularly clever
about<00:01:35.700> what<00:01:36.030> we're<00:01:36.180> doing<00:01:36.479> what<00:01:36.630> we're

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
about what we're doing what we're

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.380 
about what we're doing what we're
actually<00:01:36.869> doing<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.770> controlling<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:39.090> depth

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
actually doing is controlling the depth

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.160 
actually doing is controlling the depth

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
using a long long rod this is a 10 foot

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.080 
using a long long rod this is a 10 foot
rod<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.040> very<00:01:47.250> light<00:01:47.520> rod<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:47.880> only

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
a 2 to 3 way this is a very very tactile

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.070 
a 2 to 3 way this is a very very tactile
method<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.259> we

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
method so we

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.560 
method so we
should<00:01:53.230> be<00:01:53.410> feeling<00:01:53.980> as<00:01:54.370> well<00:01:54.670> as<00:01:54.820> visually

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
should be feeling as well as visually

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.630 
should be feeling as well as visually
seeing<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:56.080> tapes<00:01:56.380> now<00:01:57.070> I've<00:01:57.220> just<00:01:57.400> tied<00:01:57.610> that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
seeing the tapes now I've just tied that

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.180 
seeing the tapes now I've just tied that
dry<00:01:58.090> fly<00:01:58.390> on<00:01:58.570> there<00:01:59.470> for<00:01:59.620> the<00:01:59.710> sake<00:01:59.920> of<00:01:59.950> the

of<00:02:14.710> tide<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.700> will<00:02:15.820> indicate<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.420> me<00:02:16.570> that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
a while to get control very good but
