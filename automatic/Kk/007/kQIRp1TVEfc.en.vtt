00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
for example it talks about measuring the

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.260 
for example it talks about measuring the
amount<00:01:40.870> of<00:01:40.960> end<00:01:41.200> plate<00:01:41.470> second<00:01:42.040> gear<00:01:42.340> remember

amount of end plate second gear remember

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.700 
amount of end plate second gear remember
is<00:01:43.360> supposed<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.780> be<00:01:43.930> between<00:01:44.230> three<00:01:44.680> and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
is supposed to be between three and

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.350 
is supposed to be between three and
eight<00:01:44.950> thousands<00:01:45.640> if<00:01:45.820> there's<00:01:46.060> more<00:01:46.300> than

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
eight thousands if there's more than

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.420 
eight thousands if there's more than
eight<00:01:46.780> you'll<00:01:47.200> get<00:01:47.440> a<00:01:47.470> clunking<00:01:47.980> noise<00:01:48.160> when

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
eight you'll get a clunking noise when

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.340 
eight you'll get a clunking noise when
the<00:01:48.520> car<00:01:48.730> is<00:01:48.880> being<00:01:49.090> driven<00:01:49.390> in<00:01:49.660> second<00:01:50.050> gear

the car is being driven in second gear

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.470 
the car is being driven in second gear
so<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.340> gives<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.670> lot<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.030> details

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
so it gives you a lot of the details

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.000 
so it gives you a lot of the details
that<00:01:52.630> you<00:01:52.690> just<00:01:52.960> don't<00:01:53.200> get<00:01:53.380> in<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.650> service

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
that you just don't get in the service

which goes on the outside of the

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.370 
which goes on the outside of the
firewall<00:04:36.550> coming<00:04:37.479> through<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.900> firewall

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
firewall coming through the firewall

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.379 
firewall coming through the firewall
then<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:39.009> have<00:04:39.220> this<00:04:39.400> rubber<00:04:39.699> trim<00:04:40.120> piece

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
then you have this rubber trim piece

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.379 
then you have this rubber trim piece
that<00:04:40.599> goes<00:04:40.750> up<00:04:40.960> against<00:04:41.409> the<00:04:41.770> dash<00:04:42.699> pad<00:04:43.090> and

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
that goes up against the dash pad and

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.870 
that goes up against the dash pad and
then<00:04:44.050> there's<00:04:44.289> a<00:04:44.349> spring<00:04:44.800> which<00:04:45.250> causes<00:04:45.699> it<00:04:45.849> to

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
then there's a spring which causes it to

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.279 
then there's a spring which causes it to
reach

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
reach

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.589 
reach
turn<00:04:46.439> and<00:04:46.770> then<00:04:47.430> finally<00:04:47.939> on<00:04:48.059> the<00:04:48.180> end<00:04:48.389> is<00:04:48.569> a

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
turn and then finally on the end is a

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.600 
turn and then finally on the end is a
cap<00:04:48.930> which<00:04:49.379> is<00:04:49.409> covered<00:04:49.860> by<00:04:50.009> another<00:04:50.249> rubber

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
cap well when this is put together in

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.429 
cap well when this is put together in
the<00:04:52.919> factory<00:04:53.430> it's<00:04:53.909> put<00:04:54.509> into<00:04:54.779> some<00:04:54.990> kind<00:04:55.259> of<00:04:55.349> a

the factory it's put into some kind of a

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.010 
the factory it's put into some kind of a
press<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.129> everything<00:04:56.729> is<00:04:56.909> matched<00:04:57.419> over<00:04:57.869> on

press and everything is matched over on
the<00:04:58.169> end<00:04:58.409> so<00:04:58.889> that<00:04:59.039> it<00:04:59.129> won't<00:04:59.309> come<00:04:59.490> apart<00:04:59.969> and

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
the end so that it won't come apart and

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.299 
the end so that it won't come apart and
there's<00:05:00.360> no<00:05:00.509> way<00:05:00.659> to<00:05:00.719> unscrew<00:05:01.379> it<00:05:01.409> so<00:05:02.129> what<00:05:02.279> I

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:02.309 
there's no way to unscrew it so what I

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:04.939 
there's no way to unscrew it so what I
had<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.699> do<00:05:02.849> is<00:05:03.029> take<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> die<00:05:03.539> grinder<00:05:03.839> and<00:05:04.289> cut

had to do is take a die grinder and cut
out<00:05:05.129> this<00:05:05.580> part<00:05:06.180> that<00:05:06.509> is<00:05:06.659> pressed<00:05:06.960> on<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:07.349> end

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:07.529 
out this part that is pressed on the end

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.040 
out this part that is pressed on the end
which<00:05:08.339> caused<00:05:08.699> this<00:05:08.939> to<00:05:09.149> come<00:05:09.330> apart<00:05:09.659> and<00:05:09.960> then

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
which caused this to come apart and then

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.859 
which caused this to come apart and then
everything<00:05:10.499> came<00:05:10.740> apart<00:05:11.069> easily<00:05:11.629> let<00:05:12.629> me<00:05:12.719> show

quarter-inch<00:05:42.389> felt<00:05:43.009> industrial<00:05:44.009> felt<00:05:44.330> so<00:05:45.330> you

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
quarter-inch felt industrial felt so you

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.869 
quarter-inch felt industrial felt so you
have<00:05:45.719> that<00:05:45.990> much<00:05:46.199> of<00:05:46.229> it<00:05:46.559> and<00:05:46.889> then<00:05:47.430> following

have that much of it and then following

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.999 
have that much of it and then following
that<00:05:48.180> comes<00:05:48.689> the<00:05:48.930> bracket<00:05:49.409> that<00:05:49.529> goes<00:05:49.589> through

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
that comes the bracket that goes through

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:56.469 
that comes the bracket that goes through
the<00:05:50.099> firewall<00:05:53.779> on<00:05:54.779> top<00:05:55.110> of<00:05:55.289> that<00:05:55.499> is<00:05:55.740> the

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
the firewall on top of that is the

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.480 
the firewall on top of that is the
rubber<00:05:57.479> gasket<00:05:58.139> which<00:05:58.439> keeps<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.949> water<00:05:59.159> from

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
rubber gasket which keeps the water from

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.709 
rubber gasket which keeps the water from
coming<00:05:59.519> into<00:05:59.909> the<00:06:00.089> passenger<00:06:00.569> compartment

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
coming into the passenger compartment

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.899 
coming into the passenger compartment
where<00:06:01.289> this<00:06:01.439> goes<00:06:01.680> through<00:06:01.949> the<00:06:02.009> firewall<00:06:02.519> and

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
where this goes through the firewall and

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.850 
where this goes through the firewall and
it<00:06:03.629> presses<00:06:03.899> over<00:06:04.529> this<00:06:05.370> like<00:06:05.759> this<00:06:06.709> there<00:06:07.709> you

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
it presses over this like this there you

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.749 
it presses over this like this there you
have<00:06:08.069> it<00:06:08.219> right<00:06:08.249> there<00:06:09.229> and<00:06:10.229> then<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:11.699> spring

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 
have it right there and then the spring

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:21.379 
have it right there and then the spring
the<00:06:14.759> rubber<00:06:14.999> trim<00:06:15.330> gasket<00:06:18.379> and<00:06:19.819> then<00:06:20.819> finally

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
the rubber trim gasket and then finally

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.139 
the rubber trim gasket and then finally
the<00:06:22.110> washer<00:06:22.559> which<00:06:22.740> I<00:06:22.889> hit<00:06:23.069> ground<00:06:23.669> up<00:06:23.939> at<00:06:24.089> the
