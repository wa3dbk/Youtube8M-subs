a<00:00:25.869> good<00:00:26.680> start<00:00:27.360> being<00:00:28.360> fast<00:00:28.630> and<00:00:28.779> safe<00:00:28.990> yes

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
a good start being fast and safe yes

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.590 
a good start being fast and safe yes
starts<00:00:31.840> are<00:00:31.990> quite<00:00:32.830> tricky<00:00:33.070> but<00:00:33.430> um<00:00:33.610> it's<00:00:34.300> it's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
starts are quite tricky but um it's it's

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.229 
starts are quite tricky but um it's it's
always<00:00:35.019> just<00:00:35.290> finding<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:35.920> right<00:00:36.879> amount<00:00:37.150> of

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
always just finding the right amount of

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.320 
always just finding the right amount of
gas<00:00:37.420> with<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.930> with<00:00:38.379> the<00:00:38.410> clutch<00:00:38.800> and<00:00:39.330> being

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
gas with the with the clutch and being

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.140 
gas with the with the clutch and being
being<00:00:40.839> as<00:00:41.019> smooth<00:00:41.260> as<00:00:41.440> possible<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:42.150> always

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
being as smooth as possible and always

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.259 
being as smooth as possible and always
always<00:00:43.449> staying<00:00:43.839> in<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:44.019> straight<00:00:44.260> line<00:00:44.290> and

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
always staying in a straight line and

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.939 
always staying in a straight line and
the<00:00:46.269> smoother<00:00:46.690> you<00:00:46.839> can<00:00:47.019> be<00:00:47.170> with<00:00:47.409> with<00:00:47.710> both

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
the smoother you can be with with both

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.530 
the smoother you can be with with both
the<00:00:48.129> throttle<00:00:48.460> and<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.580> gas<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:49.089> better<00:00:49.269> and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
the throttle and the gas the better and

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.990 
the throttle and the gas the better and
and<00:00:49.750> then<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.650> more<00:00:50.860> you<00:00:51.010> can<00:00:51.220> more<00:00:51.850> you

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
and then the the more you can more you

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.520 
and then the the more you can more you
can<00:00:52.150> let<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.449> clutch<00:00:52.659> out<00:00:52.839> with<00:00:53.049> with<00:00:53.379> the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
can let the clutch out with with the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.079 
can let the clutch out with with the
more<00:00:53.739> amount<00:00:53.920> of<00:00:54.070> gas<00:00:54.250> if<00:00:54.729> you<00:00:54.820> were<00:00:54.940> not

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
more amount of gas if you were not

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.359 
more amount of gas if you were not
smooth<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.750> maybe<00:00:56.140> sometimes<00:00:56.680> wheelie<00:00:57.129> or

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:57.369 
smooth and maybe sometimes wheelie or

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.240 
smooth and maybe sometimes wheelie or
jerk<00:00:57.970> and<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:59.530> know<00:00:59.559> it's<00:00:59.799> not<00:00:59.890> so<00:01:00.100> good

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
jerk and and you know it's not so good

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.420 
jerk and and you know it's not so good
for<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.460> time<00:01:00.729> for<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.690> start<00:01:01.900> but<00:01:02.199> if<00:01:02.559> always

to<00:01:06.010> just<00:01:06.310> being<00:01:06.490> smooth<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.320> always<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.890> know

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
to just being smooth and always you know

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.240 
to just being smooth and always you know
riding<00:01:09.729> in<00:01:09.850> your<00:01:10.330> limits<00:01:10.689> for<00:01:10.869> sure<00:01:11.080> but<00:01:11.470> being
