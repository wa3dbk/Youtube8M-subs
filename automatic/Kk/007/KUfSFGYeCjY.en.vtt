00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.220
 do you have 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.150
 hello friends how are you I hope that super 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.040
 well I feel great and super 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.950
 excited about this recipe because in 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.650
 reality is very rich and I have a lot 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.980
 time wanting to share with you 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.140
 it's a one day recipe that you can 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.840
 use it also as a dressing but to me in 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.790
 Personally I love using it as 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.430
 example snack you want during the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.829
 something healthy day that has no fat 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.739
 Well, if you have fat but it is fat 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.290
 good low in fat and at the same time it is 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.470
 an excellent day to accompany your 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.090
 favorite vegetables for example this here 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:54.240
 I have carrot celery jicama and cucumber and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.480
 this is going to help you eat more of them 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.850
 then ready that you are going to need 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:05.339
 We are going to use 2 tablespoons of tahini 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.829
 and tajÃ­n and it's like butter type of 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.689
 sesame seed then if not 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.360
 you find tahini you can use too 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.670
 sesame seed and I knew as average 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.010
 our sesame seed paste 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.710
 next ingredient is going to be a 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.630
 peeled pumpkin and zucchini is 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.410
 excellent because it helps a lot to your 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.330
 digestion 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.240
 apart that is going to make our 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.750
 dressing is bigger let's use 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.450
 the juice of a lemon a little parsley 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.670
 to give it a little chive flavor you can 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.270
 use another type of onion and remember that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.090
 the onion is super detoxifying 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.869
 we are also going to use a celery bandage 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.030
 and the lip is going to give that flavor 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.940
 salty to our dip we will use 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.880
 a little cayenne powder and also 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.030
 let's use a little cumin and also 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.729
 if you have celery salt on hand what 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.729
 you can use but it is not necessary 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:48.170
 is ready smells delicious with a lot 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:52.000
 taste to see what is mantle that a radish 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.000
 I love radish 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.060
 very rich, I hope that 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.370
 try all you are super rich and also 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.800
 they can use it as a dressing and it is 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.260
 a very very rich way to eat more 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.240

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.940
