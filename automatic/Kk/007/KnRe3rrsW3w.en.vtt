today with oshika hi there and we're
going<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.030> build<00:00:15.240> some<00:00:15.480> mining<00:00:15.900> Turtles<00:00:16.230> today

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
going to build some mining Turtles today

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.010 
going to build some mining Turtles today
and<00:00:16.770> we're<00:00:17.160> also<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.000> learn<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.449> basics

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
and we're also going to learn the basics

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.070 
and we're also going to learn the basics
of<00:00:19.109> mining<00:00:19.439> turtle<00:00:19.820> we're<00:00:20.820> going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.330> dig<00:00:21.869> some

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
of mining turtle we're going to dig some

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.120 
of mining turtle we're going to dig some
tunnels<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:23.220> basic<00:00:23.789> quarry<00:00:24.350> ok<00:00:25.350> Oscar<00:00:25.680> so

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
tunnels and a basic quarry ok Oscar so

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.009 
tunnels and a basic quarry ok Oscar so
can<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.460> please<00:00:26.699> explain<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.359> recipe<00:00:27.810> yeah

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
can you please explain the recipe yeah

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.880 
can you please explain the recipe yeah
sure<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:29.420> we<00:00:30.420> want<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.779> build<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.080> mining<00:00:31.500> turtle

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
sure so we want to build a mining turtle

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.770 
sure so we want to build a mining turtle
but<00:00:32.070> before<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.669> actually<00:00:32.850> build<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
but before you can actually build one of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.889 
but before you can actually build one of
those<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.730> build<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.120> normal<00:00:36.660> turtle

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
those you have to build a normal turtle

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.490 
those you have to build a normal turtle
first<00:00:37.410> which<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.520> by<00:00:38.730> using<00:00:39.600> 8<00:00:40.110> iron

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
first which you do by using 8 iron

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.200 
first which you do by using 8 iron
ingots<00:00:41.960> one<00:00:42.960> that's<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.860> me<00:00:44.120> sorry

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
ingots one that's just to me sorry

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.170 
ingots one that's just to me sorry
that's<00:00:45.899> seven<00:00:46.289> actually<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.860> lot<00:00:47.340> seven<00:00:48.000> in

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that's seven actually a lot seven in

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.350 
that's seven actually a lot seven in
good<00:00:48.570> point<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:50.010> computer<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.180> showed

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
good point and a computer and we showed

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.000 
good point and a computer and we showed
you<00:00:51.539> how<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.719> build<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.110> computer<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> last

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
you how to build a computer in the last

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.430 
you how to build a computer in the last
tutorial<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:55.039> I'm<00:00:56.039> right<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:58.050> build<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
tutorial and I'm right here to build the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.920 
tutorial and I'm right here to build the
mining<00:00:58.800> turtle<00:00:59.190> you<00:01:00.000> use<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.449> turtle<00:01:00.809> you've

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
mining turtle you use the turtle you've

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.950 
mining turtle you use the turtle you've
just<00:01:01.230> built<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:02.579> pickaxe<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.600> could<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
just built and a pickaxe this could be a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.109 
just built and a pickaxe this could be a
diamond<00:01:04.199> pickaxe<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.010> believe<00:01:05.309> also<00:01:05.700> an

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
diamond pickaxe or I believe also an

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.410 
diamond pickaxe or I believe also an
iron<00:01:06.780> pickaxe<00:01:07.080> or<00:01:07.470> whatever<00:01:08.189> type<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> pickaxe

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
iron pickaxe or whatever type of pickaxe

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.690 
iron pickaxe or whatever type of pickaxe
you<00:01:09.570> want

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
you want

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.590 
you want
okay<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.560> pokers<00:01:13.560> already<00:01:13.920> has<00:01:14.040> one<00:01:14.280> okay<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.330> I

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
okay so pokers already has one okay so I

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.740 
okay so pokers already has one okay so I
have<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> mining<00:01:17.090> turtle<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.150> my<00:01:18.240> hand<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
have a mining turtle in my hand here and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840 
have a mining turtle in my hand here and
what<00:01:19.619> we're<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.340> we're<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.580> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.550 
what we're going to do is we're going to
drill<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> hole<00:01:21.960> through<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.650> hill<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> built

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
drill a hole through this hill I built

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.940 
drill a hole through this hill I built
so<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.890> place<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.130> down<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:27.770> here's<00:01:28.770> some

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
so just place it down and here's some

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.210 
so just place it down and here's some
really<00:01:29.220> basic<00:01:29.640> coding<00:01:30.860> we're<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
really basic coding we're here in the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.200 
really basic coding we're here in the
tunnel<00:01:32.490> OS<00:01:33.470> programming<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.210> language

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
tunnel OS programming and the language

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.140 
tunnel OS programming and the language
we<00:01:36.299> were<00:01:36.420> using<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.930> Lua<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.579> type<00:01:38.759> tunnel

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
we were using is Lua so just type tunnel

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.149 
we were using is Lua so just type tunnel
and<00:01:40.549> then<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.869> build<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.439> 2x3

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and then it's going to build a 2x3

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.069 
and then it's going to build a 2x3
tunnel<00:01:45.409> straightforward<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:48.659> second

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
tunnel straightforward and the second

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.170 
tunnel straightforward and the second
thing<00:01:49.170> we're<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> add<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.100> length<00:01:50.909> of

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
thing we're going to add is length of

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.630 
thing we're going to add is length of
the<00:01:51.270> tunnel<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:52.500> tunnel<00:01:52.530> length<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.460> this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the tunnel the tunnel length is in this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.289 
the tunnel the tunnel length is in this
case<00:01:53.880> four<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.250> type<00:01:56.369> tunnel<00:01:56.759> 4<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
case four so just type tunnel 4 and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.190 
case four so just type tunnel 4 and
press<00:01:58.140> ENTER<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:59.640> tunneling<00:02:00.140> okay<00:02:01.140> so

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
press ENTER and it's tunneling okay so

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080 
press ENTER and it's tunneling okay so
it's<00:02:01.500> doing<00:02:01.740> some<00:02:01.950> weird<00:02:02.159> moves<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.640> first<00:02:02.909> but

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
it's doing some weird moves at first but

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.990 
it's doing some weird moves at first but
then<00:02:03.270> you'll<00:02:03.509> see<00:02:04.189> it's<00:02:05.189> actually<00:02:05.399> starting

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
then you'll see it's actually starting

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.139 
then you'll see it's actually starting
to<00:02:06.119> dig<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.479> tunnel<00:02:06.810> well<00:02:07.970> it's<00:02:08.970> really

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
to dig the tunnel well it's really

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.420 
to dig the tunnel well it's really
beautiful<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.780> look<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.140> isn't<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.470> yes<00:02:11.009> this

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
beautiful to look at isn't it yes this

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.980 
beautiful to look at isn't it yes this
is<00:02:11.640> fun<00:02:11.940> it's

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
is fun it's

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.520 
is fun it's
not<00:02:13.110> doing<00:02:13.410> really<00:02:14.750> really<00:02:15.750> much<00:02:15.990> butts<00:02:16.320> just

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
not doing really really much butts just

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.890 
not doing really really much butts just
so<00:02:17.160> fun<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.460> watch<00:02:17.670> for<00:02:18.000> lazy<00:02:18.180> people<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.720> well

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
so fun to watch for lazy people as well

quarry<00:02:38.360> it's<00:02:39.360> also<00:02:39.600> done<00:02:39.960> by<00:02:39.990> using<00:02:40.410> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
quarry it's also done by using the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.390 
quarry it's also done by using the
mining<00:02:40.920> turtle<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.430> just<00:02:41.640> place<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.120> down<00:02:42.270> and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
mining turtle to just place it down and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.110 
mining turtle to just place it down and
enter<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.760> oh<00:02:45.300> s<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.950> just<00:02:46.950> type<00:02:47.130> excavate

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
enter the oh s and just type excavate

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.950 
enter the oh s and just type excavate
and<00:02:49.490> then<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.610> diameter<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.120> your<00:02:51.270> quarry<00:02:51.630> so

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
and then the diameter of your quarry so

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.170 
and then the diameter of your quarry so
that's<00:02:52.200> just<00:02:52.440> for<00:02:53.010> example<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.490> three<00:02:54.000> and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
that's just for example do three and

five<00:04:27.210> in<00:04:27.420> Banaras<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.930> 12<00:04:28.200> so<00:04:28.470> it's<00:04:28.950> just

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
five in Banaras a 12 so it's just

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.910 
five in Banaras a 12 so it's just
gathered<00:04:29.580> it<00:04:29.730> for<00:04:29.910> you<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.180> 27<00:04:30.990> dirts<00:04:31.230> 29

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
gathered it for you and 27 dirts 29

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.330 
gathered it for you and 27 dirts 29
cobble<00:04:32.310> so<00:04:32.880> it's<00:04:33.090> actually<00:04:33.590> refueling<00:04:34.590> itself

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
cobble so it's actually refueling itself

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.760 
cobble so it's actually refueling itself
well<00:04:35.550> digging<00:04:36.200> yeah<00:04:37.200> so<00:04:37.440> that's<00:04:37.620> really

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
well digging yeah so that's really

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.640 
well digging yeah so that's really
convenient<00:04:38.160> if<00:04:38.430> you're<00:04:38.670> lucky<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.660> well

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
convenient if you're lucky that is well

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.790 
convenient if you're lucky that is well
our<00:04:40.740> calls<00:04:41.040> pretty<00:04:41.460> common<00:04:42.320> it's<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.440> common

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
our calls pretty common it's a common

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.350 
our calls pretty common it's a common
research<00:04:44.340> right<00:04:45.560> so<00:04:46.560> when<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.280> chest<00:04:47.730> is<00:04:47.880> full

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
research right so when the chest is full

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.200 
research right so when the chest is full
it'll<00:04:49.290> just<00:04:49.590> spit<00:04:49.980> out<00:04:50.010> all<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.520> resources<00:04:50.790> it

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
it'll just spit out all the resources it

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.040 
it'll just spit out all the resources it
gathered<00:04:51.540> but<00:04:52.290> in<00:04:52.680> later<00:04:53.450> tutorials<00:04:54.450> we'll

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
gathered but in later tutorials we'll

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.490 
gathered but in later tutorials we'll
just<00:04:55.760> will<00:04:56.760> let<00:04:56.910> it<00:04:57.030> come<00:04:57.180> up<00:04:57.390> put<00:04:58.200> all<00:04:58.380> its

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
just will let it come up put all its

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.410 
just will let it come up put all its
items<00:04:58.830> into<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.130> chest<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.610> go<00:04:59.880> down<00:05:00.120> again

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
items into the chest and go down again

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.710 
items into the chest and go down again
and<00:05:01.160> continue<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.310> and<00:05:02.460> continue<00:05:02.850> that<00:05:03.030> so

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
and continue that and continue that so

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.840 
and continue that and continue that so
it<00:05:04.020> can<00:05:04.260> be<00:05:04.440> really<00:05:04.710> efficient<00:05:05.130> by<00:05:05.280> for

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
it can be really efficient by for

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.260 
it can be really efficient by for
example<00:05:05.970> putting<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.720> 64<00:05:07.350> by<00:05:07.470> 64<00:05:07.970> so<00:05:08.970> that's<00:05:09.180> a

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
example putting a 64 by 64 so that's a

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.800 
example putting a 64 by 64 so that's a
64<00:05:09.750> diameter<00:05:10.230> it<00:05:11.130> will<00:05:11.370> tell<00:05:11.760> quite<00:05:12.270> some<00:05:12.570> time

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
64 diameter it will tell quite some time

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.530 
64 diameter it will tell quite some time
though<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.050> get<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:14.460> will<00:05:14.730> it<00:05:14.940> will<00:05:15.060> level

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
though to get to it will it will level

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.160 
though to get to it will it will level
but<00:05:15.860> yeah<00:05:16.860> yeah<00:05:17.100> but<00:05:17.310> we'll<00:05:17.550> just<00:05:17.790> uh<00:05:18.170> just

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
but yeah yeah but we'll just uh just

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.460 
but yeah yeah but we'll just uh just
place<00:05:19.920> down<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.580> go<00:05:21.510> something<00:05:21.990> go<00:05:22.290> eat

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
place down and go something go eat

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.890 
place down and go something go eat
