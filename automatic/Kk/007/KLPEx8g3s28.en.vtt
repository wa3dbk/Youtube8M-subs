and<00:00:03.870> what<00:00:04.870> I<00:00:04.900> do<00:00:05.050> is<00:00:05.380> the<00:00:05.620> swarm<00:00:05.980> is<00:00:06.220> looking

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:06.610 
and what I do is the swarm is looking

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.810 
and what I do is the swarm is looking
for<00:00:06.880> a<00:00:06.910> dark<00:00:07.420> protected<00:00:08.230> place<00:00:08.560> so<00:00:09.340> if<00:00:09.460> you<00:00:09.610> see

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
for a dark protected place so if you see

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.520 
for a dark protected place so if you see
there's<00:00:10.060> a<00:00:10.120> straw<00:00:10.480> scape<00:00:10.840> under<00:00:11.170> here<00:00:11.320> let<00:00:11.470> me

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
there's a straw scape under here let me

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:20.909 
there's a straw scape under here let me
check<00:00:11.710> this<00:00:11.860> out<00:00:18.749> so<00:00:19.749> this<00:00:19.960> is<00:00:20.019> a<00:00:20.169> straw<00:00:20.560> scape

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
check this out so this is a straw scape

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.550 
check this out so this is a straw scape
beautiful

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
beautiful

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.220 
beautiful
now<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.490> put<00:00:23.700> another<00:00:24.000> one<00:00:24.270> on<00:00:24.300> but<00:00:24.930> with

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
now we put another one on but with

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.290 
now we put another one on but with
winter<00:00:25.470> coming<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:26.130> I'm<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.730> leave<00:00:27.060> this

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
winter coming on I'm going to leave this

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.850 
winter coming on I'm going to leave this
because<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.900> would<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.200> too<00:00:28.380> much<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.770> a

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
because that would be too much of a

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.880 
because that would be too much of a
disturbance<00:00:29.310> now<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.240> them<00:00:30.450> and<00:00:30.750> they<00:00:31.410> need<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
disturbance now to them and they need to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.550 
disturbance now to them and they need to
settle<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.400> for<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.669> winter<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.420> they<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
settle in for the winter so they have to

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.090 
settle in for the winter so they have to
consolidate<00:00:35.310> everything<00:00:35.540> and<00:00:36.830> go<00:00:37.830> through

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
consolidate everything and go through

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
consolidate everything and go through
the<00:00:38.250> winter<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.580> then<00:00:38.850> next<00:00:39.180> year<00:00:39.570> will

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the winter and then next year will

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.740 
the winter and then next year will
reconfigure<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.040> things<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.300> how<00:00:42.510> that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
reconfigure the things and see how that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.020 
reconfigure the things and see how that
goes

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
goes

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.580 
goes
how<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.360> test<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.080> real<00:00:46.590> night

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590

if I had the capacity I would make a

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.079 
if I had the capacity I would make a
sanctuary<00:00:54.039> for<00:00:54.489> the

the messenger nature sends them to us to

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.320 
the messenger nature sends them to us to
say

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
say

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.860 
say
that<00:01:04.990> you're<00:01:05.290> not<00:01:05.440> doing<00:01:05.710> things<00:01:06.130> properly

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
that you're not doing things properly

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.590 
that you're not doing things properly
that<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:08.680> hall<00:01:09.070> might<00:01:09.370> is<00:01:09.610> one<00:01:10.060> of<00:01:10.210> nature's

that the hall might is one of nature's

I<00:01:16.080> think<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.230> mite<00:01:17.550> infestation<00:01:18.550> is<00:01:18.850> an

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
I think the mite infestation is an

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.560 
I think the mite infestation is an
example<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:20.680> nature's<00:01:21.220> reaction<00:01:22.000> to<00:01:22.210> our

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
example of nature's reaction to our

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.240 
example of nature's reaction to our
unenlightened<00:01:24.390> relationship

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
unenlightened relationship

my<00:01:27.250> wife<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.700> attended<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.300> lecture<00:01:28.780> of<00:01:29.050> a

my wife and I attended the lecture of a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.190 
my wife and I attended the lecture of a
winter<00:01:29.920> ago<00:01:32.280> where<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.910> fellow<00:01:34.150> argued<00:01:34.780> that

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
winter ago where the fellow argued that

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.969 
winter ago where the fellow argued that
lack<00:01:36.190> of<00:01:36.400> sustainability<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.530> karmic

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
lack of sustainability is the karmic

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.310 
lack of sustainability is the karmic
consequence<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:42.000> immoral<00:01:43.000> relationship<00:01:43.330> to

that<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.229> fact<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.280> garden<00:01:47.759> won't

not<00:01:51.390> survive<00:01:52.430> it's<00:01:53.430> an<00:01:53.670> indication<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.539> your

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
not survive it's an indication that your

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.770 
not survive it's an indication that your

okay listen it's interesting there was a
study<00:02:32.400> done<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:33.030> an<00:02:33.330> island<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.020> Baltic

they took could land strong hives and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.200 
they took could land strong hives and
put<00:02:43.380> them<00:02:43.560> on<00:02:43.710> this<00:02:43.890> isolated<00:02:44.520> island<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.060> was

put them on this isolated island it was
a<00:02:45.240> big<00:02:45.510> island<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.170> had<00:02:46.380> enough<00:02:46.740> flowers

so<00:02:52.830> they<00:02:53.040> put<00:02:53.310> DeLange<00:02:53.670> straw<00:02:53.940> hives<00:02:54.270> on<00:02:54.510> this

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
so they put DeLange straw hives on this

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.740 
so they put DeLange straw hives on this
island<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.380> they<00:02:56.130> deliberately<00:02:56.750> inoculated

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
island and they deliberately inoculated

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.960 
island and they deliberately inoculated
them<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.200> varroa<00:02:58.620> mites<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.280> think<00:02:59.640> somewhere

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
them with varroa mites I think somewhere

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.630 
them with varroa mites I think somewhere
between<00:03:00.180> 35<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:00.990> 70<00:03:01.800> mites<00:03:02.070> were<00:03:02.280> put<00:03:02.520> in

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
between 35 and 70 mites were put in

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.930 
between 35 and 70 mites were put in
every<00:03:03.030> eye<00:03:03.060> okay<00:03:04.310> then<00:03:05.310> they<00:03:05.490> walked<00:03:05.760> away

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
every eye okay then they walked away

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.020 
every eye okay then they walked away
from<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.720> they<00:03:07.110> said<00:03:07.380> it's<00:03:08.250> yours<00:03:08.520> we'll

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
from it and they said it's yours we'll

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.390 
from it and they said it's yours we'll
be<00:03:09.180> back<00:03:09.390> at<00:03:09.570> swarm<00:03:09.840> season<00:03:10.320> -<00:03:10.440> hi<00:03:10.620> pier<00:03:10.920> swarms

in<00:03:16.700> three<00:03:17.150> years<00:03:18.220> 75%<00:03:19.220> of<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.370> highest<00:03:19.730> we<00:03:19.849> did

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
in three years 75% of the highest we did

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.119 
in three years 75% of the highest we did
from<00:03:21.049> floral<00:03:21.470> amah<00:03:21.830> okay<00:03:22.420> in<00:03:23.420> five<00:03:23.930> years<00:03:24.440> the

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
from floral amah okay in five years the

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.800 
from floral amah okay in five years the
mortality<00:03:25.940> rate<00:03:26.540> dropped<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.170> 15%<00:03:28.129> that<00:03:28.819> in

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
mortality rate dropped to 15% that in

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.289 
mortality rate dropped to 15% that in
fact<00:03:30.080> after<00:03:30.440> five<00:03:30.920> years<00:03:30.950> what<00:03:31.549> happened<00:03:32.030> was

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
fact after five years what happened was

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.399 
fact after five years what happened was
a<00:03:32.629> kind<00:03:33.620> of<00:03:33.739> equilibrium<00:03:33.980> established<00:03:35.409> so

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
a kind of equilibrium established so

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:37.839 
a kind of equilibrium established so
that<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.799> mind<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.370> bee<00:03:37.519> population

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
that the mind and the bee population

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.190 
that the mind and the bee population
worked<00:03:38.810> out<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.409> sustainable<00:03:40.370> program<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:41.239> the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
worked out a sustainable program and the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.580 
worked out a sustainable program and the
bees<00:03:42.440> changed<00:03:43.159> and<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.579> mites<00:03:43.849> changed<00:03:44.590> until

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
bees changed and the mites changed until

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.880 
bees changed and the mites changed until
they<00:03:45.980> developed<00:03:46.519> this<00:03:46.700> issue<00:03:47.360> of

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
they developed this issue of

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.430 
they developed this issue of
sustainability

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
sustainability

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.760 
sustainability
now<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.040> problem<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:51.940> we<00:03:52.540> with<00:03:53.200> our<00:03:53.470> modern

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
now the problem is we with our modern

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.950 
now the problem is we with our modern
beekeeping<00:03:54.490> techniques<00:03:55.060> don't<00:03:55.540> allow<00:03:55.900> that

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
beekeeping techniques don't allow that

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.660 
beekeeping techniques don't allow that
to<00:03:56.350> happen<00:03:56.530> because<00:03:56.830> we're<00:03:57.250> forever

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
to happen because we're forever

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.840 
to happen because we're forever
importing<00:03:58.540> when<00:03:58.780> we<00:03:58.960> lose<00:03:59.200> bees<00:03:59.590> we<00:04:00.340> bring<00:04:00.670> in

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
importing when we lose bees we bring in

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.500 
importing when we lose bees we bring in
new<00:04:01.030> ones<00:04:01.230> from<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.410> south<00:04:02.650> or<00:04:03.070> wherever<00:04:03.510> and

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
new ones from the south or wherever and

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.290 
new ones from the south or wherever and
so<00:04:04.690> we<00:04:04.840> never<00:04:05.140> let<00:04:05.500> nature<00:04:06.030> establish<00:04:07.030> that

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
so we never let nature establish that

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.020 
so we never let nature establish that
equilibrium<00:04:07.900> we<00:04:08.410> always<00:04:08.740> have<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.160> intrude<00:04:09.730> on

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
equilibrium we always have to intrude on

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.890 
equilibrium we always have to intrude on
it<00:04:10.240> and<00:04:10.480> change<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:11.230> okay<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:13.120> these<00:04:13.330> sets<00:04:13.660> of

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
it and change it okay and these sets of

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.600 
it and change it okay and these sets of
thinking<00:04:14.290> that's<00:04:14.500> coming<00:04:14.890> out<00:04:15.010> of<00:04:15.040> that<00:04:15.190> work

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
thinking that's coming out of that work

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.470 
thinking that's coming out of that work
I<00:04:16.320> see<00:04:17.350> I'm<00:04:17.530> fascinated<00:04:17.920> if<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:18.640> can<00:04:18.880> if<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.209> win

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
I see I'm fascinated if I can if I win

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.750 
I see I'm fascinated if I can if I win
the<00:04:19.690> lottery<00:04:19.840> I'll<00:04:20.410> buy<00:04:20.650> myself<00:04:20.920> an<00:04:21.310> island

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
the lottery I'll buy myself an island

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:31.860 
the lottery I'll buy myself an island
and<00:04:22.360> often

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.930
