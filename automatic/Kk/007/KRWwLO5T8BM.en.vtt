style I think the coolest part about her

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.130 
style I think the coolest part about her
is<00:00:23.580> she<00:00:23.789> has<00:00:23.820> like<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.300> sort<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.600> edge<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.019> her

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
is she has like this sort of edge to her

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.630 
is she has like this sort of edge to her
and<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.470> goes<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> lot<00:00:25.949> with<00:00:26.160> her<00:00:26.250> personality

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and it goes a lot with her personality

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.240 
and it goes a lot with her personality
too<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.420> one<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.900> my<00:00:28.199> favorite<00:00:28.710> elements

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
too this is one of my favorite elements

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.009 
too this is one of my favorite elements
because<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.090> actually<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> boys<00:00:30.660> jacket

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
because this is actually a boys jacket

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.979 
because this is actually a boys jacket
originally<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.340> they<00:00:32.369> fitted<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> too<00:00:33.480> you
