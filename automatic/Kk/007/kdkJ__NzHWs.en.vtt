it<00:00:02.820> was<00:00:02.939> through<00:00:03.570> Tori<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.170> had<00:00:04.500> never<00:00:04.710> been<00:00:04.799> on

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
it was through Tori I had never been on

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.920 
it was through Tori I had never been on
a<00:00:04.980> computer<00:00:05.190> before<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:05.850> never<00:00:06.150> never<00:00:06.720> learned

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
a computer before I never never learned

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.350 
a computer before I never never learned
to<00:00:07.020> use<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.350> internet<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.849> know<00:00:09.179> I've

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
to use the internet that you know I've

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.600 
to use the internet that you know I've
learned<00:00:09.690> how<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:09.990> go<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:10.170> Tori<00:00:10.500> Amos<00:00:10.650> calm<00:00:11.280> and

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
learned how to go on Tori Amos calm and

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.100 
learned how to go on Tori Amos calm and
then<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.730> learned<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.179> link<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.570> over<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.870> rain

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
then I learned to link it over to rain

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.890 
then I learned to link it over to rain
and<00:00:13.440> when<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.160> really<00:00:14.700> started<00:00:15.089> reading<00:00:15.839> about

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
and when I really started reading about

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.820 
and when I really started reading about
that<00:00:16.260> situation<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:17.359> felt<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.630> as<00:00:18.869> odd<00:00:19.590> as<00:00:19.800> it

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
that situation I felt like as odd as it

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.070 
that situation I felt like as odd as it
seemed<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:21.000> exactly<00:00:21.449> where<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.840> could

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
seemed that it was exactly where I could

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.900 
seemed that it was exactly where I could
make<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.410> most<00:00:22.680> difference<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.760> an

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
make the most difference that it was an

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.290 
make the most difference that it was an
area<00:00:24.350> that<00:00:25.350> needed<00:00:26.340> attention<00:00:26.519> especially

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
area that needed attention especially

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.620 
area that needed attention especially
for<00:00:27.930> men<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.470> think<00:00:29.130> most<00:00:29.550> men<00:00:29.789> try<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> push

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
for men I think most men try to push

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.410 
for men I think most men try to push
sexual<00:00:31.619> violence<00:00:32.009> off<00:00:32.279> as<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> situation

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
sexual violence off as a situation

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.319 
sexual violence off as a situation
affects<00:00:33.780> only<00:00:33.960> survivors<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.920> women<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
affects only survivors and women and I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.830 
affects only survivors and women and I
thought<00:00:36.719> very<00:00:37.380> strongly<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.840> subject

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
thought very strongly that the subject

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.350 
thought very strongly that the subject
needed<00:00:40.079> some<00:00:40.290> male<00:00:40.829> voices<00:00:41.100> yeah<00:00:41.640> strong<00:00:42.149> men

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
needed some male voices yeah strong men

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.630 
needed some male voices yeah strong men
letting<00:00:42.629> other<00:00:42.780> men<00:00:42.989> know<00:00:43.200> yeah<00:00:44.010> exactly<00:00:44.160> what

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
letting other men know yeah exactly what

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.010 
letting other men know yeah exactly what
it<00:00:44.760> can't<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.600> more<00:00:45.809> than<00:00:45.870> just

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
it can't but it's more than just

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.229
