00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.300
 Hi, I'm like that, and today I'm going to 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:11.030
 teach how to prepare these three eggs 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.500
 surprise for the filling of the eggs 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.990
 I will use as you see little eggs 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.519
 chocolate of different types but you can 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.530
 use any other type of candy 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:20.500
 bauble toy or whatever you want 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.590
 put inside to make it a surprise 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.119
 I'm going to use balloons and this little tube 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.560
 cardboard that I will use it as a 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.750
 funnel to put the eggs of 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.789
 chocolate inside by a normal funnel not 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.559
 fit you have to use a tube or 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.079
 anything that you invent in a way 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.260
 that they fit around the sweets inside the 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.889
 balloon you put it like that in the part of 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.530
 up and we're going to introduce the 

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:46.879
 chocolate eggs in this first 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.510
 I'm going to put these colors that are not 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.300
 they carry paper 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.280
 5 or 6 more or less can fit here 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.710
 as I say you can fill it with 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.489
 what you want but as long as it fits 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.489
 the clear tube 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.510
 is little by little I'm getting into the 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.570
 balloon the bigger the better the better 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.729
 easy to put the little things inside 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.240
 Well, here I have the eggs 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.880
 inside as you see 1 2 3 4 5 6 little eggs 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.939
 they have fit 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.649
 he removed the tube and now what I have to 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.119
 do is inflate it a little bit until the 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.789
 size I want my egg to have 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.679
 I'm going to make it big like this and lead a 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:31.110
 Nudito is to release a little bit of air to your 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.210
 knot very strong and I have it ready 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.649
 to start working and do the same 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.170
 with the other two eggs that I'm going to 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.970
 prepare 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.799
 this I'm going to put more eggs 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.920
 small and it's going to be a little 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.070
 smallest egg and the third the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.350
 Biggest of all 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.640
 good month I have eggs of three sizes and 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.680
 Now we are going to use different 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.680
 materials I will use rope tape 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.370
 of paper and thread a thread a little bit 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.500
 thick you can use wool if you want or 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.050
 whatever you can think of and here I have in this 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.640
 tail glue set this white 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.640
 they use school zone schools 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.560
 I put the rope in the tail 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.630
 placed the balloon comfortably so 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.310
 a cup to hold it high that I 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.480
 it is easier to put the rope 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.370
 around 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.940
 it has to be well glued in line or 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.940
 glue 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.840
 It's a bit sticky but good as you see 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.700
 I have placed a newspaper 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.720
 so as not to stain the table and then I 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.080
 I will have to wash my hands obviously 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.760
 but if it's cousins ​​or this and now 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.130
 I'm just going to put the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.480
 rope around the globe 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.360
 in this way circling around 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.790
 from him in all directions 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.790
 if the ropes will be well secured 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.770
 I have not cut it as you can see 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.570
 getting more from the skein of rope 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.760
 to be a continuous string and will 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.510
 wetting the glue as I go 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.510
 needing more 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.420
 you can do as many laps as you want 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.010
 keep in mind to leave it 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.510
 sufficiently thick so that it does not 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.210
 leave what is inside in this case the 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.770
 Little eggs are not too thick so they do not 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.020
 see what is inside 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.840
 alright I'm going for the second egg and I do 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.780
 exactly the same with paper tape 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.700
 of this packing as I say you can 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.340
 use wool any other thread 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.160
 strings of any type of plastic or 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.510
 you want to always put them together 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.810
 in the queue that is what is going to do that 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.970
 is stiff at the end well I have the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.390
 principle and I'm just giving it 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.730
 I do this at the beginning and 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.500
 then at the end complete with the brush 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.170
 I put a tail on the rest of the string 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.460
 is on the globe to make it easier 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.560
 the first part is always better by 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:04:03.340
 dryness under what you do with the 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:04.390
 tape well in heart if you want it not 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.730
 see what is inside and that is 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.350
 totally surprise making it very dense 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.270
 so that there is an egg 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.560
 practically a little and you do not see anything 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.360
 it's like I have done with rope 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.250
 Here I am going to leave you a little more 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.140
 open to be delivered to 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.060
 what is inside well then I leave it there 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.830
 supported and I go with the last one that is this 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.590
 tiny and I'll show you a little 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.450
 trick that is to dye the thread then in the 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.610
 tail I just add a few drops a 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.860
 trickle of food coloring is what 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.880
 I mix well I think any other 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.590
 vegetable dye serves you also remains 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.240
 a little bit dark but good then 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.940
 now you put here the thread the agreement to 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.500
 what you have and it would be tinged with 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.740
 this color so you can make the new ones 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.419
 of the color that you like the most 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.910
 is more clear would have been more 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.440
 nice but I spent a little and swim 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.389
 this little one that is easier I do 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.680
 with the rope and I go rolling as month 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.620
 I'm going to roll the rope directly and 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.199
 then I'll paint it with a brush 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.000
 which is very finite and the law will remain 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:11.669
 it is colored, it is taking care of it 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.889
 black , and nothing flight with a 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.110
 tacit or glass and let it dry for 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.660
 two days the tail has to be very very 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.460
 very dry you see here I have it the tail 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.870
 excess has been happening and it has 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.940
 stayed in the glass at the bottom 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.440
 use glasses that you are not going to use 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.150
 a lot or that they observe for crafts 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.849
 that then I cleaned it and it was linked 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.220
 well and look that is totally hard and 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.930
 rigid the three eggs these are the 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.449
 three that I have done and what to do 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.310
 now with the stick we are going to click 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.440
 globe and we have to take off from the 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.000
 rope and take it out of it so that they go 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.050
 to stay our pretty chocolate 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.050
 inside the eggs 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.099
 there it takes off very easily because 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.840
 this tail is not so good so strong 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.090
 but with the climb as I say a 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.669
 glue school carpenter schools 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.440
 I think they are somewhat stronger but 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.440
 some will be like that of plastic rubber 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.930
 it takes off a lot and we are taking off 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.520
 and with careful we are throwing leaving 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.380
 towards January that we extract it you see 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.750
 the holes you can use tweezers 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.039
 also but with a stick with this 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.240
 skewer that I am using the 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.880
 truth is that there is a video left 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.569
 here I already have lumbar that has remained like this 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.360
 they look inside the eggs and look at this 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:22.860
 pretty with light and good the kids are 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.810
 will ask to see how he got there 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.949
 inside as they were to get them out and eat it 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.120
 it is from the east center that is thickest 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:33.090
 I do exactly the same thing a little bit 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.590
 harder but I'll get out of here 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.570
 balloon is already and it has stayed like this 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.130
 these eggs apart from for easter by 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.720
 example they serve as decoration too 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.670
 even not putting anything in 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.190
 They serve to decorate a dining room by 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:49.060
 example if you put several in a basket 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.440
 a tray a plate or something 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.180
 with decorative eggs 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.460
 you see here is the third one has been the 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.770
 glue there between the strands of the thread 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.960
 and completely cover what's inside 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.940
 because it was very tiny this is the one 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.630
 rope and this is the target that is the one 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.220
 I like to me 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.140
 I hope you liked this
