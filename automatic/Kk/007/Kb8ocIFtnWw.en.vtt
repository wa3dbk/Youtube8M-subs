00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.670
 I have club june 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.730
 I have not approached the market to buy fails but life is so 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.889
 will ask the oil company to recommend 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.849
 e a dish for today told me that he will buy hake fini has suggested other 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.480
 recipes but as soon as you told me the first one stopped listening to it next 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.399
 to concentrate and not forget about this recipe that I'm going to prepare is very 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:26.050
 simple and I the truth that I had not tried it the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.759
 talk and bounce the mobile hake pq is cut into slices of centimeter 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.759
 and a half or so 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.250
 once we have named it comes we do them a bit so they do not remain 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.850
 lumps of entity flour we believed in a trickle of olive oil turned and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.519
 return 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.059
 I the truth that in the past so much so that you have to give them some 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.009
 poison especially at the beginning so that astrologers do not stick better to touch them 

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.009
 a little 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.870
 but not everything is turn pink 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.390
 this is a matter of a couple of minutes on each side 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.300
 precisely to go crazy 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.170
 On January 2 we removed it and we booked it 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.869
 on the other hand we're going to chop a couple of cloves of garlic a handful of 300 and a 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.790
 good pinch of salt because then we will not add later and so that 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.790
 be bland is to choose a good pinch 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 we talked well 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.330
 first oil in which we have seen the fish 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.600
 we suffer the bite this has to be very fast because the parsley burns 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.500
 followed 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.750
 so in a few seconds 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.750
 and we add the wine glass 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.390
 loans from the fund because it has stuck a little bit of fish 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.189
 and we let it reduce this will take a little 4 5 minutes 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.929
 we incorporate the hake again 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.269
 we also add the asparagus 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.829
 we were fine 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.549
 again give them - that I eat as you see january breaking we add the juice of the 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.789
 asparagus that are canned 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.789
 and finally a little more parsley 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.319
 and this is ready 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.759
 I hope you enjoyed a hug until then
