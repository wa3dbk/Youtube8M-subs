respiratory systems major structures and

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.589 
respiratory systems major structures and
functions<00:00:07.639> now<00:00:08.639> concerning<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.269> respiratory

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
functions now concerning the respiratory

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.770 
functions now concerning the respiratory
system<00:00:09.960> its<00:00:10.920> major<00:00:11.219> function<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.120> gas

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
system its major function is gas

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
to leave your body of course this works

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.139 
to leave your body of course this works
with<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.529> circulatory<00:00:31.980> system<00:00:32.160> because<00:00:32.969> it's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
with the circulatory system because it's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.299 
with the circulatory system because it's
the<00:00:33.300> blood<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.930> carries<00:00:34.440> both<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.040> waste

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the blood that carries both the waste

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.150 
the blood that carries both the waste
carbon<00:00:36.030> dioxide<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.899> oxygen<00:00:37.500> throughout

things you eat talk through etc etc both
of<00:01:01.949> these<00:01:02.129> where<00:01:02.699> air<00:01:02.969> enters<00:01:03.510> into<00:01:04.080> your

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
of these where air enters into your

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.289 
of these where air enters into your
system<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.400> leaves<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:06.119> your<00:01:06.360> system<00:01:08.299> now

system and leaves from your system now
your<00:01:09.479> pharynx<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.950> fancy<00:01:11.340> way<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
your pharynx is that the fancy way of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.420 
your pharynx is that the fancy way of
saying<00:01:11.640> throat<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.920> connects

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
saying throat and this is what connects

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.969 
saying throat and this is what connects
the<00:01:14.880> nose<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.570> your<00:01:15.689> larynx<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.619> next

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the nose to your larynx the next

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.149 
the nose to your larynx the next
structure<00:01:17.479> within<00:01:18.479> your<00:01:18.810> respiratory<00:01:19.140> system

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.920 

so<00:01:23.159> air<00:01:23.340> starts<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.060> nose<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.780> your

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
so air starts in your nose and your

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.749 
so air starts in your nose and your
pharynx<00:01:25.409> nose<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> mouth<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.580> goes<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pharynx nose and mouth and it goes to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
pharynx nose and mouth and it goes to
your<00:01:26.820> pharynx<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.960> goes<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.259> your

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
your pharynx and then it goes to your

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.380 
your pharynx and then it goes to your
larynx<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.759> fancy<00:01:30.090> way<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.240> saying

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
larynx this is the fancy way of saying

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.170 
larynx this is the fancy way of saying
your<00:01:30.659> voice<00:01:30.840> box<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> piece<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
your voice box and it is the piece that

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.219 
your voice box and it is the piece that
connects<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.409> pharynx<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.369> trachea<00:01:36.229> now

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
connects the pharynx to the trachea now

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
connects the pharynx to the trachea now
your<00:01:37.439> trachea<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.009> also<00:01:38.369> known<00:01:38.549> as<00:01:38.729> your

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
your trachea is also known as your

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.719 
your trachea is also known as your
windpipe<00:01:39.890> if<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.040> ever<00:01:41.189> look<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
windpipe if you ever look at the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.580 
windpipe if you ever look at the
structure<00:01:42.420> especially<00:01:43.049> when<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.259> get<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
structure especially when we get to the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.069 
structure especially when we get to the
part<00:01:43.799> where<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:43.920> dissect<00:01:44.540> pigs<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.720> stuff<00:01:45.840> in

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
part where we dissect pigs and stuff in

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.230 
part where we dissect pigs and stuff in
the<00:01:46.140> class<00:01:46.350> you'll<00:01:47.040> see<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.549> trachea<00:01:48.030> is

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the class you'll see that the trachea is

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.340 
the class you'll see that the trachea is
a<00:01:48.270> very<00:01:48.509> whitish<00:01:49.079> looking<00:01:50.060> structure<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
a very whitish looking structure and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.010 
a very whitish looking structure and
it's<00:01:52.350> sort<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.040> ridged<00:01:53.640> looking<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.930> it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
it's sort of ridged looking and so it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's sort of ridged looking and so it
always<00:01:55.140> makes<00:01:55.439> me<00:01:55.590> think<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.070> when<00:01:56.579> you

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
always makes me think of like when you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.539 
always makes me think of like when you
go<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> Six<00:01:57.180> Flags<00:01:57.270> or<00:01:58.020> some<00:01:58.860> other<00:01:59.040> amusement

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
go to Six Flags or some other amusement

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.160 
go to Six Flags or some other amusement
park<00:01:59.759> or<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.909> gas<00:02:00.149> station<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:01.020> those

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
park or a gas station and you get those

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.980 
park or a gas station and you get those
big<00:02:01.649> thicker<00:02:02.009> straws<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.549> go<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.540> big

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
big thicker straws that go with the big

bronchioles right and the bronchioles
are<00:02:51.360> just<00:02:51.600> much<00:02:51.840> smaller<00:02:52.410> tubes<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.340> again<00:02:53.940> it

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
are just much smaller tubes and again it

so<00:03:05.220> as<00:03:05.370> these<00:03:05.640> bronchioles<00:03:06.600> keep<00:03:07.290> dividing

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
so as these bronchioles keep dividing

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.250 
so as these bronchioles keep dividing
and<00:03:08.040> dividing<00:03:08.130> they<00:03:09.120> finally<00:03:09.630> end<00:03:09.840> in<00:03:10.080> these

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
and dividing they finally end in these

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.010 
and dividing they finally end in these
structures<00:03:10.560> called<00:03:11.000> alveoli<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.330> these<00:03:12.900> are

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
of the bronchioles and this is where gas

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.930 
of the bronchioles and this is where gas
exchange<00:03:21.830> actually<00:03:22.830> takes<00:03:23.100> place<00:03:23.280> where<00:03:23.850> the

you look at this picture you'll see that

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.060 
you look at this picture you'll see that

the alveoli the patient in the top right

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.000 
the alveoli the patient in the top right
are<00:03:32.520> covered<00:03:33.330> in<00:03:33.570> blood<00:03:34.020> vessels<00:03:34.200> completely

covered and that's because that's where

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.050 
covered and that's because that's where
respiration<00:03:37.410> takes<00:03:37.680> place<00:03:38.100> you've<00:03:38.820> got<00:03:38.970> to

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
respiration takes place you've got to

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.300 
respiration takes place you've got to
get<00:03:39.210> that<00:03:39.330> gas<00:03:39.600> exchange<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.590> oxygen<00:03:41.190> that

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
get that gas exchange of the oxygen that

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.730 
get that gas exchange of the oxygen that
you've<00:03:41.460> breathed<00:03:41.820> into<00:03:42.150> your<00:03:42.420> lungs<00:03:42.740> from

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
you've breathed into your lungs from

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.580 
you've breathed into your lungs from
those<00:03:44.010> alveoli<00:03:44.940> those<00:03:45.180> air<00:03:45.420> sacs<00:03:45.840> into<00:03:46.470> the

those alveoli those air sacs into the
bloodstream<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:48.630> reverse<00:03:48.930> process<00:03:49.290> you

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
bloodstream and the reverse process you

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.960 
bloodstream and the reverse process you
need<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:49.920> get<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.190> waste<00:03:50.490> product<00:03:50.940> carbon

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
need to get that waste product carbon

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.990 
need to get that waste product carbon
dioxide<00:03:51.810> from<00:03:52.170> your<00:03:52.440> bloodstream<00:03:52.709> into<00:03:53.430> the

dioxide from your bloodstream into the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.790 
dioxide from your bloodstream into the
lungs<00:03:54.209> so<00:03:54.390> your<00:03:54.600> body<00:03:54.780> can<00:03:54.900> get<00:03:55.260> rid<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.560> it

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
lungs so your body can get rid of it

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.570 
lungs so your body can get rid of it
through<00:03:56.070> exhalation<00:03:57.800> and<00:03:58.800> again<00:03:59.220> these<00:03:59.400> are

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
through exhalation and again these are

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.760 
through exhalation and again these are
all<00:03:59.610> structures<00:04:00.300> these<00:04:00.600> are<00:04:00.780> all<00:04:00.959> within<00:04:01.170> the

lungs lungs of course your major organ

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.230 
lungs lungs of course your major organ
in<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.680> process<00:04:05.160> of<00:04:05.310> respiration<00:04:05.580> and

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
in the process of respiration and

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.600 
in the process of respiration and
ventilation<00:04:07.020> and<00:04:07.200> again<00:04:08.040> like<00:04:08.220> I<00:04:08.250> say<00:04:08.430> there's

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
ventilation and again like I say there's

ventilation and again like I say there's
a<00:04:08.670> right<00:04:08.850> in<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.060> left<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:09.510> that's<00:04:09.630> why<00:04:09.810> you

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
a right in the left and that's why you

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.380 
a right in the left and that's why you
have<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.470> division<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.640> bronchi<00:04:12.090> from

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
have the division of the bronchi from

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.060 
have the division of the bronchi from
the<00:04:12.540> trachea<00:04:12.990> and<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.560> can<00:04:13.680> see<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> nice

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
the trachea and you can see a nice

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.550 
the trachea and you can see a nice
diagram<00:04:14.790> of<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.000> in<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.900> bottom<00:04:16.200> right<00:04:16.410> hand

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
diagram of that in the bottom right hand
