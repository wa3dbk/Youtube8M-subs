first tip I have for you is to stretch

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.070 
first tip I have for you is to stretch
and<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.880> very<00:00:24.240> important<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.810> stretch

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and it's very important to stretch

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.439 
and it's very important to stretch
before<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.529> do<00:00:26.430> your<00:00:26.609> jump<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.119> you

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
before you do your jump so that you

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.109 
before you do your jump so that you
don't<00:00:27.869> pull<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.859> muscle<00:00:29.189> or<00:00:29.519> something<00:00:29.609> like

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
don't pull a muscle or something like

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.479 
don't pull a muscle or something like
that<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.660> no<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.679> do<00:00:31.920> not<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.399> be

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that and no you do not have to be

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.100 
that and no you do not have to be
flexible<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.210> good<00:00:33.450> jumps<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:33.989> it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
flexible to have good jumps but it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.100 
flexible to have good jumps but it
definitely<00:00:34.260> does<00:00:34.770> help<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.430> lot<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:36.930> make

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
definitely does help a lot so just make

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840 
definitely does help a lot so just make
sure<00:00:37.140> you're<00:00:37.440> stretching<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.250> help<00:00:38.489> improve

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
your jumps and I usually stretch all my

help you get abs and you want to have a

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.210 
help you get abs and you want to have a
strong<00:02:11.030> core<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.569> that<00:02:11.599> you're<00:02:11.840> able<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.220> pull

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
strong core so that you're able to pull

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.130 
strong core so that you're able to pull
your<00:02:13.370> body<00:02:13.430> up<00:02:13.970> off<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.540> ground<00:02:14.780> when<00:02:14.989> you're

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
your body up off the ground when you're

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.020 
your body up off the ground when you're
jumping<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:16.280> basically<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:16.700> kind<00:02:17.000> of

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
jumping so basically you just kind of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.880 
jumping so basically you just kind of
lay<00:02:17.180> down<00:02:17.360> on<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.599> floor<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:17.840> then<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.380> lean

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
lay down on the floor and then you lean

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.059 
lay down on the floor and then you lean
up<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:20.090> go<00:02:20.420> into<00:02:20.630> like<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.959> toe<00:02:21.230> touch<00:02:21.440> position

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
up and go into like a toe touch position

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.280 
up and go into like a toe touch position
they're<00:02:22.250> kind<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.550> hard<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.790> explain<00:02:22.970> but<00:02:23.510> they

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
they're kind of hard to explain but they

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.339 
they're kind of hard to explain but they
really<00:02:24.920> work<00:02:25.489> your<00:02:25.670> core<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.269> then<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:27.200> get

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
really work your core and then to get

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.270 
really work your core and then to get
hyper<00:02:27.620> extended<00:02:28.280> jumps<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:29.410> practice<00:02:30.410> rotating

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
hyper extended jumps I practice rotating

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.150 
hyper extended jumps I practice rotating
my<00:02:31.580> hip<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.209> if<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.080> do<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.410> then<00:02:33.709> your<00:02:33.920> legs

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
my hip and if you do that then your legs

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.670 
my hip and if you do that then your legs
will<00:02:34.459> rotate<00:02:34.849> when<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.239> jump<00:02:35.630> up<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.260> that

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
will rotate when you jump up and that

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.470 
will rotate when you jump up and that
will<00:02:36.890> make<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.190> have<00:02:37.370> hyper-extended<00:02:37.670> jumps

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
will make you have hyper-extended jumps

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.110 
will make you have hyper-extended jumps
so<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.230> just<00:02:39.440> put<00:02:39.680> my<00:02:39.709> hand<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.400> back<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.730> my

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
so I just put my hand on the back of my

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.559 
so I just put my hand on the back of my
hip<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.660> rotate<00:02:42.530> my<00:02:42.920> hips<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.940> now<00:02:44.269> I'm<00:02:44.450> just

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
hip and rotate my hips and now I'm just

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.860 
hip and rotate my hips and now I'm just
doing<00:02:44.840> some<00:02:45.500> kicks<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.730> help<00:02:46.940> my<00:02:47.180> core<00:02:47.690> and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
doing some kicks to help my core and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.190 
doing some kicks to help my core and
legs<00:02:48.079> get<00:02:48.440> stronger<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.420> now<00:02:50.420> here<00:02:50.780> are<00:02:50.959> some

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
legs get stronger and now here are some

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:18.449 
legs get stronger and now here are some
of<00:02:51.290> my<00:02:51.440> jumps

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.190 

so<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.670> was<00:03:19.819> it<00:03:19.970> for<00:03:20.120> my<00:03:20.239> head<00:03:20.450> over<00:03:20.569> jumps

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
so that was it for my head over jumps

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.220 
so that was it for my head over jumps
