well<00:00:11.590> this<00:00:11.800> whole<00:00:11.950> camp<00:00:12.370> starts<00:00:12.940> with<00:00:13.150> trying

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
well this whole camp starts with trying

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.630 
well this whole camp starts with trying
to<00:00:13.630> build<00:00:13.960> on<00:00:14.140> on<00:00:14.320> a<00:00:14.380> foundation<00:00:14.770> of<00:00:15.280> certain

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 
to build on on a foundation of certain

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.359 
to build on on a foundation of certain
ideas<00:00:16.030> and<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:17.650> foundation<00:00:18.310> is<00:00:18.550> is<00:00:18.900> still

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
ideas and that foundation is is still

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.280 
ideas and that foundation is is still
getting<00:00:21.369> them<00:00:21.550> to<00:00:21.700> understand<00:00:22.210> a<00:00:22.540> little<00:00:23.110> bit

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
getting them to understand a little bit

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.380 
getting them to understand a little bit
more<00:00:23.500> technically<00:00:24.220> tactically<00:00:24.910> what<00:00:25.060> happens

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
more technically tactically what happens

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.999 
more technically tactically what happens
when<00:00:25.540> games<00:00:25.810> get<00:00:26.020> better<00:00:26.230> and<00:00:26.470> faster<00:00:26.650> so<00:00:26.980> a

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
when games get better and faster so a

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.530 
when games get better and faster so a
lot<00:00:27.220> of<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.460> general<00:00:27.759> stuff<00:00:28.029> that<00:00:28.210> happens

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
lot of the general stuff that happens

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.569 
lot of the general stuff that happens
throughout<00:00:28.779> training<00:00:29.020> helps<00:00:29.740> that<00:00:29.890> and<00:00:30.099> then

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
throughout training helps that and then

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.220 
throughout training helps that and then
as<00:00:30.700> we<00:00:30.849> get<00:00:31.000> closer<00:00:31.240> we<00:00:31.480> try<00:00:31.660> to<00:00:31.720> create<00:00:31.900> some

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
as we get closer we try to create some

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.140 
as we get closer we try to create some
situations<00:00:32.770> in<00:00:32.920> training<00:00:33.250> where<00:00:33.370> now<00:00:33.550> it's

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
situations in training where now it's

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.910 
situations in training where now it's
tighter<00:00:34.480> it's<00:00:34.810> faster<00:00:35.290> and<00:00:35.320> they<00:00:35.560> start<00:00:35.829> to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
tighter it's faster and they start to

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.200 
tighter it's faster and they start to
understand<00:00:36.370> what<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.610> game<00:00:36.760> might<00:00:36.940> be<00:00:36.970> like

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
understand what the game might be like

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
just try to take it all in stride it's

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.020 
just try to take it all in stride it's
gonna<00:01:14.770> be<00:01:14.920> a<00:01:14.950> great<00:01:15.070> experience<00:01:15.189> for<00:01:15.610> us<00:01:15.850> and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
gonna be a great experience for us and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.030 
gonna be a great experience for us and
hopefully<00:01:16.810> we<00:01:17.049> can<00:01:17.140> come<00:01:17.259> out<00:01:17.409> on<00:01:17.530> top<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:17.920> get

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
hopefully we can come out on top and get

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.649 
hopefully we can come out on top and get
a<00:01:18.070> win<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.340> start<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.640> year<00:01:18.729> I<00:01:18.909> think<00:01:19.509> they'll

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
a win to start the year I think they'll

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.880 
a win to start the year I think they'll
test<00:01:19.960> this<00:01:20.110> because<00:01:20.470> Chile<00:01:22.439> comes<00:01:23.439> out<00:01:23.650> and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
test this because Chile comes out and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.999 
test this because Chile comes out and
presses<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.659> team<00:01:25.960> that<00:01:26.110> really<00:01:26.170> can

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
presses and is a team that really can

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.090 
presses and is a team that really can
fly<00:01:27.280> fly<00:01:27.640> forward<00:01:28.030> fly<00:01:28.240> back<00:01:28.509> and<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.829> so<00:01:29.950> our

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
fly fly forward fly back and and so our

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.069 
fly fly forward fly back and and so our
ability<00:01:30.640> now<00:01:30.790> to<00:01:30.820> handle<00:01:31.329> that<00:01:31.420> kind<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.689> tempo

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
ability now to handle that kind of tempo

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.420 
ability now to handle that kind of tempo
and<00:01:32.229> that<00:01:32.320> kind<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.560> pressure<00:01:32.799> I<00:01:32.950> think<00:01:33.280> will

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
and that kind of pressure I think will

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.149 
and that kind of pressure I think will
be<00:01:33.810> will<00:01:34.810> be<00:01:34.840> very<00:01:35.110> important<00:01:35.560> if<00:01:36.009> you're

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
be will be very important if you're
