for The Witcher 2 assassins of Kings the
enhanced<00:00:40.829> edition<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.340> really<00:00:42.149> don't<00:00:42.300> have

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
enhanced edition I really don't have

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.360

that<00:00:42.480> many<00:00:42.690> 360<00:00:43.320> games<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.739> I've<00:00:43.829> had<00:00:44.160> my

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that many 360 games and I've had my

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
xbox360 since September so I figured why

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.080 
xbox360 since September so I figured why
not<00:00:48.750> pick<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.140> prototype<00:00:49.890> 2<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> Xbox<00:00:50.789> 360

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
not pick up prototype 2 on the Xbox 360

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
so let's pop the game out of this

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.770 
so let's pop the game out of this
awesome<00:03:59.700> little<00:03:59.820> sleeve<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.359> comes<00:04:00.570> in

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
awesome little sleeve that it comes in

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.090 
awesome little sleeve that it comes in
and<00:04:01.519> out<00:04:02.519> here<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:02.850> is<00:04:02.910> basically<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.780> same

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
and out here it is basically the same

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.160 
and out here it is basically the same
exact<00:04:05.100> thing<00:04:05.400> let's<00:04:05.910> open<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.390> I'm<00:04:06.900> probably

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
exact thing let's open it I'm probably

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.390 
exact thing let's open it I'm probably
gonna<00:04:07.380> take<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.799> side<00:04:07.980> because<00:04:08.160> I'm

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
gonna take it to the side because I'm

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.300 
gonna take it to the side because I'm
sure<00:04:08.730> there's<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.810> few<00:04:09.840> codes<00:04:10.470> on<00:04:10.709> top<00:04:11.010> there

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
sure there's a few codes on top there

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.940 
sure there's a few codes on top there
that<00:04:11.579> I<00:04:12.329> don't<00:04:12.780> want<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.230> guys<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.380> see<00:04:13.680> well<00:04:13.890> I

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
that I don't want you guys to see well I

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.930 
that I don't want you guys to see well I
guess<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.250> really<00:04:14.310> doesn't<00:04:14.489> even<00:04:14.730> matter

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
guess it really doesn't even matter

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.390 
guess it really doesn't even matter
because<00:04:15.359> before<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.410> upload<00:04:16.739> this<00:04:16.859> unboxing

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
because before I upload this unboxing

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.849 
because before I upload this unboxing
I'll<00:04:17.489> probably<00:04:17.700> input<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:18.630> codes<00:04:18.840> anyway<00:04:19.289> so

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
I'll probably input the codes anyway so

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.610 
I'll probably input the codes anyway so
I<00:04:19.890> am<00:04:20.489> really<00:04:20.729> doesn't<00:04:20.940> matter

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
I am really doesn't matter

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.670 
I am really doesn't matter
I'll<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.740> do<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.069> really<00:04:23.250> quick<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:24.680> let

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
I'll just do that really quick and let

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.719 
I'll just do that really quick and let
me<00:04:25.770> take<00:04:26.580> these<00:04:26.729> stupid<00:04:27.409> security<00:04:28.409> seals<00:04:29.370> off

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
me take these stupid security seals off

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.600 
me take these stupid security seals off
here<00:04:30.620> one<00:04:31.620> thing<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:31.889> don't<00:04:32.039> get<00:04:32.430> with

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
here one thing I don't get with

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.309 
here one thing I don't get with
unboxings<00:04:33.210> is<00:04:33.300> why<00:04:33.419> people<00:04:33.750> freak<00:04:34.020> out<00:04:34.110> about

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
unboxings is why people freak out about

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.980 
unboxings is why people freak out about
their<00:04:34.469> codes<00:04:34.740> because<00:04:35.400> usually<00:04:36.060> they<00:04:36.449> upload

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
their codes because usually they upload

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.570 
their codes because usually they upload
the<00:04:37.169> unboxing<00:04:37.770> after<00:04:38.400> they<00:04:39.330> use<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.110> code<00:04:40.580> so

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
the unboxing after they use the code so

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.850 
the unboxing after they use the code so
it's<00:04:42.150> already<00:04:42.389> been<00:04:42.599> redeemed<00:04:43.080> so<00:04:43.500> nobody

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
it's already been redeemed so nobody

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.290 
it's already been redeemed so nobody
else<00:04:44.009> can<00:04:44.159> really<00:04:44.340> redeem<00:04:44.699> it<00:04:44.879> so<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.090> don't

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
else can really redeem it so I don't

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.369 
else can really redeem it so I don't
know<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.419> lot<00:04:45.479> of<00:04:45.539> people<00:04:45.810> freaked<00:04:46.080> out<00:04:46.199> about

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
know a lot of people freaked out about

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:51.920
