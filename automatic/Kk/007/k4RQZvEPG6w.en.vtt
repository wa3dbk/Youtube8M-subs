00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.520
 responded good to write demonstrate 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.770
 how to make the peje fast swap which is a 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.590
 very very easy trillo that is done with the 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.119
 rpg obviously origin missile launchers 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.650
 Russian good to just have to shoot 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.420
 that is, the left click and burn 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.529
 weapon or be one at the same time 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.510
 I just had to stop that 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.140
 left and one at the same time and that 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.750
 way 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.870
 rpg as the change almost 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.030
 strangely 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.129
 if they want to leave the clicker or 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.870
 from one there is not much difference 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.250
 what I noticed when it's not tight or 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.180
 30 the left foot aspect of 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.140
 self time appears as a 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.550
 thousandth of a second 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.550
 hyper melilla that is pretty good 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.550
 differentiated 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.860
 the air 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.470
 first in a 360 with rpg 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.560
 after dinner because to be handsome 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.460
 they make another one represented but let me see 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.990
 and finally crazy 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.250
 since it follows 160 after more than 430 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:25.750
 and here is another example what I just 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.750
 explain 360 web phases presents after 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.420
 trillo can be combined with the same 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.770
 thing for example with light or be it first 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.929
 a blake with the rpg this 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.710
 then in air an art pass more 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.710
 handsome and after 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.159
 sometimes I will combine with the subtract 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.979
 for a lot of things that I like 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.509
 Well, if five thousand years were not enough 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.100
 using juan cano I also show you 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.330
 you can do the pp happens 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.030
 guapita gigas does not need to do everything 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.370
 so separate we will take complicated 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.230
 calculate the timing 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.790
 and nobody is by finishing presses 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.130
 how I like to always leave a 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.370
 comment without desire and we have felt 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.370
 people
