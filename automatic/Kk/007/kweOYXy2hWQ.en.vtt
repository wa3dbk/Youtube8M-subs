00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.300
 Hello, the tucson is no more 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.860
 fast 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.140
 I'll explain to you how to make a 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.420
 car sound is that right there you 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.260
 is listening to the car amplifier at 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.200
 pyramid 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.740
 Come on, you're going to need two tractors. 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.320
 of type rfp 250 freight type motor 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.600
 extractors or powerful 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.730
 after good speaker that will be used 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.380
 It's going to be a strange day, that job. 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.150
 I am of 310 different sexes you can use the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.850
 load of four eight-year-old men 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.569
 so much does it perform well 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.989
 next to your own drive so you can 

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:43.870
 concerted will need four 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.659
 auditors 2 40 and 70 years and two of a 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.899
 car on a transformer zinho drive 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.769
 who will defend himself more and 10 with 76 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.539
 wishes 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:57.309
 also needs a regulator of 5 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:59.350
 volts 05 and play the yen 4007 and a 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.659
 12 volt battery and daughter to make 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.999
 connections and if you take care of 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.360
 need to make a plate if you want, just do it 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:09.160
 the connection of the given pieces of good 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.010
 so come on first let's call 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:22.260
 the battery drain light show 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.260
 transistors disease denied together right 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:30.370
 stress that the source of the disorders 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.370
 fed are connected in the speaking world 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.540
 in this same place here the loudspeaker is 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.760
 on turn 12 a drive itself 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.380
 audio and car amplifier here is 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.490
 so try to preserve the negative legacy 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.080
 of the battery that is minc extra 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.090
 always stay here from here to have a 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.400
 son off together 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.760
 after table to own chassis 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.680
 cabinet of sin you're going to ride 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.910
 yes the four jackson actors of 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.970
 stoppage 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:07.130
 this 70-year-old subject is linked in the 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:10.580
 mosfet transit grid this one here 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.120
 that a car is turned on at the exit of the celso 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.970
 the flange county and takes out 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.680
 shows the exit and plays to the entrance or 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.420
 be connected 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.760
 together with that of almost 70 together and this 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.290
 Girl of 22 switched on the transformer in the ... 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.290
 link of this idea 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.120
 with only a little pain here he 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.530
 input where you will enter here and 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.310
 will be applied by this bearing here 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.550
 This is the super tapas is fact. 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.860
 it will go through the regulator but before 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.030
 I can do this for the gold distributor. 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.730
 to give down 1.4 today each day 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.280
 from that beginning to a voltage of 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.890
 127 volts 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:06.010
 then 0.7 of 1.4 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:14.270
 then since it is 5 volts 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:18.260
 5 - 1.4 out of 10 - four out of 65 - 1 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:23.300
 I borrowed it gets segment of 44 - 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.459
 founded for 33 goals six volts 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.970
 So it 's the tension that's going to be here in the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.670
 the tension you feel from the point of 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.520
 work of this disorders mosfet 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.260
 intention here is going to do 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.840
 that the transistors would hurt him here if 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.860
 the entries did not hurt you 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.610
 what are you talking about 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.610
 do a project but this one is the 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.610
 audio input it will come with audio 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.240
 amplified from the car radio that is the 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:56.830
 of the radio that those green wire is green 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:03.130
 green light green black is the black gray 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:06.640
 light gray no it has the white 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.580
 right white white white black 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.820
 even all white here the next audio 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:17.410
 of the high radio besides lilac also has 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:19.900
 a language because it 's us look here and 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.250
 regulator it also draws attention from the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.550
 attention that comes from his positive battery 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.050
 here is my one that keeps the 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.560
 stop all modes front 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:39.190
 so the two pin here that is the negative 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:41.950
 and pin 3 positive output that rigor that 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.700
 Famous if you do not have it you 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:49.860
 can buy at the branch store to operate in 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:53.200
 scrap also very good appliance 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.180
 ready us is only that same 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.680
 You'll like it, you can make it work. 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.490
 right here from a feedback card 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.830
 negative in 2 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.470
 he takes the show out of the show 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.350
 speaking world play the entrance again 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:16.360
 the entrance is the great traffic the signal 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:18.280
 The AP sends come here AC side 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.370
 positive and negative 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:29.130
 then the audio goes here always positive 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:31.150
 here positive to positive and negative here 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.350
 come out negative 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.960
 then changes after some very positive 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.580
 here comes a positive here leaves positive 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:45.320
 here is a negative point here enter 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.950
 negative here comes out negative 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.140
 the way that's right we is not bug 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.460
 seven heads you can not do and it will 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:58.550
 to be all right 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:00.770
 If you liked it, I liked it and go through 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:05.440
 Your friends are not going to collaborate in this 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:09.350
 project and goes for more information is 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:13.960
 keep watching my channel, and we 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.960
 we will meet in the next project
