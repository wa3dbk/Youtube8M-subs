is<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.520> x-brawn<00:01:45.119> which<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.960> kind<00:01:46.140> of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
is this is x-brawn which is kind of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.480 
is this is x-brawn which is kind of
weird<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.500> again<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.890> said<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.159> Autobot
