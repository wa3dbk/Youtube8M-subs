00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.810 
people assistive skin cannot use HH a
product<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.150> too<00:01:10.340> strong<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.580> their

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
product because is too strong for their

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.359 
product because is too strong for their
skin<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.299> metallic<00:01:12.900> acid<00:01:13.320> does<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.100> same

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
skin so metallic acid does the same

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.289 
skin so metallic acid does the same
thing<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.470> it's<00:01:16.470> more<00:01:16.799> gentle<00:01:17.189> than<00:01:17.430> H<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.180> so

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
thing but it's more gentle than H a so

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.350 
thing but it's more gentle than H a so
and<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.869> only<00:01:19.100> exfoliate<00:01:20.100> your<00:01:20.490> skin<00:01:20.549> but

breakouts

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.480 
breakouts
so<00:01:26.070> mid-deck<00:01:26.400> mandelic<00:01:27.210> acid<00:01:27.240> actually<00:01:28.490> helps
