00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
on the background test and see if it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.520 
on the background test and see if it
worked<00:00:55.980> by<00:00:56.610> selecting<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> few<00:00:57.390> icons<00:00:57.539> and

worked by selecting a few icons and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.930 
worked by selecting a few icons and
moving<00:00:59.039> it<00:01:00.590> now<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.890> did<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.129> right<00:01:02.160> you

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
moving it now if you did it right you

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.210 
moving it now if you did it right you
should<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.300> double<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.530> only<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.070> them

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
should see double the only one of them

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.890 
should see double the only one of them
will<00:01:05.570> work<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.610> next<00:01:08.939> thing<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.180> want<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> do

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.980 

let's<00:01:12.900> go<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> arrange<00:01:13.409> icons<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.990> unclick

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
let's go to arrange icons and unclick

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:27.280 
let's go to arrange icons and unclick
the<00:01:16.020> show<00:01:16.500> desktop<00:01:16.770> icons

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.780 

now<00:01:27.890> everything<00:01:28.400> will<00:01:28.490> appear<00:01:28.820> as<00:01:29.420> normal<00:01:30.790> now

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
now everything will appear as normal now

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.570 
now everything will appear as normal now
the<00:01:31.850> third<00:01:32.090> step<00:01:32.510> is<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:33.650> unlock<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:34.160> taskbar

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
the third step is to unlock the taskbar

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.610 
the third step is to unlock the taskbar
if<00:01:34.970> it's<00:01:35.210> locked<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:37.390> move<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.620> somewhere

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
if it's locked and move it somewhere

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.000 
if it's locked and move it somewhere
else<00:01:40.240> it's<00:01:41.240> like<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.510> top<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:43.090> minimize<00:01:44.090> it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
else it's like the top and minimize it

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.570 
else it's like the top and minimize it
now<00:01:46.570> if<00:01:47.570> you're<00:01:47.720> using<00:01:47.900> a<00:01:48.110> CRT<00:01:48.440> or<00:01:48.590> LCD<00:01:48.740> monitor

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
now if you're using a CRT or LCD monitor

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.400 
now if you're using a CRT or LCD monitor
you<00:01:50.060> can<00:01:50.180> adjust<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.600> settings<00:01:50.990> on<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.170> side

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
you can adjust the settings on the side

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.540 
you can adjust the settings on the side
so<00:01:51.650> this<00:01:51.740> doesn't<00:01:51.979> show<00:01:54.070> okay<00:01:55.070> now<00:01:55.190> once<00:01:55.370> you

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
so this doesn't show okay now once you

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.000 
so this doesn't show okay now once you
move<00:01:55.760> move<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.240> taskbar<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:57.590> will<00:01:57.740> appear

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
move move the taskbar it will appear

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.440 
move move the taskbar it will appear
just<00:01:58.250> as<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:58.580> was<00:01:58.700> before<00:02:00.550> yet<00:02:01.550> when<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:01.759> try<00:02:02.119> to
