00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
fact but it's not a problem for me I I'm

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.509 
fact but it's not a problem for me I I'm
fine<00:00:25.500> with<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.920> makes<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.189> perfectly

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
fine with it it makes it perfectly

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.160 
fine with it it makes it perfectly
accessible<00:00:28.910> so<00:00:29.910> that's<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.960> where<00:00:31.080> my

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
accessible so that's it this is where my

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.959 
accessible so that's it this is where my
laptop<00:00:31.349> would<00:00:31.679> usually<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.219> travel<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.759> lot

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
laptop would usually be I travel a lot

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.889 
laptop would usually be I travel a lot
and<00:00:34.489> this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.670> where<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> would<00:00:36.030> keep<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.329> one

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and this is where I would keep it one

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:37.940 
and this is where I would keep it one
reason<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.200> mentioned<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.530> travel<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> lot

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
reason I mentioned I travel a lot

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.720 
reason I mentioned I travel a lot
because<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:39.690> has<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> scan<00:00:40.410> smart<00:00:40.890> compartment

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
because it has a scan smart compartment

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.280 
because it has a scan smart compartment
so<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.000> don't<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.660> take<00:00:42.809> your<00:00:42.960> laptop

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
so you don't have to take your laptop

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
so you don't have to take your laptop
out<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.920> some<00:00:44.280> airports<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.210> kind<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
out in some airports like it kind of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.810 
out in some airports like it kind of
differs<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.899> found<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.309> not<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> universal

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
differs I found so it's not a universal

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.029 
differs I found so it's not a universal
role<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.570> Canada<00:00:49.050> they<00:00:49.320> always<00:00:49.559> make<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.770> take

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
role in Canada they always make you take

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.069 
role in Canada they always make you take
it<00:00:50.160> out<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.879> you're<00:00:51.030> traveling<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> Canada<00:00:51.719> but

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.930

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.610 
basically all you do is unzip that guy
and<00:00:54.270> throw<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.079> set<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.379> its<00:00:55.559> way

moving<00:01:09.180> right<00:01:09.270> along<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.380> next<00:01:10.619> compartment

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
moving right along the next compartment

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.929 
moving right along the next compartment
is<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.520> bigger<00:01:12.439> compartment<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.619> all<00:01:13.710> your

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939

books and what-have-you
one<00:01:16.920> thing<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.869> has<00:01:19.049> some

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
one thing I like is that it has some

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.410 
one thing I like is that it has some
support<00:01:19.770> netting<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.180> doesn't

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
support netting here so this doesn't

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.929 
support netting here so this doesn't
just<00:01:21.840> fall<00:01:22.290> right<00:01:22.530> open<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.460> pretty<00:01:23.670> cool

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
just fall right open so it's pretty cool

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.990 
just fall right open so it's pretty cool
in<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.720> I'll<00:01:24.900> keep<00:01:25.110> things<00:01:25.350> like<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:26.000> charger

finally<00:03:42.700> got<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.060> airflow<00:03:43.750> design<00:03:44.290> here

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
finally got the airflow design here

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.420 
finally got the airflow design here
which<00:03:45.310> is<00:03:45.550> supposed<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.180> allow<00:03:46.300> air<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:47.430> look

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
which is supposed to allow air to look

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.160 
which is supposed to allow air to look
through<00:03:48.730> here<00:03:48.970> so<00:03:49.300> that<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.570> don't<00:03:49.780> get<00:03:49.930> that

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
through here so that you don't get that

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.290 
through here so that you don't get that
hot<00:03:50.410> or<00:03:50.620> anything<00:03:50.650> when<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.100> have<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:51.400> I've

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
hot or anything when you have this I've

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.150 
hot or anything when you have this I've
honestly<00:03:52.660> never<00:03:52.959> found<00:03:53.410> these<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.890> work

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
honestly never found these to work

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.940 
honestly never found these to work
necessarily<00:03:54.790> well<00:03:55.470> but<00:03:56.470> that's<00:03:56.709> just<00:03:56.800> my

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
necessarily well but that's just my

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.100 
necessarily well but that's just my
experience<00:03:57.390> not<00:03:58.390> something<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.840> would<00:03:58.930> make

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
experience not something that would make

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.449 
experience not something that would make
or<00:03:59.230> break<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.470> decision<00:03:59.920> for<00:04:00.040> me<00:04:00.160> getting<00:04:00.370> a
