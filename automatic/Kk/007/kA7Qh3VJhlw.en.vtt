00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
started by cutting off the sleeves and

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.740 
started by cutting off the sleeves and
simply<00:00:25.070> cutting<00:00:25.340> a<00:00:25.520> fringe<00:00:25.880> this<00:00:26.420> is<00:00:26.570> how<00:00:26.689> you

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
sleeve and that will kind of let the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.509 
sleeve and that will kind of let the
t-shirt<00:00:32.390> curl<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:33.080> give<00:00:33.290> a<00:00:33.320> nice<00:00:33.559> smooth<00:00:34.250> look

and to keep it nice and straight the
best<00:00:38.750> way<00:00:38.960> is<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:39.140> find<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:39.680> point<00:00:39.950> in<00:00:40.130> which

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
best way is to find the point in which

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.920 
best way is to find the point in which
you<00:00:40.460> want<00:00:40.670> it<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:40.910> hang<00:00:41.149> on<00:00:41.329> your<00:00:41.450> body<00:00:41.660> and
