00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
course it is not lighting in much but it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
course it is not lighting in much but it
just<00:01:41.720> think<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.049> feem<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> bike

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
just think that the feem of the bike

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.190 
just think that the feem of the bike
makes<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> more<00:01:44.220> interesting<00:01:44.460> yes<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:46.110> of

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
makes it more interesting yes and of

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.740 
makes it more interesting yes and of
course<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.530> front<00:01:46.829> part<00:01:47.369> has<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.000> small

course the front part has the small

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.380 
course the front part has the small
handlebar<00:01:49.380> bag<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:50.460> carry<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.000> few<00:01:51.240> things

things I was afraid off with these new

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.300 
things I was afraid off with these new
devices<00:03:59.709> it<00:04:00.160> takes<00:04:00.370> over<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.760> ride<00:04:00.940> but<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:02.470> had

devices it takes over the ride but I had

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.420 
devices it takes over the ride but I had
four<00:04:03.609> power<00:04:03.849> meters<00:04:04.239> at<00:04:04.870> one<00:04:05.079> time<00:04:05.260> one<00:04:06.220> bike

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
four power meters at one time one bike

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.280 
four power meters at one time one bike
was<00:04:06.579> I<00:04:06.670> was<00:04:06.760> comparing<00:04:07.030> them<00:04:07.239> but<00:04:07.900> now<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.049> have

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
was I was comparing them but now I have

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.210 
was I was comparing them but now I have
a<00:04:08.319> GPS<00:04:08.739> that's<00:04:09.280> hidden<00:04:09.609> in<00:04:10.450> there<00:04:10.930> in<00:04:11.220> every

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
a GPS that's hidden in there in every

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.370 
a GPS that's hidden in there in every
right<00:04:12.430> now

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
right now

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.470 
right now
I<00:04:13.500> look<00:04:13.920> at<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.430> see<00:04:14.700> where<00:04:14.880> did<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.150> venture

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
I look at it and see where did I venture

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.870 
I look at it and see where did I venture
out<00:04:15.630> yeah<00:04:16.050> you<00:04:16.410> know<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.800> and<00:04:17.040> all<00:04:17.400> my<00:04:17.640> photos

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
out yeah you know and and all my photos

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.720 
out yeah you know and and all my photos
are<00:04:18.209> tagged<00:04:18.590> so<00:04:19.590> it's<00:04:19.830> kind<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.040> an<00:04:20.130> experience

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
are tagged so it's kind of an experience

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.640 
are tagged so it's kind of an experience
and<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:20.910> think<00:04:21.120> with<00:04:21.840> this<00:04:21.930> kind<00:04:22.140> of<00:04:22.200> bike<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.530> it

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
and I think with this kind of bike it it

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.440 
and I think with this kind of bike it it
takes<00:04:22.830> me<00:04:23.070> because<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.670> just<00:04:23.820> venture<00:04:24.240> out

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
takes me because you just venture out

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.500 
takes me because you just venture out
exactly<00:04:25.170> in<00:04:25.320> portable<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.980> is<00:04:26.640> more<00:04:27.060> exactly

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
exactly in portable it is more exactly

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.140 
exactly in portable it is more exactly
about<00:04:27.720> where<00:04:27.960> you're<00:04:28.320> gone<00:04:28.850> along<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:30.000> way

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
about where you're gone along the way

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.020 
about where you're gone along the way
what<00:04:30.390> you've<00:04:30.540> seen<00:04:30.810> then<00:04:31.680> what<00:04:32.490> calorie<00:04:32.820> you

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
what you've seen then what calorie you

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.750 
what you've seen then what calorie you
burn<00:04:33.300> yeah<00:04:33.840> or<00:04:34.470> what<00:04:34.860> speed<00:04:35.190> you<00:04:35.220> have<00:04:35.430> gone

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
yeah what's the average speed right and

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.170 
yeah what's the average speed right and
that's<00:04:37.770> also<00:04:37.920> why<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.220> see<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.550> lot<00:04:38.700> of<00:04:38.850> despise

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
that's also why you see a lot of despise

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.510 
that's also why you see a lot of despise
the<00:04:39.720> drivetrain<00:04:40.290> is<00:04:40.410> more<00:04:40.620> basic<00:04:40.860> is<00:04:41.160> more

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
the drivetrain is more basic is more

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.720 
the drivetrain is more basic is more
looking<00:04:41.910> at<00:04:42.410> reliability<00:04:43.410> right<00:04:44.130> then<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
looking at reliability right then the

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.510 
looking at reliability right then the
pure<00:04:45.030> lightness<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.170> the<00:04:46.380> accuracy<00:04:46.650> of<00:04:46.950> like

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
pure lightness and the accuracy of like

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.760 
pure lightness and the accuracy of like
an<00:04:47.670> integrated<00:04:48.210> shifter<00:04:48.570> but<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.410> course<00:04:49.440> you

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
an integrated shifter but of course you

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.250 
an integrated shifter but of course you
know<00:04:49.950> if<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:50.220> want<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.640> run<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:50.880> campy<00:04:51.630> 11<00:04:52.080> is

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
know if you want to run a campy 11 is

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.510 
know if you want to run a campy 11 is
all<00:04:53.220> ready<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.610> go<00:04:53.730> that<00:04:54.090> row<00:04:54.270> as<00:04:54.450> well<00:04:54.690> so<00:04:55.140> yeah

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
all ready to go that row as well so yeah

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.450 
all ready to go that row as well so yeah
but<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.640> key<00:04:56.790> thing<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.270> offender

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
but the key thing is the offender

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.160 
but the key thing is the offender
possibility<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.550> run<00:04:59.730> big<00:04:59.940> tires<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.570> the

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
possibility to run big tires and the

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.470 
possibility to run big tires and the
carrying<00:05:01.650> capacity<00:05:01.980> to<00:05:02.550> i<00:05:02.580> think<00:05:02.970> paul

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
carrying capacity to i think paul

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.180 
carrying capacity to i think paul
reynolds<00:05:03.780> it's<00:05:04.170> a<00:05:04.350> beautiful<00:05:04.770> job<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.160> I
