small<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.769> now<00:00:58.769> let's<00:00:59.070> fly<00:00:59.339> to<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.790> north

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
small so now let's fly to the north

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.930 
small so now let's fly to the north
because<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.019> is<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.470> less<00:01:01.769> obvious<00:01:02.040> thing

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
because that is the less obvious thing

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.359 
because that is the less obvious thing
on<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:03.420> map<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.809> rest<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.500> quite<00:01:04.920> obvious<00:01:05.220> but

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
on the map the rest is quite obvious but

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
on the map the rest is quite obvious but
we<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:05.729> check<00:01:05.940> it<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.210> anyways<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
we will check it out anyways in the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.639 
we will check it out anyways in the
north<00:01:07.740> we'll<00:01:08.040> find<00:01:08.340> some<00:01:08.580> Plains<00:01:09.060> area<00:01:09.469> so<00:01:10.469> if

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
north we'll find some Plains area so if

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.469 
north we'll find some Plains area so if
you<00:01:10.770> need<00:01:10.950> some<00:01:11.219> flat<00:01:11.579> building<00:01:12.030> area<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you need some flat building area and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.480 
you need some flat building area and
that's<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:12.899> place<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> next<00:01:13.890> stood<00:01:14.070> we

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that's your place in the next stood we

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.690 
that's your place in the next stood we
have<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> savanna<00:01:15.240> mountain<00:01:16.079> plateau<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:17.100> these

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
have a savanna mountain plateau so these

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.060 
have a savanna mountain plateau so these
huge<00:01:18.180> savanna<00:01:18.689> mountains<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.439> only<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
huge savanna mountains with only the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.940 
huge savanna mountains with only the
dirt<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.579> earth<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:22.200> this

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
dirt on earth and as you can see this

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.899 
dirt on earth and as you can see this
goes<00:01:23.250> quite<00:01:23.700> far<00:01:23.969> up<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.359> looks<00:01:25.490> quite<00:01:26.490> nice

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
goes quite far up and looks quite nice

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.120 
goes quite far up and looks quite nice
in<00:01:27.299> my<00:01:27.509> opinion<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:27.929> have<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.350> valley<00:01:28.649> here

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
in my opinion we have this valley here

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.889 
in my opinion we have this valley here
and<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:30.420> guess<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> goes<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:32.060> 156<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.630> I'm<00:01:33.780> not

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
and I guess it goes up to 156 if I'm not

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.700 
and I guess it goes up to 156 if I'm not
wrong<00:01:34.369> then<00:01:35.369> next<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:35.990> flying<00:01:36.990> south<00:01:37.350> will

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
wrong then next to it flying south will

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.770 
wrong then next to it flying south will
come<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> Mesa<00:01:38.520> biome<00:01:38.939> which<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.479> only

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
come to a Mesa biome which is only

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.630 
come to a Mesa biome which is only
separated<00:01:40.320> by<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.560> little<00:01:40.890> river<00:01:41.070> from<00:01:41.429> the
