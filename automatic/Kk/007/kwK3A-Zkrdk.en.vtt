 a transparent shine now I'm going to 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:15.170
 say how to do it the first thing we go 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.890
 to do is put a layer of enamel on 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.890
 beige 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.489
 with the eyeliner in gray we are going to 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.569
 make a hairline as well as leaving 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:32.849
 a small corner as well as a triangulation and 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.849
 we are going to make two parallel lines 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:54.090
 and we make a hairline 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:58.470
 leaving a slight corner 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.920
 and two parallel lines followed by the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.920
 first 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.200
 then with the color eyeliner 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.680
 cherry we are going to paint the little corner that 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.680
 we leave 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.470
 and we are going to make some little lines in the middle of 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.470
 the two gray hatches 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.260
 we put in the little corner 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.200
 and we put in the middle of the two lines 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.460
 gray 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.230
 with the eyeliner in cherry color 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.370
 let's put a dot 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.599
 and we are going to put five dots to the 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.599
 sides around 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.970
 and then 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.920
 we go as we exhale the little dot of this 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.920
 like we pulled it towards the center 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.230
 we put a dot 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.130
 and we put five dots 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.130
 around 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:32.449
 and now like we pull the dots 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.449
 we pull them towards the center 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.850
 it does not matter if you do not get very very 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.250
 pretty the little flowers that I do not 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.200
 they come out very perfect because I also 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.940
 I am a beginner, I am just starting 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.990
 but with practice you will go 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.990
 coming out nicer 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.449
 let's put a gray dot in the middle 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.449
 of the little flowers 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.930
 and we will wait for dry flower 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.520
 to put the shine layer 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:16.190
 transparent because if we do not wait for 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.740
 and we apply the brightness what will happen 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.750
 is that all the flowers are going to run 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.110
 and then it's going to be destroyed and all the 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.800
 decorated let's wait for it to be very 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.800
 very dry 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.659
 since it is completely dry 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.020
 little flower we give a layer of brightness 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.020
 transparent
