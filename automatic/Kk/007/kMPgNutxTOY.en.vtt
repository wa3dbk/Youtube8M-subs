portrait<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.930> beginners<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.820> we<00:02:08.910> go

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
portrait for beginners so here we go

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.030 
portrait for beginners so here we go
first<00:02:10.170> we'll<00:02:10.500> get<00:02:10.649> your<00:02:10.769> ruler<00:02:12.650> place<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.890> on

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
first we'll get your ruler place it on

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.610 
first we'll get your ruler place it on
the<00:02:14.160> picture<00:02:14.579> and<00:02:14.959> then<00:02:15.959> measure<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
the picture and then measure the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.430 
the picture and then measure the
proportions<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.910> eyes<00:02:18.090> basically<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
proportions of the eyes basically the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.620 
proportions of the eyes basically the
eyes<00:02:19.620> are<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.070> key<00:02:20.370> point<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.910> portrait<00:02:21.329> if

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
eyes are the key point of a portrait if

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.420 
eyes are the key point of a portrait if
you<00:02:21.750> get<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.019> eyes<00:02:22.110> right<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.980> rest<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
you get the eyes right the rest of the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.789 
you get the eyes right the rest of the
portrait<00:02:23.910> looks<00:02:24.660> more<00:02:25.200> realistic<00:02:27.560> now<00:02:28.560> I'm

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
portrait looks more realistic now I'm

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.940 
portrait looks more realistic now I'm
drawing<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.250> portrait<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.970> scale<00:02:30.329> so<00:02:31.230> this

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
drawing this portrait to scale so this

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.400 
drawing this portrait to scale so this
is<00:02:32.130> an<00:02:32.250> a4<00:02:32.459> sheet<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.060> paper<00:02:33.269> so<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.019> will<00:02:34.260> be

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
is an a4 sheet of paper so I will be

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.319 
is an a4 sheet of paper so I will be
drawing<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.950> portrait<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.640> Angelina<00:02:36.209> Jolie

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
drawing the portrait of Angelina Jolie

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.650 
drawing the portrait of Angelina Jolie
as<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:37.440> 4<00:02:37.739> as<00:02:37.860> well<00:02:38.040> but<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.790> can<00:02:39.000> also<00:02:39.180> mess

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
as a 4 as well but you can also mess

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.840 
as a 4 as well but you can also mess
around<00:02:39.780> with<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> scale<00:02:40.500> by<00:02:40.860> changing

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
around with a scale by changing

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.090 
around with a scale by changing
measurements<00:02:42.450> either<00:02:42.780> timesing<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.620> twice<00:02:43.920> as

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
measurements either timesing it twice as

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.490 
measurements either timesing it twice as
big<00:02:44.340> or<00:02:44.640> twice<00:02:44.940> as<00:02:45.150> small<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:46.049> can<00:02:46.260> choose

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
big or twice as small you can choose

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.960 
big or twice as small you can choose
whatever<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.980> portrait<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.670> might<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:47.820> a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
whatever the portrait is it might be a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.030 
whatever the portrait is it might be a
bit<00:02:48.120> easier<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.600> do<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.930> if<00:02:49.230> you're<00:02:49.500> copying

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
bit easier to do that if you're copying

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.430 
bit easier to do that if you're copying
from<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.430> magazine<00:02:50.720> but<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.840> really<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.260> helpful

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
from a magazine but it really is helpful

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.400 
from a magazine but it really is helpful
to<00:02:52.769> do<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:54.180> do<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.570> outline<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.230> face

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
to do this to do the outline of the face

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.370 
to do this to do the outline of the face
I'm<00:02:55.709> using<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.250> 3<00:02:56.549> B<00:02:56.760> pencil<00:02:57.329> this<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.140> quite

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
I'm using a 3 B pencil this is quite

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.800 
I'm using a 3 B pencil this is quite
darker<00:02:58.890> usually<00:02:59.280> ologies<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.120> F<00:03:00.269> pencil

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
darker usually ologies and F pencil

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.380 
darker usually ologies and F pencil
because<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.590> shows<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.160> quite<00:03:02.370> light<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.940> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
because it shows up quite light on the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.970 
because it shows up quite light on the
paper<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.019> if<00:03:04.079> you<00:03:04.170> need<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.410> or<00:03:04.530> anything<00:03:04.769> out

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
paper so if you need to or anything out

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.250 
paper so if you need to or anything out
it<00:03:05.190> won't<00:03:05.340> show<00:03:05.639> up<00:03:05.820> but<00:03:06.480> I'm<00:03:06.600> only<00:03:06.780> using<00:03:07.049> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
it won't show up but I'm only using the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.220 
it won't show up but I'm only using the
start<00:03:07.530> pencil<00:03:07.919> to<00:03:08.130> give<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.489> an<00:03:08.579> idea

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
start pencil to give you an idea

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.100 
start pencil to give you an idea
what<00:03:09.319> it<00:03:09.440> would<00:03:09.500> look<00:03:09.620> like<00:03:09.680> on<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.190> paper<00:03:11.110> now

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
what it would look like on the paper now

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.350 
what it would look like on the paper now
as<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.590> can<00:03:12.709> see<00:03:12.769> I'm<00:03:13.250> doing<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.760> points<00:03:14.180> of

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
as you can see I'm doing the points of

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.259 
as you can see I'm doing the points of
the<00:03:14.720> edges<00:03:15.080> of<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.500> eyes<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:16.159> Anjali<00:03:16.610> Angelina

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
the edges of the eyes of Anjali Angelina

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.140 
the edges of the eyes of Anjali Angelina
Jolie's<00:03:17.569> eyes<00:03:17.750> on<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.170> paper<00:03:18.640> by<00:03:19.640> measuring

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
Jolie's eyes on the paper by measuring

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.750 
Jolie's eyes on the paper by measuring
them<00:03:20.330> with<00:03:20.510> my<00:03:20.720> ruler<00:03:21.080> this<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.159> because<00:03:22.519> it

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
them with my ruler this is because it

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.390 
them with my ruler this is because it
would<00:03:22.879> be<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.060> same<00:03:23.540> scale<00:03:24.110> as<00:03:24.409> the<00:03:24.470> April

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
would be the same scale as the April

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.030 
would be the same scale as the April
piece<00:03:25.549> of<00:03:25.700> paper<00:03:25.879> and<00:03:26.209> also<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:27.049> way<00:03:27.260> the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
piece of paper and also this way the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.670 
piece of paper and also this way the
proportions<00:03:28.790> are<00:03:29.000> more<00:03:29.180> realistic<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:30.049> lot<00:03:30.530> of

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
proportions are more realistic a lot of

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.039 
proportions are more realistic a lot of
people<00:03:30.980> try<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.220> draw<00:03:31.519> freehand<00:03:31.819> first<00:03:32.450> go<00:03:32.720> and

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
people try to draw freehand first go and

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.570 
people try to draw freehand first go and
then<00:03:33.140> wonder<00:03:33.470> why<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.709> doesn't<00:03:34.040> look<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:34.459> great

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
then wonder why it doesn't look so great

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.670 
then wonder why it doesn't look so great
I<00:03:34.910> think<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:36.019> have<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.349> have<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.500> lot<00:03:36.650> of

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
I think you have to have a lot of

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.069 
I think you have to have a lot of
practice<00:03:37.220> do<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.430> have<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:37.640> draw<00:03:37.819> freehand

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
practice do you have to draw freehand

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.199 
practice do you have to draw freehand
before<00:03:39.079> I<00:03:39.110> started<00:03:39.500> drawing<00:03:39.680> freehand<00:03:40.099> I<00:03:40.549> use

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
before I started drawing freehand I use

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.150 
before I started drawing freehand I use
this<00:03:41.420> method<00:03:41.629> a<00:03:41.900> lot<00:03:42.049> so<00:03:42.560> it's<00:03:42.739> really<00:03:42.980> great

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
this method a lot so it's really great

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.309 
this method a lot so it's really great
for<00:03:43.250> beginners<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.150> be<00:03:44.299> helpful<00:03:47.319> I'm

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
for beginners and it's be helpful I'm

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.780 
for beginners and it's be helpful I'm
just<00:03:48.530> going<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.829> speed<00:03:49.129> this<00:03:49.280> part<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.700> the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
just going to speed this part of the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.509 
just going to speed this part of the
video<00:03:49.970> because<00:03:50.599> it's<00:03:50.750> basically<00:03:51.109> me

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
video because it's basically me

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.650 
video because it's basically me
transferring<00:03:52.519> measurements<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.269> points

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
transferring measurements and points

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.119 
transferring measurements and points
from<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.930> photograph<00:03:54.349> onto<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.799> piece<00:03:54.980> of

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
from the photograph onto the piece of

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.280 
from the photograph onto the piece of
paper<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:56.120> then<00:03:56.299> I<00:03:56.390> can<00:03:56.450> begin<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.840> construct

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
paper so then I can begin to construct

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.190 
paper so then I can begin to construct
how<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.250> eyes<00:03:58.579> would<00:03:58.849> look<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.420> think<00:03:59.900> this

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
how the eyes would look I think this

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.920 
how the eyes would look I think this
method<00:04:00.470> is<00:04:00.709> great<00:04:00.890> for<00:04:01.430> developing<00:04:02.420> later<00:04:02.660> on

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
method is great for developing later on

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.559 
method is great for developing later on
to<00:04:03.260> become<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.859> freehand<00:04:04.340> draw<00:04:04.609> because<00:04:05.450> you're

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
to become a freehand draw because you're

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.300 
to become a freehand draw because you're
not<00:04:05.690> completely<00:04:06.079> relying<00:04:06.560> on<00:04:06.739> measurements

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
not completely relying on measurements

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.580 
not completely relying on measurements
as<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.640> are<00:04:07.819> constructing<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.810> Lions

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
as you are constructing the Lions

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.309 
as you are constructing the Lions
yourself<00:04:09.950> but<00:04:10.190> just<00:04:10.370> using<00:04:10.730> points<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.420> lot<00:04:12.260> of

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
yourself but just using points a lot of

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.789 
yourself but just using points a lot of
people<00:04:12.739> on<00:04:13.069> YouTube<00:04:13.129> asked<00:04:13.940> why<00:04:14.359> I<00:04:14.389> don't<00:04:14.840> show

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
people on YouTube asked why I don't show

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.219 
people on YouTube asked why I don't show
my<00:04:16.430> construction<00:04:16.940> lines<00:04:17.299> to<00:04:17.780> begin<00:04:17.959> with<00:04:18.109> in

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
my construction lines to begin with in

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.409 
my construction lines to begin with in
the<00:04:18.289> veers<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:19.220> reason<00:04:19.579> for<00:04:19.700> that<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:20.090> because

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
the veers the reason for that is because

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.050 
the veers the reason for that is because
I<00:04:21.229> usually<00:04:21.859> like<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.039> spend<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.700> couple<00:04:22.880> of

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
I usually like to spend a couple of

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.140 
I usually like to spend a couple of
hours<00:04:23.270> or<00:04:23.840> an<00:04:24.260> hour<00:04:24.410> so<00:04:24.979> I'm<00:04:25.250> actually<00:04:25.880> just

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
hours or an hour so I'm actually just

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.700 
hours or an hour so I'm actually just
getting<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.539> proportions<00:04:27.139> right<00:04:27.229> in<00:04:27.590> my

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
getting the proportions right in my

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.870 
getting the proportions right in my
videos<00:04:28.539> also<00:04:29.539> because<00:04:30.229> I<00:04:30.500> usually<00:04:31.250> use<00:04:31.460> quite

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
videos also because I usually use quite

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.089 
videos also because I usually use quite
a<00:04:32.120> light<00:04:32.419> pencil<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:33.169> my<00:04:33.320> webcam<00:04:33.560> it's<00:04:33.889> really

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
a light pencil and my webcam it's really

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.000 
a light pencil and my webcam it's really
blurry<00:04:34.310> which<00:04:34.550> I<00:04:34.700> film<00:04:34.940> on<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:36.050> outlines<00:04:36.680> of

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
blurry which I film on the outlines of

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.890 
blurry which I film on the outlines of
the<00:04:37.550> drawing<00:04:38.030> are<00:04:38.180> actually<00:04:38.510> really<00:04:38.660> light

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
the drawing are actually really light

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.210 
the drawing are actually really light
and<00:04:39.139> they<00:04:39.200> don't<00:04:39.229> actually<00:04:39.500> show<00:04:39.860> up<00:04:39.979> on<00:04:40.099> the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
and they don't actually show up on the

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.640 
and they don't actually show up on the
webcam<00:04:40.639> so<00:04:41.479> I<00:04:41.510> didn't<00:04:41.840> find<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.289> extremely

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
webcam so I didn't find it extremely

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.980 
webcam so I didn't find it extremely
necessary<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.669> show<00:04:43.940> part<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.510> video<00:04:44.630> we

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
necessary to show part the video we

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.140 
necessary to show part the video we
couldn't<00:04:45.349> actually<00:04:45.530> see<00:04:45.889> what<00:04:46.070> I<00:04:46.160> was<00:04:46.280> doing

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
couldn't actually see what I was doing

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.570 
couldn't actually see what I was doing
I'm<00:04:48.380> just<00:04:49.380> finishing<00:04:49.800> off<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:49.980> eyes<00:04:50.220> now

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
I'm just finishing off the eyes now

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.490 
I'm just finishing off the eyes now
another<00:04:50.940> method<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.450> could<00:04:51.600> also<00:04:51.780> use<00:04:52.080> is<00:04:52.320> the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
another method you could also use is the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.620 
another method you could also use is the
grid<00:04:52.680> method<00:04:52.920> this<00:04:53.640> is<00:04:53.850> where<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.150> draw<00:04:54.330> lines

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
grid method this is where you draw lines

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.480 
grid method this is where you draw lines
on<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.990> photograph<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.770> measure<00:04:56.010> them<00:04:56.250> from

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
on the photograph and measure them from

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.450 
on the photograph and measure them from
there<00:04:56.670> and<00:04:56.790> transfer<00:04:57.330> them<00:04:57.540> onto<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.900> piece<00:04:58.140> I

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
there and transfer them onto the piece I

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.910 
there and transfer them onto the piece I
think<00:04:59.460> this<00:05:00.000> would<00:05:00.150> probably<00:05:00.180> be<00:05:01.110> harder<00:05:01.710> than

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
think this would probably be harder than

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.920 
think this would probably be harder than
my<00:05:02.070> method<00:05:02.550> as<00:05:02.730> it<00:05:03.000> takes<00:05:03.210> longer<00:05:03.480> as<00:05:03.720> well<00:05:03.900> I

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
my method as it takes longer as well I

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.320 
my method as it takes longer as well I
know<00:05:04.230> some<00:05:04.440> of<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:04.680> like<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.580> do<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:05.970> outline

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
know some of you like to do the outline

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.510 
know some of you like to do the outline
of<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.660> portrait<00:05:07.050> just<00:05:07.260> quickly<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.340> you<00:05:08.430> can

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
of the portrait just quickly so you can

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.570 
of the portrait just quickly so you can
get<00:05:08.670> straight<00:05:08.940> into<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.300> realistic<00:05:09.840> details

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
get straight into the realistic details

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.580 
get straight into the realistic details
but<00:05:11.580> I<00:05:11.610> think<00:05:11.910> using<00:05:12.390> a<00:05:12.630> pointing<00:05:12.990> method<00:05:13.260> also

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
but I think using a pointing method also

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.380 
but I think using a pointing method also
helps<00:05:13.950> better<00:05:14.220> as<00:05:14.670> I<00:05:14.820> said<00:05:15.000> earlier<00:05:15.300> for

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
helps better as I said earlier for

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.820 
helps better as I said earlier for
developing<00:05:16.050> onto<00:05:16.440> a<00:05:16.470> freehand<00:05:16.860> rora<00:05:17.160> as<00:05:18.830> you

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
developing onto a freehand rora as you

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.890 
developing onto a freehand rora as you
can<00:05:19.980> see<00:05:20.220> now<00:05:20.400> I've<00:05:20.580> moved<00:05:20.790> on<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.240> drawing<00:05:21.420> the

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
can see now I've moved on to drawing the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.990 
can see now I've moved on to drawing the
outline<00:05:22.410> of<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.830> mouth<00:05:23.040> after<00:05:23.520> just<00:05:23.760> doing

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
outline of the mouth after just doing

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.090 
outline of the mouth after just doing
the<00:05:24.120> nose<00:05:24.300> also<00:05:24.690> using<00:05:25.140> the<00:05:25.260> point<00:05:25.530> method<00:05:25.920> and

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
the nose also using the point method and

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.190 
the nose also using the point method and
so<00:05:26.580> far<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.970> proportions<00:05:27.570> are<00:05:27.720> looking<00:05:28.020> quite

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
so far the proportions are looking quite

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.400 
so far the proportions are looking quite
realistic<00:05:32.090> this<00:05:33.090> is<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.390> final<00:05:33.840> drawing<00:05:34.230> I

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
realistic this is the final drawing I

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.410 
realistic this is the final drawing I
did<00:05:34.680> a<00:05:34.710> quick<00:05:34.920> sketch<00:05:35.340> to<00:05:35.760> show<00:05:35.970> you<00:05:36.030> what<00:05:36.300> the

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
did a quick sketch to show you what the

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.690 
did a quick sketch to show you what the
proportions<00:05:36.960> look<00:05:37.170> like<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:37.680> hope<00:05:38.160> you<00:05:38.430> enjoyed

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
proportions look like I hope you enjoyed

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.100 
proportions look like I hope you enjoyed
