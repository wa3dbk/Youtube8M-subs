 Relatively light 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.419
 It was a damage 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.329
 Echizen Washi also confirmed the safety of the cutlery student 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.019
 Then it falls for the first time in 3 days 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.319

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.399
 International exchange hall that worked as a training facility nearby 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.079
 I have been completely done 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.989
 We want to go on two main pillars One is 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.049
 Student satisfaction is on the net 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.009

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:00.719
 In business 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.759
 As a politician, I have made more and more efforts 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.979
 Student life activities 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.749
 It was 11 o'clock

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.059
 Properly 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.269
 I was asked to go to the place to kill the chrysanthemum 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.530
 That rate of growth is greater than when we met 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.389
 Let me feel 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:26.069
 The other is slax type that can contribute to the area 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:28.529
 It means 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:32.609
 Well, I've been able to get some results from open lectures etc. 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.589
 This year 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:39.899
 Competitively, one was able to earn a low external fund 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.719
 Member of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology no 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.719
 Programs to meet your re-learning needs 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:53.709
 Another one of the repercussions of the language is the real newness of the Agency for Cultural Affairs- 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.269
 However, I always make three events that say the sound of words 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.889
 It means that 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.059
 Collective reading 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.229
 Read aloud in the language of countries 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:09.299

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.310
 Expand to high school students and join local high school students 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.399
 It has become unpaid 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.399
 Well, university will continue to be in the region 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.699
 It is for designated promotion of cultural activities 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.499
 I'm thinking of how to assemble a cabin 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.499
 Thought 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.330
 In the previous Chuetsu-oki earthquake 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.719
 Local people 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.889
 I want to get support from many people 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.889
 Apology and thought to this than 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.840
 It continues without losing to Gyeonggi 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.449
 Second time 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.449
 Aiming for the best in Japan 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.559
