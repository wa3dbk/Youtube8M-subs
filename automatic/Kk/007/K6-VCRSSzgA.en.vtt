like<00:03:02.190> inspiration<00:03:02.909> is<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.299> so<00:03:03.510> much<00:03:03.720> better

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
like inspiration is just so much better

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.720 
like inspiration is just so much better
than<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.319> original<00:03:04.349> this<00:03:05.129> is<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.459> clean

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
than the original this is the clean

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.729 
than the original this is the clean
version<00:03:05.970> which<00:03:06.329> is<00:03:06.569> still<00:03:06.900> very<00:03:07.109> nice<00:03:07.319> but<00:03:07.590> I

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
version which is still very nice but I

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.289 
version which is still very nice but I
just<00:03:08.190> don't<00:03:08.370> like<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.639> as<00:03:08.760> much<00:03:08.790> as<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.239> one

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
just don't like it as much as this one

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.180 
just don't like it as much as this one
and<00:03:09.629> then<00:03:09.989> there<00:03:10.109> is<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.379> minimalist<00:03:10.920> one

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
and then there is the minimalist one

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.680 
and then there is the minimalist one
which<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.579> don't<00:03:11.760> really<00:03:11.970> like<00:03:12.239> because<00:03:12.540> it

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
which I don't really like because it

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.030 
which I don't really like because it
doesn't<00:03:12.959> have<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.290> portrait<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.889> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
doesn't have the portrait and the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.830 
doesn't have the portrait and the
unskilled<00:03:14.609> vision<00:03:14.909> shows<00:03:15.120> me<00:03:15.299> dead<00:03:15.569> so<00:03:15.599> I

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
unskilled vision shows me dead so I

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.660 
unskilled vision shows me dead so I
really<00:03:16.200> don't<00:03:16.349> like<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.650> one<00:03:16.859> but<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.430> course

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
really don't like that one but of course

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.250 
really don't like that one but of course
