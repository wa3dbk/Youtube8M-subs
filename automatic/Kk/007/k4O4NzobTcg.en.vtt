00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.719
 when such a clock at her bedroom 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.610
 I would think I will hang through 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.969
 Berlin is actually had a goal 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.440

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.279
 My father said I asked massage that way 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.660
 use quickly because if someone times 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.830

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.550
 Bad weather earlier home 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.060
 Who are the ones watching TV? 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.380

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.559
 penetrate not so good 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.190
 We're going back out of the kitchen today 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.380
 on 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.030
 I know my name is like it 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.579
 At that time, nothing better came to mind 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.789
 No one gives away from the kitchen and 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.170
 you do not need that much again for that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.670
 Shoe cream is really really right 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.800
 Well arrived when the chocolate cream him 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.480
 He has not seen it here 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.440
 short free so you need one again 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.640
 Jar 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.039
 because you need son he knows how 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.079
 bought edeka I 've been like this before 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.290
 a small amount bottled so to speak 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.060
 because I buy this stuff awaits peeps 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.500
 then suddenly my father is on the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.860
 sofa that makes him have the door 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.580
 torn up investor i need 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.430
 hide things for my video session 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.360
 so and then you still need dedicated 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.960
 honey by glock and a bit over the top 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.409
 So just really fresh needs away 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.150
 offer honey fleet I told you 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.750
 now of long-lived then you need 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.869
 one more a vanilla bean and that is 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.579
 a homemade honey, so to speak 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.670
 wax honey nuts and i mean the nut 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.829
 mix and you can also great 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.570
 such a great gift for someone 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.189
 me or something does not need so much money 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.450
 spend and I believe if you then 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.840
 says grandma i have that for you 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.149
 she is definitely looking forward to it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.890
 of course I mean now, of course 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.140
 the honey because it is naturally buys 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.270
 but why not honey itself 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.719
 I can not do it that way 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.509
 How to start a first step first 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.440
 You're Mr. Ton and now you have to 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.270
 the nuts on 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.610
 the problem is best it would be 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.200
 of course if they are unpeeled, though 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.890
 how can I help you on the fast 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.960
 peel 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.950
 that is definitely a sander wearing the 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.930
 I do not know 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.950
 but I do not feel like it now 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.410
 to deal with it 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.330
 That's why I leave the stories 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.010
 Now here for example it's gone 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.610
 certainly already happened 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.080
 almonds so then I'll stop now 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.290
 few things that are already happening are like this 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.030
 cashew nuts or walnuts you can 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.880
 already peeled hazelnuts 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.070
 I still have peanuts here 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.660
 many different nuts that are yes 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.240
 just get in the pan and will 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.890
 biggest that can only be very short 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.740
 the very short so that they completely 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.930
 briefly unfold their aroma and that is 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:07.070
 actually already the hardest 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:07.070
 sister, let's wait a moment, okay 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.830
 saved from the other she takes 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.660
 Rostock 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.390
 because he takes the drop short 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.560
 cool down so you become yours 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.580
 I have written down here now 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.230
 professionals 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.690
 I had no other pen he is 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.239
 maradona so fat but I hope everyone 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.870
 Nevertheless, it is mostly happy now 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.459
 pretty nice 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.640
 you take the honey and squeeze it like that 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.290
 to be here once so he dumped 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.200
 the whole thing off so I live here 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:50.550
 once in the container 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:53.220
 indeed the whole I can not I 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.640
 Press five minutes to fix and 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.640
 finished 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.500
 I would make the sofa now 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.660
 should leave a little space because 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.980
 now the nuts with it riders of iptv 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.680
 rusted list is a natural one 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:21.490
 have clean sterile hands and then give birth 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:26.479
 you just on top of the vanilla bean 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:30.380
 Just turn a little bit then 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:32.990
 reinstetten then there is the honey 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:38.840
 another vanilla note as well as the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:42.770
 you have done that and then you have 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.500
 your homemade vanilla honey 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.880
 must mix it is relatively fast 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.110
 and you can also see that her own 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.600
 did because her you have to 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.330
 equipped and I think that is relative 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.370
 long lasting so you can too 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.020
 now after a cost point can 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.539
 I sometimes tell you so again 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.960
 Make sure that it is important 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:05.419
 the 350 works cost these glasses 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.220
 there is always said with them 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:13.070
 then get the earth mass mixture 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.560
 you also with 250 and the vanilla bean 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.240
 costs again so two euro so 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.430
 there you are with 56 euro each 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.900
 case, but I can say anyway 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.419
 grandma i did not do it for you 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.860
 Mine you are honey honey 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:35.210
 do not do it yourself but it is always 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:36.620
 again something is without it first 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.169
 always stand watch at the checkout 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.970
 I hope this little kitchen video and 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.080
 you can see it quickly has fun 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.430
 even if it may be one 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.800
 It was a bit hectic for me 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.090
 really sorry but i have to go now 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.080

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.010
