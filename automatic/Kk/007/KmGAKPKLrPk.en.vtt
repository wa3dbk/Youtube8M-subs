this<00:04:11.560> is<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.829> last<00:04:12.040> thing<00:04:12.280> we<00:04:12.670> don't<00:04:13.329> have

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
this is the last thing we don't have

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.630 
this is the last thing we don't have
here<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:13.870> group<00:04:14.140> of<00:04:14.290> two<00:04:14.530> kids<00:04:14.799> but<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:15.430> can

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
here a group of two kids but you can

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.340 
here a group of two kids but you can
trust<00:04:15.819> me<00:04:15.969> that<00:04:16.090> if<00:04:16.329> we<00:04:16.449> continued<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:17.169> would

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
trust me that if we continued it would

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.270 
trust me that if we continued it would
be<00:04:17.500> there<00:04:17.729> so<00:04:18.729> we<00:04:18.820> have<00:04:19.000> 8<00:04:19.239> CS<00:04:20.009> X's<00:04:21.009> on<00:04:21.160> the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
be there so we have 8 CS X's on the

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.840 
be there so we have 8 CS X's on the
piano

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
piano

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.150 
piano
eight<00:04:22.389> octaves<00:04:23.050> what<00:04:23.320> is<00:04:23.440> an<00:04:23.560> octave<00:04:23.889> an

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
eight octaves what is an octave an

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.700 
eight octaves what is an octave an
octave<00:04:24.759> is<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.360> range<00:04:25.539> between<00:04:25.750> one<00:04:26.199> C<00:04:26.500> and

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
octave is the range between one C and

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.890 
octave is the range between one C and
the<00:04:26.919> other<00:04:27.100> or<00:04:27.490> let's<00:04:27.880> say<00:04:28.030> between<00:04:28.210> one<00:04:28.600> note

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
the other or let's say between one note

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.290 
the other or let's say between one note
and<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.620> other<00:04:29.800> note<00:04:30.100> on<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.400> higher<00:04:30.820> register

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
and the other note on a higher register

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.950 
and the other note on a higher register
so<00:04:31.990> you<00:04:32.050> actually<00:04:32.410> play<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.310> same<00:04:33.490> note<00:04:33.699> only

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
so you actually play the same note only

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.749 
so you actually play the same note only
higher<00:04:35.009> next<00:04:36.009> we're<00:04:36.250> going<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.430> discuss

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
higher next we're going to discuss

higher next we're going to discuss
middle<00:04:37.120> C<00:04:37.389> middle<00:04:37.840> C<00:04:38.050> is<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.919> C<00:04:39.160> which<00:04:39.669> is

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
middle C middle C is the C which is

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.600 
middle C middle C is the C which is
found<00:04:40.060> in<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.330> middle<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.810> piano<00:04:41.610> let's

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
found in the middle of the piano let's

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.820 
found in the middle of the piano let's
see<00:04:43.949> it<00:04:44.949> here<00:04:45.870> okay<00:04:46.870> it's<00:04:47.259> just<00:04:47.349> right<00:04:47.800> there

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
see it here okay it's just right there

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.730 
see it here okay it's just right there
in<00:04:48.009> the<00:04:48.280> middle<00:04:48.750> about<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.900> middle<00:04:50.169> C<00:04:50.410> is<00:04:50.560> the

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
in the middle about the middle C is the

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.400 
in the middle about the middle C is the
higher<00:04:50.949> register<00:04:53.009> and<00:04:54.900> under<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:56.020> is<00:04:56.349> the

higher register and under it is the
lower<00:04:56.889> register<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:01.210> let's<00:05:01.389> have<00:05:01.479> a<00:05:01.599> short

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.020 
lower register so let's have a short
summary<00:05:02.139> of<00:05:02.470> what<00:05:02.680> we've<00:05:02.860> learned<00:05:03.070> where<00:05:03.910> we

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
summary of what we've learned where we

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.120 
summary of what we've learned where we
go<00:05:04.180> higher<00:05:04.479> at<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.960> piano<00:05:05.169> we<00:05:05.680> go<00:05:05.830> to<00:05:05.889> the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
go higher at the piano we go to the

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.279 
go higher at the piano we go to the
right<00:05:06.280> where<00:05:07.030> we<00:05:07.180> go<00:05:07.360> lower<00:05:07.570> we<00:05:07.840> go<00:05:07.990> to<00:05:08.050> the

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
right where we go lower we go to the

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.860 
right where we go lower we go to the
left<00:05:08.580> these<00:05:09.580> are<00:05:09.849> named<00:05:10.090> after<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.570> letters

left these are named after the letters
of<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.349> ABC<00:05:11.949> starting<00:05:12.520> from<00:05:12.699> a<00:05:12.970> which<00:05:13.240> is<00:05:13.510> the

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
of the ABC starting from a which is the

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.189 
of the ABC starting from a which is the
lowest<00:05:14.229> key<00:05:14.530> on<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.949> piano<00:05:15.190> a<00:05:16.139> b<00:05:17.139> c<00:05:17.409> d<00:05:17.979> e<00:05:18.520> f<00:05:18.970> G<00:05:19.960> a

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.320 
and we can also backwards AG f e d c b a
and<00:05:26.020> then<00:05:26.949> we've<00:05:27.400> learned<00:05:27.610> how<00:05:27.820> to<00:05:27.849> orient

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
and then we've learned how to orient

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.110 
and then we've learned how to orient
ourselves<00:05:28.479> with<00:05:29.229> the<00:05:29.349> Black<00:05:29.590> Keys<00:05:30.000> we<00:05:31.000> are
