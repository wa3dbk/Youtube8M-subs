00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.290
 much of the happiness we feel in 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.720
 life is born from the relationship with other 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.030
 people usually our 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.580
 interactions are pleasant and not 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.190
 they produce more stress but from time to time 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.880
 when the attitude of others can 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.440
 come to offend or mortify us 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.630
 it seems to be a natural component of 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.510
 human experience which sometimes 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.630
 someone would offend us the criticism of a 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.599
 familiar a misunderstanding at work or 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.350
 the unfriendly attitude of a neighbor are 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.999
 all things that may offend us 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.699
 it is almost inevitable that in some 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:41.559
 moment the behavior of another person is 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.100
 counterpose what one would have 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:48.420
 preferred and we feel hurt when 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.219
 those things happen we have two options 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.489
 we can nest feelings of 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.069
 resentment or face the offense of a 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.149
 constructive way and set aside the 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:00.149
 negative feelings 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.710
 It is normal to feel anger or frustration 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.840
 towards other people but keep those 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.560
 feelings and let them grow and 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.870
 Fermenting is unnecessary even if we are 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.540
 victims of an inconsiderate act 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.710
 we can get to harm us even more 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.680
 if we decide to hold the grudge but not 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.280
 we can escape the offense well we can 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.200
 avoid the destructive results is 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.570
 much better to acknowledge the suffering 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.570
 caused by bad feelings and put 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.030
 end to them find a way to solve 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.119
 the matter in a positive way with 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.580
 kindness and compassion towards oneself and 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.490
 to the aggressor when applying the truth 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.369
 that we find in the proverb that says 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.430
 soft response removes anger we can 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.430
 achieve the promise of the psalmist much peace 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.490
 have those who love tulÃ©yev hino there 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.789
 for them I stumble, so that nothing 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.460
 offend the initial pain of the offense 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.070
 maybe it's inevitable but if we can 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.150
 avoid prolonged suffering if 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.080
 we decided to 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.080
 feel offended
