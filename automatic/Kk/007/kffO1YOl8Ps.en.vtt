00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
story goes is this there's two areas or

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.680 
story goes is this there's two areas or
three<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:46.710> cases<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.090> melon<00:00:48.420> heads

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
three in some cases that the melon heads

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.680 
three in some cases that the melon heads
lurk<00:00:49.230> around<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> US<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.510> they<00:00:51.660> are

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
lurk around in the US and what they are

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.760 
lurk around in the US and what they are
are<00:00:52.199> essentially<00:00:52.920> small<00:00:53.870> humanoids<00:00:54.870> with

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
are essentially small humanoids with

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.060 
are essentially small humanoids with
giant<00:00:56.370> bulbous<00:00:57.030> heads<00:00:57.390> hence<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.230> name<00:00:58.379> melon

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
giant bulbous heads hence the name melon

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.389 
giant bulbous heads hence the name melon
heads<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.420> legends<00:01:00.870> go<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.190> go
