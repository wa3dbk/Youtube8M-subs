00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.309
 In which country in the world are there more vineyards in 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.750
 Spain 'our country is one of the 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.150
 main producers and exporters 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.099
 the Spanish wine sector has known 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.320
 reinvent themselves as few to compete 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.360
 successfully in the toughest markets has 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.029
 there have been changes of taste and that man 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.470
 but keep your way of working not 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.640
 try to keep the essence of what 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.110
 you want to offer any had is that 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.849
 never forget what happens in the 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:34.059
 market what are the likes of the 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:35.980
 consumer adapt or die the success of 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.840
 Our wines are shown by the fact 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.760
 that in the last four years despite 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.860
 of the crisis sales abroad 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.840
 have continued to increase both in value 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.420
 as in volume during the first 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.220
 semester of 2011 exports of 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.560
 wine reached something over one billion 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.390
 of euros a growth of 20 per 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.350
 percent over the same period of the year 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.420
 previous this success is not casual it should be 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.550
 to the effort that for the past 30 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.470
 years have made the wineries of all 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.659
 the regions in innovation and 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.939
 marketing to achieve wines from 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.979
 quality recognized by experts 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.530
 as for the general public in what 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.600
 it has been called silent revolution 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.909
 not Spanish, I suggest that more than one 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.860
 revolution what has been there are three 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.090
 revolutions there was a first revolution 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.400
 I believe from the point of view 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.840
 We were very concerned about the technological 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.970
 good wines and therefore the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.950
 investments in many wineries were 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.940
 towards hiring good winemakers 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.830
 also towards the equipment with good 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.170
 barrel deposits everything related 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.780
 with the cellar and with the good elaboration 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.210
 the first thing that I thought 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.539
 with my first vineyard that was a cabernet 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.509
 sauvignon that comes from the burgundy the 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.720
 medoc area fundamentally bring me to 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.280
 the greatest world authority 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.380
 in Bordeaux wines that was the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.090
 professor of enology of the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.300
 Bordeaux University of Bill Payne or 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.820
 mister peino put some glues 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.790
 but finally it appeared around here in 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.680
 August of the year 82 and he told me that this 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.290
 is doing 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.300
 have my blessings and little feel 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.430
 I will help make one of the best 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.960
 Spain wines innovations 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.090
 technologies in the process of 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.950
 vinification improved the quality of the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.110
 wines but you had to take another step 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.520
 then we check that you can not 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.190
 do miracles in the cellar and that was 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.110
 absolutely fundamental that the grape 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.750
 came well from the field then there was a 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.240
 second revolution in the vineyard where 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.670
 there were extraordinary investments 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.010
 as to 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230
 the way of driving the vineyard in 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.000
 Regarding the varieties in terms of 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.930
 Irrigation fertigation means everything 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.930
 related to the grape 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.069
 a part of that revolution was made here 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.660
 in this farm 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.569
 I bring myself from israel- irrigation by 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.569
 drip where today all children 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.160
 of california de australia de espaÃ±a or 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.650
 from any country that water Chile 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.330
 Argentina or South Africa laugh at this 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.680
 system but here we were the pioneers to 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.659
 world level 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.879
 we can read the floors but now 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.019
 we can say okay this has more iron 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.329
 less iron more nitrogen we see 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.010
 nitrogen and say okay now applied this 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.959
 for I am so not because yes or 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.430
 be that there has been a change that 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.810
 the same before it was then I'm going to do it 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.400
 because they tell me I think I have to do 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.560
 now it's fashionable that I have to 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.900
 take a good turn because it's me that will not do 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.659
 with technology we can say well 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.459
 35 years they did not arrive because they did not 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.409
 they do it and how well I came to the vineyard 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.910
 do not do it then now yes the 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:34.350
 decisions are more rational 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.170
 if we compare a little the way of doing 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.790
 of 30 years ago with the way of doing 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.440
 now it's different and the style wines 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.760
 it has also been changing 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.340
 I insist we have not changed our 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.170
 philosophy and our essence at the time 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.780
 elaborate the wines we have improved a lot 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.090
 when it comes to working in the vineyard but 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.760
 we have also managed to update a 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.350
 little the kind of wine and the big change 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.420
 for me how important it has been has 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.040
 been above all how you are taking care of yourself 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.940
 vineyard now and the raw material the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.090
 quality grapes that are 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.090
 working 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.340
 work in viticulture is shaping up 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.349
 also as the key to consolidate a 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.319
 image of Spanish wines at medium 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.650
 path between the old and the new world 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.870
 I think if we play both at 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.540
 that we are on the one hand europe and on the other 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.600
 side that we have that climate 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.380
 of sunshine and wonderful light of the new 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.460
 world spain has a unique position in 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.460
 the world of videos 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.890
 an own identity necessary for 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.810
 differentiate and face the one that could 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.580
 be the third revolution in the world of 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.580
 internationalization came 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.280
 in markets in continuous movement 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.680
 the producers change and the wines 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.139
 they change in the main markets 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.060
 International highlights the incorporation 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.460
 from women to the world of wine as 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.990
 winemakers wineries consumers or 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.100
 responsible for large purchases 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.290
 chains 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.630
 I believe that in the end the wine is 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.460
 people it does not matter if they are men or 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.620
 women what is true is that and 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.240
 I'm super happy that every time there 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.120
 more women because because in the end we are 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.680
 different and we bring a touch of 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.300
 dynamism of sensitivity prestige 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.610
 International of Spanish gastronomy 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.380
 has been another element that has helped 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:30.260
 boost the image of Spanish wine in 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.260
 the outside the last key link 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.350
 extraordinary takeoff from the kitchen 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:40.000
 Spanish and that at this moment Spain 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:44.660
 Leader leads the world in kitchen 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.210
 innovative and that has given an image is 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.800
 that our gastronomy and therefore of 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.800
 our wines and olive oils 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.640
 unbeatable but there are still subjects 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.410
 earrings I the only thing I've done a 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.560
 a little bit less in some markets is 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.210
 this of the united image of Spain 'that 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.520
 I think it would help us a lot, I think 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.400
 that they are making very great wines 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:13.210
 in all regions and that that vision 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.250
 that being a Spanish wine places you 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.780
 at the same level as the French would be 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.370
 Wonderful, we do not have years left because 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.020
 obviously the French have it 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.430
 doing a long time but I think that 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.550
 we are there I believe that the quality 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.680
 we are there and what is needed is 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.340
 communicate it well and maybe in a way 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.340
 little more united 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.170
 Giving me a call
