getting the killer apps on that teeny
weeny<00:00:03.000> screen<00:00:03.449> how<00:00:03.720> you<00:00:03.780> gonna<00:00:03.929> do<00:00:04.170> it<00:00:04.319> yeah

weeny screen how you gonna do it yeah
it's<00:00:05.609> interesting<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:06.000> mean<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.180> Apple

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
it's interesting you mean the Apple

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.639 
it's interesting you mean the Apple
watch<00:00:06.509> gives<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.839> lot<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.049> opportunities<00:00:07.620> to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
watch gives a lot of opportunities to

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.250 
watch gives a lot of opportunities to
developers<00:00:08.340> with<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> small<00:00:09.510> screen<00:00:09.809> we're

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
developers with the small screen we're

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.230 
developers with the small screen we're
expecting<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.980> have<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> high<00:00:11.550> frequency<00:00:11.849> of

to<00:00:15.030> 10<00:00:15.240> seconds<00:00:15.690> we're<00:00:15.809> calling<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.109> micro

to news consumption traditionally this
has<00:00:20.430> been<00:00:20.550> done<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.970> larger<00:00:21.359> screen<00:00:21.539> format

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
has been done on a larger screen format

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.840 
has been done on a larger screen format
now<00:00:22.590> we're<00:00:22.769> lucky<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> case<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.430> suddenly

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
now we're lucky in the case of suddenly

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.550 
now we're lucky in the case of suddenly
in<00:00:23.970> yahoo<00:00:24.180> news<00:00:24.449> digest<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.140> we've<00:00:25.289> built<00:00:25.410> an

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
in yahoo news digest that we've built an

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.290 
in yahoo news digest that we've built an
algorithm<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.220> take<00:00:26.430> long<00:00:26.670> content<00:00:27.180> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
algorithm that can take long content and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.630 
algorithm that can take long content and
automatically<00:00:27.990> summarized<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.710> down<00:00:28.920> into

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
automatically summarized it down into

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.880 
automatically summarized it down into
the<00:00:29.760> salient<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.420> visual<00:00:30.750> points<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.710> as<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
the salient and visual points and as a

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.530 
the salient and visual points and as a
result<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.340> think<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.700> our<00:00:32.969> approach<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
result we think that our approach to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.810 
result we think that our approach to
news<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.010> be<00:00:35.130> great<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> Apple

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
news is going to be great on the Apple

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.850 
news is going to be great on the Apple
watch<00:00:35.969> given<00:00:36.450> those<00:00:36.570> constraints<00:00:37.050> all<00:00:37.649> right

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
watch given those constraints all right

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.799 
watch given those constraints all right
but<00:00:38.129> how<00:00:38.370> small<00:00:38.760> does<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> need<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.510> you're

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
but how small does it need to be you're

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
but how small does it need to be you're
saying<00:00:40.050> 5<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.559> 10<00:00:40.739> seconds<00:00:41.129> how<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.520> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
saying 5 to 10 seconds how you going to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.850 
saying 5 to 10 seconds how you going to
take<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> long-form<00:00:42.510> piece<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.960> news<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.469> get

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
take a long-form piece of news and get

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.069 
take a long-form piece of news and get
it<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.160> little<00:00:44.600> well<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> mean<00:00:45.750> you'll<00:00:45.899> see

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
it that little well I mean you'll see

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.910 
it that little well I mean you'll see
next<00:00:46.230> month<00:00:46.530> what<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> product

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
next month what the product

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.040 
next month what the product
manifestation<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> we've<00:00:48.510> been<00:00:48.629> thinking<00:00:48.989> a

manifestation is we've been thinking a
lot<00:00:49.079> about<00:00:49.230> what's<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.890> salient<00:00:50.399> univ

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
lot about what's the salient univ

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.130 
lot about what's the salient univ

information that we call atoms and so in
the<00:01:09.869> case<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.320> watch<00:01:10.530> we're<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.430> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the case of the watch we're going to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.520 
the case of the watch we're going to
give<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.479> visual<00:01:12.689> information<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.470> the

give you the visual information in the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.660 
give you the visual information in the
form<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.770> these<00:01:13.920> atoms<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:14.520> also

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
form of these atoms and then also

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.710 
form of these atoms and then also
something<00:01:15.000> interesting<00:01:15.450> around<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
something interesting around the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
something interesting around the
summarization<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.860> we've<00:01:16.950> been<00:01:17.009> doing<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.280> lot

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
summarization so we've been doing a lot

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.770 
summarization so we've been doing a lot
of<00:01:17.430> experiments<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.210> mean<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.450> were<00:01:18.540> fortunate

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
of experiments I mean we were fortunate

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.170 
of experiments I mean we were fortunate
at<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> Apple<00:01:19.380> approached<00:01:19.710> us<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.250> September

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
at the Apple approached us in September

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
at the Apple approached us in September
ahead<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> watch<00:01:21.780> launch<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.770> talk<00:01:23.159> about

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
ahead of the watch launch to talk about

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.310 
ahead of the watch launch to talk about
how<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:23.970> integrate<00:01:24.180> digest<00:01:24.780> into<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.170> so

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
how we would integrate digest into it so

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.530 
how we would integrate digest into it so
we've<00:01:25.439> had<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> long<00:01:25.830> time<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.540> conceptualize

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
we've had a long time to conceptualize

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.789
