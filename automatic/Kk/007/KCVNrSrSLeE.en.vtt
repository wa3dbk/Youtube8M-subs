00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:14.700
 There are no medals at hand yet, but I have no feeling at all 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:18.060
 A lot of cell phones rang 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:26.250
 I felt like I was finally done 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:28.590
 I have always been before the game, and I have a lot of exposure to the media when I'm in Japan 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.130
 I did not come 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.510
 First 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:39.030
 Before you go to the game 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.950
 Rather than saying that it goes out to the television or various things, you take the medal firmly and the competition feature 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.280
 After appealing 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.410
 Say your story in front of you on 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:52.250
 It is more persuasive to do 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:55.890
 In that fully spear Among that their 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.750
 We can appeal to people of the people 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.380
 Because 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:08.370
 I think Naa was a medal with very valuable in the sense that went so 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:12.360
 I really went to some pens and basic skis and various skis, and now I am turning a half pipe 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.870
 Say because I became really just simply Olympic sport when it decided 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.920
 That's really the only reason 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:26.140
 There is a part that links in various places also technically 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.750
 Because I got rid of so many high walls in my own great 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.780
 not really 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.680
 And technology of Toka Alpine without the Tteyuu This It 's because of this is kept alive in now 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:41.030
 I think that is not it 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.030
 I don't think I should say that, but I think it was a bit late 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.440
 Tteyuu's really amazing the top three slip from crawling that book and the top 32 qualifying 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.790
 It was a thing 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.500
 Last 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.540
 I really didn't know until the shaking tower failed 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.640
 If she really makes a goal 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:07.110
 I think I already lost 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.410
 In that sense it is now over for the top two 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.920
 With a frank feeling 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.520
 Since the take firm medals among them 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:22.290
 I think it was really good in a sense 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:26.579
 If there are no Well Supporters Club started people cheering or was the local people 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.340
 Well I couldn't stand at this place, and I couldn't take a medal like this 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.269
 Because I think 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:38.190
 I think it's really a medal that everyone has taken 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:43.800
 Since the final goal was here after I turned to the competition 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:49.560
 It is I did not think to say so to say go to the amusement line over the past two years until now 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:54.380
 I did n't have any routines, and I've only been doing what I really do 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.380
 With confidence that everything will be okay 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:07.260
 As we challenged this tournament, it is the advance world cup in it and it is x game 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:11.939
 With confidence in its own way because he firmly results leave 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:16.530
 I think I might have spread , the final goal is here, as I said earlier 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:18.090
 I have no idea what to do in the future 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.640
 Well now 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.280
 I plan to go abroad once more from now 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:30.120
 Because there is 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:34.530
 The Fu such also I'm going to be invited to the event I'm is not empty tournament the first time 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.900
 Well this is a Japanese rider's rider up to now 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.000
 last week 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:44.890
 That is the opportunity to be called out for overseas events or exposed to overseas sound media. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:52.850
 Naa If Ikere paving also kind of way because there was no 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:56.500
 By the way, as a player who likes and likes 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.300
 It's still over 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.500
 That at all 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:07.980
 I think it will take time to reach the next goal 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.980
 A little here in the harbor also I think Naa do not want to aura
