00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.460 

I'm<00:05:31.800> not<00:05:32.070> sure<00:05:32.310> this<00:05:32.610> one<00:05:32.880> sleek<00:05:33.240> like<00:05:33.750> the

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
I'm not sure this one sleek like the

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.460 
I'm not sure this one sleek like the
colors<00:05:34.860> are<00:05:35.040> really<00:05:35.220> pretty<00:05:35.460> but<00:05:35.880> I<00:05:36.470> don't

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
colors are really pretty but I don't

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.660

I think after wearing it for some time
it<00:05:47.040> just<00:05:47.220> becomes<00:05:48.200> flaky<00:05:49.200> and<00:05:49.290> I<00:05:49.380> can't<00:05:49.680> deal
