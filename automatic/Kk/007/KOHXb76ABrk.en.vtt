00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.080 
okay now let's uh TN got rid of those
things<00:02:44.050> let's<00:02:44.980> uh<00:02:46.950> let's<00:02:47.950> reactivate<00:02:48.640> alright

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
things let's uh let's reactivate alright

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.330 
things let's uh let's reactivate alright
first<00:02:49.390> we<00:02:49.600> click<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.050> high-res<00:02:50.470> model<00:02:51.160> which

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
first we click the high-res model which

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.750 
first we click the high-res model which
had<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.760> multi-resolution<00:02:53.760> shift-click

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
had the multi-resolution shift-click

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.300 
had the multi-resolution shift-click
that<00:02:55.330> gives<00:02:55.540> me<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.780> low<00:02:55.960> res<00:02:56.170> model<00:02:56.620> now<00:02:57.280> we

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
that gives me the low res model now we

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.810 
that gives me the low res model now we
go<00:02:57.550> over<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.910> bake<00:02:58.090> options<00:02:58.800> baked

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
go over to the bake options baked

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.970 
go over to the bake options baked
selected<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:00.940> active<00:03:01.510> I'll<00:03:02.440> explain<00:03:02.740> that<00:03:02.920> in

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
selected to active I'll explain that in

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.420 
selected to active I'll explain that in
a<00:03:03.100> second<00:03:03.520> we<00:03:03.670> want<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:03.940> normals<00:03:04.830> baked<00:03:05.830> all

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
a second we want to normals baked all

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.520 
a second we want to normals baked all
right<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:06.880> should<00:03:07.120> do<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.390> trick<00:03:07.510> now<00:03:08.350> how

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
right this should do the trick now how

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.620 
right this should do the trick now how
this<00:03:08.710> works<00:03:08.770> is<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.490> takes<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.880> selected<00:03:10.450> the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
this works is it takes the selected the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.360 
this works is it takes the selected the
first<00:03:10.900> selected<00:03:11.410> mesh<00:03:11.650> which<00:03:11.920> was<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.250> one

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
first selected mesh which was the one

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.970 
first selected mesh which was the one
with<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:12.580> multi<00:03:12.970> res<00:03:13.180> high<00:03:13.540> poly<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.290> lot<00:03:14.830> of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
with the multi res high poly a lot of

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.880 
with the multi res high poly a lot of
detail<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:16.210> bakes<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.810> normals<00:03:17.290> on<00:03:17.530> to

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
detail and it bakes the normals on to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.100 
detail and it bakes the normals on to
the<00:03:18.400> active<00:03:18.910> one<00:03:19.120> which<00:03:19.360> was<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.720> low<00:03:19.870> poly

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
the active one which was the low poly

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.260 
the active one which was the low poly
and<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.560> see<00:03:20.740> we've<00:03:20.920> got<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.130> right<00:03:21.340> there<00:03:21.610> so

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
and you see we've got it right there so

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.180 
and you see we've got it right there so
now<00:03:22.450> let's<00:03:22.780> go<00:03:22.960> to<00:03:23.020> our<00:03:23.200> low<00:03:23.470> pot<00:03:23.710> now<00:03:23.890> save

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
now let's go to our low pot now save

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.370 
now let's go to our low pot now save
this<00:03:24.400> image<00:03:24.610> image<00:03:25.210> save<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.870> image<00:03:26.170> as

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
this image image save the image as

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.840 
this image image save the image as
whatever<00:03:26.710> save<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.340> on<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.490> your<00:03:27.610> hard<00:03:27.790> drive

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
whatever save it on to your hard drive

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.090 
whatever save it on to your hard drive
you're<00:03:28.180> not<00:03:28.330> going<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.510> want<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.780> do<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.110> into

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
you're not going to want to do it into

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.220 
you're not going to want to do it into
the<00:03:30.190> temporary<00:03:30.820> cache<00:03:31.180> which<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:31.750> in<00:03:32.050> this

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
the temporary cache which is in this

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.750 
the temporary cache which is in this
window<00:03:32.560> right<00:03:32.590> here<00:03:32.770> but<00:03:33.190> I'm<00:03:33.280> doing<00:03:33.550> it<00:03:33.610> just

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
window right here but I'm doing it just

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.470 
window right here but I'm doing it just
for<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.030> sake<00:03:34.209> of<00:03:34.270> this<00:03:35.010> tutorial<00:03:36.390> let's<00:03:37.709> see

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
for the sake of this tutorial let's see

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.360 
for the sake of this tutorial let's see
UV<00:03:40.480> mapping<00:03:41.610> sampling<00:03:42.610> is<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:42.940> normal<00:03:43.570> map

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
UV mapping sampling is the normal map

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.640 
UV mapping sampling is the normal map
and<00:03:45.370> now<00:03:45.610> we<00:03:45.670> want<00:03:46.300> not<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.810> color<00:03:47.050> but<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
and now we want not the color but the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.160 
and now we want not the color but the
normal<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.250> now<00:03:48.580> if<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:49.000> go<00:03:49.030> into<00:03:49.209> alt<00:03:49.630> Z<00:03:49.870> I'm

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
normal and now if I go into alt Z I'm

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.300 
normal and now if I go into alt Z I'm
not<00:03:50.320> gonna<00:03:50.470> see<00:03:50.650> anything<00:03:50.830> let's<00:03:51.130> add<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> lamp

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
not gonna see anything let's add a lamp

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.740 
not gonna see anything let's add a lamp
point<00:03:54.310> lamp<00:03:54.520> and<00:03:54.790> now<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:54.940> can<00:03:55.209> see<00:03:55.420> that<00:03:55.600> we

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
point lamp and now you can see that we

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.470 
point lamp and now you can see that we
have<00:03:55.870> made<00:03:56.050> this<00:03:56.260> low<00:03:56.530> poly<00:03:56.830> mesh<00:03:57.160> look<00:03:58.120> like

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
have made this low poly mesh look like

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.340 
have made this low poly mesh look like
it<00:03:58.630> has<00:03:58.780> high<00:03:59.050> poly<00:03:59.410> wrinkles<00:04:00.370> on<00:04:00.550> it<00:04:00.580> okay<00:04:01.510> you

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
it has high poly wrinkles on it okay you

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.840 
it has high poly wrinkles on it okay you
can<00:04:02.500> do<00:04:02.590> that<00:04:02.620> for<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.040> entire<00:04:03.160> face<00:04:03.580> you<00:04:03.730> can

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
can do that for the entire face you can

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.280 
can do that for the entire face you can
do<00:04:03.940> that<00:04:04.090> for<00:04:04.240> muscles<00:04:04.600> you<00:04:04.780> can<00:04:04.900> do<00:04:04.990> that<00:04:05.140> for

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
do that for muscles you can do that for

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.940 
do that for muscles you can do that for
a<00:04:05.320> lot<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:05.530> things<00:04:05.770> talk<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.820> later
