 very good because we are going to make a wine a little different because it does not talk about 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.140
 is to youtube channels and with money the actor talks about six despite 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.139
 there are indications that assad 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.730
 the history of science back to goiás and researches why it does not want 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.810
 make a very big video and it turns out that people are not interested in things 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.319
 very different 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:26.429
 so I'm going to make a video showing how it's done and for whoever I want 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.220
 I'll show you a small example here. 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.500
 in its length 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.500
 is also known as cast cast 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.270
 it's an honor 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.830
 past 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.070
 so let's see how you work on the material you need 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.950
 use 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.330
 so let's go to the basic stuff we'll need 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.440
 a base 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.800
 Where are you going to apply the yes? 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.740
 which I recommend to be a little bit more resistant material than a sheet of 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.070
 craft an example isis calendars 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.690
 here is a half 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.330
 paperboard 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.330
 this material can be a great 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.390
 stronger card too 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.110
 or a6 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.680
 I will not be able to use 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.230
 this type of cardboard is corrugated cardboard 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.630
 because they do not know what they want corrugated cardboard is the one that has 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.620
 a structure inside 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.830
 with a skeleton criticizing 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.979
 This is not good to use. 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.520
 Most Used Material Threats After Directing X-Rays 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.000

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.710
 this good 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.100
 used 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.490
 It is a sturdier material that will last for a long time. 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.290
 then the six will use 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.560
 can use 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.880

 cut 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.750

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.229
