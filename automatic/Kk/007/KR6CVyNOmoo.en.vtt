00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
actually it's not identical on each of

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.560

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
access ginormous eyes so this is

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.220 
access ginormous eyes so this is
actually<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.740> one-sided<00:02:59.250> deck<00:02:59.750> which<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.900> kind

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
actually a one-sided deck which is kind

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.450 
actually a one-sided deck which is kind
of<00:03:01.380> weird<00:03:01.590> i<00:03:01.830> don't<00:03:01.860> know<00:03:02.010> why<00:03:02.130> they<00:03:02.280> did<00:03:02.430> that

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
of weird i don't know why they did that

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.050 
of weird i don't know why they did that
but<00:03:02.910> they<00:03:03.510> did<00:03:04.370> now<00:03:05.370> you'll<00:03:05.610> notice<00:03:05.640> then<00:03:05.970> you

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
but they did now you'll notice then you

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.490 
but they did now you'll notice then you
get<00:03:06.180> two<00:03:06.330> jokers<00:03:06.570> you've<00:03:06.840> got<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.050> guaranteed

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
get two jokers you've got the guaranteed

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.480 
get two jokers you've got the guaranteed
over<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:10.530> know<00:03:10.620> college<00:03:10.950> oak<00:03:11.160> which<00:03:11.340> is

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
over and you know college oak which is

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.990 
over and you know college oak which is
blue<00:03:11.730> because<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.210> blue<00:03:12.390> deck<00:03:13.940> alex<00:03:14.940> is

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
blue because of the blue deck alex is

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.800 
blue because of the blue deck alex is
actually<00:03:15.360> mixed<00:03:15.600> up

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.410 

the<00:03:19.290> ace<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.650> spades<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.099> actually<00:03:20.370> no<00:03:20.849> one

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.300 

I<00:03:23.480> suppose<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.950> is<00:03:26.380> just<00:03:27.380> enormous<00:03:27.560> of

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
I suppose that is just enormous of

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.350 
I suppose that is just enormous of
spades<00:03:29.890> but<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.190> thing<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.700> notice<00:03:31.940> is

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
spades but the thing that you notice is

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.080 
spades but the thing that you notice is
when<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.050> spread<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.530> deck<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.890> get<00:03:34.090> red

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
when you spread the deck you get red

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.600 
when you spread the deck you get red
cards<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.660> are<00:03:35.780> blue<00:03:37.569> so<00:03:38.569> when<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.840> do<00:03:38.959> fans

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
cards that are blue so when you do fans

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.300 
cards that are blue so when you do fans
kind<00:03:40.610> of<00:03:40.700> looks<00:03:40.880> like<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:41.920> mean<00:03:42.920> it<00:03:43.040> looks

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
kind of looks like that I mean it looks

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.830 
kind of looks like that I mean it looks
fine<00:03:43.640> personally<00:03:45.700> like<00:03:46.700> but<00:03:47.569> it's<00:03:47.660> kind<00:03:47.690> of

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
fine personally like but it's kind of

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.309 
fine personally like but it's kind of
weird<00:03:48.080> seeing<00:03:48.319> blue<00:03:48.620> as<00:03:48.830> well<00:03:49.190> as<00:03:50.319> like

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
weird seeing blue as well as like

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.130 
weird seeing blue as well as like
instead<00:03:51.709> of<00:03:51.769> red<00:03:52.239> um<00:03:53.680> so<00:03:54.680> yeah

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
instead of red um so yeah

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.440 
instead of red um so yeah
so<00:03:56.740> you<00:03:56.800> got<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.250> core<00:03:57.640> cars<00:03:57.880> now<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.150> court

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
too good because these waters are quite

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.380 
too good because these waters are quite
thick<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.720> mean<00:04:36.930> thin<00:04:37.200> I'm<00:04:37.620> not<00:04:37.800> like<00:04:38.390> they're

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
thick I mean thin I'm not like they're

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.170 
thick I mean thin I'm not like they're
quite<00:04:39.960> like<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:41.220> normal<00:04:41.400> cards<00:04:41.730> will<00:04:41.820> come<00:04:41.970> up

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
quite like the normal cards will come up

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.760 
quite like the normal cards will come up
closer<00:04:42.630> was<00:04:43.530> it<00:04:43.620> all<00:04:44.750> cards<00:04:45.750> up<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:46.110> good<00:04:46.470> fan

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
closer was it all cards up a good fan

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.860 
closer was it all cards up a good fan
come<00:04:47.040> up<00:04:47.160> closer<00:04:47.430> these<00:04:48.120> ones<00:04:48.300> action<00:04:48.600> don't

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
come up closer these ones action don't

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.020

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.390 
run very pretty good like any other deck
and<00:04:56.750> they<00:04:57.750> just<00:04:57.900> handle<00:04:58.380> like<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.530> new<00:04:58.890> bicycle

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400

and they just handle like a new bicycle
deck<00:05:01.310> think<00:05:02.310> these<00:05:02.460> guys<00:05:02.700> cards<00:05:03.180> do<00:05:03.360> clump<00:05:03.810> up

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
deck think these guys cards do clump up

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.550 
deck think these guys cards do clump up
after<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.590> while<00:05:05.330> but<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.510> get<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:07.020> with<00:05:07.260> any

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
after a while but you get that with any

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.520 
after a while but you get that with any
deck<00:05:09.020> unfortunately<00:05:11.030> so<00:05:12.030> yeah<00:05:12.300> that<00:05:12.930> has<00:05:13.320> been

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
deck unfortunately so yeah that has been
