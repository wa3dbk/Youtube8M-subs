the<00:02:15.860> top<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:18.440> fingerprints<00:02:19.310> aren't

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
the top the the fingerprints aren't

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.040 
the top the the fingerprints aren't
really<00:02:19.760> visible<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:20.330> if<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:20.630> look<00:02:20.750> closely

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
really visible but if you look closely

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.140 
really visible but if you look closely
you<00:02:21.260> will<00:02:21.319> see<00:02:21.440> somebody<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.580> course<00:02:22.819> headed

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
you will see somebody of course headed

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.090 
you will see somebody of course headed
this<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:23.780> their<00:02:23.930> hands<00:02:24.290> let's<00:02:24.769> check<00:02:24.950> out<00:02:25.069> the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
this in their hands let's check out the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.070 
this in their hands let's check out the
ports<00:02:25.430> we<00:02:25.610> have<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.030> headphone<00:02:26.780> microphone

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
ports we have the headphone microphone

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.820 
ports we have the headphone microphone
two<00:02:28.040> USB<00:02:28.430> ports<00:02:28.459> vga<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.660> Kensington<00:02:30.260> power

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
two USB ports vga and Kensington power

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.710 
two USB ports vga and Kensington power
port<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.250> again<00:02:31.489> on<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.819> side<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.330> like<00:02:32.510> that

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
port is again on the side I like that

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.699 
port is again on the side I like that
and<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:34.069> should<00:02:34.660> glow<00:02:35.660> in<00:02:35.900> blue<00:02:36.170> when<00:02:36.410> it's<00:02:36.530> on

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
and it should glow in blue when it's on

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.130 
and it should glow in blue when it's on
like<00:02:37.250> on<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.519> first<00:02:37.760> MC<00:02:38.209> 100<00:02:38.930> on<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.799> NC<00:02:40.489> 10

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
like on the first MC 100 on the NC 10

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.449 
like on the first MC 100 on the NC 10
first<00:02:42.140> netbook<00:02:42.440> by<00:02:42.560> Samsung<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.160> then<00:02:43.310> we

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
first netbook by Samsung and then we

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.610 
first netbook by Samsung and then we
have<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.640> sim<00:02:43.910> card<00:02:43.940> either<00:02:44.239> here<00:02:44.569> or<00:02:44.600> there<00:02:45.590> is

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
have a sim card either here or there is

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.280 
have a sim card either here or there is
a<00:02:45.799> dummy<00:02:46.130> portage<00:02:46.549> at<00:02:46.760> least<00:02:47.060> which<00:02:47.390> could

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
a dummy portage at least which could

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.740 
a dummy portage at least which could
hold<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.739> 3g<00:02:49.160> module<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.700> future<00:02:50.060> on<00:02:50.269> the

m-bit Lamport and fan and USB 2.0 port
that<00:02:59.959> gives<00:03:00.620> out<00:03:00.890> power<00:03:01.220> also<00:03:01.549> if<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.209> device

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
that gives out power also if the device

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.170 
that gives out power also if the device
is<00:03:02.480> off<00:03:02.870> which<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.200> pretty<00:03:03.470> nice<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:04.180> five

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
is off which is pretty nice and five

also and then we have an SD card reader
which<00:03:11.359> takes<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.140> whole<00:03:12.380> SD<00:03:13.340> card

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
which takes in the whole SD card

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.699 
which takes in the whole SD card
shouldn't<00:03:14.090> stick<00:03:14.269> out<00:03:14.420> too<00:03:14.600> much<00:03:14.780> then<00:03:15.079> on<00:03:15.290> the

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
shouldn't stick out too much then on the

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.440 
shouldn't stick out too much then on the
bottom<00:03:15.859> you<00:03:16.040> can<00:03:16.100> see<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.640> memory<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.060> easily

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
let's put in a battery and see how it

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.080 
let's put in a battery and see how it
looks<00:03:31.670> with<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.030> chunky<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.670> come<00:03:34.670> here<00:03:34.790> later<00:03:34.910> on

looks with a chunky I come here later on
the<00:03:35.269> bottom<00:03:35.570> as<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:35.900> can<00:03:36.049> see<00:03:36.320> sticks<00:03:37.010> out<00:03:37.160> a

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
the bottom as you can see sticks out a

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.000 
the bottom as you can see sticks out a
little<00:03:37.310> bit<00:03:37.609> not<00:03:38.000> too<00:03:38.030> much<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.859> yeah<00:03:39.859> it's

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
little bit not too much and yeah it's

little bit not too much and yeah it's
still<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.310> nice<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.790> swim<00:03:41.000> design<00:03:41.329> so<00:03:42.230> let's

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
still a nice and swim design so let's

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.030 
still a nice and swim design so let's
take<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.799> look<00:03:43.040> inside<00:03:44.319> ok<00:03:45.319> we<00:03:45.590> have<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.739> matte

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
take a look inside ok we have a matte

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.500 
take a look inside ok we have a matte
screen<00:03:47.019> not<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.170> mat<00:03:48.730> bezel<00:03:49.730> on<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:50.030> side<00:03:50.269> but

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
screen not the mat bezel on the side but

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.699 
screen not the mat bezel on the side but
it<00:03:50.840> has<00:03:51.109> small<00:03:51.590> dots<00:03:51.890> which<00:03:52.370> prevent<00:03:52.819> the

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
it has small dots which prevent the

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.280 
it has small dots which prevent the
bezel<00:03:54.709> from<00:03:55.299> having<00:03:56.299> too<00:03:56.510> many<00:03:56.690> fingerprints

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
bezel from having too many fingerprints

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.650 
bezel from having too many fingerprints
it<00:03:58.209> opens<00:03:59.209> up<00:03:59.329> and<00:04:00.170> all<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:01.069> way<00:04:01.100> all<00:04:02.000> this<00:04:02.450> way

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
it opens up and all the way all this way

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.900 
it opens up and all the way all this way
that's<00:04:03.170> not<00:04:03.410> too<00:04:03.709> much<00:04:03.889> but<00:04:04.130> enough<00:04:04.160> for<00:04:04.579> me<00:04:04.730> as

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
that's not too much but enough for me as

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.539 
that's not too much but enough for me as
a<00:04:05.299> person<00:04:05.870> was<00:04:06.290> one<00:04:06.560> meters<00:04:07.099> and<00:04:07.280> 90

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
a person was one meters and 90

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.199 
a person was one meters and 90
centimeters<00:04:08.060> that's<00:04:08.290> six<00:04:09.290> point<00:04:09.709> three<00:04:10.209> feet

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
centimeters that's six point three feet

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.520 
centimeters that's six point three feet
actually<00:04:11.480> so

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
actually so

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.190 
actually so

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
key on the left is a little bit bigger

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.490 
key on the left is a little bit bigger
than<00:04:16.519> on<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.760> right<00:04:16.910> but<00:04:17.090> otherwise<00:04:17.299> wow<00:04:18.260> this
