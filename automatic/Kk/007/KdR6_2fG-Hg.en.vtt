00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
with the analog stick so we'll just play

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.870 
with the analog stick so we'll just play
here<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.180> I'll<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> game<00:01:58.880> all

so<00:02:03.510> it's<00:02:03.660> very<00:02:03.900> simple<00:02:04.560> concept<00:02:04.830> it's<00:02:05.570> just<00:02:06.570> a

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
so it's very simple concept it's just a

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.130 
so it's very simple concept it's just a
Disney<00:02:07.140> basically<00:02:07.770> game<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.720> four

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
diff you have four lives here you have

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.940 
diff you have four lives here you have
your<00:02:12.390> screw<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:12.900> there<00:02:13.110> as<00:02:13.230> well<00:02:13.440> as<00:02:13.560> your<00:02:13.710> time

to build all these windows up oh that

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.420 
to build all these windows up oh that
was<00:02:42.510> close<00:02:42.750> there<00:02:43.080> alright<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.070> can<00:02:44.220> see

was close there alright so you can see
now<00:02:44.610> we're<00:02:44.790> moving<00:02:45.090> up<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:47.250> least<00:02:47.610> you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
now we're moving up the the least you

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.060 
now we're moving up the the least you
know<00:02:48.090> least<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.540> die<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.810> bigger<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.709> score

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
know least you die the bigger the score

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.250 
know least you die the bigger the score
you<00:02:50.190> get<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.610> faster<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.450> time<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.870> do<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.020> in

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
you get the faster the time you do it in

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.770 
you get the faster the time you do it in
the<00:02:52.410> more<00:02:52.680> score<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.190> get<00:02:53.400> also<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:54.600> that's

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
the more score you get also so that's

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.140 
the more score you get also so that's
how<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:54.989> works<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:56.520> move<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.880> throughout

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
how that works as you move on throughout

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.910 
how that works as you move on throughout
the<00:02:57.390> game<00:02:57.540> you'll<00:02:57.780> have<00:02:57.930> flower<00:02:58.260> beds<00:02:58.709> and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
the game you'll have flower beds and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.580 
the game you'll have flower beds and
stuff<00:02:59.330> protecting<00:03:00.330> window<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:00.900> we<00:03:01.140> harder<00:03:01.470> to

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
stuff protecting window so we harder to

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.070 
stuff protecting window so we harder to
get<00:03:01.709> away<00:03:01.830> from<00:03:02.010> me<00:03:02.570> stuffy's<00:03:03.570> throwing<00:03:03.900> at

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
get away from me stuffy's throwing at

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:19.100 
get away from me stuffy's throwing at
you

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.350 

okay<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.010> there's<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.400> pie<00:03:20.670> that's<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.150> power

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
okay so there's a pie that's the power

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.030 
okay so there's a pie that's the power
up<00:03:21.570> all<00:03:21.990> right<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.530> see<00:03:22.680> if<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:22.890> get

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
up all right so you can see if you get

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.650 
up all right so you can see if you get
that<00:03:23.190> pie<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.580> gives<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> power<00:03:24.420> up

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
that pie it gives you a power up

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.990 
that pie it gives you a power up
basically<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.920> is<00:03:25.980> kind<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.460> a<00:03:26.520> Mario

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
basically this is kind of like a Mario

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.370 
basically this is kind of like a Mario
knock<00:03:27.300> off<00:03:27.600> now<00:03:27.900> I'm<00:03:28.620> pretty<00:03:29.250> much<00:03:29.310> invincible

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
knock off now I'm pretty much invincible

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.600 
knock off now I'm pretty much invincible
all<00:03:31.380> right<00:03:31.500> so<00:03:31.680> we<00:03:31.800> just<00:03:31.980> completed<00:03:32.250> that

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
all right so we just completed that

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.220 
all right so we just completed that
stage<00:03:32.940> there<00:03:33.270> now<00:03:33.510> we're<00:03:33.690> moving<00:03:33.810> on<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.110> the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
stage there now we're moving on to the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.560 
stage there now we're moving on to the
next<00:03:34.350> there's<00:03:35.280> quite<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.610> few<00:03:35.700> stages<00:03:36.120> in<00:03:36.450> the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
next there's quite a few stages in the

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.300 
next there's quite a few stages in the
game<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.930> can<00:03:37.080> pretty<00:03:37.290> much<00:03:37.380> keep<00:03:37.770> going<00:03:38.160> and

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
game you can pretty much keep going and

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.510 
game you can pretty much keep going and
going<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.900> does<00:03:40.380> end<00:03:40.590> at<00:03:40.740> some<00:03:40.980> point<00:03:41.280> though<00:03:41.490> I

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
going it does end at some point though I

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.940 
going it does end at some point though I
haven't<00:03:41.850> got<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.150> far<00:03:42.420> yet<00:03:42.690> I've<00:03:43.500> gotten

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.090 
haven't got that far yet I've gotten
about<00:03:44.160> stage<00:03:44.520> 4<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.240> then<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.350> died<00:03:46.590> because<00:03:46.860> it

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
about stage 4 and then I died because it

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.410 
about stage 4 and then I died because it
gets<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.550> gets<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:47.820> lot<00:03:47.970> more<00:03:48.030> challenging

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
gets it gets a lot more challenging

00:03:48.420 --> 00:04:01.090 
gets it gets a lot more challenging
awful<00:03:49.080> here<00:03:49.290> until<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.590> die

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.670 

but<00:04:02.100> this<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.400> basically<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:02.940> game<00:04:03.270> and<00:04:03.680> as

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
but this is basically the game and as

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.830 
but this is basically the game and as
you<00:04:04.800> move<00:04:04.980> on<00:04:05.220> farther<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.090> farther<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.690> will

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
you move on farther and farther it will

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.150 
you move on farther and farther it will
get<00:04:06.990> harder<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:07.410> harder<00:04:07.500> they<00:04:07.830> will<00:04:07.950> start

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
get harder and harder they will start

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.190 
get harder and harder they will start
being<00:04:08.430> birds<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:08.940> come<00:04:09.180> out<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.660> they're

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
being birds that come out and they're

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.140 
being birds that come out and they're
flying<00:04:10.590> over<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.310> have<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.580> dodge<00:04:11.790> in

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
flying over that you have to dodge in

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.730 
flying over that you have to dodge in
there<00:04:12.360> will<00:04:12.450> be<00:04:12.540> windows<00:04:13.020> that<00:04:13.320> will<00:04:13.470> get<00:04:13.650> in

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
there will be windows that will get in

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.849 
there will be windows that will get in
the<00:04:13.770> way<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.220> stuff<00:04:14.900> like<00:04:15.900> here<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.290> can<00:04:16.590> see

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
the way and stuff like here you can see

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.099 
the way and stuff like here you can see
these<00:04:17.400> shutters<00:04:17.760> will<00:04:18.060> open<00:04:18.510> so<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.780> can't

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
these shutters will open so you can't

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.800 
these shutters will open so you can't
move<00:04:19.380> across<00:04:19.709> them<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.120> can't<00:04:21.390> move<00:04:21.630> in

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
move across them so you can't move in

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.420 
move across them so you can't move in
like<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.170> direction<00:04:22.530> would<00:04:22.740> have<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.190> jump

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
like that direction would have to jump

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.250 
like that direction would have to jump
over<00:04:23.610> or<00:04:23.940> something<00:04:24.270> like<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.840> can<00:04:25.080> see

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
over or something like that you can see

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.700 
over or something like that you can see
I<00:04:25.290> can't<00:04:25.590> go<00:04:25.710> down<00:04:25.920> there<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.820> flower<00:04:27.120> beds

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
I can't go down there that flower beds

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.990 
I can't go down there that flower beds
so<00:04:28.710> that's<00:04:28.950> how<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.250> gets<00:04:29.400> harder<00:04:29.790> in<00:04:29.880> this

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
so that's how it gets harder in this

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.300 
so that's how it gets harder in this
game<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.510> he<00:04:30.690> starts<00:04:31.020> throwing<00:04:31.230> stuff<00:04:31.740> faster

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
game and he starts throwing stuff faster

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:42.570 
game and he starts throwing stuff faster
at<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.640> would<00:04:32.940> today

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.089 

so<00:04:43.300> this<00:04:43.449> is<00:04:43.599> basically<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:44.110> game<00:04:44.409> overall<00:04:44.889> I

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
so this is basically the game overall I

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.309 
so this is basically the game overall I
give<00:04:45.340> wreck-it<00:04:45.789> Ralph<00:04:46.060> four<00:04:46.780> stars<00:04:47.080> out<00:04:47.259> of
