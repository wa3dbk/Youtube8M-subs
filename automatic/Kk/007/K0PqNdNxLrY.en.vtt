00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.190
 width will be 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.310
 44 centimeters long 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.310
 it's going to be 78 centimeters to cut 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.550
 also this that of width is of 12 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.550
 centimeters long is 24 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.630
 centimeters for about this line here 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.220
 so that it closes so nice in the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:35.870
 portfolio the folder as they call it is 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.780
 they are going to do they are going to grab their rule 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.960
 from here 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.090
 but from here I want them to another 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.100
 corner then they will be like that 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.580
 little bit and that's it 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.030
 taking it like this they should 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.490
 but then they're going to fold them like that 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.740
 half to fold them for the other half 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.310
 A) Yes 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.130
 and already to do this also from this 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.550
 side are going to give the center of the cardboard 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.320
 and they are going to do this 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.830
 well and the solito folded unless 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.920
 obviously they are going to pressure and 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.630
 they look like that must be like that 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.220
 after that they will occupy a needle 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.340
 cloak that is this is called needle 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.690
 capotera here in Mexico so we call 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.560
 needle cover because it's too much 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.370
 large and thick will also occupy the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.890
 ribbon when you want the ribbon 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.140
 paper contact also and let's start 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.620

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.889
 it is a paper that already has the adhesive 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.010
 from the back they no longer need 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.319
 this one put you or nothing has to 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.569
 cut it a little more outside as per 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.870
 here so you can double it for 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.319

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.780
 and already look good well fine nice here if 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:32.790
 they realize that you see they already have the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.790
 time deposits then let's sew 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.989

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.610
 cost of things as well as states 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.610
 more ratios upon completion 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.750

 on the internet to make a folder these and 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.610
 from amia this is my idea came out of me like this 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.760

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:51.350
 and the paper hits sticks are going to stick here 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:54.280
 and they are going to hit it here arribita so that 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.280
 at the time of closing 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:06:00.680
 It was nice 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.190
 and there is the background very nice well 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.190

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.280

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.310
 also in the part up here or 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.560

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.970
