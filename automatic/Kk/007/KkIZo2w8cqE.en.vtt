00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
this surface here which we sell with

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.440 
this surface here which we sell with
relative<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.830> surface<00:00:32.130> there<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.270> when

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
relative to that surface there so when

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.600 
relative to that surface there so when
we<00:00:33.570> measure<00:00:34.760> cross<00:00:36.469> vehicle<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.890> way<00:00:38.160> right

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
we measure cross vehicle this way right

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.090 
we measure cross vehicle this way right
you<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.940> from<00:00:39.239> down<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.829> then<00:00:40.980> when

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you know from down here and then when

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.130 
you know from down here and then when
you<00:00:41.190> extend<00:00:41.430> off<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.000> back<00:00:42.629> surface

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you extend off of that back surface

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.040 
you extend off of that back surface
there<00:00:43.789> they<00:00:44.789> are<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.120> same<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> want<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
there they are the same now so I want to

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.080 
there they are the same now so I want to
put<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> engine<00:00:46.710> that's<00:00:47.399> yeah<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.000> we

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
put it on the engine that's yeah but we

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.420 
put it on the engine that's yeah but we
did<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> compass<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.020> know<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.430> that's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
did a compass that you know so that's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.709 
did a compass that you know so that's
what<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.820> was<00:00:50.969> trying<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.210> accomplish<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
what I was trying to accomplish it

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.180 
what I was trying to accomplish it
accomplished<00:00:52.590> right<00:00:52.940> but<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.829> on

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
accomplished right but now this here on

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.490 
accomplished right but now this here on
this<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.610> had<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> little<00:00:57.120> step<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.320> then

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
this one had the little step and then

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.229 
this one had the little step and then
we're<00:00:58.620> back<00:00:58.739> here<00:00:58.949> had<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.760> radius<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
we're back here had the radius so I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.630 
we're back here had the radius so I
didn't<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> chamfer<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.500> bench<00:01:02.219> side<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
didn't have to chamfer the bench side of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
didn't have to chamfer the bench side of
this<00:01:02.789> clutch<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.300> had<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> had<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> do

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this clutch I had that I had to do

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
this clutch I had that I had to do
otherwise<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.280> won't<00:01:05.339> sit<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.760> flush<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.210> there

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
otherwise I won't sit up flush in there

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.359 
otherwise I won't sit up flush in there
but<00:01:06.450> once<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.750> did<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.830> dude<00:01:08.040> stood<00:01:08.280> up

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
but once I did that this dude stood up

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.399 
but once I did that this dude stood up
nice<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.210> common<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> measurements

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
nice and it was common the measurements

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.420 
nice and it was common the measurements
with<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.490> original<00:01:11.939> engine<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.369> I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
with the original engine so I you know I

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.039 
with the original engine so I you know I
don't<00:01:14.549> need<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.030> spacer<00:01:15.509> because<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.960> was

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
don't need this spacer because I was

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.120 
don't need this spacer because I was
thinking<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> got<00:01:16.740> thrown<00:01:16.979> off<00:01:17.100> a

thinking I think I got thrown off a
little<00:01:17.250> bit<00:01:17.520> because<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:18.530> I<00:01:19.530> don't<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:19.920> maybe

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
little bit because of I don't know maybe

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.649 
little bit because of I don't know maybe

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.060 
the length of the crank I was cutting
out<00:01:21.720> wasn't<00:01:21.869> able<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> put<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.680> until<00:01:22.979> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
out wasn't able to put it on until I

muffler system the mount on there
and<00:01:56.740> this<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.130> what<00:01:57.369> I<00:01:57.399> had<00:01:57.640> on<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:58.530> original

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
and this is what I had on the original

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.130

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.890 
there was an adjustment for a spanner
wrench<00:03:33.190> when<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:33.459> take<00:03:33.669> this<00:03:33.819> off<00:03:34.030> on<00:03:34.359> the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
wrench when I take this off on the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.170 
wrench when I take this off on the
inside<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.130> kind<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.489> just<00:03:36.669> guessed<00:03:36.970> I'm

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
inside and I kind of just guessed I'm

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.550 
inside and I kind of just guessed I'm
that<00:03:37.720> big<00:03:38.669> you<00:03:39.669> know<00:03:39.790> circular<00:03:40.380> no<00:03:41.380> you're

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
that big you know circular no you're

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.860 
that big you know circular no you're
gonna<00:03:41.680> call<00:03:41.859> it<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.069> nut<00:03:42.310> anyways<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
gonna call it a nut anyways that the

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.270 
gonna call it a nut anyways that the
threads<00:03:44.230> were<00:03:44.349> a<00:03:44.410> few<00:03:44.590> threads<00:03:44.829> sticking<00:03:45.010> out

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
threads were a few threads sticking out

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.530 
threads were a few threads sticking out
when<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:45.549> take<00:03:45.730> this<00:03:45.849> off<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.239> piece<00:03:46.389> I'm

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
when you take this off that piece I'm

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.900 
when you take this off that piece I'm
talking<00:03:46.810> about<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:48.190> if<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.519> clutch<00:03:48.700> doesn't

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
talking about so if the clutch doesn't

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.210 
talking about so if the clutch doesn't
engage<00:03:49.209> or<00:03:49.630> disengage<00:03:49.769> quickly<00:03:50.769> enough<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.099> may

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
engage or disengage quickly enough I may

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.890 
engage or disengage quickly enough I may
have<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.400> play<00:03:51.579> with<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.940> little<00:03:52.030> bit<00:03:52.359> and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
have to play with that a little bit and

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.199 
have to play with that a little bit and
this<00:03:53.769> guy<00:03:53.980> here<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.220> just<00:03:54.250> picked<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.669> up<00:03:54.819> saying

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
this guy here I just picked it up saying

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.930 
this guy here I just picked it up saying
I<00:03:55.329> flew<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.660> put<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.620> back<00:03:56.650> well<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.489> mean<00:03:57.760> I

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
I flew it put it back well I mean I

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.920 
I flew it put it back well I mean I
obviously<00:03:58.120> want<00:03:58.389> to<00:03:58.450> get<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.599> engine<00:03:58.840> in

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
obviously want to get the engine in

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.140 
obviously want to get the engine in
because<00:03:59.109> it<00:03:59.260> they<00:03:59.950> really<00:04:00.220> want<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.489> off<00:04:00.639> when

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
because it they really want it off when

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.300 
because it they really want it off when
you<00:04:01.329> put<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.169> engine<00:04:02.380> back<00:04:02.410> in<00:04:02.709> then<00:04:03.099> I<00:04:03.190> can

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
you put the engine back in then I can

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.369 
you put the engine back in then I can
put<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.549> on<00:04:03.669> after<00:04:03.940> that<00:04:04.299> but<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:05.140> exhaust

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
put it on after that but the exhaust

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.809 
put it on after that but the exhaust
manifold<00:04:05.860> is<00:04:05.980> going<00:04:06.159> to<00:04:06.219> be<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> little<00:04:06.489> trick

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
manifold is going to be a little trick

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.179 
manifold is going to be a little trick
and<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.959> still<00:04:08.170> going<00:04:08.319> to<00:04:08.379> reinforce<00:04:08.799> this<00:04:08.920> even

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
and I still going to reinforce this even

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.870 
and I still going to reinforce this even
a<00:04:09.250> little<00:04:09.340> bit<00:04:09.489> more

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
a little bit more

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.760 
a little bit more
down<00:04:10.180> there<00:04:10.420> I<00:04:10.600> think<00:04:11.260> I<00:04:11.320> got<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:11.530> pretty<00:04:11.620> good

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
down there I think I got it pretty good

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.140 
down there I think I got it pretty good
but<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:12.040> like<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.280> reinforces<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.820> little<00:04:13.060> bit

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
but I like the reinforces a little bit

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.570 
but I like the reinforces a little bit
more<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:14.910> that's<00:04:15.910> about<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.209> for<00:04:16.330> now
