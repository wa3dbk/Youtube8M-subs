00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.280 
I did notice about this game is that it
seems<00:03:57.500> like<00:03:57.739> when<00:03:58.310> you<00:03:58.430> hold<00:03:58.790> on<00:03:59.090> it's<00:04:00.019> the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
seems like when you hold on it's the

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.710 
seems like when you hold on it's the
kickoff<00:04:00.530> show<00:04:00.799> it's<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.970> first<00:04:02.209> word<00:04:02.510> of<00:04:02.659> the

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
kickoff show it's the first word of the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.589 
kickoff show it's the first word of the
year<00:04:02.840> either<00:04:03.650> he<00:04:03.950> messed<00:04:04.250> up<00:04:04.549> or<00:04:04.819> I<00:04:04.849> messed<00:04:05.389> up

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
year either he messed up or I messed up

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.229 
year either he messed up or I messed up
and<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:05.959> guess<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.530> user<00:04:06.889> strip<00:04:07.489> did<00:04:07.790> not<00:04:07.970> tell

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
and I guess the user strip did not tell

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.080 
and I guess the user strip did not tell
y'all<00:04:08.450> just<00:04:08.900> like<00:04:09.139> it<00:04:09.349> last<00:04:09.620> year<00:04:10.099> this<00:04:10.639> strip
