alternate your man here I want to talk
to<00:00:06.979> you<00:00:07.069> about<00:00:07.160> the<00:00:07.910> big<00:00:08.270> three<00:00:08.540> wiring

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
to you about the big three wiring

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.320 
to you about the big three wiring
upgrade<00:00:09.920> ah<00:00:10.360> and<00:00:11.360> how<00:00:12.170> this<00:00:12.379> all<00:00:12.619> works

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
upgrade ah and how this all works

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.779 
upgrade ah and how this all works
Automotive<00:00:14.330> alternators<00:00:14.680> make<00:00:15.680> AC<00:00:16.010> current

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
Automotive alternators make AC current

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.109 
Automotive alternators make AC current
this<00:00:17.630> isn't<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.050> AC<00:00:18.230> sine<00:00:18.800> wave<00:00:19.130> basically<00:00:19.970> it

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
this isn't the AC sine wave basically it

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.909 
this isn't the AC sine wave basically it
goes<00:00:20.269> through<00:00:20.539> the<00:00:20.689> center<00:00:20.900> goes<00:00:21.679> into

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:21.919 
goes through the center goes into

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.230 
goes through the center goes into
negative<00:00:22.039> goes<00:00:22.609> positive

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
negative goes positive

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.269 
negative goes positive
it's<00:00:23.749> an<00:00:23.960> alternating<00:00:24.619> current<00:00:24.769> it

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
it's an alternating current it

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.849 
it's an alternating current it
alternates<00:00:25.849> up<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:26.390> down<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:26.869> this<00:00:27.619> is<00:00:27.829> a

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
alternates up and down and this is a

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.769 
alternates up and down and this is a
bridge<00:00:28.130> rectifier<00:00:28.449> what<00:00:29.449> the<00:00:29.599> bridge

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
bridge rectifier what the bridge

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.960 
bridge rectifier what the bridge
rectifier<00:00:30.259> does<00:00:30.589> is<00:00:30.890> converts<00:00:31.429> this<00:00:31.640> AC

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
rectifier does is converts this AC

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.780 
rectifier does is converts this AC
current<00:00:32.660> to<00:00:33.050> DC<00:00:33.410> current<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:34.130> virtually<00:00:34.579> does

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
current to DC current it virtually does

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.410 
current to DC current it virtually does
it<00:00:34.940> by<00:00:35.090> basically<00:00:35.950> wiping<00:00:36.950> out<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:38.030> center

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
it by basically wiping out the center

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.520 
it by basically wiping out the center
line<00:00:39.340> all<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.640> way<00:00:40.670> through<00:00:41.230> this<00:00:42.230> is<00:00:42.410> what

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
line all the way through this is what

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.870 
line all the way through this is what
the<00:00:42.650> bridge<00:00:42.800> rectifier<00:00:42.980> does<00:00:43.490> it<00:00:43.760> basically

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
the bridge rectifier does it basically

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.380 
the bridge rectifier does it basically
separates<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.920> two<00:00:46.130> components<00:00:46.820> of<00:00:46.880> the<00:00:47.210> AC

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
separates the two components of the AC

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.960 
separates the two components of the AC
current<00:00:47.750> where<00:00:48.080> we<00:00:48.170> have<00:00:48.290> positive<00:00:48.590> no<00:00:49.520> longer

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
current where we have positive no longer

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.090 
current where we have positive no longer
moving<00:00:50.300> through<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.690> negative<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:51.830> you<00:00:51.950> end

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
moving through the negative so you end

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.550 
moving through the negative so you end
up<00:00:52.160> with<00:00:52.220> positive<00:00:53.030> positive<00:00:53.450> going<00:00:54.380> out

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
up with positive positive going out

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.110 
up with positive positive going out
through<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:55.040> positive<00:00:55.610> portion<00:00:56.000> of<00:00:56.060> the

this<00:01:39.139> is<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.380> part<00:01:39.649> that<00:01:39.710> people<00:01:39.950> don't

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
this is a part that people don't

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.050 
this is a part that people don't
understand<00:01:40.759> that

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
understand that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.859

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.679 
they all clear with the positive power
it<00:01:51.530> comes<00:01:51.679> out<00:01:51.889> through<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.189> battery<00:01:52.689> battery

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
it comes out through the battery battery

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:54.940 
it comes out through the battery battery
where<00:01:53.869> in<00:01:53.959> the<00:01:54.049> back<00:01:54.200> they<00:01:54.380> all<00:01:54.409> tear

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
where in the back they all tear

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.830 
where in the back they all tear
so<00:01:55.459> when<00:01:55.579> you're<00:01:55.700> doing<00:01:55.850> your<00:01:55.969> big<00:01:56.179> 3<00:01:56.420> upgrade

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
so when you're doing your big 3 upgrade

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.289 
so when you're doing your big 3 upgrade
not<00:01:57.530> only<00:01:57.920> are<00:01:58.159> you<00:01:58.369> increasing<00:01:58.520> your<00:01:58.969> ground

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
not only are you increasing your ground

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.449 
not only are you increasing your ground
your<00:01:59.630> frame<00:01:59.959> increasing<00:02:00.799> your<00:02:00.950> ground<00:02:01.189> your

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
your frame increasing your ground your

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.969 
your frame increasing your ground your
motor<00:02:01.729> but<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:02.600> also<00:02:02.810> increase<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.499> positive

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
motor but you also increase the positive

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.999 
motor but you also increase the positive
wire<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:04.429> so<00:02:04.999> what<00:02:05.179> people<00:02:05.359> should<00:02:05.749> do<00:02:05.959> is<00:02:06.200> add

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
wire and so what people should do is add

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.370 
wire and so what people should do is add
one<00:02:07.369> to<00:02:07.639> the<00:02:07.729> big<00:02:07.880> 3<00:02:08.149> upgrade<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.750> run<00:02:09.350> a

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
one to the big 3 upgrade and run a
