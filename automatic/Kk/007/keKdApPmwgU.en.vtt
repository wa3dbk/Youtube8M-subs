00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.309
 welcome to a new episode 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.260
 from a short classic and this time on 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.449
 the motorcycle show in dortmund we are 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.809
 traveled a lot and this man to three of 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.460
 oliver hermann haller oliver hello you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.710
 connects a very special story 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 with this fair and with this motorcycle 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.500
 the fair is 30 years old 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.719
 consist 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.729
 and you have this motorcycle before 30 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.920
 years ago presented here how is going 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.540
 That's how old you were then 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.119
 I started with the thing at 16 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.310
 so 30 years ago i was just 17 when 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.890
 the fair started here for the first time 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.780
 This is the first construction level of 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.610
 the motorcycle in the bed you have to yes 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.190
 stressed because 80 kubicki is one 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.350
 former honda in the mountain and the fair 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.000
 really started in the small hall 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.190
 basically taken thus become gang 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.569
 and made such a home-made competition 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.069
 Father read this somewhere 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.450
 they have a call for self-construction here 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.190
 competition more with the laugh in the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.940
 face says you can your 80s 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.950
 to represent and again so is one 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.240
 scattered in front of nothing in the years I 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.190
 they also applied me directly 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.210
 Immediately come then must go there 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.140
 then between all the others 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.450
 set carts and notes too 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.060
 So martin rau has only the very noble ones 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.850
 tags and the little one in between 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.130
 take it true but do not despair 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.049
 the third place occupied in the conversion 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.030
 Competitions then gave way to buoyancy 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.899
 more then there was conversion stage two the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.520
 we see here now 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.229
 that was then the year after so then 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.969
 from 29 years again at the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.829
 motorcycles and then there was even the 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.780
 first place in the small classes 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.299
 the second opera rolls between 50 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.739
 Motorcycles has the little oliver 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.540
 At that time, powerfully made and proud 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.519
 That's why a great love connects us 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.519
 the thing could never be sold 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.230
 some technical data provide something 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.760
 is that for a glasses or what 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.420
 We have exactly what we have here 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.580
 already a few things that 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.920
 powerfully rebuilt between the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.209
 Tank is from the kawasaki 80 then 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.010
 I fed a bit 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.380
 then here's my first plastic 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.470
 Welding an oil tank around welded 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.910
 that suits my second gfk work 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.440
 At that time I was a young man myself 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.120
 so they made a shape for 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.739
 a hump the highlight we can 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.810
 yes right now see here quite puff 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.520
 in the back then what you certainly right now 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.739
 was once seen as in racing machine 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.090
 so it could not be extreme enough 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.590
 I thought there must somehow everything 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.780
 then I have an MTX one 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.610
 swing swing box to welded 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.530
 faltered it per link and then on the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.910
 Federbeine has fed here too 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.530
 Mighty luck that I have a training 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.930
 had started as a machinist 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.090
 then in conversion stage 2 and my master 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.670
 that was such a grounded one said boy 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.709
 as a hobby say yes the motorcycles 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.420
 is good i do not care for parts for 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.549
 the scrap box said so here 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.230
 File and throw away half a day 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.670
 Educational framework in a day can 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.900
 But you have to do everything 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.900
 sign and show me everything before 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.400
 For the time being, thumbs up and the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.730
 Little uni was really still at that time 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.610
 small 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.739
 He could start and then fire free 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.989
 there was a small painting booth there 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.640
 then that was at the University of Wuppertal 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.560
 industrial design 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.049
 industrial design the whole designer the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.850
 ran around it and their machine park 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.290
 I worked as a mechanic for that 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.299
 The teaching then should be for the maintenance and 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.010
 then there's morning air 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.450
 sniffed because then I have then 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.950
 own design studies further 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.040
 running and bayer today motorcycles 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.660
 And that was the sixth in the lottery 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.209
 Master that I make 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.070
 industrial designer around me 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.390
 Machinery and many ideas engine was 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.530
 then my own thing that has 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.510
 little to do with design 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.280
 the so radical tuned because only with 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.100
 aviation fuel is running so needs 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.049
 really high octane and so on 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.340
 This is an MTX gearbox 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.230
 six gear so that's not quite so 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.880
 quickly the box is broken that stops 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.190
 500 kilometer then he flies so 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.539
 really apart 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.280
 But that is also in the acceleration 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.560
 so weird the part she's there with so 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.010
 an xl 250 in the city to the first 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.479
 500 meters have held and that is 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.740
 the other one does other reason why 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.230
 I love them that used to have a lot to me 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.970
 pocket money 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.380
 are then always too mcdonald and have 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.850
 then put us there and a bit 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.240
 Fitted like the waste 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.010
 his car scan pair types subtracted 50 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.590
 used and then the boys still 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.450
 Wagered at the back and was one 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.890
 it is not possible to have a nice time easier 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.380
 I also needed more money 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.360
 aviation gasoline was history 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.270
 I'm cool these footpegs there 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.950
 I fit two feet on it and three 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.990
 jacket freedom this was okay or 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.640
 that was okay but I have to be honest 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.870
 confess I still have that time 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.940
 built fast for the fair 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.590
 I do not have that anymore 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.360
 can go big because shortly after the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.500
 second exhibition of the fair has the 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.720
 police the thing then radical 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.370
 shut down there were a few 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.790
 but unfortunately not registered 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.590
 enough 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.210
 For a long time that went well together 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.950
 in the morning a job as one 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.450
 Team with two crew cars and 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.670
 complete only ten people on me 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.830
 Waited behind the bushes and has 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.210
 only one more task from the traffic 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.460
 with the things and then they have that 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.740
 really taken apart and then 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.540
 I logged off the next and for 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.610
 but then keep it 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.740
 so really did this take foot 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.970
 Allagui in the enjoyment the first one I 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.180
 hope the goods narrower I told you so 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.520
 at least survived is now absolutely 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.910
 thank you so much for the top story 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.020
 we're running every now and then 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.480
 first in the courtyard a round 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.740
 Unfortunately no the motorcycle had classic 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.640
 me once after I addressed should 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.380
 Let's get started 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.030
 this is actually a task at 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.120
 Now take us to the chest to take the engine 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.040
 has for 30 or 30 years is one he made 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.050
 the only thing I really did 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.640
 have except clean again is 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.250
 new muffler here forward it 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.170
 made because the old woman is bumbling 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.150
 tree hollow 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.080
 otherwise everything is really there is there 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.080
 nothing changed 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.440
 The thing is from 30 years ago 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.970
 here 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.380
 I guess you have to complete it 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.540
 disassemble the engine but now I have 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.430
 so many people you hooked now ne 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.380
 Is that still going to happen ? I would say so 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.610
 get you running and then contact me 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.160
 maybe with a short one 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.390
 video if the thing goes or not then 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.980
 have you made my wish that was 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.840
 that we have the conclusion where has that 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.930
 surely we will judge today 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.930
 have to see each other again 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.930
 Thank you
