00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.570
 is incredible 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.470
 the moods 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:28.330
 we are forbidden to cross the forest of 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.330
 hell called me there's a whole sheriff 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:44.340
 your wings shine in my eyes 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.340
 are the humans with a size direction 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.920
 my name is bell, I tell you what 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.920
 two fairies born of the same laugh 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.950
 a little more to fight but you have a 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.950
 very positive 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.510
 I would love to know your world 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.280
 if you do not need your help I will 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.580
 build a machine so that I can 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.580
 come 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.020
 they ignored the danger and crossed the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.020
 border 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.190
 the balance of the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.960
 stations in the hollow of the fairies 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.530
 It will be as cold as in the forest of 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.530
 winter 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.119
 try to save the game tree from 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.119
 fairies 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.410
 bells the secret of the wings
