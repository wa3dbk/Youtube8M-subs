00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
but I mean I was sprinting and he had

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.340 
but I mean I was sprinting and he had
dexterity<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:24.910> quick-draw<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.389> had<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.540> AR

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.150 

probably<00:02:29.350> wasn't<00:02:29.470> even<00:02:29.590> like<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:30.069> was
