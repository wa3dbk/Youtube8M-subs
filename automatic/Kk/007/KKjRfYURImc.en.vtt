00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 it is true after dues here in the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.109
 pit lane and welcome 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.150
 to the mister world championship 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.860
 we arrived in the final 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.780
 many have been eliminated though 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.380
 two could still be brave here 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.630
 hold 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.220
 but now comes the decision will 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.400
 this year the cup with home 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.710
 take our candidates with the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.869
 start number 2 john doe run four times 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.000
 winner of the tm clock world championship 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.650
 he will continue his victory series 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.480
 that still stands in the stars 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
 because the competition is big 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.030
 with the start number one is this year 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.989
 namely exclusively for mister unexpected 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.440
 myself in the race my ladies 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.930
 and men 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.790
 and he has surprised everyone without the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.010
 least effort he apparently has 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.210
 in his first cup runs into 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.370
 the final fight 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.500
 they see we have the best 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.500
 Requirements for a gripping final 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.660
 and they are going on with it 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.190
 full throttle in the first turn 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.190
 It's a head to head race 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.120
 but no 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.170
 would have unexpected one piece seems to him 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.170
 to be far ahead 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.259
 now it's a piece penetrated 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.259
 can catch up today 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.940
 we are in the middle of the second 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.840
 round and that would have to be unexpected 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.840
 still in the lead 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.770
 everything is still open for seniors though 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.090
 so slowly he should also gas a bit more 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.420
 give if he gain the here 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.420
 want 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.040
 the last round everything again 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.040
 become 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.540
 but the decision seems already 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.540
 to have fallen 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.560
 yes I think that was it with the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.560
 grandiose victory series by john d 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.020
 and we have a winner the cup 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.570
 This year's New Year's Eve Aspects World 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:27.890
 championship with this person 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:27.890
 against the first run already 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:41.810
 she is going to be packed 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.440
 it was full as well i want now too 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.440
