00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
less thick Viney part and I luckily got

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.810 
less thick Viney part and I luckily got
it<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.619> my<00:01:04.710> first<00:01:04.890> try<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.460> can't<00:01:05.670> get

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it on my first try but if you can't get

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.960 
it on my first try but if you can't get

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it in like the first 15 seconds just run

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.200 
it in like the first 15 seconds just run
back<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.479> try<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.840> again<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.970> once<00:01:11.970> you're<00:01:12.090> in

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
