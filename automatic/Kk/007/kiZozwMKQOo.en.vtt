now<00:02:58.000> we're<00:02:58.120> starting<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.390> see<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.510> secondary

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
now we're starting to see the secondary

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:17.930 
now we're starting to see the secondary
spikes

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.490 

some<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.150> steel<00:03:19.390> looks<00:03:19.660> new<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.200> can't

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
some of that steel looks new but I can't

00:03:20.500 --> 00:04:08.140 
some of that steel looks new but I can't
really<00:03:20.680> be<00:03:20.800> sure<00:03:20.830> about<00:03:21.130> that

so<00:04:08.720> yeah<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.989> main<00:04:09.140> shelf<00:04:09.530> is<00:04:09.920> complete<00:04:10.400> for

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
so yeah the main shelf is complete for

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.399 
so yeah the main shelf is complete for
the<00:04:10.790> transportation<00:04:11.239> hub<00:04:13.659> not<00:04:14.659> one<00:04:14.900> spike<00:04:15.230> is

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
the transportation hub not one spike is

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:27.870 
the transportation hub not one spike is
there

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.370 

well<00:04:28.880> here<00:04:29.090> is<00:04:29.180> tower<00:04:29.389> to<00:04:29.630> World<00:04:29.840> Trade<00:04:30.080> Center

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
well here is tower to World Trade Center

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.990

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
for the transit hub this thing looks

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.760 
for the transit hub this thing looks
amazing<00:05:00.080> everything<00:05:01.080> that's<00:05:01.500> going<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.710> be
