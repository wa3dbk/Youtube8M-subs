00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:03.568
 Hi, I'm Robert Downey Jr. Enjoy the new exclusive trailer 

00:00:03.568 --> 00:00:06.866
 from my next film Sherlock Holmes: A game of Shadows. 

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:09.302
 Only in iTunes trailers. 

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.829
 Please sit down. Put the money on the table. 

00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:24.569
 You are welcome. 

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:30.077
 The letters can reveal your future. 

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.073
 I feel you are in danger. 

00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:38.932
 In fact, I prefer to read your fortune. 

00:00:40.338 --> 00:00:43.464
 I see that your next client is here to kill you. 

00:00:52.108 --> 00:00:53.631
 How I missed you, Holmes. 

00:00:58.738 --> 00:00:59.576
 SOON 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.501
 I see that your network of conspiracies has expanded. 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.391
 I'm up to my knees in a unique case, the most important of my career. 

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:09.595
 The clues point to an address. 

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.161
 Professor James Moriarty 

00:01:12.782 --> 00:01:14.852
 Are you sure you want to play this game? 

00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:18.199
 I'm afraid you've lost. 

00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:27.809
 I agree that it is not my best disguise, but I had to conform. 

00:01:37.512 --> 00:01:38.861
 You did not see this in the letters, did you? 

00:01:50.104 --> 00:01:51.441
 What do we do here below? 

00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:57.660
 We are waiting. 

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:09.240
 That it is worth it! 

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:17.535
 I do not care how you move! 

00:02:21.824 --> 00:02:23.566
 SHERLOCK HOLMES A SET OF SHADOWS 

00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:26.066
 Remove that from my face. It's not in your face, it's in my hand. 

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:28.406
 Remove what is in your hand from my face. 

00:02:28.406 --> 00:02:30.441
 SOON
