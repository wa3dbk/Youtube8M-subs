00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.740 

on<00:00:05.220> Tuesday<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.700> showed<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.180> how<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.359> approach

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
on Tuesday I showed you how to approach

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.259 
on Tuesday I showed you how to approach
drawing<00:00:07.200> straight<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.890> clean<00:00:08.370> lines<00:00:08.700> inside

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
drawing straight and clean lines inside

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.240 
drawing straight and clean lines inside
a<00:00:09.330> Photoshop<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.110> also<00:00:10.620> showed<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.040> how<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.160> use

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
a Photoshop I also showed you how to use

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.180 
a Photoshop I also showed you how to use
the<00:00:11.490> ellipse<00:00:11.790> template<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.509> do<00:00:12.630> curves<00:00:13.190> well

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
the ellipse template to do curves well

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
the ellipse template to do curves well
today<00:00:14.400> I'm<00:00:14.490> going<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.670> show<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.849> how<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.030> take

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
today I'm going to show you how to take

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.090 
today I'm going to show you how to take
those<00:00:15.389> two<00:00:15.630> techniques<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.650> build<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.920> line

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
those two techniques and to build a line

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.490 
those two techniques and to build a line
work<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.910> mechanical<00:00:18.480> prop<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.350> let's

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
work in this mechanical prop so let's

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.099 
work in this mechanical prop so let's
get<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> brush<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.900> I'll<00:00:21.990> be

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
get to it so the brush that I'll be

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.800 
get to it so the brush that I'll be
using<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.710> entire<00:00:22.980> process<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:24.539> bit

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
using for this entire process is a bit

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.490 
using for this entire process is a bit
like<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> pen

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
like a pen

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.470 
like a pen
it<00:00:25.980> does<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.369> some<00:00:26.400> pressure<00:00:26.939> sensitivity

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
it does have some pressure sensitivity

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810 
it does have some pressure sensitivity
on<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.960> but<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.010> could<00:00:29.160> use<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.699> had

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
on it but you could use one that had

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.009 
on it but you could use one that had
pressure<00:00:30.060> sensitivity<00:00:30.480> turned<00:00:30.840> completely

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
pressure sensitivity turned completely

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.260 
pressure sensitivity turned completely
off<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:32.040> because<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:32.940> type<00:00:33.149> of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
off if you like because for this type of

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.760 
off if you like because for this type of
line<00:00:33.450> work<00:00:33.630> you're<00:00:34.050> not<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> want<00:00:34.469> too

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
line work you're not going to want too

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.819 
line work you're not going to want too
much<00:00:35.030> opacity<00:00:36.030> jitter<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.710> begin

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
much opacity jitter so I like to begin

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.850 
much opacity jitter so I like to begin
by<00:00:38.070> defining<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.850> outer<00:00:39.540> contours<00:00:40.379> these<00:00:40.710> are

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
by defining the outer contours these are

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.040 
by defining the outer contours these are
sort<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> outlines<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> shape<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
sort of the outlines of the shape and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.180 
sort of the outlines of the shape and
I'm<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.440> doing<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> bit<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.829> draw

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
I'm going to be doing a bit of draw

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279 
I'm going to be doing a bit of draw
through<00:00:44.700> where<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.390> draw<00:00:45.570> beyond<00:00:45.960> where<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
through where you draw beyond where you

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.889 
through where you draw beyond where you
want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.480> just<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.660> get<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
want to go to just so you get that

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.959 
want to go to just so you get that
confident<00:00:49.410> line<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.700> erase

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
confident line and then you can erase

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.170 
confident line and then you can erase
away<00:00:51.270> where<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.719> don't<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:52.879> but<00:00:53.879> before<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
away where you don't want but before I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.090 
away where you don't want but before I
know<00:00:54.270> where<00:00:54.539> these<00:00:54.690> lines<00:00:54.870> end<00:00:55.199> exactly<00:00:55.800> I'm

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
know where these lines end exactly I'm

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.689 
know where these lines end exactly I'm
going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> need<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> define<00:00:57.059> those<00:00:57.270> ellipses

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
going to need to define those ellipses

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.719 
going to need to define those ellipses
so<00:00:59.699> I'll<00:00:59.820> make<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> new<00:01:00.270> layer<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:04.489> I'll<00:01:05.489> form

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
so I'll make a new layer and I'll form

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.190 
so I'll make a new layer and I'll form
an<00:01:05.820> ellipse<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.330> then<00:01:07.320> I'll<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> Select

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
an ellipse and then I'll do the Select

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.750 
an ellipse and then I'll do the Select
transform<00:01:10.200> selection<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.610> can

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
transform selection and then I can

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.649 
transform selection and then I can
actually<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.330> ellipse<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.320> place

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
actually get this ellipse right in place

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.350 
actually get this ellipse right in place
when<00:01:15.659> I'm<00:01:15.780> happy<00:01:16.049> with<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> hit<00:01:16.470> confirm

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
when I'm happy with that I hit confirm

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.210 
when I'm happy with that I hit confirm
go<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> edit<00:01:19.490> stroke<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.710> for<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.979> I'll<00:01:23.100> be

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
go to edit stroke and for now on I'll be

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.640 
go to edit stroke and for now on I'll be
using<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.729> keyboard<00:01:24.210> shortcut<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.869> pull<00:01:25.380> up<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
using a keyboard shortcut to pull up the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.770 
using a keyboard shortcut to pull up the
stroke<00:01:25.890> menu<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.090> won't<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.540> me<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
stroke menu so you won't see me go to

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.620 
stroke menu so you won't see me go to
the<00:01:27.900> Edit<00:01:28.140> menu<00:01:28.170> anymore<00:01:35.329> so<00:01:36.329> now<00:01:36.450> I'm<00:01:36.509> going

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the Edit menu anymore so now I'm going

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.920 
the Edit menu anymore so now I'm going
to<00:01:36.840> find<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.320> next<00:01:38.159> contour<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.600> its<00:01:39.810> own

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
to find the next contour here on its own

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.359 
to find the next contour here on its own
layer<00:01:40.280> stroke<00:01:42.560> okay<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:43.890> happy<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
layer stroke okay and I'm happy with the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.710 
layer stroke okay and I'm happy with the
way<00:01:44.399> those<00:01:44.640> two<00:01:44.880> live<00:01:45.060> together<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.630> I'll

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
way those two live together so I'll

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.800 
way those two live together so I'll
flatten<00:01:45.990> them<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> single<00:01:46.710> layer<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.810> then

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
flatten them to a single layer and then

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.030 
flatten them to a single layer and then
I'll<00:01:48.899> go<00:01:49.020> back<00:01:49.140> down<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.470> first<00:01:49.799> layer

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
I'll go back down to that first layer

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
I'll go back down to that first layer
where<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> made<00:01:51.060> those<00:01:51.240> original<00:01:51.810> lines<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
where I made those original lines and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:01.219 
where I made those original lines and
I'll<00:01:52.590> erase<00:01:52.890> away<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> don't<00:01:53.729> need

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.609 

and<00:02:02.229> then<00:02:03.130> on<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.310> new<00:02:03.490> layer<00:02:03.640> I'll<00:02:03.850> define<00:02:04.149> this

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
and then on a new layer I'll define this

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:14.990 
and then on a new layer I'll define this
back<00:02:05.619> ellipse<00:02:09.119> transform<00:02:10.119> my<00:02:10.209> selection

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.740 

confirm<00:02:16.230> stroke<00:02:18.150> erase<00:02:19.150> away<00:02:19.299> but<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.510> don't

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
confirm stroke erase away but I don't

need ok now I'm going to fast forward a

need ok now I'm going to fast forward a
bit<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.799> establish<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.549> rest<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.819> the

now<00:02:35.269> generally<00:02:35.659> speaking<00:02:36.049> I'm<00:02:36.200> not<00:02:36.349> a<00:02:36.379> huge

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
now generally speaking I'm not a huge

now generally speaking I'm not a huge
fan<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.920> time-lapse<00:02:37.609> videos<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:38.900> this

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
fan of time-lapse videos but in this

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.110 
fan of time-lapse videos but in this
case<00:02:39.200> it's<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.069> lot<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.459> same<00:02:40.700> steps

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
case it's a lot of the same steps

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.030 
case it's a lot of the same steps
repeated<00:02:41.629> over<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:41.959> over<00:02:42.079> but<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:42.799> think<00:02:42.950> it

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
repeated over and over but I think it

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.649 
repeated over and over but I think it
can<00:02:43.129> be<00:02:43.159> useful<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.609> see<00:02:43.790> how<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.629> I

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
can be useful to see how it is that I

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.449 
can be useful to see how it is that I
actually<00:02:44.870> build<00:02:45.409> this<00:02:45.650> from<00:02:46.040> start<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.430> finish

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
actually build this from start to finish

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.059 
actually build this from start to finish
so<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.599> is<00:02:47.719> sped<00:02:47.900> up<00:02:47.930> about<00:02:48.200> three<00:02:48.530> times<00:02:48.739> and

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
so this is sped up about three times and

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.520 
so this is sped up about three times and
I've<00:02:49.819> also<00:02:50.000> hidden<00:02:50.329> the<00:02:50.480> cursor<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.409> all

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
I've also hidden the cursor so all

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.490 
I've also hidden the cursor so all
you're<00:02:51.709> seeing<00:02:51.889> is<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.189> results<00:02:52.579> and<00:02:53.500> I've

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
you're seeing is the results and I've

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.379 
you're seeing is the results and I've
gone<00:02:54.650> ahead<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:54.920> hidden<00:02:55.250> my<00:02:55.370> layer<00:02:55.609> stack<00:02:55.969> but

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
gone ahead and hidden my layer stack but

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.849 
gone ahead and hidden my layer stack but
know<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.569> I'm<00:02:56.810> not<00:02:56.959> keeping<00:02:57.260> very<00:02:57.620> many

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
know that I'm not keeping very many

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.280 
know that I'm not keeping very many
layers<00:02:58.099> at<00:02:58.340> one<00:02:58.519> time<00:02:58.760> I'm<00:02:59.329> having<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.959> few<00:03:00.139> new

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
layers at one time I'm having a few new

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.959 
layers at one time I'm having a few new
ones<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.769> then<00:03:01.010> when<00:03:01.099> I<00:03:01.129> like<00:03:01.340> them<00:03:01.579> I'll

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 
ones and then when I like them I'll

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:06.429 
ones and then when I like them I'll
flatten<00:03:02.299> them<00:03:02.510> down<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.840> on<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.019> face<00:03:06.169> near

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
flatten them down so on the face near

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.229 
flatten them down so on the face near
the<00:03:06.560> camera<00:03:06.950> I've<00:03:07.220> got<00:03:07.370> two<00:03:07.609> cylindrical

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
the camera I've got two cylindrical

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.899 
the camera I've got two cylindrical
tubes<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.989> are<00:03:09.139> nearly<00:03:09.379> identical<00:03:09.790> one<00:03:10.790> will

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
tubes that are nearly identical one will

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.429 
tubes that are nearly identical one will
be<00:03:10.970> slightly<00:03:11.239> smaller<00:03:11.569> than<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.840> other<00:03:12.049> but

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
be slightly smaller than the other but

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.809 
be slightly smaller than the other but
there's<00:03:12.590> really<00:03:12.739> no<00:03:12.889> sense<00:03:13.129> in<00:03:13.310> driving<00:03:13.370> both

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
there's really no sense in driving both

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.849 
there's really no sense in driving both
individually<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.290> you'll<00:03:15.409> see<00:03:15.530> I'll<00:03:15.620> draw<00:03:15.799> the

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
individually so you'll see I'll draw the

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.069 
individually so you'll see I'll draw the
first<00:03:16.189> one<00:03:16.459> so<00:03:17.389> I'll<00:03:17.450> duplicate<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.989> entire

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
first one so I'll duplicate the entire

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.140 
first one so I'll duplicate the entire
thing<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.739> then<00:03:19.459> move<00:03:19.639> it<00:03:19.760> over<00:03:19.849> in<00:03:20.090> the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
thing and then move it over in the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.209 
thing and then move it over in the
correct<00:03:20.419> perspective<00:03:20.599> and<00:03:21.079> save<00:03:21.709> myself<00:03:21.889> a

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:22.219 
correct perspective and save myself a

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:25.449 
correct perspective and save myself a
fair<00:03:22.519> amount<00:03:22.579> of<00:03:22.760> time<00:03:23.769> often<00:03:24.769> times<00:03:25.219> at<00:03:25.370> the

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
fair amount of time often times at the

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.399 
fair amount of time often times at the
end<00:03:25.639> of<00:03:25.849> a<00:03:25.939> cylinder<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.540> have<00:03:26.959> a<00:03:26.989> slight

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
end of a cylinder you have a slight

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.319 
end of a cylinder you have a slight
bevel<00:03:27.739> what<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:28.849> means<00:03:29.030> is<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:29.180> you're

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
bevel what this means is that you're

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.729 
bevel what this means is that you're
gonna<00:03:29.450> have<00:03:29.599> two<00:03:29.750> ellipses<00:03:30.349> that<00:03:30.530> are

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
gonna have two ellipses that are

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.830 
gonna have two ellipses that are
perfectly<00:03:31.219> in<00:03:31.400> parallel<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:31.969> very<00:03:32.419> near<00:03:32.689> one

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
perfectly in parallel and very near one

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.199 
perfectly in parallel and very near one
another<00:03:33.159> usually<00:03:34.159> what<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.340> like<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.669> do<00:03:34.819> to

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
another usually what I like to do to

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.909 
another usually what I like to do to
save<00:03:35.389> a<00:03:35.419> little<00:03:35.569> time<00:03:35.659> is<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.469> draw<00:03:36.650> one<00:03:36.889> of

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
save a little time is to draw one of

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.670 
save a little time is to draw one of
these<00:03:37.129> usually<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.030> bigger<00:03:38.209> one<00:03:38.449> and<00:03:38.690> then

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
these usually the bigger one and then

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.339 
these usually the bigger one and then
duplicate<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.299> shrink<00:03:41.299> it<00:03:41.419> slightly<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:42.049> move

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
duplicate it shrink it slightly and move

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.110 
duplicate it shrink it slightly and move
it<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.500> little<00:03:42.680> off-center<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.940> way<00:03:44.060> you

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
it a little off-center and that way you

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.610 
it a little off-center and that way you
don't<00:03:44.209> have<00:03:44.419> to<00:03:44.629> define<00:03:44.930> your<00:03:45.049> ellipse<00:03:45.319> twice

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
don't have to define your ellipse twice

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.770 
don't have to define your ellipse twice
you<00:03:46.040> just<00:03:46.220> do<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:46.400> once<00:03:46.579> and<00:03:46.849> save<00:03:47.479> yourself

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
you just do it once and save yourself

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.640 
you just do it once and save yourself
some<00:03:47.810> time<00:03:48.079> and<00:03:49.510> what<00:03:50.510> I'm<00:03:50.599> doing<00:03:50.629> here<00:03:51.079> now

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
some time and what I'm doing here now

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.259 
some time and what I'm doing here now
that<00:03:51.769> I've<00:03:51.859> got<00:03:52.010> my<00:03:52.040> major<00:03:52.459> anchors<00:03:52.909> in<00:03:53.060> place

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
that I've got my major anchors in place

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:00.010 
that I've got my major anchors in place
is<00:03:53.510> putting<00:03:54.079> a<00:03:54.139> little<00:03:54.260> surface<00:03:54.680> detailing<00:03:55.159> in

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.750 

for<00:04:00.380> a<00:04:00.410> last<00:04:00.650> little<00:04:00.830> bit<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.040> detailing<00:04:01.580> here

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
for a last little bit of detailing here

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.430 
for a last little bit of detailing here
I've<00:04:01.970> decided<00:04:02.300> to<00:04:02.420> drop<00:04:02.660> out<00:04:02.990> of<00:04:03.230> the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
I've decided to drop out of the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.010 
I've decided to drop out of the
time-lapse<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.100> show<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.490> in<00:04:04.580> real<00:04:04.730> time<00:04:05.020> my

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
time-lapse and show you in real time my

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.440 
time-lapse and show you in real time my
goal<00:04:06.230> here<00:04:06.410> is<00:04:06.710> to<00:04:06.770> make<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.370> ribbing<00:04:07.790> on<00:04:07.910> the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
goal here is to make the ribbing on the

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.510 
goal here is to make the ribbing on the
side<00:04:08.660> of<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.900> cylinder<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:10.220> instead<00:04:10.460> of

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
side of the cylinder so instead of

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.340 
side of the cylinder so instead of
drawing<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:10.970> a<00:04:11.030> bunch<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.300> times<00:04:11.540> I'm<00:04:12.260> just

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
drawing it a bunch of times I'm just

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.430 
drawing it a bunch of times I'm just
gonna<00:04:12.590> draw<00:04:12.860> it<00:04:12.980> once<00:04:13.810> spend<00:04:14.810> my<00:04:14.930> time<00:04:15.110> on<00:04:15.320> it

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
gonna draw it once spend my time on it

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:24.040 
gonna draw it once spend my time on it
and<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:16.790> duplicate<00:04:17.239> it<00:04:22.510> so<00:04:23.510> any<00:04:23.660> sort<00:04:23.870> of

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
and that duplicate it so any sort of

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.290 
and that duplicate it so any sort of
fine<00:04:24.680> surface<00:04:24.980> detailing<00:04:25.670> that<00:04:25.820> I'd<00:04:25.910> want<00:04:26.120> in

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
fine surface detailing that I'd want in

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.220 
fine surface detailing that I'd want in
each<00:04:26.690> of<00:04:26.900> these<00:04:26.990> ribs<00:04:27.320> I'll<00:04:27.560> draw<00:04:27.920> in<00:04:28.070> here<00:04:30.250> and

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
each of these ribs I'll draw in here and

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.690 
each of these ribs I'll draw in here and
I'll<00:04:33.230> erase<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:33.530> a<00:04:33.740> little<00:04:33.920> bit<00:04:34.130> just<00:04:34.580> to

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
I'll erase it a little bit just to

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.100 
I'll erase it a little bit just to
soften<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.150> so<00:04:35.300> it<00:04:35.360> doesn't<00:04:35.480> fight<00:04:35.780> as<00:04:35.930> much

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
soften it so it doesn't fight as much

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.380 
soften it so it doesn't fight as much
with<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.440> outer<00:04:36.590> contour<00:04:37.070> I<00:04:37.370> want<00:04:38.090> this<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.360> be

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
with the outer contour I want this to be

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.980 
with the outer contour I want this to be
sort<00:04:38.660> of<00:04:38.720> low<00:04:38.960> relief<00:04:40.150> okay<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.540> now<00:04:41.780> that<00:04:41.900> I'm

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
sort of low relief okay and now that I'm

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.910 
sort of low relief okay and now that I'm
happy<00:04:42.080> with<00:04:42.260> it<00:04:42.730> I'll<00:04:43.730> duplicate<00:04:44.330> it<00:04:44.770> down<00:04:45.770> the

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
happy with it I'll duplicate it down the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:53.400 
happy with it I'll duplicate it down the
line<00:04:47.140> pre<00:04:48.140> transforming<00:04:48.740> into<00:04:49.310> perspective

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.750 

so<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:54.710> great<00:04:54.950> example<00:04:55.400> of<00:04:55.490> where<00:04:55.640> you

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
so this is a great example of where you

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.200 
so this is a great example of where you
can<00:04:55.910> let<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.120> computer<00:04:56.540> do<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:56.720> work<00:04:56.870> for<00:04:57.110> you

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
can let the computer do the work for you

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.270 
can let the computer do the work for you
where<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.240> have<00:04:59.390> drawn<00:04:59.630> it<00:04:59.750> once<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:00.380> it's<00:05:01.130> not

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
where I have drawn it once and it's not

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.040 
where I have drawn it once and it's not
especially<00:05:01.760> creative<00:05:02.510> to<00:05:02.600> draw<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:02.810> same

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
especially creative to draw the same

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.120 
especially creative to draw the same
thing<00:05:03.290> over<00:05:03.440> and<00:05:03.560> over<00:05:03.770> again

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
thing over and over again

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.740 
thing over and over again
so<00:05:04.610> I'm<00:05:04.670> going<00:05:04.790> to<00:05:04.850> let<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.030> computer<00:05:05.180> sort<00:05:05.660> of

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
so I'm going to let the computer sort of

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.100 
so I'm going to let the computer sort of
take<00:05:06.320> over<00:05:06.440> that<00:05:06.620> burden<00:05:06.890> for<00:05:07.190> me

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.990 

and<00:05:14.110> then<00:05:15.070> I'll<00:05:15.160> flatten<00:05:15.430> all<00:05:15.610> those<00:05:15.790> down

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
and then I'll flatten all those down

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.910 
and then I'll flatten all those down
together<00:05:16.200> so<00:05:17.200> they're<00:05:17.320> on<00:05:17.410> a<00:05:17.440> single<00:05:17.770> layer

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
together so they're on a single layer

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.070 
together so they're on a single layer
and<00:05:18.130> I'll<00:05:18.940> race<00:05:19.180> away<00:05:19.360> where<00:05:19.660> I<00:05:19.690> don't<00:05:19.780> need

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
and I'll race away where I don't need

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:34.830 
and I'll race away where I don't need
them<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:32.850> then<00:05:33.850> I'll<00:05:33.940> hide<00:05:34.120> my<00:05:34.300> underdrawing

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
them and then I'll hide my underdrawing

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.660 
them and then I'll hide my underdrawing
and<00:05:35.830> you'll<00:05:35.980> see<00:05:36.130> that<00:05:36.220> what<00:05:36.340> I'm<00:05:36.400> left<00:05:36.550> with

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
and you'll see that what I'm left with

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.540 
and you'll see that what I'm left with
is<00:05:36.910> a<00:05:36.940> particularly<00:05:37.540> sharp<00:05:37.930> drawing<00:05:38.370> nice<00:05:39.370> and

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
is a particularly sharp drawing nice and

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.440 
is a particularly sharp drawing nice and
clean<00:05:40.950> so<00:05:41.950> before<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.280> wrap<00:05:42.520> up<00:05:42.580> I<00:05:43.000> want<00:05:43.180> to<00:05:43.360> give

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
clean so before I wrap up I want to give

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.890 
clean so before I wrap up I want to give
a<00:05:43.480> quick<00:05:43.690> shout-out<00:05:43.930> to<00:05:44.260> reader<00:05:44.790> xrg<00:05:45.900> they

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
a quick shout-out to reader xrg they

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.080 
a quick shout-out to reader xrg they
watch<00:05:47.110> Tuesday's<00:05:47.650> video<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.190> saw<00:05:48.790> that<00:05:48.940> there

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
watch Tuesday's video and saw that there

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.909 
watch Tuesday's video and saw that there
was<00:05:49.150> a<00:05:49.210> feature<00:05:49.450> I<00:05:49.570> was<00:05:49.750> not<00:05:49.930> using<00:05:50.350> which<00:05:50.890> is

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
was a feature I was not using which is

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.760 
was a feature I was not using which is
the<00:05:51.190> transform<00:05:51.880> selection<00:05:52.180> command<00:05:53.050> this<00:05:53.710> is

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
the transform selection command this is

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.440 
the transform selection command this is
a<00:05:53.919> feature<00:05:54.190> I've<00:05:54.520> been<00:05:54.700> wanting<00:05:55.150> for<00:05:55.180> years

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
a feature I've been wanting for years

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.360 
a feature I've been wanting for years
and<00:05:56.350> it<00:05:56.470> turns<00:05:56.650> out<00:05:56.800> it<00:05:56.919> was<00:05:57.010> there<00:05:57.190> all<00:05:57.340> along

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
and it turns out it was there all along

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.550 
and it turns out it was there all along
I<00:05:57.820> just<00:05:58.150> didn't<00:05:58.360> know<00:05:58.450> about<00:05:58.570> it<00:05:58.780> so<00:05:59.380> it<00:05:59.500> really

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
I just didn't know about it so it really

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.620 
I just didn't know about it so it really
goes<00:05:59.950> to<00:06:00.010> show<00:06:00.340> that<00:06:00.790> there<00:06:01.000> are<00:06:01.030> just<00:06:01.360> little

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
goes to show that there are just little

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.360 
goes to show that there are just little
things<00:06:01.720> hidden<00:06:02.169> in<00:06:02.290> Photoshop<00:06:02.830> that<00:06:03.100> can

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
things hidden in Photoshop that can

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.370 
things hidden in Photoshop that can
change<00:06:03.669> your<00:06:03.820> process<00:06:03.970> for<00:06:04.360> the<00:06:04.450> better<00:06:04.630> so

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
change your process for the better so

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.920 
change your process for the better so
thanks<00:06:05.650> a<00:06:05.710> lot<00:06:05.860> xrg<00:06:06.310> if<00:06:07.240> anybody<00:06:07.570> else<00:06:07.720> has<00:06:07.900> any
