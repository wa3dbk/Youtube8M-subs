album as opposed to don't forget is that
I<00:00:34.290> definitely<00:00:34.710> think<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.100> album<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.610> more<00:00:35.879> of

I definitely think this album is more of
me<00:00:36.720> and<00:00:37.940> you<00:00:38.940> know<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> got<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.510> write<00:00:40.290> most<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
me and you know I got to write most the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.820 
me and you know I got to write most the
album<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.600> put<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> lot<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.809> myself<00:00:43.230> into<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
album and put a lot of myself into it

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.680 
album and put a lot of myself into it
and<00:00:44.100> I've<00:00:44.820> changed<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.239> lot<00:00:45.360> over<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.660> last

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and I've changed a lot over the last

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.340 
and I've changed a lot over the last
year<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.829> definitely<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.790> a<00:00:48.350> more

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
year so it's definitely like a more

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:01.640 
year so it's definitely like a more
mature<00:00:49.910> version<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:51.660> music

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.470 

the<00:01:02.160> writing<00:01:02.460> process<00:01:02.610> was<00:01:02.820> really<00:01:03.210> great<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the writing process was really great I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
the writing process was really great I
got<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.810> work<00:01:03.900> with<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.320> lot<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.620> really<00:01:05.160> really

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
got to work with a lot of really really

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.100 
got to work with a lot of really really
cool<00:01:05.550> people<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.450> wanted<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> work<00:01:07.080> with

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
cool people that I wanted to work with

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.890 
cool people that I wanted to work with
and<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.520> incredible<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.150> did<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
and it was incredible I did get to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
and it was incredible I did get to
co-write<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.230> lot<00:01:10.440> I<00:01:10.710> think<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> little<00:01:11.610> bit<00:01:11.760> as

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
co-write a lot I think a little bit as

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.520 
co-write a lot I think a little bit as
more<00:01:12.060> edgier<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.720> think<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.050> more

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
more edgier but I think the more

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.170 
more edgier but I think the more
important<00:01:14.220> thing<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.550> me<00:01:14.670> was<00:01:14.820> making<00:01:15.150> sure

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
important thing to me was making sure

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.850 
important thing to me was making sure
that<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.540> was<00:01:15.630> definitely<00:01:15.810> more<00:01:16.170> soulful<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that it was definitely more soulful and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.940 
that it was definitely more soulful and
a<00:01:17.670> more<00:01:18.180> mature<00:01:18.360> version<00:01:18.690> of<00:01:18.990> me<00:01:19.170> but

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
a more mature version of me but

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.020 
a more mature version of me but
basically<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:21.300> all<00:01:21.480> me<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.020> time<00:01:22.880> but<00:01:23.880> I

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
basically it's all me this time but I

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
basically it's all me this time but I

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
I think there's nothing compared to live

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.640 
I think there's nothing compared to live
performances<00:03:58.780> especially<00:03:58.960> when<00:03:59.440> you're<00:03:59.590> in
