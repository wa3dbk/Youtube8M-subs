this<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:00.989> a<00:00:01.079> quick<00:00:01.319> example<00:00:01.709> of<00:00:01.890> how<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.070> would

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
this is a quick example of how you would

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.849 
this is a quick example of how you would
change<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.850> melody<00:00:03.270> note<00:00:03.480> on<00:00:03.720> your<00:00:03.859> cord

without<00:00:05.250> checking<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.700> cord<00:00:06.000> in<00:00:06.569> case<00:00:06.750> you

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
without checking the cord in case you

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.690 
without checking the cord in case you
want<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.170> maintain<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.770> court<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.340> follow<00:00:08.580> a

want to maintain the court and follow a
string<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.120> melody<00:00:09.450> notes<00:00:10.580> just<00:00:11.580> as<00:00:11.700> an

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
string of melody notes just as an

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.980 
string of melody notes just as an
example<00:00:11.910> here<00:00:13.160> let's<00:00:14.160> make<00:00:14.309> sure<00:00:14.370> we<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.990> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
example here let's make sure we have the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.019 
example here let's make sure we have the
cord<00:00:16.260> group<00:00:16.440> single<00:00:16.920> note<00:00:17.100> selected<00:00:17.789> and

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
cord group single note selected and

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.730 
cord group single note selected and
we're<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.600> use<00:00:18.690> basic<00:00:19.170> chords<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.619> this

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
we're going to use basic chords in this

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.050 
we're going to use basic chords in this
example<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.970> say<00:00:21.150> for<00:00:21.180> example<00:00:21.740> we<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.279> G

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
example so say for example we have a G

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.029 
example so say for example we have a G
chord<00:00:24.590> G<00:00:25.590> B<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.730> D<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.439> wanted<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> change

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
chord G B and D and we wanted to change

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.009 
chord G B and D and we wanted to change
the<00:00:29.189> melody<00:00:29.670> note<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.119> follow<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.390> melody<00:00:30.810> line

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
the melody note to follow a melody line

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.310 
the melody note to follow a melody line
say<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:32.040> wanted<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.550> move<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.969> D<00:00:33.210> down<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.290> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
say we wanted to move the D down to a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.690 
say we wanted to move the D down to a
seat<00:00:34.730> you're<00:00:35.730> able<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.149> rip<00:00:36.420> off<00:00:36.660> or<00:00:37.050> move<00:00:37.290> or
