00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.629
 Being in an epic narrative has its pitfalls 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.230
 On the one hand you can sometimes be disappointed powerful because the city in the 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.230
 Afterwards childhood memories and research 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.410
 On the other hand, it is difficult with the terrain a therapy against the FC 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.980
 Dornach to find 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.230
 You can easily become prey to interactive media such as 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.330
 video games 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.760
 like Lord of the Rings Online 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.320
 Otherwise you might like to turn up your nose and continue with us 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.370
 Stockmann as a connoisseur of the template on the lavish detail richness 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.030
 one is really happy to meet well-won characters 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.350
 to admire even more detailed replicas of ethical landscapes 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.790
 and now of course that can sound and the evil powers six 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.000
 to face 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Middle-earth suddenly becomes a whole lot more tangible 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.350
 being Lord of the Rings you will be sucked in by these programs 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.680
 because even minor weaknesses in the game system dazzles the Steinberg both 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.400
 successful 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.390
 And that's exactly the problem 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.090
 because in the emergency the devil eats flies 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.120
 a small example complacent 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.380
 Let's just put on denser clouds and mentally in the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.219
 Year 1995 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.459
 as the company Intercell a lord of the rings action-adventure for the super 

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:30.459
 Nintendo released 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.140
 Hz I am sorry that looking back a little blurry but because of that 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.260
 the most special things are so something to the beautiful music 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.370
 remind 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.360
 as expected now is clear from while something like Zelda thus upper world 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.270
 explore 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.270
 Explore caves and the Emmental 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.920
 there is true that even these great character pictures from the lot 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.360
 had been inspired 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.630
 All heroes were on board 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.500
 Photo and his hobbit companion 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.120
 Aragorn in life 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.040
 and Blake Olaf obviously has nothing better to do than being in the middle of it 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.399
 would have labyrinths standing around 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.649
 Image ruler Gandalf 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.279
 there is a year 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.279
 this is Klose Wizard 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.619
 who the hell the Spectral 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:31.589
 just so that's clear it gives the Lord of the Rings only 5000 off 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.699
 why on the Vistula this year 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.699
 Gandalf the gray who joins the racing community 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.010
 Caracas of heat 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.060
 who, apart from his animal assistance, keeps out of the matter 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.129
 and two more loud magicians who long ago made the most generous and 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.349
 have disappeared since then 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.689
 Drexel is 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.059
 but tell about it that it is not one of the lost wizards 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.869
 Son of the Magic with the Fernwaldhalle because that is still the smallest Schmidt 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:03.789
 says 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:07.109
 if any of you have ever managed to get to that point at all 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.209
 he is the deadliest «Lord of the Rings» on this planet anyway 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.199
 lovely landscapes 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:20.759
 of over £ 5,000 per day and not just in Moriya from the trolls 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:24.779
 let alone differ, of course, come without a twitch times in a dead end 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:25.829
 to run 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.669
 all heights and traffic consist of a collection of 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:29.989
 compound days 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.989
 which drive them to despair with the sick captain 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:37.549
 that is, as long as you're on the go, boredom turns off loud 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.299
 the developers live in Middle-earth no more than five monster types the 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.299
 By the way, all of them go down with a single stroke of the sword 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.199
 a clear rejection 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.629
 Bat or pump Martian with Viking helmet 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.169
 vuf during Rudolstadt 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.370
 It is clear if you have an interpretation 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.909
 about as fiebig interpretation of Kati bond and without parking authorization 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:04.349
 Murray is standing by the front door anyway, anyway 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.979
 seems to want to beat Alina Fausta 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.419
 the purest kindergarten 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.599
 because you can really be happy that the action is only up to the station 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.599
 the planned second part was immediately rejected 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:20.220
 I do not believe that but I know someone who is good at these principles 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.999
 run 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:25.020
 and even got quite far but that was only due to the circumstance 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.939
 this is not a single "Lord of the Rings" playing on consoles far and wide 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:32.289
 only on the Amiga and the PC should you still with Middle Earth 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.849
 a completely differently designed role-playing game also from Interplay 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:36.629
 came 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.399
 however, developer Silicon had known in 10 Abs today 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.310
 much more effort in this version
