00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.610 

the<00:00:03.030> next<00:00:03.270> concept<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:03.720> I'll<00:00:03.870> cover<00:00:04.140> here<00:00:04.500> in

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
the next concept is I'll cover here in

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.730 
the next concept is I'll cover here in
PowerPoint<00:00:04.770> is<00:00:05.490> using<00:00:06.359> animations<00:00:07.350> and

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
PowerPoint is using animations and

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.879 
PowerPoint is using animations and
here's<00:00:08.250> how<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.610> works<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.500> basically<00:00:10.500> we<00:00:10.710> go

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
here's how that works so basically we go

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.940 
here's how that works so basically we go
here<00:00:11.099> under<00:00:11.190> animations<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.679> for<00:00:13.679> example

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
here under animations and for example

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.890 
here under animations and for example
this<00:00:14.070> slide<00:00:14.280> right<00:00:14.820> now<00:00:14.849> does<00:00:15.299> not<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.540> any

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
this slide right now does not have any

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.170 
this slide right now does not have any
animations<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.279> if<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.520> went<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.850> insert

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
animations so if I went to insert

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.109 
animations so if I went to insert
animations<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.140> could<00:00:19.740> choose<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.910> those

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
animations I could choose one of those

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.950 
animations I could choose one of those
options<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.730> how<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:23.939> all<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.449> here

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
options so that how it's all up here

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.660 
options so that how it's all up here
so<00:00:25.380> if<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.529> only<00:00:25.590> do<00:00:25.859> insert<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> animation

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
so if I only do insert in the animation

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.179 
so if I only do insert in the animation
I<00:00:26.970> click<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.330> add<00:00:27.570> animation<00:00:27.890> so<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.949> pick<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
I click on add animation so I pick a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.460 
I click on add animation so I pick a
component<00:00:29.670> first<00:00:30.090> when<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.840> click<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.199> add

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
component first when I click on add

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.729 
component first when I click on add
animation<00:00:31.790> and<00:00:32.790> then<00:00:32.910> big<00:00:33.329> how<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> want<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
animation and then big how I want that

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.549 
animation and then big how I want that
animation<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.880> show<00:00:36.480> up<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.260> case

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
animation to show up so in this case

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.910 
animation to show up so in this case
I'll<00:00:37.860> choose<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.700> fly<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> bullets<00:00:40.770> at

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
I'll choose to fly in so the bullets at

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.580 
I'll choose to fly in so the bullets at
this<00:00:41.100> point<00:00:41.520> they<00:00:41.790> will<00:00:41.850> fly<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.510> now<00:00:43.110> one

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
this point they will fly in now one

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.799 
this point they will fly in now one
other<00:00:43.680> thing<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.489> well<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.090> which<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
other thing to do as well is which is

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.819 
other thing to do as well is which is
helpful<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.270> reveal<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.719> animation<00:00:49.350> pane

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
helpful is to reveal this animation pane

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.430 
helpful is to reveal this animation pane
so<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.309> click<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.640> animation<00:00:50.910> pane<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.320> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so we click on animation pane and it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.069 
so we click on animation pane and it
kind<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> tells<00:00:52.980> us<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.750> door<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
kind of tells us here as to what door it

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.830 
kind of tells us here as to what door it
shows<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.480> options<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.809> available

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
shows what we options we have available

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.490 
shows what we options we have available
what<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.980> animated<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.730> far<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.600> notice

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
what we have animated so far so notice

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.119 
what we have animated so far so notice
so<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:03.090> one<00:01:03.359> place<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.710> bundle

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
so we have one one one place this bundle

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.330 
so we have one one one place this bundle
here<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.820> section<00:01:06.290> will<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.590> show<00:01:08.070> up

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
here this section will all show up

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.649 
here this section will all show up
together<00:01:08.780> then<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.560> -<00:01:11.070> -<00:01:11.610> -<00:01:12.030> all<00:01:12.360> of

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
together then we have this - - - all of

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.210 
together then we have this - - - all of
these<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.200> means<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.890> these<00:01:14.010> when

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
these that means that all of these when

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.370 
these that means that all of these when
we<00:01:14.310> go<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> present<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.689> will<00:01:15.869> show<00:01:16.140> up

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
we go to present it they will show up

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.160 
we go to present it they will show up
together<00:01:16.650> at<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> same<00:01:17.430> time<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.689> here's<00:01:18.990> how

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
together at the same time so here's how

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.410 
together at the same time so here's how
it<00:01:19.290> will<00:01:19.350> come<00:01:19.530> up<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.890> far<00:01:20.060> those<00:01:21.060> things

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
it will come up so far those things

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.210 
it will come up so far those things
together<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:22.229> give<00:01:22.380> me<00:01:22.500> now<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:22.860> about<00:01:22.950> if

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
together they give me now what about if

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
together they give me now what about if
we<00:01:23.340> wanted<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.670> change<00:01:24.000> those<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:24.990> they

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
we wanted to change those so that they

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.580 
we wanted to change those so that they
came<00:01:25.470> separately<00:01:26.119> so<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.270> change<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.930> we

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
came separately so to change that we

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
came separately so to change that we
need<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.920> click<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.700> somewhere<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.299> we

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
have this section right here and under

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.609 
have this section right here and under
the<00:01:32.970> animation<00:01:33.509> pane<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.259> drop

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619

if I present this click one click two

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.850 
if I present this click one click two
didn't<00:02:13.560> take

facts<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.550> then<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.480> one<00:02:16.880> let's<00:02:17.880> say<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.360> its

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
facts and then this one let's say on its

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.610 
facts and then this one let's say on its
own<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:19.350> number<00:02:19.710> three<00:02:21.350> let's<00:02:22.350> try<00:02:22.560> this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
own like number three let's try this

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.350 
own like number three let's try this
again<00:02:23.240> click<00:02:24.240> one<00:02:24.480> click<00:02:25.040> two<00:02:26.040> click<00:02:26.360> three

again click one click two click three

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.930 
again click one click two click three
the<00:02:27.990> reason<00:02:28.320> why<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.590> third<00:02:29.070> one<00:02:29.340> came<00:02:29.670> up

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
the reason why this third one came up

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.960 
the reason why this third one came up
earlier<00:02:30.630> together<00:02:31.290> with<00:02:31.500> number<00:02:31.800> two<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.640> was

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
earlier together with number two it was

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.270 
earlier together with number two it was
because<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.750> was<00:02:33.960> set<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.320> start<00:02:34.890> with<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
because it was set to start with the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.690 
because it was set to start with the
previous<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.300> if<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.480> present<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.960> again<00:02:37.700> pick

will show up at the same time or if I
present<00:04:37.890> it<00:04:38.010> this<00:04:38.130> way<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.830> idea<00:04:41.130> here<00:04:41.190> for

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
present it this way so the idea here for

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.750 
present it this way so the idea here for
animation<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.620> customized<00:04:43.620> each<00:04:44.070> component

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
animation is customized each component

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.400 
animation is customized each component
the<00:04:44.850> way<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.030> want<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.540> remember<00:04:46.260> don't

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
the way you want it remember don't

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.220 
the way you want it remember don't
overdo<00:04:46.980> it<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.340> then<00:04:48.000> move<00:04:48.300> stuff<00:04:48.690> up<00:04:48.960> and

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
overdo it and then move stuff up and

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.460 
overdo it and then move stuff up and
down<00:04:49.410> as<00:04:49.710> needed<00:04:52.610> same<00:04:53.610> way<00:04:53.850> it<00:04:53.910> works<00:04:54.240> for

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
down as needed same way it works for

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.900 
down as needed same way it works for
clipart<00:04:55.470> same<00:04:55.800> idea<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.340> click<00:04:56.550> on<00:04:56.670> add

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
clipart same idea you click on add

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.880 
clipart same idea you click on add
animation<00:04:58.190> fly-in<00:04:59.190> in<00:04:59.880> what<00:05:00.270> direction<00:05:00.890> now

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
animation fly-in in what direction now

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.430 
animation fly-in in what direction now
for<00:05:02.220> SmartArt<00:05:02.850> you<00:05:03.150> can<00:05:03.360> animate<00:05:03.630> smart<00:05:04.140> art

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
for SmartArt you can animate smart art

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.970 
for SmartArt you can animate smart art
as<00:05:04.740> well<00:05:05.040> and<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.850> smart<00:05:06.180> art<00:05:06.450> it's<00:05:07.110> basically

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
as well and a smart art it's basically

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.370 
as well and a smart art it's basically
the<00:05:08.220> way<00:05:08.370> you<00:05:08.430> do<00:05:08.670> that<00:05:08.850> is<00:05:09.120> by<00:05:09.450> you<00:05:09.930> select

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
the way you do that is by you select

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.710 
the way you do that is by you select
SmartArt<00:05:10.980> here<00:05:11.250> like<00:05:11.460> we<00:05:11.610> have<00:05:11.910> in<00:05:12.270> this<00:05:12.420> case

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
SmartArt here like we have in this case

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.230 
SmartArt here like we have in this case
and<00:05:13.380> actually<00:05:13.560> let<00:05:13.890> me<00:05:14.040> go<00:05:14.190> for<00:05:14.460> a<00:05:14.490> SmartArt<00:05:15.030> to

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
and actually let me go for a SmartArt to

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.010 
and actually let me go for a SmartArt to
this<00:05:15.420> one<00:05:16.910> same<00:05:17.910> idea<00:05:18.240> but<00:05:18.800> just<00:05:19.800> for<00:05:20.550> emphasis

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
this one same idea but just for emphasis

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.960 
this one same idea but just for emphasis
so<00:05:22.020> you<00:05:22.080> pick<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:23.010> whole<00:05:23.220> object<00:05:23.820> for

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
so you pick the whole object for

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.140 
so you pick the whole object for
SmartArt<00:05:24.540> and<00:05:24.870> then<00:05:25.410> you<00:05:25.500> choose<00:05:25.800> add

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
SmartArt and then you choose add

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.620 
SmartArt and then you choose add
animation<00:05:27.150> now<00:05:28.110> we<00:05:28.230> want<00:05:28.440> this<00:05:28.530> to<00:05:28.740> appear<00:05:29.130> I

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
animation now we want this to appear I

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.320 
animation now we want this to appear I
notice<00:05:30.630> on<00:05:31.010> animation<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.490> noticed<00:05:33.030> it's<00:05:33.180> one

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
notice on animation I noticed it's one

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.540 
notice on animation I noticed it's one
of<00:05:33.450> the<00:05:33.690> components<00:05:34.350> here<00:05:34.560> on<00:05:34.710> animation<00:05:35.190> for

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
of the components here on animation for

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.450 
of the components here on animation for
the<00:05:35.640> SmartArt<00:05:36.180> is<00:05:36.540> that<00:05:36.840> once<00:05:37.590> we<00:05:37.800> have<00:05:38.040> at<00:05:38.280> the

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
the SmartArt is that once we have at the

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.370 
the SmartArt is that once we have at the
object<00:05:38.880> selected<00:05:39.420> and<00:05:39.660> we<00:05:39.750> have<00:05:39.870> chosen<00:05:40.080> to

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
object selected and we have chosen to

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.960 
object selected and we have chosen to
add<00:05:40.530> animation<00:05:41.220> there's<00:05:42.030> also<00:05:42.330> an<00:05:43.970> effect

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
add animation there's also an effect

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.330 
add animation there's also an effect
options<00:05:45.690> here<00:05:45.930> under<00:05:46.050> animations<00:05:46.830> you<00:05:47.130> click

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
options here under animations you click

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.730 
options here under animations you click
on<00:05:47.460> it<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:48.150> you<00:05:48.360> can<00:05:48.480> have<00:05:48.660> them<00:05:48.810> come<00:05:49.140> one<00:05:49.470> at

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
on it and you can have them come one at

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.270 
on it and you can have them come one at
a<00:05:49.770> time<00:05:50.070> if<00:05:50.850> I<00:05:50.970> present<00:05:51.420> it<00:05:51.710> this<00:05:52.710> is<00:05:52.920> a<00:05:53.040> little

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
a time if I present it this is a little

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.830 
a time if I present it this is a little
show<00:05:53.580> up<00:05:54.350> one<00:05:55.350> at<00:05:55.470> a<00:05:55.500> time<00:05:56.210> so<00:05:57.210> unfortunately

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
show up one at a time so unfortunately

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.660 
show up one at a time so unfortunately
probably<00:05:58.020> it's<00:05:58.320> not<00:05:58.350> recording<00:05:58.980> yet<00:05:59.190> here<00:05:59.490> the

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
probably it's not recording yet here the

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.400 
probably it's not recording yet here the
whole<00:05:59.880> screen<00:06:00.330> but<00:06:00.660> they<00:06:00.900> will<00:06:01.020> be<00:06:01.140> able<00:06:01.260> to

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
whole screen but they will be able to

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.980 
whole screen but they will be able to
see<00:06:01.710> that<00:06:02.070> each<00:06:02.730> object<00:06:03.150> here<00:06:03.600> is<00:06:03.690> coming

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
see that each object here is coming

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.110 
see that each object here is coming
separately<00:06:04.200> and<00:06:05.160> again<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:05.700> way<00:06:05.790> you<00:06:05.820> control

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
separately and again the way you control

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.600 
separately and again the way you control
that<00:06:06.540> you<00:06:06.780> enable<00:06:07.050> the<00:06:07.350> animation<00:06:07.950> and<00:06:08.550> you

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
that you enable the animation and you

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.480 
that you enable the animation and you
choose<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.300> effect<00:06:09.540> options<00:06:10.110> right<00:06:10.830> here<00:06:10.860> as

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
choose the effect options right here as

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.270 
choose the effect options right here as
to<00:06:11.700> how<00:06:11.910> you<00:06:11.970> want<00:06:12.360> that<00:06:12.570> to<00:06:12.630> show<00:06:13.200> up<00:06:13.280> within

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
to how you want that to show up within

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:26.880 
to how you want that to show up within
the<00:06:15.350> SmartArt

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.820 

there's<00:06:27.890> other<00:06:28.520> animation<00:06:29.470> for<00:06:30.470> the<00:06:30.560> smart

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
there's other animation for the smart

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:37.690 
there's other animation for the smart
dog<00:06:33.940> okay<00:06:34.940> so<00:06:35.000> that's<00:06:35.240> an<00:06:35.360> animation
