00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.170
 gift for more than 5 thousand 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.420

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.080
 occasion I come to bring you this subject that 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.210
 they see on screen that I had prepared for 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.370
 all of you 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.570
 and well let's start in the 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.280
 video description english 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.340
 carl here this file once they have 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.649
 downloaded and right extract here is going 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.670
 to leave this folder here we are going to 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.760
 find the theme folder 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.350
 and another extras folder here 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.290
 that allows us with our windows 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.570
 be thus transparent 'the universal' 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.310
 patch what it does is give you permissions 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.860
 to our windows 7 so you can 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.299
 apply these kinds of topics as well 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.039
 you see it on screen 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.700
 well here I leave the operating system of 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:23.130
 64 bits and 86 light operating system 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.020
 better known as 32 bits and you do not 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.000
 they know what operating system they have 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.840
 can right click any of the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.890
 two and run as it administers under 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.180

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.510
 will you specify what kind of 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.210
 windows we have in this case 64 bits of 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.340
 that I have at this moment and good 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.720
