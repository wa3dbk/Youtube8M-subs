00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.220
 9 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.170
 mistrust so here we have it is the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.740
 two boys and on the box 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.159
 we open the box so we find the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.409
 week at the sea ​​king is so in a 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.200
 little plastic pouch which is 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.600
 placed on a cradle that presents a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.280
 kind of little by little in clothes games 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.829
 heavier that's just 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.899
 if I remove the little cradle here we have 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.780
 been adopted touched all need 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.940
 just then a crazy cradle 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.080
 remove it we see the accessories I 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.540
 go back to the accessories from here 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.540
 a few moments the cradle and the drink 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.780
 not so if we simply remove the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.790
 team yesterday to sign a small bag 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.860
 know that he has tackled the sea so we 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.390
 take off the phone that 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.760
 covers with a small protective film 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.170
 plastic that waiting to have some 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.250
 compatible accessories to consult the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.050
 women because the current time is 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.180
 not at all well will allow you at least 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.300
 protect your screen is a good point 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.230
 so to a typical plastic on the screen 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.390
 So here is a little tour of 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.769
 8 megapixel sensor phone to 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.489
 the back who seems to have moreover 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.989
 a beautiful opening 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.670
 so that's a good point I think 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.319
 brightness side is able to well the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.349
 to receive 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.269
 with a double double led flash so we 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.090
 take a good point 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.340
 this is the wii cooking sync that the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.830
 forgiveness to be precise that's it 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.680
 go back into this little silly thing with 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.060
 this little touch blum which we find 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.810
 very depressing that the documentation 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.489
 herself in a little bag that's 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.349
 also found radâmes adapter 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.670
 sector the unavoidable adapter 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:26.580
 sector 120 sector in sports 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.140
 since one but especially above all 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.239
 feels the malice wickedly a 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.500
 AC adapter to buy it's in 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.269
 any case at threshold and some time 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.850
 so and on which we will connect a 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.740
 usb cable simply 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.310
 then the case of milk as soon as it will have 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.160
 obviously find here with this famous 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.420
 week at the site 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.950
 so I'm still so good at 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.630
 resist the micro usb ezie who 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.700
 will not only allow the charge but 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.330
 also the synchronization 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.250
 So that's all in one site 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.150
 also finds a pedestrian kit that foot 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.140
 so he's going to plug jack 3.5 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.780
 worry him so who is a little 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.130
 pedestrian earphones type earphones 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.870
 it's not our habit to launch 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.760
 headphones with a plastic a whole 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.040
 little hard I think it is doing a 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.420
 little harm to the ears force to wear them 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.720
 finally for me it's mine is to be 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.340
 there with a jack 3.5 connectors 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.980
 current genres in the usa it's a small 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.770
 little touch of two simple 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.660
 originality of wilko just a little 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.700
 clip to hang it on your lapel 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.890
 stick this pedestrian lawyer and that's her 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.560
 small remote control with the button 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.210
 here is his little microphone that is the 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.040
 girl and the little button 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.180
 so that's it comes with the 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.560
 phone of course it's an obligation 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.060
 besides built course structure which 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.220
 buzz market their phone in 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.810
 France and we still find a small 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.030
 documentation that is neither more nor less 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.560
 a manual start guide 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.610
 of use and facilitates drawing with 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.530

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.800
 saying it was a manual but that 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.210

 I said publicly that the battery 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.850
 so that will teach me to look well 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.360
 to have eyes when I make videos 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.820
