00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 I'll always have a little video 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.849
 vacuum cleaner blower crusher leaves 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.870
 we will be there I managed to have it and 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.540
 10 euros promo So here by 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.480
 defect actually in attack like that that 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.359
 it's rotten that I tinkered it's a 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.250
 perfect war came out i released 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.350
 their agreement that was in the center is 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.710
 who just stood by a necklace that 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.920
 jacky donzeaud guen and greece and the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.329
 redis with our system that I have 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.829
 tinkered with the sail so in fact it's 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.280
 just one types the garbage fields 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.280
 that I tinkered 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.370
 So here we come to Genk arrive 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:01:02.430
 here a year in the trash for empire 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:01:03.510
 we see the waste and then we 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.840
 has the advantage of no longer having a sade 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.840
 prove 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.119
 so we do that pub is actually 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.009
 when I did that too it's for 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.080
 ability to blow insulation in the room 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.500
 we see it here it's heavy 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.670
 when I'll have a day nothing knew that 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.759
 allows to have ten meters of pipes done 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.960
 blow from far into the fact of 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.399
 do this on a few sheets good after 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.060
 it's the grinder is not very efficient 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.060
 in fact it is in the clear 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.069
 at the same time 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:48.659
 So here we go out we have a super in 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:53.140
 does this shredder the bridges not very well 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:56.530
 so see some stuff that comes even 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:07.260
 crushed and other leaves remains 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:09.930
 hours baptism of grinding once nice 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.359
 that's that brilliant fact not enough 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.709
 rama I 'd like that though 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:20.500
 grinders and not good enough for that 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:22.180
 so tight with another where they 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.580
 will come out in head the hardest this is 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.560
 to have a sort will go elsewhere one 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.910
 can put a pipe directly here 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.289
 so they're actually building 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.900
 it's simple so it's the hood of 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:42.010
 the trash by the frame well because 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.860
 I remember it's the hood the 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.039
 trash in it so I have a colander 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.280
 it's a colander throw the 3 euros 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.689
 So here I have a sleeve 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.509
 right here 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:05:01.119
 good now sleeve a way of 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:04.360
 repair diameter 100 done so I 

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:06.879
 pierced at 95 and I like hose end of 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.049
 blood and then a piece of wall agree a 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.089
 end of sleeve have hurt females 

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:12.339
 to hold well actually it helps to 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:15.039
 do here a shoulder of Germans do 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:17.819
 in fact so it allows to have to do 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:21.779
 a kind of a good catch that in the 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:26.409
 the trash is here and then I put a bend 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:27.429
 with here an expansion joint for 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.239
 power that the guen can go in and 

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:30.669
 go out easily 

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:32.979
 and then a collar strengthen on the corner 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.169
 there because with the weight that it makes 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:38.709
 on the under the shot of the series that 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.659
 tearing that part off I 

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:42.610
 put myself in there for so a 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:46.209
 necklace to hold to prevent that going 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.929
 defend too much so use 

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:48.929
 It's done 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.550
 it's simple
