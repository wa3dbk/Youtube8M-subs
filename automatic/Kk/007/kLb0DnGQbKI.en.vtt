00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:29.030
 red onion ribs with sugar of 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:32.020
 cane that the same 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.740
 perone beer great reserve of the highest 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.720
 some spices sweet paprika pepper that 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:44.600
 chilli and finally a juice of 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:53.410
 completion juice let's start first 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:53.410
 what the ribs goes like that 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:10.360
 we must make it so that 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.680
 the ribs are in the mouth ready 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:22.630
 we prepare ourselves for our barbecue sauce 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:25.220
 how we slice onions we cut it 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.910
 so coarse afterwards 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.910
 the crowded we take 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.310
 a clove of garlic 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.990
 usual 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:48.500
 we crush it so destroyed it's good 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:54.080
 so let's put it 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.560
 after lighting our fire a 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.560
 splash of oil 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.360
 we will brown one onion and garlic 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.509
 once the onion has browned and 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.989
 the garlic we are going to insert the sugar 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.260
 of cane 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:19.300
 so it sticks on and doesn't go away anymore 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.860
 and releases its aroma once 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.480
 the sugar will be attached to the onion 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.140
 garlic can insert our own 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:33.730

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:10.250
 we expect the works to be a little bit like this 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.950
 the alcohol goes away but the Rome remains 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.150

 a few more strokes of sauce la 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.139
 temperature in this case must be 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:03.560
 moderate 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:05.000
