we're<00:00:03.720> going<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.870> be<00:00:03.959> talking<00:00:04.080> about<00:00:04.319> grunge

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
we're going to be talking about grunge

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.460 
we're going to be talking about grunge
both<00:00:05.520> grunge<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:06.029> layers<00:00:06.299> how<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.779> remove<00:00:07.230> it

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
both grunge on layers how to remove it

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.799 
both grunge on layers how to remove it
get<00:00:07.950> rid<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.280> off<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.610> clipping<00:00:08.970> mask<00:00:09.179> but

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
get rid of it off of clipping mask but

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.900 
get rid of it off of clipping mask but
also<00:00:09.960> how<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.290> add<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:10.800> using<00:00:11.250> our<00:00:11.340> new<00:00:11.550> grunge

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
also how to add it using our new grunge

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.999 
also how to add it using our new grunge
overlays<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:13.080> let's<00:00:13.259> go<00:00:13.380> into<00:00:13.530> Photoshop<00:00:13.980> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
overlays so let's go into Photoshop and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.670 
overlays so let's go into Photoshop and
get<00:00:14.309> started<00:00:14.780> so<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.960> new<00:00:16.139> grunge

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
get started so in the new grunge

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.980 
get started so in the new grunge
overlays<00:00:17.310> product<00:00:17.760> there's<00:00:18.000> 52<00:00:18.510> different

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
overlays product there's 52 different

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.990 
overlays product there's 52 different
grunge<00:00:19.560> layers<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.279> i'll<00:00:20.460> show<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.699> how<00:00:20.789> you

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
grunge layers and i'll show you how you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.529 
grunge layers and i'll show you how you
can<00:00:21.390> utilize<00:00:21.689> those<00:00:22.760> all<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:24.090> them<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.359> be

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
can utilize those all of them can be

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.089 
can utilize those all of them can be
used<00:00:24.720> over<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.260> over<00:00:25.380> again<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:26.070> different

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
used over and over again in different

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.810 
used over and over again in different
ways<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.090> they<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.990> use<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.230> dirty<00:00:29.189> up<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
ways and they can use to dirty up or to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.209 
ways and they can use to dirty up or to
grunge<00:00:30.119> or<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.779> give<00:00:30.960> aging<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.679> texture<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
grunge or to give aging and texture to

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.750 
grunge or to give aging and texture to
things<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.930> use<00:00:34.200> those<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.620> layers<00:00:34.920> or

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
things so you can use those in layers or

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.330 
things so you can use those in layers or
you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.270> use<00:00:36.300> those<00:00:36.750> as<00:00:37.050> say<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.100> layer

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
you can use those as say like a layer

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.340 
you can use those as say like a layer
mask<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.660> show<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.840> how<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.200> both

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
mask and I can show you how to do both

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.470 
mask and I can show you how to do both
of<00:00:40.410> those<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.920> well<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.149> we'll<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.450> is

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
of those as well so what we'll do is

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.600 
of those as well so what we'll do is
this<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> background<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.430> on

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
this is the background that will be on

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.380 
this is the background that will be on
that<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.059> DVD<00:00:45.660> you'll<00:00:46.850> see<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.030> from

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that on that DVD you'll see it's from

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.479 
that on that DVD you'll see it's from
the<00:00:48.690> our<00:00:48.809> studio<00:00:49.170> collection<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:50.160> really

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the our studio collection it's really

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.310 
the our studio collection it's really
cool<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> ton<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.660> layers<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
cool and it's got a ton of layers to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.889 
cool and it's got a ton of layers to
work<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:53.210> what<00:00:54.210> I've<00:00:54.329> done<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.629> I've

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
work with here what I've done is I've

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.770 
work with here what I've done is I've
already<00:00:55.170> actually<00:00:55.590> gone<00:00:56.039> into<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.969> I've

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
already actually gone into that and I've

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
already actually gone into that and I've
created<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.440> how<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> want<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.160> look<00:00:59.510> so

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
created one how I want it to look so

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.799 
created one how I want it to look so
you'll<00:01:00.690> see<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:02.329> what<00:01:03.329> I've<00:01:03.449> done<00:01:03.480> is

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you'll see that here what I've done is

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.539 
you'll see that here what I've done is
I'll<00:01:04.199> move<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.470> over<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.250> large

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
I'll move this over so you can see large

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.380 
I'll move this over so you can see large
is<00:01:06.439> that<00:01:07.439> curves<00:01:08.010> I've<00:01:08.280> changed<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.000> color

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
is that curves I've changed that color

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.469 
is that curves I've changed that color
as<00:01:09.950> well<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.310> different<00:01:11.700> grunge<00:01:12.060> hear<00:01:12.390> in

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
as well as the different grunge hear in

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.200 
as well as the different grunge hear in
the<00:01:12.570> background<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.229> I'll<00:01:13.320> turn<00:01:13.530> those<00:01:13.740> off

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
the background so I'll turn those off

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.730 
the background so I'll turn those off
you'll<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.750> nice<00:01:15.930> patterns<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.680> are

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
you'll see really nice patterns that are

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.039 
you'll see really nice patterns that are
in<00:01:16.950> there<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.340> then<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.150> shape<00:01:18.479> layers<00:01:18.750> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
in there and then all the shape layers I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.570 
in there and then all the shape layers I
actually<00:01:19.259> group<00:01:19.740> together<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.189> make<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
actually group together to make it a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.850 
actually group together to make it a
little<00:01:20.700> bit<00:01:20.909> easier<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.390> work<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.020> then

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
little bit easier to work with and then

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.210 
little bit easier to work with and then
I<00:01:22.890> drop<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> opacity<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:24.119> all<00:01:24.420> those<00:01:24.570> so

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
I drop the opacity on all those so

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.260 
I drop the opacity on all those so
you'll<00:01:26.220> see<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> couple<00:01:26.790> different<00:01:26.909> layers

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
you'll see a couple different layers

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.090 
you'll see a couple different layers
here<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.840> pattern<00:01:28.229> there<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> background

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
here the pattern there in the background

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.550 
here the pattern there in the background
and<00:01:29.250> some<00:01:29.490> more<00:01:29.610> texture<00:01:30.200> well<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.439> like

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
and some more texture well just like

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.350 
and some more texture well just like
this<00:01:31.799> texture<00:01:32.250> right<00:01:32.369> here<00:01:32.610> has<00:01:32.790> an<00:01:32.939> overlay

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
this texture right here has an overlay

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.630 
this texture right here has an overlay
what<00:01:33.960> I've<00:01:34.049> done<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.530> put<00:01:34.740> my<00:01:34.920> own<00:01:35.100> textures

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
what I've done is I put my own textures

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.690 
what I've done is I put my own textures
in<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.780> using<00:01:37.650> two<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.189> ones<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
in there so using two of the ones that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.789 
in there so using two of the ones that
you'll<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.270> right<00:01:39.450> there<00:01:39.720> grunge<00:01:40.140> 52<00:01:40.650> in

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
you'll see right there grunge 52 in

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.179 
you'll see right there grunge 52 in
grunge<00:01:41.009> 40<00:01:41.630> if<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.930> actually<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.740> here

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
grunge 40 if we actually go in you here

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
grunge 40 if we actually go in you here

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and let me just put a background in

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620 
and let me just put a background in
there<00:01:46.229> real<00:01:46.439> quick<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.630> now

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
there real quick so you can see that now

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.219 
there real quick so you can see that now
let's<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.409> same<00:01:49.619> color<00:01:50.689> so<00:01:51.689> now<00:01:51.960> you'll

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
let's like the same color so now you'll

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.630 
let's like the same color so now you'll
see<00:01:52.439> when<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> make<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.040> little<00:01:53.220> bit<00:01:53.430> larger

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
see when I make that a little bit larger

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.429 
see when I make that a little bit larger
you'll<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.240> able<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> see<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.780> nice<00:01:55.020> grunge

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
you'll be able to see that nice grunge

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.709 
you'll be able to see that nice grunge
that's<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.159> well<00:01:56.700> all<00:01:56.969> those<00:01:57.360> grunge

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that's in there well all those grunge

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.270 
that's in there well all those grunge
overlays<00:01:58.259> are<00:01:58.409> going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.710> completely

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
overlays are going to be completely

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.179 
overlays are going to be completely
different<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.939> completely<00:02:00.090> unique<00:02:01.189> they're

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
different and completely unique they're

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.920 
different and completely unique they're
just<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.880> great<00:02:03.060> resource<00:02:03.329> for<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
just a really great resource for you to

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.380 
just a really great resource for you to
have<00:02:04.369> let's<00:02:05.369> see<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.969> looks<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.329> on

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
have let's see if what it looks like on

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.570 
have let's see if what it looks like on
this<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.320> when<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> drag<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.009> drop<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.250> one

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
this so when I drag and drop that one

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.559 
this so when I drag and drop that one
onto<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.110> under<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.140> canvas<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:11.420> what<00:02:12.420> I've

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
onto the under the canvas here what I've

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.850 
onto the under the canvas here what I've
done<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.959> done

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
done is done

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.620 
done is done
color<00:02:13.980> burn<00:02:14.250> at<00:02:14.460> forty<00:02:14.760> percent<00:02:15.090> let's<00:02:15.390> put

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
color burn at forty percent let's put

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.900 
color burn at forty percent let's put
that<00:02:15.750> back<00:02:15.990> at<00:02:16.200> normal<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:17.730> hundred

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
that back at normal and a hundred

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.190 
that back at normal and a hundred
percent<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.630> you'll<00:02:18.720> see<00:02:18.900> what<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.110> would

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
percent and you'll see what it would

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.560 
percent and you'll see what it would
normally<00:02:19.260> look<00:02:19.770> like<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.910> playing<00:02:21.270> with<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
normally look like so playing with the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.420 
normally look like so playing with the
different<00:02:21.930> layers<00:02:22.170> will<00:02:22.740> allow<00:02:22.950> me<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.280> get

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
different layers will allow me to get

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.390 
different layers will allow me to get
different<00:02:23.670> looks<00:02:24.710> so<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:25.800> can<00:02:26.010> see<00:02:26.220> how<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
different looks so you can see how the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.920 
different looks so you can see how the
texture<00:02:26.850> will<00:02:27.090> change<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:30.510> i<00:02:30.600> did<00:02:30.780> an

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
texture will change so if i did an

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.140 
texture will change so if i did an
overlay<00:02:31.560> something<00:02:32.070> like<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.520> i<00:02:32.820> could<00:02:33.060> get

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
overlay something like that i could get

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.030 
overlay something like that i could get
a<00:02:33.210> different<00:02:33.600> texture<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.170> then<00:02:34.440> if<00:02:34.560> i<00:02:34.710> drop

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
a different texture and then if i drop

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.140 
a different texture and then if i drop
down<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:37.110> opacity<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:38.070> could<00:02:38.430> change<00:02:38.610> how<00:02:38.910> much

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
down the opacity I could change how much

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.949 
down the opacity I could change how much
of<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.570> want<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.959> show<00:02:40.140> through<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.750> let's

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
of that I want to show through so let's

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.620 
of that I want to show through so let's
do<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.320> about<00:02:43.770> forty-five<00:02:44.250> percent<00:02:44.630> the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
do that about forty-five percent the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.120 
do that about forty-five percent the
other<00:02:45.780> one<00:02:46.050> you'll<00:02:46.230> see<00:02:46.440> I've<00:02:46.620> done<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.980> same

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
other one you'll see I've done the same

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.340 
other one you'll see I've done the same
thing<00:02:47.190> here<00:02:47.700> another<00:02:48.150> color<00:02:48.480> burn<00:02:48.750> at<00:02:49.020> fifty

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
thing here another color burn at fifty

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.470 
thing here another color burn at fifty
percent<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.850> let's<00:02:51.000> change<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.270> back<00:02:51.450> to

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
percent so let's change it back to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.530 
percent so let's change it back to
normal<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.220> hundred<00:02:53.220> percent<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.880> as<00:02:54.360> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
normal a hundred percent and as the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.020 
normal a hundred percent and as the
quick<00:02:54.900> click<00:02:55.590> through<00:02:56.040> quickly<00:02:56.550> through<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
quick click through quickly through the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.420 
quick click through quickly through the
different<00:02:57.510> layer<00:02:58.260> styles<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:59.010> see<00:02:59.280> what

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
different layer styles you can see what

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.449 
different layer styles you can see what
that<00:02:59.610> would<00:02:59.760> do<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.830> put<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.130> back<00:03:02.250> at<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
that would do so you put it back at a

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.180 
that would do so you put it back at a
color<00:03:02.700> burn<00:03:03.140> but<00:03:04.140> then<00:03:04.290> let's<00:03:04.500> drop<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.980> down

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
color burn but then let's drop it down

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.560 
color burn but then let's drop it down
like<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.180> said<00:03:06.330> about<00:03:07.850> fifty<00:03:08.850> percent<00:03:08.880> works

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
like I said about fifty percent works

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.340 
like I said about fifty percent works
for<00:03:09.780> me<00:03:10.790> ok<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.420> we<00:03:12.540> turn<00:03:12.720> back<00:03:12.750> on<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.230> other

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
for me ok so we turn back on the other

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.560 
for me ok so we turn back on the other
layers<00:03:13.650> we<00:03:14.640> could<00:03:14.820> go<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.330> we<00:03:15.420> could

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
layers we could go in and we could

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.930 
layers we could go in and we could
change<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.959> here<00:03:16.620> we<00:03:17.160> could<00:03:17.340> turn<00:03:17.520> on<00:03:17.730> and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
change that here we could turn on and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.240 
change that here we could turn on and
off<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.239> shapes<00:03:18.510> but<00:03:19.410> you'll<00:03:19.590> see<00:03:19.830> what<00:03:20.070> we've

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
off the shapes but you'll see what we've

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.320 
off the shapes but you'll see what we've
done<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:20.880> come<00:03:21.870> up<00:03:21.989> with<00:03:22.170> something<00:03:22.620> that

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
done is come up with something that

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.120 
done is come up with something that
originally<00:03:25.820> look<00:03:26.820> just<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:28.130> with

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
originally look just like this and with

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.130 
originally look just like this and with
those<00:03:29.310> grunge<00:03:29.640> layers<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.180> dirtied<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:30.989> up

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
those grunge layers just dirtied it up

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.660 
those grunge layers just dirtied it up
real<00:03:31.440> nice<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.920> made<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.130> look<00:03:32.160> completely

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
real nice and made it look completely

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.660 
real nice and made it look completely
different<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:34.170> we'll<00:03:34.350> get<00:03:34.799> rid<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:35.010> those<00:03:35.280> and

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
different so we'll get rid of those and

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.640 
different so we'll get rid of those and
there'll<00:03:36.209> be<00:03:36.239> another<00:03:36.570> way<00:03:36.810> what<00:03:37.080> we<00:03:37.260> can<00:03:37.440> do

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
there'll be another way what we can do

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.979 
there'll be another way what we can do
is<00:03:37.880> take<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> nice<00:03:39.180> vintage<00:03:39.540> image<00:03:40.940> right<00:03:41.989> that

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
is take a nice vintage image right that

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.720 
is take a nice vintage image right that
originally<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.980> looks<00:03:44.190> something<00:03:44.400> like<00:03:44.580> this

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
originally it looks something like this

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.600 
originally it looks something like this
right<00:03:45.480> nice<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.810> clean<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:47.400> kind<00:03:47.580> of

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
right nice and clean it's just kind of

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.070 
right nice and clean it's just kind of
lacking<00:03:47.910> something<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.570> want<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.750> little<00:03:48.900> bit

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
lacking something I want a little bit

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.620 
lacking something I want a little bit
more<00:03:49.290> artistic<00:03:49.890> effect<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:51.390> what<00:03:51.540> I'll

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
more artistic effect to it so what I'll

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.800 
more artistic effect to it so what I'll
do<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:53.130> reduce<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.670> I've<00:03:53.940> taken<00:03:54.540> those

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
do is just reduce that I've taken those

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.440 
do is just reduce that I've taken those
same<00:03:55.080> exact<00:03:55.500> grunge<00:03:55.830> layers<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.549> I've<00:03:57.150> placed

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
same exact grunge layers and I've placed

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.720 
same exact grunge layers and I've placed
those<00:03:57.630> on<00:03:57.810> here<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.380> instead<00:03:59.100> of<00:03:59.250> doing<00:03:59.549> like

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
those on here and instead of doing like

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.270 
those on here and instead of doing like
an<00:03:59.910> overlay<00:04:00.480> or<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.720> color<00:04:01.049> burn<00:04:01.350> what<00:04:01.920> actually

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
an overlay or a color burn what actually

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.100 
an overlay or a color burn what actually
did<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:02.580> screen<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.390> see<00:04:03.750> now<00:04:03.930> it

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
did is a screen so you see now it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.970 
did is a screen so you see now it
lightens<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.709> up<00:04:06.110> so<00:04:07.110> depending<00:04:07.650> on<00:04:07.769> those

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
lightens it up so depending on those

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.090 
lightens it up so depending on those
different<00:04:08.840> blending<00:04:09.840> modes<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.739> different

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
different blending modes the different

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.190 
different blending modes the different
layer<00:04:11.220> styles<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.269> all<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.480> way<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:13.079> you

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
layer styles and all the way that you

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.870 
layer styles and all the way that you
change<00:04:13.470> how<00:04:13.650> those<00:04:13.829> those<00:04:14.220> different<00:04:14.730> layers

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
change how those those different layers

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.909 
change how those those different layers
interact<00:04:15.360> together<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:16.320> can<00:04:16.470> get<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.620> really

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
interact together you can get a really

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.520 
interact together you can get a really
cool<00:04:17.250> look<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.609> feel<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.150> we<00:04:18.900> have<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:19.200> same

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
cool look and feel so we have that same

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.830 
cool look and feel so we have that same
one<00:04:19.799> you'll<00:04:20.190> see<00:04:20.400> here<00:04:20.820> if<00:04:21.180> we<00:04:21.299> put<00:04:21.479> it<00:04:21.540> back<00:04:21.660> to

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
one you'll see here if we put it back to

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.170 
one you'll see here if we put it back to
normal<00:04:22.200> you'll<00:04:22.410> see<00:04:22.620> that<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:23.789> actually

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
normal you'll see that but I actually

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.160 
normal you'll see that but I actually
have<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:24.750> out<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:24.990> soft<00:04:25.410> light<00:04:25.710> right<00:04:26.190> there

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
have it out of soft light right there

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.780 
have it out of soft light right there
so<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.440> just<00:04:27.500> creates<00:04:27.920> a<00:04:28.010> real<00:04:28.220> nice<00:04:28.400> effect

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
so it just creates a real nice effect

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.520 
so it just creates a real nice effect
and<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.060> even<00:04:29.300> can<00:04:29.480> put<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.930> with<00:04:30.410> that

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
and I even can put that it with that

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.460 
and I even can put that it with that
soft<00:04:30.860> light<00:04:31.100> at<00:04:31.250> one<00:04:31.340> hundred<00:04:31.400> percent<00:04:32.470> here

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
soft light at one hundred percent here

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.140 
soft light at one hundred percent here
what<00:04:33.800> I<00:04:33.830> did<00:04:34.040> is<00:04:34.190> sixty<00:04:34.580> percent<00:04:34.730> in<00:04:35.060> the

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
what I did is sixty percent in the

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.600 
what I did is sixty percent in the
screen<00:04:35.480> so<00:04:36.020> if<00:04:36.350> you<00:04:36.470> see<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.830> effect<00:04:37.100> there<00:04:37.430> I

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
screen so if you see the effect there I

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.720 
screen so if you see the effect there I
can<00:04:38.210> control<00:04:38.630> that<00:04:38.780> as<00:04:38.960> well<00:04:39.140> so<00:04:39.410> say<00:04:39.650> I'm<00:04:39.740> want

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
can control that as well so say I'm want

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.220 
can control that as well so say I'm want
it<00:04:40.820> there<00:04:41.060> but<00:04:41.270> just<00:04:41.510> a<00:04:41.600> little<00:04:41.840> bit<00:04:42.050> more

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
it there but just a little bit more

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.470 
it there but just a little bit more
subtle<00:04:42.730> you<00:04:43.730> know<00:04:43.820> we<00:04:43.970> could<00:04:44.090> do<00:04:44.210> something

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
subtle you know we could do something

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.500 
subtle you know we could do something
like<00:04:44.630> forty<00:04:45.080> percent<00:04:45.910> okay<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.150> then<00:04:47.300> what<00:04:47.450> I

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
like forty percent okay and then what I

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.540 
like forty percent okay and then what I
did<00:04:47.780> is<00:04:47.930> I<00:04:48.020> put<00:04:48.230> one<00:04:48.470> more<00:04:48.650> in<00:04:48.710> there<00:04:48.860> just

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
did is I put one more in there just

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.250 
did is I put one more in there just
multiplying<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:50.390> same<00:04:50.660> effect<00:04:51.020> with<00:04:51.140> the

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
multiplying that same effect with the

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.310 
multiplying that same effect with the
screen<00:04:51.710> at<00:04:52.400> thirty-five<00:04:53.000> percent<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:54.080> if<00:04:54.170> I

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
screen at thirty-five percent so if I

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.040 
screen at thirty-five percent so if I
see<00:04:54.560> if<00:04:54.740> I<00:04:54.860> turn<00:04:55.070> all<00:04:55.250> those<00:04:55.430> off<00:04:55.930> you'll<00:04:56.930> see

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
see if I turn all those off you'll see

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.230 
see if I turn all those off you'll see
just<00:04:57.110> a<00:04:57.380> really<00:04:57.950> cool<00:04:58.160> quick<00:04:58.550> effect<00:04:58.970> using

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
just a really cool quick effect using

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.990 
just a really cool quick effect using
those<00:04:59.540> different<00:04:59.990> grunge<00:05:00.290> overlays<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.820> give

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
those different grunge overlays to give

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.670 
those different grunge overlays to give
it<00:05:02.150> more<00:05:02.360> of<00:05:02.420> that<00:05:02.660> vintage<00:05:03.020> feel<00:05:03.200> that

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
it more of that vintage feel that

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.710 
it more of that vintage feel that
vintage<00:05:03.890> pop<00:05:04.340> to<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:04.550> so<00:05:05.330> those<00:05:05.510> are<00:05:05.660> some

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
vintage pop to it so those are some

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.180 
vintage pop to it so those are some
different<00:05:06.170> effects<00:05:06.440> that<00:05:06.620> you<00:05:06.710> can<00:05:06.890> get<00:05:07.040> with

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
different effects that you can get with

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.950 
different effects that you can get with

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.370 
with it to see what you can come up with
in<00:05:13.880> another<00:05:14.240> tutorial<00:05:14.480> what<00:05:14.930> we'll<00:05:15.080> do<00:05:15.230> is

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
in another tutorial what we'll do is

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.300 
in another tutorial what we'll do is
we'll<00:05:15.560> remove<00:05:16.010> or<00:05:16.490> add<00:05:17.140> grunge<00:05:18.190> using<00:05:19.190> the

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
we'll remove or add grunge using the

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.550 
we'll remove or add grunge using the
brushes<00:05:19.790> or<00:05:20.120> clipping<00:05:20.660> masks<00:05:21.050> in<00:05:21.170> different

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
brushes or clipping masks in different

brushes or clipping masks in different
layer<00:05:21.740> mask<00:05:22.130> so<00:05:22.730> keep<00:05:22.940> an<00:05:23.090> eye<00:05:23.210> out<00:05:23.240> for<00:05:23.390> that
