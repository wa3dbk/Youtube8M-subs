00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
preparing to go to college and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
preparing to go to college and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
normal to feel a bit pressured and you

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.069

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.600 
normal and stuff but then I started
getting<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.750> panic<00:01:49.320> attacks<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:50.009> school<00:01:50.369> and

getting like panic attacks in school and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.690 
getting like panic attacks in school and
once<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.750> was<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:53.009> her<00:01:53.130> parents<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.610> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
once I was like with her parents in a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.330 
once I was like with her parents in a
car<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.270> were<00:01:54.509> driving<00:01:55.079> home<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.829> Joe<00:01:56.130> I

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
car and we were driving home and Joe I

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.280 
car and we were driving home and Joe I
just<00:01:56.820> started<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.420> know<00:01:57.570> getting<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.140> these

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
just started you know getting all these

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.679 
just started you know getting all these
tingles<00:01:58.890> through<00:01:59.189> my<00:01:59.340> arms<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.240> legs<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.659> I

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
tingles through my arms and legs and I

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.840 
tingles through my arms and legs and I
like<00:02:00.899> literally<00:02:01.500> couldn't<00:02:01.829> move<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.520> it's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
like literally couldn't move and it's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.060 
like literally couldn't move and it's
just<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.299> really<00:02:03.600> scary<00:02:03.930> experience<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
just a really scary experience and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.700 
just a really scary experience and
basically<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.360> your<00:02:06.540> body<00:02:06.750> reacting

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
basically it's just your body reacting

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.130 
basically it's just your body reacting
to<00:02:07.950> trust<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.940> are<00:02:08.970> under

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
to trust that you are under

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.350 
to trust that you are under
I'm<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.920> type<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.130> person<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.820> mean<00:02:12.000> I'm<00:02:12.120> very

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
I'm the type of person I mean I'm very

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.740 
I'm the type of person I mean I'm very
emotional<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.760> don't<00:02:14.760> really<00:02:15.030> cry<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> lot

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
emotional but I don't really cry a lot

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.530 
emotional but I don't really cry a lot
so<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.530> guess<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.610> kind<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.030> blocked<00:02:18.360> my

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
so I guess I just kind of blocked my

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.360 
so I guess I just kind of blocked my
feelings<00:02:18.960> inside<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.710> don't<00:02:19.740> really<00:02:20.160> let

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
feelings inside and I don't really let

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.640 
feelings inside and I don't really let
it<00:02:20.520> go<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.420> not<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> good<00:02:22.080> thing<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.350> do

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
it go and that is not a good thing to do

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.710 
it go and that is not a good thing to do
and<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.130> never<00:02:23.250> used<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.910> be<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.570> used

wasn't<00:05:30.250> studying<00:05:30.550> before<00:05:30.849> I<00:05:31.090> really<00:05:31.599> was<00:05:31.780> but

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
wasn't studying before I really was but

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.200 
wasn't studying before I really was but
I<00:05:32.500> just<00:05:32.770> felt<00:05:33.130> like<00:05:33.340> when<00:05:33.520> I<00:05:33.550> was<00:05:33.699> at<00:05:33.849> home<00:05:34.090> it

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
I just felt like when I was at home it

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.110 
I just felt like when I was at home it
was<00:05:34.389> a<00:05:34.449> lot<00:05:34.659> harder<00:05:34.690> to<00:05:35.380> stop<00:05:35.590> her<00:05:35.740> case

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
was a lot harder to stop her case

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.240 
was a lot harder to stop her case
procrastinating<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:38.229> I<00:05:38.470> just<00:05:38.710> couldn't

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
procrastinating and that I just couldn't

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.399 
procrastinating and that I just couldn't
make<00:05:39.340> result<00:05:39.789> go<00:05:39.970> and<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.419> know<00:05:40.510> do<00:05:40.720> my<00:05:40.840> tasks

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
make result go and you know do my tasks

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.620 
make result go and you know do my tasks
and<00:05:41.590> I<00:05:41.740> just<00:05:41.979> felt<00:05:42.159> really<00:05:42.220> lazy<00:05:42.639> but<00:05:43.449> that's

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
and I just felt really lazy but that's

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.629 
and I just felt really lazy but that's
just<00:05:43.780> because<00:05:44.139> you<00:05:44.289> know<00:05:44.409> I<00:05:44.440> I<00:05:44.889> had<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.460> option

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
just because you know I I had the option

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.779 
just because you know I I had the option
to<00:05:46.030> say<00:05:46.180> no<00:05:46.419> so<00:05:47.139> now<00:05:47.560> I<00:05:47.590> actually<00:05:48.190> go<00:05:48.580> to<00:05:48.639> the

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
to say no so now I actually go to the

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.360 
to say no so now I actually go to the
library<00:05:48.820> to<00:05:49.389> start<00:05:49.630> studying<00:05:49.870> and<00:05:50.320> that<00:05:51.039> works

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
library to start studying and that works

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.339 
library to start studying and that works
out<00:05:51.550> perfectly<00:05:52.180> because<00:05:52.449> you<00:05:53.110> know<00:05:53.199> when

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
out perfectly because you know when

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:54.810 
out perfectly because you know when
you're<00:05:53.500> there<00:05:53.680> it's<00:05:53.889> just<00:05:54.039> so<00:05:54.220> silent<00:05:54.669> and

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
you're there it's just so silent and

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.249 
you're there it's just so silent and
people<00:05:55.120> are<00:05:55.240> studying<00:05:55.509> around<00:05:55.750> you<00:05:56.020> so<00:05:56.080> you

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
people are studying around you so you

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:57.510 
people are studying around you so you
don't<00:05:56.440> have<00:05:56.530> to<00:05:56.680> really<00:05:56.860> have<00:05:57.039> anything<00:05:57.370> else

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
don't have to really have anything else

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.570 
don't have to really have anything else
to<00:05:57.729> do<00:05:57.849> but<00:05:58.389> to<00:05:58.870> start<00:05:59.320> studying<00:05:59.560> so<00:05:59.979> that's

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
to do but to start studying so that's

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.950 
to do but to start studying so that's
what<00:06:00.729> I've<00:06:00.820> been<00:06:00.849> doing<00:06:00.970> and<00:06:01.330> that<00:06:01.360> has<00:06:01.750> been

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
what I've been doing and that has been

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.080 
what I've been doing and that has been
amazing<00:06:02.830> really<00:06:03.099> amazing<00:06:03.460> I<00:06:03.520> feel<00:06:03.669> like<00:06:03.820> it

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
amazing really amazing I feel like it

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.270 
amazing really amazing I feel like it
takes<00:06:04.389> me<00:06:04.539> a<00:06:04.599> lot<00:06:04.720> less<00:06:05.020> you<00:06:05.440> learn<00:06:05.740> something

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
takes me a lot less you learn something

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.950 
takes me a lot less you learn something
and<00:06:06.490> to<00:06:06.639> prepare<00:06:06.970> for<00:06:07.030> like<00:06:07.330> an<00:06:07.479> exam<00:06:07.780> or

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
and to prepare for like an exam or

and to prepare for like an exam or
something<00:06:08.139> which<00:06:08.800> is<00:06:08.919> always<00:06:09.070> a<00:06:09.190> good<00:06:09.400> thing

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
something which is always a good thing

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.760 
something which is always a good thing
and<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:10.419> third<00:06:10.630> thing<00:06:10.960> and<00:06:11.139> final<00:06:11.530> thing<00:06:11.740> that

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770
