00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.510
 well these terraces are millenary that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.850
 we inherit from our 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.790
 ancestors the forms of construction 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.490
 It is made of stone and then 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.330
 they are stuffed with earth and then 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.440
 then the lands are credited 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.880
 and it is planted and here in bell is a 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.140
 very fertile valley that is given almost everything 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.510
 scallions below equal chives but 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.640
 the bud is just coming more 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.360
 down the reserves are planted below 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.170
 the last ones below are recorded 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.920
 increases this series of celery the parsley is 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.450
 thematic there was an apple is more 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.910
 cooperate 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.490
 As I said, almost everything is given 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.050
 well here the irrigation system is for 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.970
 flood 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.730
 Likewise, the water comes from a spring that 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.280
 is already towards the end and watered by 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.890
 this channel does not waste water 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.660
 because all the rest that remains of the water 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.400
 which falls into a pond that later 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.550
 return occupy to fix our 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.920
 sector I had drought but for 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.450
 example this year it rained very much lived 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 very much the rain was good for 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.180
 us because the same will be irrigated 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.970
 fields all the stone is cleaned 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.320
 everything is purified the earth is that equal 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.010
 I peel the rain for us 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.470
 example is very very well received 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.720
 until the canal clean party 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.930
 which is where a payment is made to the land 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.409
 to ask for water on earth 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.479
 for crops by planting 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.939
 same is a ceremony that is the same here 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.069
 it takes a lot of protection that is not given to 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.590
 meet people because it's like 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.510
 more private more more internal more own 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.120
 of the community 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.220
 life is for it is very quiet all the 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.150
 people are dedicated to work what is the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.020
 agriculture the small livestock but if 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.520
 For example, people have not allowed 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.380
 come outside people without such with 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.970
 the tourism company who can 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.060
 develop tourism has to be the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.370
 people from here from Caspana from here 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.480
 you can not sell land either 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.730
 can sell the water do not 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.050
 in that sense followed as guarding 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.050
 the heritage of the town here 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.760
