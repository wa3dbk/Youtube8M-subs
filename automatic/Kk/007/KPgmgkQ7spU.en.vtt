 it allows you to have a cooking 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.109
 very very accurate then we will start 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.930
 look at artichoke backgrounds from 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.390
 frozen trade or so we turn them 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.099
 show men okay we like it look in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.969
 the small gastro tray with holes in agreement 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.630
 go slightly seasoned here you go 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.809
 pepper from the mill 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.270

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.930
 artichokes with vapors wissant beugré 20 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.850
 minutes of cooking 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.719
 it would plunge'll see it's great 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:58.829
 nice cooking steam 100 degrees and the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:01:00.510
 20 minutes and we bake it's gone 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.070
 while the artichokes are cooking we will 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.019
 to take care of foie gras so keep yourself 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.939
 have a block of raw foie gras 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.710
 ok let's go less I'll cut it in 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.720
 slices about 1 cm thick 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.830
 it must be cold when 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.240
 I put them on the board 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.680
 thou season and what you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.950
 that he does then I take the mac the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.380
 no longer have the fat that surrounds 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.520
 this is actually dried duck breast and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.250
 smoked and so the rd12 and long life here 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.130
 simply remove the skin that the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.939
 fake fat it's rich enough 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.939
 dropped me here 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.460
 go I continue I cut but 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.170
 slice of foie gras and duck breast 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.210
 that's me I'm going to season on 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.240
 two sides a little bit of flower of 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.240
 salt 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.110
 add on both sides we will 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.560
 see we will repeat the operation on 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.590
 each face a nice round of pepper 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.590
 mill 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.890
 and if you like very slight tip 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.189
 gives up the very light 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.990
 I admire infogrames here and we go 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.990
 repeat the operation on the other side 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.280
 here are our artichokes are cooked look 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.560
 we check the cooking with the tip 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.490
 of a knife and has it perfect and what 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.870
 is good but steam cooking is 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.500
 that we looked at either they did not blacken 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.960
 his niqab 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.790
 ok then we continue a nice terrine 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.860
 you'll see it's super simple a 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.350
 beautiful terrine me I put my foie gras 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.370
 at the bottom of the terrine with one layer and 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.800
 then we'll try lightly with a 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.470
 a tablespoon to have some 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.010
 good thing ten years a really pretty 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:48.260
 layer do not hesitate and there the first 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.430
 layer we took a little bit for the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.120
 foie gras you know a little warmed up 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.380
 to a flawless 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.940
 so now look we're going to put 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.000
 smoked duck breast a layer of duck breasts 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.980
 girls and everything let it appear 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.980
 it's super fast to do after there is 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:10.280
 a beautiful cooking a layer of 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.040
 number and then even before our little ones 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.320
 artichokes cut into slices of 5 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:30.709
 mm they are impeccable in cooking well 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:32.209
 homogeneous and we go the rows and you 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.520
 have finished your marbled foie gras 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.070
 obviously by a layer of liver 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.290
 fat because that will allow to 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.750
 to hold the foie gras is to make the jury 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.000
 couples in Lyon in a final 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.790
 layer of foie gras and we will go and 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.770
 after cooking the terrine is finished on 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.739
 will cook it with the small lid to 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.970
 65 ° steam for about 45 minutes 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:04:00.440
 it is gone marbled of foie gras in 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:03.920

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:13.100
 men have chosen steam cooking 65 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:15.800
 degrees and 45 minutes and it's gone 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.739
 our terrines and cooked so be careful 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.810
 do not burn and there is a very small 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.430
 little fat that on the surface agree and 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.760
 immediately in a small plate of a 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.130

 like that in a corner of the kitchen and 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.610

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.800
 the same generator we will put it at 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.840
 refrigerator and optimally one 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.850
 will wait at least 48 hours have 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.720
