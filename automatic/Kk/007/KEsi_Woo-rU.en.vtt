00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and I've got them on a baking tray line

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.510 
and I've got them on a baking tray line

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
would not stick baking paper and would

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.130 
would not stick baking paper and would
have<00:01:50.640> done<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.090> cut<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> stems<00:01:51.840> out<00:01:51.990> of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
have done is I just cut the stems out of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
have done is I just cut the stems out of
all<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> them<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.070> what<00:01:53.189> we're<00:01:53.280> going<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.460> do<00:01:53.579> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
all of them so what we're going to do is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.399 
all of them so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.149> put<00:01:54.329> them<00:01:54.509> cut<00:01:55.140> side<00:01:55.170> down

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
we're going to put them cut side down

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.920 
we're going to put them cut side down
just<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.610> I've<00:01:57.240> preheated<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
just like so and I've preheated the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.380 
just like so and I've preheated the
grill<00:01:58.500> or<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:59.219> America's<00:01:59.610> caught<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> boil<00:02:00.149> off

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
grill or in America's caught a boil off

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.300 
grill or in America's caught a boil off
so<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.229> will<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.950> cook<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
so what that will do is just cook the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.859 
so what that will do is just cook the
top<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.850> I'm<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.090> place<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.329> into<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
top so I'm going to place it into the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.150 
top so I'm going to place it into the
boiler<00:02:04.290> or<00:02:04.530> guerrilla<00:02:04.920> 45<00:02:05.820> minutes<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.659> high

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
boiler or guerrilla 45 minutes on high

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.249 
boiler or guerrilla 45 minutes on high
so<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.310> about<00:02:08.489> 200<00:02:09.030> grams<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.539> nonfat

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
