 tips to have beautiful hair 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.960

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.150

 Indian does not mean you do not go 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.740
 because there are bath droplets or bones 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.080
 the supermarket you can put them in 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.990
 the head to wash your body tip 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.870
 number 2 when we bathe many 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.670
 we usually tell the 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.920
 shampoo with nails 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.280
 the ideal would be with the yolks of the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.480
 fingers do like a light massage or this 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.640
 will help to have a better 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.390
 circulation and grow faster than 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.840
 hair 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.780
 3 I recommend you use conditioning 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.780
 of public media to use 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.240
 softest hair number 4 the mother the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.280
 aunty stockings and the truth has 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.060
 It worked a lot to him 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.610
 I recommend too much and this one consists of 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.100
 Brush your hair from behind to 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.900
 go ahead this will work to you 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.850
 grow hair faster 4152 there 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.520
 to tell 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.069
 is to find your hair every month or 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.800
 every two or three months or when the moon 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.550
 be at your point is only lie 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.890
 imagine the hair 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.120
 grows an approximate centimeter every month 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.030
 and cut one centimeter a month that they 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.640
 will grow nothing because what is 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.610
 increased you already cut it then 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.520
 will continue with the same haircut I 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.780
 I have not cut my hair since 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.470
 I was going to move to the second high school 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.380
 here they can put the before and the 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.120
 then I did not cut myself at all for 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.170
 nothing at all 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.980
 and I have so long so 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.620
 6 do not abuse the dryer or iron 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.560
 there are thousands of ways to approach 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.569
 to the hair the best of all is when 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.360
 you dry it naturally I recommend you 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.760
 much that you use a heat protector 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.600
 this serves so that you do not mistreat yourself 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.090
 hair while you put everything on 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.489
 Tip 827 is one of the best that 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.550
 I have hair after bathing is 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:20.840
 very complicated I recommend you to wait 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.180
 minimum 5 minutes before brushing the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.850
 hair because if you did not know fair 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.700
 after bathing the annie wait for the 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.709
 minutes needed if it can break 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.540
 the hair that I highly recommend 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.989
 It has served quite 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.480
 to nourish the broken ends you go 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.909
 to sleep I recommend you to do a 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.129
 braid this is going to help you when 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.540
 you wake up in the morning do not wake up 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.629
 with the hairs yes 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.030
 or share these level that when you 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:55.409
 awake they will have natural Chinese 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.900
 and be so pretty 9 and look at your hair 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.560
 three times a day so you have a 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.950
 softer and more manageable hair and 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.739
 we get to number 10 the feed is 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.599
 necessary for hair we never think 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.459
 in the food when you talk about the 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.379
 hair 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.370
 so sometimes junk food does not 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.370
 I cough penalty 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:26.110
 well we can waste it 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.110
 the food and less if they make us eyes 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.480
 but if it is of beautiful hair the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.850
 proteins are your best allies good 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.680
 this was all for today I hope 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.440
 you have served a lot these 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.260
