resolution<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.380> yeah<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.149> mean<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
resolution so yeah the that I mean that

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.290 
resolution so yeah the that I mean that
is<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.630> biggest<00:02:06.960> difference<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:08.640> screen<00:02:09.030> and

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
is the biggest difference the screen and

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.839 
is the biggest difference the screen and
Google's<00:02:10.110> telling<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> screen<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.129> be<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
Google's telling the screen to be the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.290 
Google's telling the screen to be the
best<00:02:12.180> screen<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.840> tab

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
best screen on the tab

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.990 
best screen on the tab
ever<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:14.170> highest<00:02:14.440> res<00:02:14.890> they<00:02:15.490> said<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.760> think

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
ever the highest res they said I think

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.020 
ever the highest res they said I think
their<00:02:16.450> quote<00:02:16.660> was<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> highest<00:02:17.290> resolution

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
their quote was the highest resolution

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.350 
their quote was the highest resolution
tablet<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.440> planet<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:20.830> yeah<00:02:21.640> it's<00:02:22.120> kind

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
tablet on the planet so yeah it's kind

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.090 
tablet on the planet so yeah it's kind
of<00:02:22.420> cool<00:02:22.600> right<00:02:22.840> I'm<00:02:23.380> probably<00:02:23.650> going<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.980> pick

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
of cool right I'm probably going to pick

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.650 
of cool right I'm probably going to pick
up<00:02:24.190> one<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.400> these<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:24.820> stay<00:02:25.180> tuned<00:02:25.420> for<00:02:25.630> that

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
up one of these so stay tuned for that

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.260 
up one of these so stay tuned for that
review<00:02:25.900> because<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.500> can't<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.520> resolution

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
review because I can't that resolution

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.340 
review because I can't that resolution
is<00:02:28.690> just<00:02:28.840> amazing<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.850> processors<00:02:31.200> we've<00:02:32.200> got

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
is just amazing the processors we've got

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.460 
is just amazing the processors we've got

absolute<00:02:41.950> beast<00:02:42.690> I've<00:02:43.690> got<00:02:43.900> another<00:02:44.140> page<00:02:44.440> up

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
absolute beast I've got another page up

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.860 
absolute beast I've got another page up
here<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.190> shows<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.960> Exynos<00:02:47.710> 5<00:02:47.980> 5<00:02:48.850> 250<00:02:49.480> which

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
here that shows the Exynos 5 5 250 which

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.620 
here that shows the Exynos 5 5 250 which
is<00:02:50.050> this<00:02:50.260> chip<00:02:50.530> here<00:02:50.770> versus<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.670> a6<00:02:52.270> but<00:02:52.480> not

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
is this chip here versus the a6 but not

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.740 
is this chip here versus the a6 but not
the<00:02:52.750> a6x<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.160> slightly<00:02:54.640> better<00:02:55.030> been

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
the a6x so this is slightly better been

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.230 
the a6x so this is slightly better been
I<00:02:55.870> if<00:02:56.290> we<00:02:56.800> have<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> look<00:02:57.130> here<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.640> X<00:02:57.970> noise

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
I if we have a look here the X noise

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.570 
I if we have a look here the X noise
dual<00:02:58.660> core<00:02:58.930> which<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.830> is<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.160> same<00:03:00.340> that's

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
dual core which is it is the same that's

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.550 
dual core which is it is the same that's
in<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.760> Chromebook<00:03:01.210> that's<00:03:01.570> in<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:02.050> tablet

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
in the Chromebook that's in that tablet

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.550 
in the Chromebook that's in that tablet
so<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.640> can<00:03:03.790> see<00:03:04.060> here<00:03:04.360> lower<00:03:05.050> is<00:03:05.230> better<00:03:05.290> in

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
so you can see here lower is better in

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.800 
so you can see here lower is better in

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.520 
better 387 1 vs. 1 53 346 y versus 1672
I<00:03:22.150> mean<00:03:22.510> these<00:03:22.690> are<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:25.239> know<00:03:25.330> GPU<00:03:25.900> benchmarks

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
I mean these are you know GPU benchmarks

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.240 
I mean these are you know GPU benchmarks
but<00:03:27.780> look<00:03:28.780> at<00:03:28.959> that<00:03:29.140> is<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.290> big<00:03:29.620> difference<00:03:29.920> you

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
but look at that is a big difference you

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.880 
but look at that is a big difference you
know<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.670> X<00:03:31.060> knows<00:03:31.480> dual-core<00:03:32.080> a<00:03:32.320> 15

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
know this X knows dual-core a 15

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.430 
know this X knows dual-core a 15
architecture<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.760> an<00:03:34.000> absolute<00:03:34.750> beast<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.380> it

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
architecture is an absolute beast and it

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.530 
architecture is an absolute beast and it
beats<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.890> a6<00:03:36.520> I<00:03:36.730> don't<00:03:36.970> know<00:03:37.150> whether<00:03:37.360> it

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
beats the a6 I don't know whether it

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.290 
beats the a6 I don't know whether it
beats<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.840> a6x<00:03:38.410> we'll<00:03:38.800> have<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.040> find<00:03:39.250> out<00:03:39.430> but

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
beats the a6x we'll have to find out but

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.150 
beats the a6x we'll have to find out but
it's<00:03:40.450> going<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.720> be<00:03:40.930> pretty<00:03:41.380> much<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:41.920> the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
it's going to be pretty much on the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.850 
it's going to be pretty much on the
money<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.640> comparable<00:03:43.390> with<00:03:43.570> it<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.110> they

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
money and comparable with it so they

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.590 
money and comparable with it so they
have<00:03:45.070> put<00:03:45.310> an<00:03:45.430> absolute<00:03:45.940> beast<00:03:46.239> of<00:03:46.540> a

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
have put an absolute beast of a

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.910 
have put an absolute beast of a
processor<00:03:47.290> in<00:03:47.550> this<00:03:48.550> tablet<00:03:49.560> next<00:03:50.560> up<00:03:50.739> we<00:03:50.890> got

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
processor in this tablet next up we got

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.460 
processor in this tablet next up we got

see<00:05:22.389> here<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:23.169> nexus<00:05:23.650> 10<00:05:23.860> is<00:05:24.930> larger<00:05:25.930> because

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
see here the nexus 10 is larger because

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.050 
see here the nexus 10 is larger because
it's<00:05:26.440> 10<00:05:26.680> inch<00:05:26.830> display<00:05:27.310> versus<00:05:27.729> the<00:05:27.849> nine

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
it's 10 inch display versus the nine

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.750 
it's 10 inch display versus the nine
point<00:05:28.300> seven<00:05:28.539> inches<00:05:28.870> you<00:05:29.050> can<00:05:29.110> see<00:05:29.380> here

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
point seven inches you can see here

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.589 
point seven inches you can see here
saying<00:05:30.760> that<00:05:31.120> it's<00:05:31.620> thinner<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:34.270> can<00:05:34.419> see

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
saying that it's thinner you can see

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:40.700 
saying that it's thinner you can see
here<00:05:34.870> 6.99<00:05:35.590> versus<00:05:36.099> 7.31<00:05:36.940> and<00:05:39.000> 0.35<00:05:40.000> versus

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
here 6.99 versus 7.31 and 0.35 versus

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.950 
here 6.99 versus 7.31 and 0.35 versus
0.37<00:05:41.710> so<00:05:42.159> it<00:05:42.280> is<00:05:42.400> thinner<00:05:42.849> than<00:05:42.970> the<00:05:43.300> ipad<00:05:43.659> 4

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
0.37 so it is thinner than the ipad 4

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.860 
0.37 so it is thinner than the ipad 4
which<00:05:44.169> is<00:05:44.289> really<00:05:44.590> interesting<00:05:45.570> also<00:05:46.570> it

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
which is really interesting also it

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.409 
which is really interesting also it
weighs<00:05:47.440> less<00:05:47.770> and<00:05:48.099> the<00:05:48.490> ipad<00:05:48.789> for<00:05:48.970> you<00:05:49.330> know
