well<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.149> their<00:01:12.300> lakes<00:01:12.539> but<00:01:13.229> again<00:01:13.530> most<00:01:13.770> baits

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
well on their lakes but again most baits

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.820 
well on their lakes but again most baits
will<00:01:14.430> catch<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.630> water<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.050> well<00:01:16.289> clouded<00:01:16.740> up

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
will catch the water is well clouded up

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.010 
will catch the water is well clouded up
so<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> lot<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.670> time<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.090> carp<00:01:18.300> act<00:01:18.539> on<00:01:18.720> sin

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
so a lot of the time the carp act on sin

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.169
