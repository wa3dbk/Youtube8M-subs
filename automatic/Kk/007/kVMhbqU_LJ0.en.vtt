00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.529 
power 25 ratings now the movie eruptions
I<00:00:16.830> think<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.070> started<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.400> WV<00:00:17.850> 12<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.330> can't

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
I think it started on WV 12 I can't

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.760 
I think it started on WV 12 I can't
really<00:00:18.630> remember<00:00:18.720> since<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.289> would<00:00:19.439> play<00:00:19.590> that

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
really remember since I would play that

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.980 
really remember since I would play that
gave<00:00:19.890> them<00:00:20.100> much<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:21.180> at<00:00:21.480> first<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.810> thought<00:00:21.930> it

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
gave them much but at first I thought it

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.960 
gave them much but at first I thought it
was<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.170> good<00:00:22.410> idea<00:00:22.550> but<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.789> has<00:00:23.939> its

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
was a good idea but it has its

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.390 
was a good idea but it has its
advantages<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:25.050> disadvantages<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.189> thing

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
advantages and disadvantages the thing

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.609 
advantages and disadvantages the thing
that<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.640> don't<00:00:26.699> like<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.960> that's<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.380> shit<00:00:28.560> i

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
that I don't like and that's that shit i

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.310 
that I don't like and that's that shit i
don't<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:29.039> people<00:00:29.609> oh<00:00:29.810> it's<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> fact<00:00:31.170> that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
don't like people oh it's the fact that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
don't like people oh it's the fact that
when<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.160> run<00:00:32.430> into<00:00:32.730> some<00:00:33.000> wood<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.480> actually

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
when you run into some wood it actually

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.479 
when you run into some wood it actually
stops<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.380> loop<00:00:34.559> which<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.920> stupid<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.340> could

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
stops the loop which is stupid you could

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.000 
stops the loop which is stupid you could
want<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.730> buy<00:00:35.880> old<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.180> it'll<00:00:36.420> stop<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.660> blue

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
want to buy old it it'll stop the blue

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.760 
want to buy old it it'll stop the blue
so<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.399> they<00:00:39.030> work<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.750> where<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.410> wasn't

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
so if they work out it where it wasn't

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.619 
so if they work out it where it wasn't
as<00:00:40.890> sensitive<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.329> will<00:00:42.450> probably

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
as sensitive as it is it will probably

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.450 
as sensitive as it is it will probably
be<00:00:42.750> better<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.530> hate<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> fact<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
be better but I hate the fact that you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.850 
be better but I hate the fact that you
can<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.760> fucking<00:00:45.090> walk<00:00:45.930> right<00:00:46.200> box<00:00:46.469> employed

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
can just fucking walk right box employed

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.220 
can just fucking walk right box employed

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
it did or either up the boob it should

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.750 
it did or either up the boob it should
be<00:00:49.260> able<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.620> should<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.520> some

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
be able you should have to do like some

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.340 
be able you should have to do like some
kind<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.030> grapple<00:00:51.300> or<00:00:51.600> something<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.020> order<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
kind of grapple or something in order to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.670 
kind of grapple or something in order to
stop<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> loop<00:00:53.059> then<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:55.170> next<00:00:55.320> thing<00:00:55.469> I'm

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
stop the loop then the next thing I'm

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.099 
stop the loop then the next thing I'm
going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.890> talk<00:00:56.070> about<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.420> power<00:00:57.629> 25

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
going to talk about is the power 25

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.810 
going to talk about is the power 25
races<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.770> think<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.070> last<00:00:59.219> game<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.760> was

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
races so I think the last game that was

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.240 
races so I think the last game that was
almost<00:01:00.000> over<00:01:00.300> two<00:01:00.449> thousand<00:01:00.840> eight<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.800> had

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
almost over two thousand eight it had

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.160 
almost over two thousand eight it had
like<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> power<00:01:02.730> 25<00:01:03.270> basically<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
like a power 25 basically you know the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.539 
like a power 25 basically you know the
top<00:01:04.379> people<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:06.600> book<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:08.100> think<00:01:08.340> that

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
top people of that book and I think that

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.830 
top people of that book and I think that
was<00:01:08.640> pretty<00:01:08.820> cool<00:01:09.030> might<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.420> been<00:01:09.479> weekly

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
was pretty cool might have been weekly

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.719 
was pretty cool might have been weekly
I'm<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.080> sure<00:01:10.290> yeah<00:01:10.799> i<00:01:10.830> think<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.280> weekly

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
I'm not sure yeah i think it was weekly

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.030 
I'm not sure yeah i think it was weekly
but<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.229> pretty<00:01:13.409> cool<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.830> think

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
but it was pretty cool what I think

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.020 
but it was pretty cool what I think
maybe<00:01:14.159> they<00:01:14.310> should<00:01:14.460> bring<00:01:14.549> them<00:01:14.760> back<00:01:14.880> for

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
maybe they should bring them back for

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
maybe they should bring them back for
one<00:01:15.210> line<00:01:15.420> they'll<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.770> top

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
one line they'll have like the top

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.340 
one line they'll have like the top
players<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.990> week<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.100> power<00:01:20.310> 25<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
players of that week at the power 25 and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.230 
players of that week at the power 25 and
they<00:01:22.350> should<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.650> able<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.400> don't<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.090> how

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
they should be able to I don't know how

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.880 
they should be able to I don't know how
they<00:01:24.270> would<00:01:24.509> judge<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.960> should<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.439> based<00:01:25.650> off

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
they would judge it should be based off

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.100 
they would judge it should be based off
wins<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.369> know<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.729> much<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.540> should<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.810> based

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
wins I know that much it should be based

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.140 
wins I know that much it should be based
off<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.770> know<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.189> don't<00:01:29.310> know<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> don't<00:01:30.030> know

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
off you know I don't know I don't know

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.340 
off you know I don't know I don't know
how<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.420> would<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
how they would do it but I just think it

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.660 
how they would do it but I just think it
would<00:01:31.409> be<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> good<00:01:31.680> idea<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:32.009> them<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.610> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
would be a good idea for them to do it I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.390 
would be a good idea for them to do it I
haven't<00:01:32.820> really<00:01:33.000> thought<00:01:33.210> about<00:01:33.270> how<00:01:34.159> be<00:01:35.159> done

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
haven't really thought about how be done
