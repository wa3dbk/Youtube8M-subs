00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 hello and welcome back 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.519
 star wars force attack I'll do it again 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.410
 a unboxing as a cabinet Mendes 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.609
 This trading card is such a pack 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.380
 and I'm curious what's in this time 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.920
 I have already had two special cards 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.840
 received my first two unboxing and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:36.210
 the kennel see what's in here 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:37.770
 would want to say paper gone and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.989
 then we start with the first card 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:51.420
 the alliance rebel leader then pays 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.890
 because princess leia how cool I have 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.870
 here and I have only luck here 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.649
 I think that's one of those cards 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.359
 star card 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.250
 this is a strong one because so strong 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.040
 cards are always with star cards 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:11.360
 I would say excellent 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.360
 defense 76 attack 80 cards number 199 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.799
 very beautiful princess leia extremely pretty 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.869
 I think 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.280
 I did not find her so cute in the past 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.009
 the movies where I was younger but 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.619
 Meantime say yourself 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:30.720
 Princess Leia was a top cast 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 and now makes a lot of fun looks 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.500
 now synonymous, the camera and there sees 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.600
 I'm so kind of mirrored that way 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 a little bit that's the canon legria 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.009
 hfm 406 and that's on the edge too 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.880
 mention very nice camera we do 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.130
 continue 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.130
 the alliance commando 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:58.799
 riebel command her picture of the profession like that 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.770
 from the optical point of view, that also has to be one 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.829
 be from the older star wars fan 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:10.580

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 I can not say here again 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.790
 the pure change 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.200
 I would say that it wants that with 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.150
 this little weird one is alive 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.959

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.650
 name that one of which is from the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.230
 Clothes good that was the second 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.410
 map we continue and we have 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.410
 the republic a clone warrior 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:51.930
 Clone Warrior Klo Lieutenant The Clone Warrior 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:56.120
 Defense 67 then attack 68 completely 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.840
 important card number 107 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.840
 this is how he looks like 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:10.580
 yes very nice as I think so lieutenant 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.560
 That was my third card in this 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:18.349
 pack we continue with the fourth 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:25.850
 Guilty vehicle rips the category 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:30.680
 and this time I have saline grid 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.750
 Anyway, such a sand vehicle that 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.680
 is also from the series of older star 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:44.569
 wars movies defense 43 attack 41 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:51.230
 card number 85 so as I said that is 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:52.100
 a card from and ship from episode 5 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.510
 or 6 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.160
 if I was not sure that was good 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.590
 I already notice a fourth card 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.269
 I am there what I am filming and the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.310
 occupation I'm one hundred percent sure 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.900
 It's a bit like me too 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.940
 last thing printed from it 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.390
 Next , a crater already has 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.820
 seen 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:20.440
 the republic libyer and i have too 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:20.440
 already seen it is as if you 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:30.100
 Jedi Knight Defense 90 Attack 91 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:34.360
 card number 89 and yes masters diapers 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.790
 was one of the hottest for me 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.310
 characters at star wars i found it 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.250
 a great pity for an episode 3 died 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:47.230
 is and also in episode 4 5 or 6 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.760
 unfortunately no longer appeared in the 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.250
 you really have to see the principle of dying 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.430
 so if you disney now 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.110
 makes new movies you always master 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.300

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.130
 also always sees if the now after 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:07.030
