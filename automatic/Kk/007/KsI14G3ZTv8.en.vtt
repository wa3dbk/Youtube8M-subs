00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
than it is today well you know I see I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.510 
than it is today well you know I see I
see<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.079> lot<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.260> countries<00:00:58.770> where<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.190> lot<00:00:59.489> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
see in a lot of countries where a lot of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.900 
see in a lot of countries where a lot of
slightly<00:00:59.940> older<00:01:00.859> women<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.160> men<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:02.879> are

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
slightly older women and men they are

I<00:01:04.140> think<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.760> life<00:01:06.000> over<00:01:06.360> there

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
I think it's a it's the life over there

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.700 
I think it's a it's the life over there
because<00:01:06.689> they<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> do<00:01:07.260> things<00:01:07.530> for

because they have to do things for

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.679 
because they have to do things for
themselves<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.460> over<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> lot<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
themselves and over here we get a lot of

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.630 
themselves and over here we get a lot of
help<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.560> things<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.040> think<00:01:11.100> fitness
