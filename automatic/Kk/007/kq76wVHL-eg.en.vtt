00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.730

 win war z and i won't say it 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.710
 long name of this game since it 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.340
 too long 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:41.670
 a little tangled and even more so in the discharge 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:45.020
 everyone is familiar to everyone not so much 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 infestation effect of the story however 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.039
 move on to the guide itself in order to 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.910
 you need to play this war z you need 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.030
 go to the official website 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.899
 developers or rather founders 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.809
 this very server 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.250
 I will throw off the link in the description preferably 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.520
 go to this server 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.220
 Well, more precisely the site and download all sorts here 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.700
 gadgets that are needed with 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.850
 google browser ie without mega 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.659
 just were not working however when you 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:27.780
 We already went to this site via google 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.460
 we see such small information which 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.490
 says exactly what we need to do 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.190
 Well, I will explain shorter than here 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.250
 is written 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.230
 let's say he needs to download launcher 30 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.330
 megabyte 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:47.600
 download the full client of course through 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:49.880
 torrent by the way torrent through dr what else 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.530
 then it will be necessary to download hack shield it 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.240
 such a good program which 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.030
 protects against cheaters 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.390
 that is, it is the only server on 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.930
 which is very few cheaters it them immediately 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:09.320
 bans even honey it will be better 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.920
 original and original server after 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.320
 as you downloaded the launcher downloaded 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.150
 full client and downloaded this one 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:27.320
 shell, that is, we are doing anti-cheat program 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:29.900
 next we continue to create 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.810
 a separate daddy called well 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.800
 some such as the Barsiku dick gauze lala 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.880
 at least as you can ova-2 2 g but I called 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.150
 the war z then we throw 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.810
 folder 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.150

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.010

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.010

 eat eat eat eat eat 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.660
 well, and we are and we turn to 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.540
 guide 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:36.460
 here we downloaded the hack shield stuff here 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:39.340
 doesn’t tell us what you don’t have here 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.220
 the torrent itself but I have a remake here 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.180
 the update is the launcher 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.870
 he is this 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:52.270
 launcher is called the palace folder something 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:56.650
 remake had it low okay don't laugh 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:59.320
 names and go to this archive and 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.570
 we see so many files 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.330
 transfer it to that folder 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.430
 which we want is the folder that I 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.720
 called war z 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.580
 throw it all because I 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:15.340
 already thrown over they need to be thrown 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:17.860
 throws everything after that 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.350
 how did you download the full client 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:28.050
 so full client yes complete client 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:31.960
 also throws here together with 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:36.100
 replacing the file here but better replacing yes 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:40.230
 nothing needs to be wise after we go 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:43.690
 file shorter system leaks out 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.320
 we go we see such such hack butterfly 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.350
 shield here we see it too 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.990
 relocatable with replacement ie watch out 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.350
 for the sequence to be 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.500
 right the same as mine to not on 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.480

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.510
