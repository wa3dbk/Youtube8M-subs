00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
will how's that different than anyone

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.309 
will how's that different than anyone
elses<00:02:36.970> I

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.259 

you<00:02:42.319> asked<00:02:42.620> about<00:02:42.680> all<00:02:43.340> my<00:02:43.549> work<00:02:43.730> is<00:02:43.879> different

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
you asked about all my work is different

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.729 
you asked about all my work is different
because<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.659> grew<00:02:44.810> up<00:02:44.870> here<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.140> mean<00:02:45.379> maybe<00:02:45.560> it

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
because I grew up here I mean maybe it

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.130 
because I grew up here I mean maybe it
is<00:02:45.950> because<00:02:46.250> i'm<00:02:46.819> working<00:02:47.360> with<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.720> elements

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
is because i'm working with the elements

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.509 
is because i'm working with the elements
rather<00:02:48.319> than<00:02:48.650> against<00:02:49.129> them<00:02:50.920> if<00:02:51.920> it's<00:02:52.129> pouring

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
rather than against them if it's pouring
