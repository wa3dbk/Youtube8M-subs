 also the screen of my cell phone so that 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.350
 you can see in real time and how it is 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.360
 that works around the synchronization 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.670
 application with your mobile phone 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.570

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.400
 app 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.110

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 also by cell phones 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.570
 he is not off but he is 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.100
 not in use it works 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.159
 this way then I will click the option 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.630
 find the app that asks me to 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.790
 to log in again I login and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.340
 can see that he has already organized and already gave 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.060
 location of my cell phone that the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.460
 Our home is not with the oge ps on 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.259
 even so and for the six new and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.439
 can give a more or 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.899
 The less you need my location and he 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.869
 found the same look as my street 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.180
 I have the google street option 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.360
 located here the honey corn of residence 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.630
 very cool for locating the cell in 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.149
 In case of loss theft can see that the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.130
 people also have an option to play 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.010
 do not want to locate my phone 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.290
 Edno was stolen but a 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.490
 thing I can play or remotely I 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.590
 I'll give you an example here 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.800
 sometimes it is good to see that it is immediately 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:31.440
 when I click the play will have my 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:34.000
 phone and then I'll try to find him 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.950
 then for the update you can see that it is 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.980
 very cool we have a option that 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.050
 intruder but as you can see the version 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.150
 pay but I'll show you something else 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.100
 how does this option work here too 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.980
 for the free option you have as you 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.630
 is taking a screenshot and the person 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.900
 Who is using your cell phone? 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.960
 can see that we have the option here of 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.240
 protection if you want to block 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.180
 your cell phone with a little bit then 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.860
 is another mode of security and even 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.110
 Do you want to format your cell phone? 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.390
 remotely or was stolen you do not 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.510
 're expecting to recover their 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.900
 cell phone formats it preserves its data 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.120
 highly anticipated by students of xylose 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.880
 Well, it 's better then you, Marotta. 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.760
 format your phone remotely 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.320
 I suggest not testing this task option is 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.370
 more a matter of extreme 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.830
 need 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.880
 and we also have the camera option 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.830
 look how nice it is 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.240
 I can access the camera did not like it 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.110
 remotely 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:39.210
 he is bringing the first camera 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.210
 then back of the cell phone as a talin 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.930
 It worked all black but came back 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.790
 toggle here 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.740
 to locate the front camera is what 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.110
 We want to get the citizen's face. 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.709

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.780
 that even turned off and will get the face 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.709
 there that you have used your 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.570
 cell phone 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.280
 I could only get one 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.840
 screenshot O Malandrinha that there're 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.150

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.170
 everything remotely op with the mobile 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.810

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.359
 remotely taking picture from your cell phone 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.880
 This is very cool too and it was these 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.479
 safety options in relation to the 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.320
 location of your cell phone you have 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.960
 other options

 very cool for remote management in 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.990
 your mobile phone 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.220

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.390
