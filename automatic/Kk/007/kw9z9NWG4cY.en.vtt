00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.190
 so guys then here we are with a 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.280
 gameplay dedicated to drive clubs 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.620
 today we will do a night race or 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080
 better part of day but it becomes night 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.089
 so we will see the mutation of time 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.820
 of the climate and all that concerns 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.220
 the meteorological factor and that is one 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.109
 component that I've always loved 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.980
 I remember precisely the horizon in the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.590
 first laughed on 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.539
 there was this thing and I went crazy when 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.859
 it became night anyway beyond 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.109
 these nonsense 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.730
 today we will run a single player race 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.250
 then offline 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.050
 precisely because unfortunately of servers 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.090
 currently they are overloaded 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.710
 currently it is obviously referred to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.149
 when I'm doing the video then not 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.430
 I know if it will be online 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.930
 then this thing will improve it I hope 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.000
 sincerely for the sake of the game 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.210
 because precisely based on multiplayer 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.489
 therefore having cut off the part as far as 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.699
 it's about the clubs so the challenge in 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.890
 multiplayer etc. etc. damage 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.899
 resounding at this game unfortunately e 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.539
 look at this in short, the sight of this 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.400
 fantastic map I must be honest i 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.619
 circuits have me a little disappointed here was 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.990
 a very ironic fantastic if we want 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.659
 to say it all we are on playstation 4 we are 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.390
 on the game designed for the next gen 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.490
 we are not on a game as an horizon force 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.000
 that even if it was given to two 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.770
 different studies is still a part 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.990
 dedicated to the old gen 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.060
 we are on drive club which is a game that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.049
 had to go out for the new console e 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.100
 he had to somehow go to 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.400
 sponsor it is 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.200
 graphically this does not seem to me 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.479
 however, the games by 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.280
 light as precisely we see in this 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.140
 audio map 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.810
 to this map practically the games of 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.820
 light are they are very well made and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.700
 the times are very annoying 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.070
 in fact on some occasions we would have the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.740
 sun in the face literally and is a 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.630
 effect that really had to be there 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.200
 in driving games had not yet been 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.869
 conceived in such an overbearing way though 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.030
 if you drive if you think about it 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.229
 the sun comes into your face so you need to 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.729
 put on your sunglasses for 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.430
 play drive club but in the meantime 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.140
 today we are here with an audi a1 that 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.519
 a car that I have to be honest not 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.620
 I'm so sorry 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.989
 obviously from the aesthetic point of view e 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.750
 then of the driveability 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.400
 it seems to me that the vehicles in three clubs 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.010
 are a bit all the same I got it 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.069
 to try some about a dozen 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.830
 dozen and they all look similar to me here 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.470
 apart from maybe some small differences 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.610
 maybe and not car control though 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.459
 we are obviously facing the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.880
 simulator so we can't say that 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.470
 there are big differences in that 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.140
 ridability in response 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.110
 car is short for now is an arcade 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.180
 eco drive club and an arcade masked by 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.209
 semi simulative a bit like all the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.489
 car games to date and I remember 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.200
 they came out on playstation 3 e 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.930
 playstation 4 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.350
 apart from rare cases like motor sports force 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.079
 on xbox 360 and xbox one and gran turismo 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.299
 who are the last two pioneers of the 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.120
 simulative on races then there will be this 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.940
 project katz which will be released in the month of 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.450
 November and that 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.670
 could be the new toma simulator 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.110
 the new pioneer of this kind who 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.810
 he was a little lost over the years and that was going 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.640
 very strong up to a decade ago 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.410
 however I must be sincere this similar 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.880
 arcade i don't mind that much 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.700
 here is with regards to the 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.850
 driving ability of the suleman means is not 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.950
 hard drives intelligence 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.340
 artificial of the opponents is something 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.690
 quite limited they are difficult but 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.820
 because they have more powerful cars 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.410
 of yours for the simple fact that 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.570
 indeed they go faster then us 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.490
 on the straight they take most of the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.170
 times unless we have more means 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.590
 powerful but otherwise it seems to me 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.670
 quite simply obviously 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.200
 I'm waiting to try the final version 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.020
 of the title that will be the one with 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.239
 online multiplayer hoping that 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.280
 this problem of servers that you don't 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.050
 connect as soon as possible and 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.480
 obviously I finished the race 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.129
 thank you for following me and nothing 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.840
 leave below in the comments the 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.000
 your impressions about the club 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.070
 as it seemed in this video if it 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.290
 you will buy if you have purchased it or if 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.940
 you won't buy it and nothing will leave a 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.130
 I like and share the video and 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.850
 subscribe to the channel we'll see you there 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.240
 next time 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.240
 Hello
