00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
three months there was no way we could

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.109 
three months there was no way we could
do<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.250> i<00:01:23.340> had<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.610> figure<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> new

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
do that and i had to figure out a new

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.149 
do that and i had to figure out a new
way<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.659> i<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:25.170> at<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> supermarket<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
way to do it i was at a supermarket and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.100 
way to do it i was at a supermarket and
I<00:01:26.369> turned<00:01:26.670> around<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.509> saw<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.049> his

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
I turned around and I saw one of his

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.260 
I turned around and I saw one of his
current<00:01:28.350> mirrors<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.970> thought<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.180> myself

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
current mirrors and I thought to myself

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.630 
current mirrors and I thought to myself
if<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.930> found<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.439> I'd<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.460> able<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
if I found at that I'd be able to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
if I found at that I'd be able to
capture<00:01:32.820> everything<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.930> built<00:01:34.140> four

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
capture everything and so we built four

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.170 
capture everything and so we built four
hundred<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.860> those<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.369> left<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.939> form

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
hundred of those and then I left to form

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.480 
hundred of those and then I left to form
a<00:01:36.509> company<00:01:36.990> called<00:01:37.380> Koji<00:01:37.740> toe<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.130> just

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a company called Koji toe that just

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.969 
a company called Koji toe that just
