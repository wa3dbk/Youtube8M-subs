00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.479
 dogs are here where you train your pains. work out 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.099
 you won torino 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.209
 a little ago complimentissimi yet we saw that during training there was 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.900
 still a few details to file there is always something is wrong with you both 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.529
 there is still so much 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.939
 arrange to learn 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.949
 this system 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.759
 eum 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.149
 so we are 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:33.229
 fail the media training for the shanghai world championships 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.790
 fair. do the mine do not touch 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.310
 we feel like a boy who would like for those who want to approach this sport a 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.310
 swimming in general has any sport what advice would you give 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.130
 but fired in general precisely adele 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.020
 must try to understand which 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.380
 but it is perhaps sparta 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.160
 is more suitable for him is 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.260
 open monuments% for game to especially enjoy the files 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.380
 start to asti nice after time arenzano you have goals e 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.160
 insecticide make you do everything 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.990
 if you are an example for many young people 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.220
 because in any case born in person sports personalities like you 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.900
 obviously seen by others as an example to follow 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.650
 but in your opinion those who do sports in general support certain rallies matured in a manner 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.760
 different and perhaps better way to bank 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.760
 it surely immerses itself in a different way because 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.050
 it is as if we lived in a 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.100
 small world apart from boats if so many aspects but the fact remains in the championship 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.290
 that in any case starts me viajar at 14 15 years alone then clear announcements and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.940
 there are those who go to experience abroad and therefore always have it alone 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.750
 let's say about the spectra you're more mature 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.330
 n'altra me extends a little out of the real world if to do to the world to al 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:01:59.280
 work 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.810
 and therefore 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.380
 once finished ail still to learn 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.080
 and see how real life 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.259
 photo luck just sure dad that i train you 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.589
 youtube from this point of view there are positive aspects in the sense that there is the 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.879
 your dad who still pulls you a little under the protective wing you say o .midi 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.289
 I see a bit of your world in quotation marks on the other, maybe it can 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:26.099
 there is a conflict between father and son as you live weight relationship 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.289
 nice conflict from father daughter 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:32.529
 remove the galleon entact this thing that 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.759
 mini vital then precisely the positive thing is that with 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.309
 has one shoots so many 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.929
 in which much trust is needed 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.699
 and therefore 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:45.389
 open letter to avella 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.869

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.869

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.290
 the first thing he told you with us on the trampoline in the first tour first tu 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.739

 and then I went with my dad who trained those a little big 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:16.769
 the advice that you
