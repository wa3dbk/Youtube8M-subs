00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
is the microphone you can see popping up

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.380 
is the microphone you can see popping up
out<00:00:44.250> out<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> unit

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
out out of the unit

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.650 
out out of the unit
now<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.899> webcam<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:47.039> an<00:00:47.219> HD<00:00:47.789> webcam<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.539> can

now the webcam is an HD webcam so it can

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.880 
now the webcam is an HD webcam so it can
capture<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.190> 1600<00:00:50.190> by<00:00:50.309> 1200<00:00:51.020> video<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:52.620> 30

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
frames per second and it's actually

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.319 
frames per second and it's actually
built-in<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> side<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.820> microphone

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it in out of the way now this little

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.359 
it in out of the way now this little
holder<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.270> actually<00:01:04.229> stores<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.979> USB

Windows XP Vista and 7 and also on the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.140 
Windows XP Vista and 7 and also on the
Mac<00:01:21.409> now<00:01:22.409> let's<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.799> take<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.280> USB<00:01:23.759> cable

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
Mac now let's just take that USB cable

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.179 
Mac now let's just take that USB cable
out<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.630> get<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.080> way<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.950> if

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
out to get it out of the way now if

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.600 
out to get it out of the way now if
you're<00:01:26.400> using<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> desk<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.960> simply<00:01:28.610> put

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
you're using it on a desk you simply put

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.969 
you're using it on a desk you simply put
it<00:01:29.729> onto<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.090> stand<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.990> angle<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
it onto this stand you can angle the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.350 
it onto this stand you can angle the
microphone<00:01:33.590> like<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.250> also<00:01:35.369> rotates<00:01:35.820> in

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
microphone like so it also rotates in

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.740 
microphone like so it also rotates in
different<00:01:36.630> directions<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.670> with<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.939> webcam

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
different directions and with the webcam

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.359 
different directions and with the webcam
out<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.259> very<00:01:40.320> useful<00:01:40.979> because<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
out this is very useful because it

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.370 
out this is very useful because it
enables<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:41.970> angle<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.600> correctly<00:01:43.200> so

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
enables you to angle it correctly so

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.469 
enables you to angle it correctly so
you're<00:01:43.530> getting<00:01:43.829> yourself<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you're getting yourself in the in the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.929 
you're getting yourself in the in the
frame<00:01:45.720> properly<00:01:46.110> now<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.369> don't<00:01:47.610> want<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
frame properly now if you don't want to

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.960 
frame properly now if you don't want to
use<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> desk<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.460> remove<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
use this on the desk you can remove it

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.149 
use this on the desk you can remove it
from<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.299> stand<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.899> they<00:01:52.439> supply<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> with

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
from this stand and they supply you with

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.550 
from this stand and they supply you with
this<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.970> looks<00:01:54.210> rather<00:01:54.420> rudimentary<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
this it looks rather rudimentary it's a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.380 
this it looks rather rudimentary it's a
basically<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.070> thick<00:01:56.430> piece<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.880> rubber<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
basically a thick piece of rubber and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.350 
basically a thick piece of rubber and
you<00:01:58.320> slot<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> side<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you slot this on to the side of the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.190 
you slot this on to the side of the
webcam<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:03.840> basically

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
webcam like so and you just basically

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.029 
webcam like so and you just basically
adjust<00:02:05.450> until<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.079> distance

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
adjust until you get the distance

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.660 
adjust until you get the distance
between<00:02:08.220> here<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:10.440> your<00:02:10.560> liking

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
between here and here to your liking

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.080 
between here and here to your liking
and<00:02:11.760> then<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.780> actually<00:02:13.140> six<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.280> top<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.000> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and then this actually six on top of a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.470 
and then this actually six on top of a
monitor<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.620> also<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:17.940> you've<00:02:18.239> got<00:02:18.450> a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
monitor you can also if you've got a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.350

how the blue microphones eyeball tube

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.560 
how the blue microphones eyeball tube
performs<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:40.109> it<00:03:40.829> worth<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.190> 70<00:03:41.549> pounds<00:03:41.940> well

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
performs is it worth the 70 pounds well

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.720 
performs is it worth the 70 pounds well
I<00:03:42.810> did<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.680> some<00:03:43.950> problems<00:03:44.250> with<00:03:44.609> it

initially using it on my iMac the video

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.930 
initially using it on my iMac the video
is<00:03:48.239> very<00:03:48.390> stuttery<00:03:49.070> since<00:03:50.070> I've<00:03:50.310> got<00:03:50.609> my<00:03:50.760> new

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
is very stuttery since I've got my new

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.670 
is very stuttery since I've got my new

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
picture quality I suppose the condenser

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.430 
picture quality I suppose the condenser
