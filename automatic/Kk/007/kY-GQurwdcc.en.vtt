00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.039
 how about friends then again here 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.529
 one more day of fishing the prey the knife 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.439
 now let's use another decoy 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.320
 different personal friend is one of the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.680
 what I like the most is the ninja sticks that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.900
 It is also known as 5 of the brand 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.210
 livingston of course one of our 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.550
 main sponsors and good then 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.329
 this one 5 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.280
 that I am going to use today is a 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.620
 solid color 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.149
 the color is called martÃ­ crash so that 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.020
 can find out there in our 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.980
 online store 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.220
 using a seven- foot rod with 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.830
 chlorine carbon 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.960
 and a 93 octavo cost with an area that 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.600
 it's out there as you can see 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.270
 and you can appreciate the sound that 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 We're going to be working on sticks because 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.880
 south line or carbon then we go to the water 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.340
 It is very cloudy but we will try to 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.470
 lose it as much as possible if to see if 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.479
 this can help us get better 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.060
 result our catches well 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.670
 let's use the 5 which is also 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.369
 known as line color sticks 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.470
 mardigras using as I mentioned 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.360
 a tuxen or three eighths with ones 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.940
 Stop here so you do not run 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.550
 work it on the ruler tiles line flower 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.970
 or carbon 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.570
 of 20 pounds the area waves to call 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.510
 the attention of the bass using a 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.850
 offset hook 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.890
 of 4 zeros 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.890
 then we are going to string 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.330
 in the streets 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.040
 try to present the best you can 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.130
 can you remember that 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.190
 one of the factors is that the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.010
 presentation 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.510
 of our arrangement then we're going to 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.840
 start working with our sticks 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.170
 the water remains cloudy we always remember 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.290
 tighten our very very well 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.120
 track if what we are going to be doing 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.629
 is to be pricking 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.560
 let's start working by clicking 6 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.680
 feet 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.380
 on the edges of the pallets 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.340
 the water as mentioned turbid 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.070
 work it with very slow movements 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.690
 slow very slow here the advantage that 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.500
 we have with these clubs is that they are 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.060
 glued to the stream then the bassins 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.800
 It is an ideal place to 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.800
 stock up on food to be able to 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.069
 fishing is slow in these seasons 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.920
 by the heats 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.920
 then being slow because we have to 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.310
 work also slow 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.100
 be very aware we have to bring 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.240
 a very very good rod in this case what 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.990
 which is something highly recommended 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.870
 since the sensitivity they have is 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.310
 excellent and sometimes the picket in these 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.080
 seasons or when it is very slow 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.920
 fishing, it does not feel as much as 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.920
 other times of the year 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.049
 pay close attention because sometimes 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:45.790
 may be stinging inside the sticks 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:49.639
 not outside the clubs are these bars 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.040
 of this line of what so much the classical 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:56.060
 or the line of white eyes 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.849
 what they have is 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.580
 is one of the most important parts are 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:06.710
 the micro guides the micro guides 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.690
 help to have more accurate viruses 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.510
 hit the target now yes where we want 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.740
 put our our decoy and the other 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.360
 part is also they also have longer 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.480
 and it helps us a lot in sensitivity 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.480
 as well 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.579
 Noise 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.430
 and then falling 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.430
 we see an animal 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.599
 is 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.599
 good 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.790
 so good over here we see that 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.750
 our ninjas tics in color mardigras 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.750
 it did not work 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.990
 is allowed on the sticks 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.070
 is excellent for tournament 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.790
 we see that she is in chubby 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.740
 yes 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.500
 So that means that 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.330
 want the food 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.910
 well, let's free this 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.480
 pretty we got out there among the 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.630
 sticks 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.220
 to free him this 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:27.560
 but the most beautiful thing about the fresh table 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.560
 when we release our ruins 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.560
 see what awesome things are 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.200

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.960
