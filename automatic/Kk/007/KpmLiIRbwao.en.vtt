 incredible features next to 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.709

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.540
 so here 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.640
 I do not have to work out the horror 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.620
 imagination that work that because the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.900
 character in the last novel in portugal 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.959
 call the warrior I loved that name in 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.450
 Portuguese government is a brunette there and 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.530
 hadi the guys is very bad what was 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.280
 did it cancel rúbia glamor with hassan 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.470
 I took this one so I'll see my 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.220
 God's love to go talk to him 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.049
 seventh 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.299
 He talked about inviting those 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.459
 mishaps to make maria nubié a 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.640
 community character so she knows 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.920
 It has great strength and great achievement. 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.060
 It was then let's see, let's just go to the 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.110
 At the same time, I was thinking like 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.250
 explain the number of 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.170
 communities 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.670
 I've lived in community so I have to 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.549
 think of this character where people 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.110
 do not think it's easy for me 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.299
 because I live there that no character 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.340
 away from the character needs a 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.480
 construction but people think that 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.640
 when you make the character of the world 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.739
 you see here is more practical for 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.510
 otherwise it is much more difficult because 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.579
 have a greater search you have a 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.680
 you have one more thing 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.260
 curious that people at home do not know 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.530
 It is to hear these phrases is not to end up 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.600
 making it almost gave in and Danúbia huse 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.720
 However, it is phrases that she will seek 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.090
 here in the community played with the 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.340
 Kuwaiti my brother wore it straight 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.110
 keeps the coach's eye is not only with 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.390
 the costs the woman to fadu accept that hurts 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.739
 The less accepted it hurts is that you in the queue 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.750
 of French and Russian bread 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.550
 The evil of you looks great on the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:30.470
 11 I'm taking the team's face 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:33.259
 ai ai ai want to see if there comes to you 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.860
 she came back terrorist bora bora accepted 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:40.520
 which hurts fewer patients on hold and also 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.210
 because it will rain ff the brunette move 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.039
 front poet that the Portuguese public has 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.539
 a great affection for the actors who 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.069
 I really admire the work that is done here. 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.830
 in brazil soap operas pass with a lot of 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.990
 force you there and you become a person 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.720
 already it was other work does not pass 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.460
 to be a loved one is you already 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.080
 had in portugal and this was in 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.330
 portugal in july with june of the year 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.849
 past so I end up taking view 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.219
 to spend holidays in portugal and so I 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.569
 I fell in love with a very serious degree. 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:10.940
 a place I want to return all 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.159
 years is a place that I would spend times 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.889
 of my life there because it's very 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.030
 similar to Brazil is not the joy of 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.509
 people 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.969
 I think they embrace and respect each other so much. 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.770
 and I was talking I think I told 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.080
 everybody, all the stuff that I do 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.880
 portugal to me is a reference of what 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.590
 is the article is from brazil why there they 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.620
 They both admire him so much 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.979
 caring they love from funk to daniela 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.080
 mércury of the same degree without distinction they 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.110
 love the novels they value the 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.370
 novels is in a way as if it were a 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.529
 hollywood movie 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.810
 So I have to be very 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:53.300
 Thank you Brazilians to the Portuguese. 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.400
 For this kind of affection, there are things that have 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.409
 musicians I did not even know and that I 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.969
 I knew in portugal there are songs 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.129
 that I did not even remember that it existed and I 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.569
 I listen to Portugal very often. 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.550
 so you were very well received a lot 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:06.110
 People were already watching some 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.240
 things on the internet 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.400
 It was very much appreciated to feel 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.370
 lots of photos I arrived on the day of the party 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.949
 santo antônio was a magic day downloaded 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.710
 and I had fun every day so I danced 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.599
 is it was beautiful I made friends for life 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.979
 people who will stay for all mine 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.529
 life as soon as we communicate 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.870
 today so I am very grateful Portugal as well 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:29.690
 I think I think if we 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.270
 Brazilians, we value ourselves if we 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.740
 our art 1 at least 50% of what it is 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.039
 exposed as the Portuguese value 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.529
 I think we would be even happier. 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.029
 Look, I wanted to tell you that really. 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:42.549
 I think it was a great pleasure 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:45.069
 in this place blessed by God who is a 

00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:47.529
 Wonderful place, I love talking to you.
