00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.280
 very good guys you are surely 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.189
 tired of your data telling me 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.680
 at the end of the month, if you want to save 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.640
 more data you have that I want here in this 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.640
 video on android 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.340
 the application build today to be able 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.620
 save this data is called opera max 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.500
 we have it here in the google play 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.270
 free has 100 thousand downloads and one 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.330
 score of 4.3 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.610
 the application weighs exactly 5 with 52 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.980
 You know, it's not much, many of you 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.809
 asking how he gets exactly 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.280
 save megas this application 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.989
 this application saves from the following 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.970
 way all the information that 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.600
 we request you send it to a server 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.449
 External opera that information we 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.460
 it becomes compressed with which it operates 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.769
 keating a bit of information but 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.690
 you can barely notice for example if you take 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.790
 an image makes it smaller take a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.059
 video reduces quality and things a bit 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.500
 A) Yes 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.570
 in the images you hardly notice the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.610
 difference in the video a little bit more but 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.990
 that then we can regulate it later 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.340
 We for example on YouTube download us 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.740
 a bit of quality and you can not 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.030
 reduce the data because it has a 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.920
 own server that I'll explain 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.720
 now as we lower the quality we can 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.909
 raise us the quality in the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.130
 video options just in 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.900
 instagram for example it would not be noticed 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.290
 just the difference and we would be left 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.750
 much faster 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.270
 in what interface is this 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.700
 application has material interface 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.890
 design with a careful aesthetic 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.290
 how you are seeing is at a glance is 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.660
 pretty not in this menu that we have here 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.030
 up on the left we have different 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.370
 options we can choose between saving 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.650
 Wi-Fi saving data or both and now 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.850
 here I have only the savings 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.670
 data with mobile use 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.220
 I do not use wifi and we also have a 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.210
 eyelash for the applications 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.240
 blocked that we can block the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.460
 through data or wifi or both too 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.380
 so that we do not consume data if we 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.630
 we put in the tab of mobile use 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.490
 we can see what we have consumed with 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.990
 the data in the top part we 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.210
 we will find a little button to 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.520
 enable or disable data saving 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.310
 a little further down we find 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.959
 a little girl who says today that they are the 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.810
 data that our plunged in today and what 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.959
 we have saved and here we have what 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.239
 we have spent the entire month does not 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.880
 one month but in the month in which we are 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.800
 that is to say that day 1 resets now and 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.450
 will start again a little bit lower 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.849
 we find the megas used 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.069
 saved megas that in this case are 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.810
 kilobytes 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.129
 the time that we have been using the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.840
 data is to say the time that we have 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.879
 had the data connected and 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.040
 consuming through the data and here 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.540
 we have the leader in savings that is the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.030
 application that today has saved us more 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.370
 As you can see we have 3 kilobytes that are 2 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.859
 % of the data saved per battery and 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.359
 doctor who is not much one 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.469
 little bit below we have the 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.900
 applications ordered chronologically 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.269
 and how much have we spent on each one as 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.750
 you see the last one I put with data were 35 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.189
 minutes on whatsapp at 406 not all 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.959
 applications can save data 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.150
 some applications like facebook 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.250
 youtube and it seems to me that spotify does not 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.139
 can save data because it has 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.239
 private servers and you can not 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.189
 compress how it operates now by sending 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.419
 data to your private server can not 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.489
 remove it from the youtube servers 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.040
 to send it to itself if we press 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.750
 here in the list that we have here of 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.340
 information gives us information 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.930
 detailed of some of the questions 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.290
 Frequently people who go by 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.019
 about this application we also have 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.159
 the tab this month in which we 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.329
 we found everything we have 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.040
 spent this month is convenient 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:42.349
 previously like for example the snap 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.540
 Chat Spent 230 Megas at Spotify 121 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.400
 megas and we have saved good very little 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.579
 because as you can see it can not be compressed 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.170
 just with the private server but for 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.680
 example how are you looking down on 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.810
 instagram we have spent 85 megabytes and we have 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.670
 saved 126 we have saved more than 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.810
 that we really have spent the truth 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.609
 that is very good because it helps us 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.280
 get to the end of the month with the data 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.959
 just without spending here we have these two 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.000
 little dots that help us to sort by 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.439
 we can order it for use by saving 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.629
 by name that we will sort by 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.370
 Saving as you see instagram is where you 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.729
 more saved what is a game 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.289
 I create one world there is another game and all 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.539
 the applications with which we have gone 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.870
 saving we go again to the menu of 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.880
 up we are going to use wifi here 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.680
 we found the consumption by wifi this 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.750
 tab is exactly the same as the 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.580
 mobile use as it is or visually is 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.310
 same as here we put the data of the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.720
 wifi to be exactly the same as the 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.560
 mobile use would not be much that 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.770
 explain 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.590
 what we have been spending here is the same 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.960
 use the savings and iii in savings and 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.970
 not imply because as you see today, 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.889
 saved nothing because I've hardly used 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.230
 the mobile and then here in applications 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:57.889
 blocked that that's what really 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.480
 interesting here we can select the 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.900
 applications that we do not want to be 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.370
 connect via data or via wifi 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.110
 we just give a little touch to the 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.860
 application the full map in blocked 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:13.280
 to spotify then google play youtube 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.810
 because because many times without giving me 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.660
 mind I'm going to show you this 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.639
 well youtube in the end it consumes me 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.310
 data in account then this we have 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.440
 blocked does not let us spend data is 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.850
 say when we go in, get into the 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.750
 application tells us you have connection to 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.610
 Internet 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.650
 this application is very good because you 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.419
 ask before you get in if you want 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.030
 keep blocking this application or 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.960
 unlock the to use it with 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.000
 data 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.449
 then we also have a little eye for 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.919
 remember our selection and so not 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.110
 we have to always give what we want 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.000
 whether to continue blocking the slip in 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.160
 the screen as you see we have the 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.410
 blocked apps with wifi that does not 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.449
 I have none blocked and here again 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.970
 if we go to the menu and we're going to 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.470
 share we have the opportunity to 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.120
 share the data that we have spent 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.220
 with our social networks friends and 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.349
 is not an option that I see with 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.310
 very useful not because your friends do not 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.050
 I think you care what you have 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.639
 saved but good here's the 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.110
 option if you want to say I took it hey 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.970
 see that with this application you have saved 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.320
 so download the one that is very good and 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.630
 if you do not have to go to blow and send 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.120
 directly the link of the application 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:21.020
 that with sending from here and if we go 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.320
 menu again have here already 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.970
 configuration section that would be the 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.120
 important not to save better data 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.639
 we have different options we have the 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.650
 notification anchored above that the 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:38.000
 notification is this that we have here 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:41.150
 hence you see that red m and here we 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.190
 says what we have spent with data what 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.780
 what we have spent with 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.000
 wifi and what we have saved 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.530
 we also have different savings as 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.780
 you see savings in images I have it in 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.810
 high video savings also high 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.940
 because because it is that if we put it in 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.860
 we're going to have better quality but 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.020
 there will be much more data and with data 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.820
 The truth is that I do not see many videos 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.800
 the images that I see are those of 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.990
 instagram and does not download them either very much 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.870
 that you can say fuck what bad looks 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.660
 I do not have it up here 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.410
 we have a little introduction 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.790
 applications that save a lot that 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.800
 we have frequently asked questions 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.410
 and communicate a problem we also have 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.060
 the third-party version and licenses and 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.470
 this would be the application of opera max 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.330
 I hope that from now on you save 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.330
 lots of data and we'll see each other
