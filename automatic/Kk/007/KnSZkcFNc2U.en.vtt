00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:08.260
 hi dear friends today we are 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.210
 keep looking guns out 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.840
 great complement with second 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.580
 assault 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.640
 Today we will consider the most desirable 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.100
 rifle f2000 in my opinion this 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.970
 rifle has the most difficult task 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.160
 for unlock 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.380
 she is called fast train for 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.539
 you will need to complete this task 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.270
 do ten kills inside the subway 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.119
 get 2 patches for help and for error 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.649
 for owning assault rifles 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.289
 the difficulty is that it is 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.620
 need to do in one round and not in the subway 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.899
 it's impossible to kill but all the suffering 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.909
 which you will experience when performing 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.190
 This quest is worth 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:47.769
 f2000 is absolutely not the same as in 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.960
 battlefield 3 or same battlefield 2 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.789
 he became a special rifle which 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.749
 combines accurate fire and high 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.850
 rate of fire 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.039
 but let's first take a look at the whole 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.619
 f2000 development path 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.769
 battlefield 2 this rifle possessed on 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:05.260
 surprise low firing rate of 650 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.570
 minute shots have scatter and damage and in 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.230
 2000 was the perfect average 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.330
 He put between m16 and ak100 1 but the main 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.120
 The chip is of course an optical sight 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.240
 which was only available to this trunk 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.970
 in a new era f2000 moved with big 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.550
 changes in the first here is the company in 2000 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.280
 has become a better melee rifle 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.020
 had a rate of 850 shots 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.570
 a minute of it in those days could 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.730
 shoot only abakan mg3 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.400
 which opened upon reaching 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.160
 Last rank and I in 2000 boa liza 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 veteran status that is if you had 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.560
 other games of the battlefield series in 2000 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.909
 you got automatically when you first 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.880
 game start 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.470
 Of the minuses can be noted the absence of 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.230
 classic sight with new 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.050
 survived the generation of battlefield f2000 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.330
 return to pc in bad company 2 balance 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.790
 assault rifles changed a bit and 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.490
 Abakan became a gun for long distances 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.830
 f2000 automatically became king 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.319
 melee chips can be noted 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.280
 permanent damage at any distance he 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.040
 only 12.5 units were extremely small 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.799
 damage 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.810
 in battlefield 3 f2000 was popular was 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.180
 fathers with a high rate of fire 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.370
 he lost his main chip 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.829
 grenade launcher popularity he 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.019
 received due to the high rate of fire 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.909
 efficiency in melee as in 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.980
 difference from a e to he was low 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.109
 hip shooting range minuses 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.140
 could be attributed a long recharge and 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:38.150
 high vertical return also f2000 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.689
 was the first trunk that got 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.519
 Camouflage battlefield 4 f2000 very 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:46.129
 has changed a lot now we have completely 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.409
 other recoil and recharge as well as us 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.480
 returned classic rifle scope 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.419
 characteristics have been changed in many ways 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.569
 best side damage maximum 25 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:58.970
 minimum 18 pace shooting 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:02.599
 850 minute shots by charging full 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.139
 passes in 3.9 seconds tactical in 2 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.959
 As many as 70 of the first that can be noted 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.700
 this recoil she became more appeasable 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.530
 convenient to control if earlier 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.419
 vertical recoil was serious 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.030
 enemy for firing on medium 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:19.879
 distances now it is not a problem pull 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.799
 argue there is a little care right 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.919
 but it's easy to get rid of it with 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.349
 using a compensator capacitor f2000 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.239
 work wonders at medium distances 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.790
 minus returns can only be released 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.459
 initial returns like she fell very 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.229
 High for medium distances I recommend 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.720
 put the corner handle which 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:41.690
 reduce it by 33 percent second 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.909
 the positive quality of f2000 is it 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.909
 sight opening you have two 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:50.120
 option sight 1 this front sight 2 sight with 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:52.010
 magnification 16 optical sight despite 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.209
 that closes the review gives a very 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.340
 clear picture 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.010
 especially at medium distance grid 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.769
 sight with something similar to the cobra sight 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.530
 horizontal stripes actively helps 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.599
 watch out for trunk drift thanks to this 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.599
 the barrel itself is easier to control 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.400
 also in 2000 is was dads so 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.379
 he has less scatter when shooting from 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.359
 hips this chip is quite good 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.299
 works at close distances though 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.729
 f2000 took over the main disease was hitting 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.359
 this long recharge has become much 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.969
 longer 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.900
 chef even when compared with the option of 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.939
 lot filtri 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.300
 probably this is the only significant 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:31.400
 minus f2000 that on assemblies here two 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.469
 option which depends on the distance 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.500
 which you work up melee 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:37.699
 I recommend the compensator and ltsu 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.039
 ergonomic handle for combat 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.650
 midrange compensator in chapter i 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.870
 handle and services for each distance 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.120
 need to use different sights 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.849
 here the choice between the usual collimator 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.969
 standard telescopic sight overall 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.189
 f2000 became a good competitor of mine so 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:57.590
 how he is more variable in the distance 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:00.110
 this is achieved by a new sight and 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.060
 modified characteristic mounting but 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.490
 I think that's all thanks for watching 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.189
 subscribe comment if you are 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.469
 watch this video on youtube please 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.400
 follow the link in the description to 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:14.500
 the next day 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.500
 see you on the battlefield factor
