there's<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.700> new<00:00:06.000> tool<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.839> fight<00:00:07.049> against

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
there's a new tool in the fight against

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.240 
there's a new tool in the fight against
breast<00:00:07.440> cancer

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
breast cancer

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.289 
breast cancer
it's<00:00:08.940> called<00:00:09.330> Tomo<00:00:09.990> synthesis<00:00:14.299> Tomo

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
it's called Tomo synthesis Tomo

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.370 
it's called Tomo synthesis Tomo
synthesis<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:16.020> basically<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> 3d<00:00:16.980> mammogram

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
synthesis is basically a 3d mammogram

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.560 
synthesis is basically a 3d mammogram
the<00:00:19.380> 3d<00:00:19.830> exam<00:00:20.250> looks<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.060> feels<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
the 3d exam looks and feels like a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.929 
the 3d exam looks and feels like a
regular<00:00:21.779> mammogram<00:00:22.500> only<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.400> takes<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.760> few

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
regular mammogram only it takes a few

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.679 
regular mammogram only it takes a few
seconds<00:00:24.330> longer<00:00:24.539> for<00:00:24.930> each<00:00:25.080> view<00:00:26.689> that's

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
seconds longer for each view that's

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.839 
seconds longer for each view that's
because<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.289> x-ray<00:00:28.680> arm<00:00:28.890> swings<00:00:29.340> over<00:00:29.550> your

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
because the x-ray arm swings over your

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089 
because the x-ray arm swings over your
breast<00:00:30.410> gathering<00:00:31.410> enough<00:00:31.650> extra

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
breast gathering enough extra

breast gathering enough extra
information<00:00:32.660> to<00:00:33.660> create<00:00:33.960> a

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
information to create a

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.610 
information to create a
three-dimensional<00:00:34.469> image<00:00:35.040> set<00:00:36.410> so<00:00:37.410> now<00:00:37.440> the

three-dimensional image set so now the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
three-dimensional image set so now the
doctors<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.850> search<00:00:39.090> through<00:00:39.390> your

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
doctors can see and search through your

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.700 
doctors can see and search through your
tissue<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.680> millimeter<00:00:41.160> layers<00:00:45.649> why<00:00:46.649> is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
tissue in one millimeter layers why is

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.730 
tissue in one millimeter layers why is
this<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> good<00:00:47.309> thing

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
this a good thing

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.360 
this a good thing
well<00:00:49.370> a<00:00:49.780> traditional<00:00:50.780> 2d<00:00:51.200> mammogram<00:00:51.380> shows

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
well a traditional 2d mammogram shows

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.060 
well a traditional 2d mammogram shows
all<00:00:52.700> the<00:00:52.880> breast<00:00:53.120> tissue<00:00:53.360> at<00:00:53.630> a<00:00:53.660> glance<00:00:54.070> that

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
all the breast tissue at a glance that

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.100 
all the breast tissue at a glance that
means<00:00:55.400> one<00:00:55.700> feature<00:00:56.000> can<00:00:56.300> hide<00:00:56.510> in<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.810> shadow

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
means one feature can hide in the shadow

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.980 
means one feature can hide in the shadow
of<00:00:57.230> another<00:00:57.910> so<00:00:58.910> it<00:00:59.060> might<00:00:59.270> look<00:00:59.540> like<00:00:59.600> there's

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
of another so it might look like there's

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.290 
of another so it might look like there's
cancer<00:01:00.440> where<00:01:00.710> there<00:01:00.830> isn't<00:01:00.980> any<00:01:01.190> or<00:01:02.060> there

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
cancer where there isn't any or there

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.660 
cancer where there isn't any or there
could<00:01:02.450> be<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.630> tiny<00:01:02.930> cancer<00:01:03.410> we<00:01:03.590> just<00:01:03.800> can't<00:01:03.980> see

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.420 

3d<00:01:07.670> tomosynthesis<00:01:07.850> is<00:01:08.660> different<00:01:09.160> because<00:01:10.160> it

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
3d tomosynthesis is different because it

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.630 
3d tomosynthesis is different because it
shows<00:01:10.700> your<00:01:10.910> tissue<00:01:11.180> in<00:01:11.480> very<00:01:11.780> thin<00:01:12.080> layers

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
shows your tissue in very thin layers

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.440 
shows your tissue in very thin layers
almost<00:01:13.640> like<00:01:13.820> turning<00:01:14.150> pages<00:01:14.390> in<00:01:14.660> a<00:01:14.750> book<00:01:16.450> that

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
almost like turning pages in a book that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.450 
almost like turning pages in a book that
makes<00:01:17.690> it<00:01:17.930> easier<00:01:18.350> for<00:01:18.380> doctors<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:18.980> see<00:01:19.340> if

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
makes it easier for doctors to see if

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.270 
makes it easier for doctors to see if
there's<00:01:19.640> anything<00:01:19.910> to<00:01:20.060> be<00:01:20.240> concerned<00:01:20.570> about

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
there's anything to be concerned about

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.980 
there's anything to be concerned about
there's<00:01:22.280> less<00:01:22.550> chance<00:01:22.580> for<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.240> cancer<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.750> hide

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
there's less chance for a cancer to hide

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.290 
there's less chance for a cancer to hide
behind<00:01:24.260> overlapping<00:01:24.920> tissue<00:01:27.670> it<00:01:28.670> also<00:01:28.910> means

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
behind overlapping tissue it also means

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.120 
behind overlapping tissue it also means
there's<00:01:29.840> less<00:01:30.140> chance<00:01:30.170> your<00:01:30.650> doctor<00:01:30.979> will

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
there's less chance your doctor will

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.800 
there's less chance your doctor will
call<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.430> back<00:01:31.550> later<00:01:31.880> for<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.270> second<00:01:32.690> look

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
call you back later for a second look

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.289 
call you back later for a second look
because<00:01:33.110> they<00:01:33.860> can<00:01:34.040> see<00:01:34.280> more<00:01:34.550> clearly<00:01:34.850> now

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
because they can see more clearly now

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.740 
because they can see more clearly now
and<00:01:38.280> yet<00:01:39.280> for<00:01:39.460> all<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.909> extra<00:01:40.240> clarity<00:01:40.719> of

and yet for all the extra clarity of

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.859 
and yet for all the extra clarity of
greens<00:01:41.079> your<00:01:41.829> x-ray<00:01:42.310> exposure<00:01:42.759> is<00:01:43.090> only<00:01:43.600> about
