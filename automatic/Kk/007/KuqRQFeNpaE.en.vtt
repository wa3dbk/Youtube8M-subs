 Video games room 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.659
 and 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.369
 here is my complete collection 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.379
 yes and I wanted to show you this now 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.179
 as it is built in my living room here 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.520
 So always an anteroom my living room 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.910
 is percent questioned 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.400
 You can also see what I'm playing right now 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.170
 and back again 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 Georg you see 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.140
 many pieces 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.500
 I did not show everything in my videos 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
 I have shelves here for this 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.610
 where many things are situated 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.180
 so that may see approximately 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.280
 how everything is laid out for me you know many of my videos of mine 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.390
 Collections 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.640
 where ever something and Darfeld and there was sometimes the question 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.580
 if i am a type man good for marriage and i guess if you look like that 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.260
 the things are set up yes 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
 because you can see very well there with my things 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.290
 handle well 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.689
 that's it 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.970
 one of my years again such a few 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.100
 main actor 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.190
 my new lamp 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.730
 someone else has 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.100
 she made them comfortable 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 again a few cardboard cutouts 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.210
 and their opinion and their play drift with a ball 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.900
 by making treats and then getting through holes 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.940
 Sunday post because the others are hanging on the walls 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.130
 As I said that everything is not finished yet there is a lot more 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.130
 in it 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.229
 so 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:14.759
 that the community 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.229
 to lead 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.229
 For three years anticipation played like a batty one 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.949
 that's yours 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.259
 Now I have hit everyone once again 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.259
 but I think so idiosyncratic 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.059
 has the tempo played 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.829
 so now i'll show you hanging down yet 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.829
 Percent calendar 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.609
 yes and that is here 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.099
 my well-known Metal Gear figure the Chamber already a few Sketchen to 4 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:52.859
 and 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.979
 yes I think that it optically not bad 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:59.669
 no one can say that there is no height in it 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.340
 and I have to install the work a bit if Rime is square 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.229
 Does it look like a medley? 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.229
 I would say pretty much full 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:17.279
 yes, now he has seen again like my video game collection in total 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:21.629
 is built in the anteroom 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.819
 where for more than ten years only 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.009
 he served for my video games 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.409
 yes I hope you liked it and then 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.909
