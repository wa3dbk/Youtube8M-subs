00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
they have good webs but this Bluff is

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.680 
they have good webs but this Bluff is
just<00:03:11.790> impeccable<00:03:12.500> like<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.769> seriously

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
just impeccable like it's seriously

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.449 
just impeccable like it's seriously
strong<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:17.010> is<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.190> 18<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.000> 20<00:03:19.310> this<00:03:20.310> is

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
strong so this is the 18 to 20 this is

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.170 
strong so this is the 18 to 20 this is
another<00:03:20.700> piece<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.239> 18<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.870> 20<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.970> guess<00:03:23.970> this

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
another piece of 18 to 20 I guess this

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.350 
another piece of 18 to 20 I guess this
is<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.359> smaller<00:03:24.840> piece

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.830 

it<00:03:31.780> comes<00:03:32.620> coiled<00:03:33.160> up<00:03:33.280> seriously<00:03:34.120> tight<00:03:36.840> but

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
it comes coiled up seriously tight but

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.700 
it comes coiled up seriously tight but
the<00:03:37.870> hair<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.410> bomb<00:03:38.710> I<00:03:39.130> kid<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.150> not<00:03:40.710> and

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
the hair is a bomb I kid you not and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.740 
the hair is a bomb I kid you not and
when<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.220> pull<00:03:42.520> it<00:03:42.640> apart<00:03:42.730> when<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.180> first<00:03:43.450> got

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
when you pull it apart when I first got

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.350 
when you pull it apart when I first got
it<00:03:44.020> I<00:03:44.230> looked<00:03:45.040> at<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:45.580> I<00:03:45.700> was<00:03:45.880> like<00:03:46.090> this

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
it I looked at it and I was like this

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.100 
it I looked at it and I was like this
cannot<00:03:46.900> even<00:03:47.260> be<00:03:48.250> anywhere<00:03:48.760> near<00:03:49.120> 11<00:03:49.690> ounces

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
cannot even be anywhere near 11 ounces

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.940 
cannot even be anywhere near 11 ounces
but<00:03:50.380> when<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.130> pull<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.520> apart<00:03:51.640> is<00:03:52.950> seriously

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
but when you pull it apart is seriously

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
but when you pull it apart is seriously
a<00:03:54.070> lot<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.460> hair<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.740> when<00:03:56.740> I<00:03:56.830> do<00:03:56.890> not<00:03:57.280> when<00:03:57.820> I<00:03:57.910> do

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
a lot of hair so when I do not when I do

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.260 
a lot of hair so when I do not when I do
my<00:03:58.300> tracks<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:59.080> think<00:03:59.730> spacing<00:04:00.730> would<00:04:00.880> be<00:04:01.030> very

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
my tracks I think spacing would be very

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.449 
my tracks I think spacing would be very
important<00:04:01.990> with<00:04:02.170> his<00:04:02.320> hair<00:04:02.560> because<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.190> so

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
important with his hair because it is so

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.610 
important with his hair because it is so
thick<00:04:03.850> so<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:06.670> looks<00:04:06.730> like<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.330> little<00:04:07.660> bit<00:04:07.840> but

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
thick so it looks like a little bit but

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.470 
thick so it looks like a little bit but
I<00:04:08.740> can<00:04:08.950> see<00:04:09.130> already<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:09.820> would<00:04:10.090> have<00:04:10.270> to

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
I can see already that I would have to

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.830 
I can see already that I would have to
strategically<00:04:10.750> place<00:04:11.620> these<00:04:11.920> webs<00:04:12.840> because

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
strategically place these webs because

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.740 
strategically place these webs because
the<00:04:13.989> hair<00:04:14.230> is<00:04:14.260> no<00:04:14.620> joke<00:04:14.950> now<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.850> color<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.720> I

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
the hair is no joke now the color that I

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.319 
the hair is no joke now the color that I
got<00:04:17.260> this<00:04:17.769> is<00:04:17.980> a<00:04:18.010> natural<00:04:18.700> supposed<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.180> be<00:04:19.299> a

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
got this is a natural supposed to be a

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.580 
got this is a natural supposed to be a
natural<00:04:20.489> brown<00:04:21.489> but<00:04:22.419> this<00:04:22.600> hair<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.230> could<00:04:23.410> see

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
natural brown but this hair I could see

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.440 
natural brown but this hair I could see
a<00:04:23.620> tenth<00:04:23.980> of<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.310> so<00:04:24.460> it's<00:04:24.640> like<00:04:24.790> a<00:04:24.820> dark<00:04:25.180> brown

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450
