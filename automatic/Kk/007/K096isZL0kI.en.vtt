00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.590 
we've cheated over the top of what was
already<00:00:28.870> there<00:00:28.990> in<00:00:29.520> one<00:00:30.520> end<00:00:30.880> of<00:00:31.150> the<00:00:31.240> room<00:00:31.420> we

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
already there in one end of the room we

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.110 
already there in one end of the room we
have<00:00:31.630> no<00:00:31.930> blood<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.439> plaster<00:00:32.980> ceiling<00:00:33.910> and

the other end was old plaster board with
loaded<00:00:38.230> wallpaper<00:00:38.590> on<00:00:38.800> it<00:00:38.949> so<00:00:39.310> it<00:00:39.430> was<00:00:39.520> easy

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
loaded wallpaper on it so it was easy

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.360 
loaded wallpaper on it so it was easy
it's<00:00:39.940> just<00:00:40.180> poured<00:00:41.050> over<00:00:41.200> the<00:00:41.380> lot<00:00:41.560> with<00:00:42.190> nine

and<00:00:42.520> a<00:00:42.550> half<00:00:42.610> bill<00:00:42.970> blass<00:00:43.810> the<00:00:43.989> wood<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.380> then

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
and a half bill blass the wood and then

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.040 
and a half bill blass the wood and then
we'll<00:00:45.100> get<00:00:45.220> that<00:00:45.370> skin<00:00:45.760> tomorrow<00:00:46.210> know<00:00:46.630> fairly

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
well as you can see we use their

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.840 
well as you can see we use their
password<00:00:50.020> lifts<00:00:50.230> which<00:00:50.410> are<00:00:50.590> borrowed<00:00:50.850> from

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
password lifts which are borrowed from

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.090 
password lifts which are borrowed from
the<00:00:52.300> plaster<00:00:52.720> and<00:00:52.930> that<00:00:53.079> just<00:00:53.380> makes<00:00:53.920> things

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
the plaster and that just makes things

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.960 
the plaster and that just makes things
ten<00:00:54.460> times<00:00:54.640> quicker<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:55.300> if<00:00:56.140> you<00:00:56.680> are

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
ten times quicker and if you are

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.880 
ten times quicker and if you are
shooting<00:00:57.970> ceilings<00:00:58.570> I<00:00:58.899> definitely<00:00:59.620> recommend

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
shooting ceilings I definitely recommend

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.700 
shooting ceilings I definitely recommend
spending<00:01:00.760> a<00:01:01.030> bit<00:01:01.180> of<00:01:01.270> cash<00:01:01.450> on<00:01:01.840> hiring<00:01:02.350> one<00:01:02.620> of

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
spending a bit of cash on hiring one of

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.770 
spending a bit of cash on hiring one of
these<00:01:02.829> because<00:01:03.180> means<00:01:04.180> you<00:01:04.299> can<00:01:04.420> get<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.629> work

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
these because means you can get the work

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.859 
these because means you can get the work
done<00:01:04.809> on<00:01:05.019> your<00:01:05.290> own<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.680> also<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:07.360> just<00:01:07.630> means

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
done on your own and also it just means

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.389 
done on your own and also it just means
you're<00:01:08.170> not<00:01:08.200> wobbling<00:01:08.710> around<00:01:08.799> on<00:01:09.040> ladders

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
you're not wobbling around on ladders

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.580 
you're not wobbling around on ladders
the<00:01:10.060> pillar<00:01:10.329> I'm<00:01:10.540> actually<00:01:10.689> gonna<00:01:10.930> clad<00:01:11.319> in

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590

the pillar I'm actually gonna clad in
plywood<00:01:12.959> first<00:01:13.959> and<00:01:14.590> that's<00:01:14.799> because<00:01:15.100> we're

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.249 
plywood first and that's because we're

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:17.010 
plywood first and that's because we're
gonna<00:01:15.340> have<00:01:15.579> steel<00:01:16.270> up<00:01:16.479> right<00:01:16.719> here<00:01:16.959> to

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
gonna have steel up right here to

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.999 
gonna have steel up right here to
support<00:01:17.560> some<00:01:17.829> wall<00:01:18.340> units<00:01:18.729> in<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:18.969> kitchen

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.499 
support some wall units in the kitchen
so<00:01:21.009> I'm<00:01:21.189> gonna<00:01:21.340> use<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.700> ply<00:01:21.909> to<00:01:21.969> conceal<00:01:22.479> that

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
so I'm gonna use the ply to conceal that

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.629 
so I'm gonna use the ply to conceal that
so<00:01:23.350> we'll<00:01:23.469> hold<00:01:23.619> off<00:01:23.770> on<00:01:23.889> that<00:01:23.920> bit<00:01:24.219> for<00:01:24.369> a<00:01:24.459> week

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:24.639 
so we'll hold off on that bit for a week

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:25.949 
so we'll hold off on that bit for a week
but<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:24.969> rest<00:01:25.149> of<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.359> should<00:01:25.509> be<00:01:25.569> skimmed

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:25.959 
but the rest of it should be skimmed

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.499 
but the rest of it should be skimmed
this<00:01:26.380> week<00:01:26.619> I'm<00:01:27.310> gonna<00:01:27.459> try<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:27.819> keep<00:01:28.029> what<00:01:28.479> I

can<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.990> this<00:01:29.139> lime<00:01:29.469> plaster<00:01:29.740> this<00:01:30.549> is<00:01:30.729> the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
can of this lime plaster this is the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.019 
can of this lime plaster this is the
external<00:01:31.179> wall<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:32.429> it's<00:01:33.429> nice<00:01:33.579> to<00:01:33.609> sound

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:34.029 
external wall and it's nice to sound

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.099 
that plaster and it's gonna keep that
wall<00:01:36.490> completely<00:01:36.969> breathable<00:01:37.179> this<00:01:37.779> corner

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
wall completely breathable this corner

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.679 
wall completely breathable this corner
someone's<00:01:38.439> out<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.679> go<00:01:38.799> it<00:01:39.240> fixing<00:01:40.240> what<00:01:40.509> they

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
someone's out to go it fixing what they

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.739 
someone's out to go it fixing what they
thought<00:01:40.929> was<00:01:41.139> a<00:01:41.170> damp<00:01:41.499> problem<00:01:42.389> the<00:01:43.389> wall<00:01:43.569> is

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
thought was a damp problem the wall is

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:45.300 
thought was a damp problem the wall is
slightly<00:01:44.079> damp<00:01:44.349> but<00:01:44.590> that's<00:01:44.740> really<00:01:45.009> because

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
slightly damp but that's really because

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.749 
slightly damp but that's really because
it's<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.849> drain<00:01:46.149> outside<00:01:46.389> from<00:01:47.020> all<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.349> roof

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
it's the drain outside from all the roof

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.099 
it's the drain outside from all the roof
guttering<00:01:48.759> comes<00:01:48.999> down<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.569> it's<00:01:49.810> obviously

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
guttering comes down and it's obviously

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.289 
guttering comes down and it's obviously
caused<00:01:50.380> some<00:01:50.649> issues<00:01:51.009> so<00:01:51.700> we'll<00:01:51.849> have<00:01:51.969> a<00:01:52.029> big

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
caused some issues so we'll have a big

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.080 
caused some issues so we'll have a big
around<00:01:52.630> down<00:01:52.869> there<00:01:53.079> outside<00:01:53.799> in<00:01:54.459> the<00:01:54.700> future

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
around down there outside in the future

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.809 
around down there outside in the future
and<00:01:55.359> try<00:01:55.719> and<00:01:55.840> solve<00:01:56.049> that<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:57.340> they've<00:01:57.609> gone

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
and try and solve that but they've gone

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.269 
and try and solve that but they've gone
ahead<00:01:57.939> and<00:01:58.149> tried<00:01:58.599> to<00:01:58.709> fix<00:01:59.709> it<00:01:59.919> by<00:02:00.099> putting
