00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.939 

now<00:00:00.210> that<00:00:00.329> I've<00:00:00.420> got<00:00:00.599> those<00:00:00.780> groupings<00:00:01.530> set<00:00:01.829> up

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
now that I've got those groupings set up

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.409 
now that I've got those groupings set up
I'm<00:00:02.040> gonna<00:00:02.129> make<00:00:02.310> some<00:00:02.490> controls<00:00:02.909> here<00:00:03.210> so<00:00:03.360> I

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
I'm gonna make some controls here so I

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.420 
I'm gonna make some controls here so I
can<00:00:03.570> select<00:00:03.840> these<00:00:04.020> guys<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.589> animate<00:00:05.009> them<00:00:05.220> I

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
can select these guys and animate them I

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.740 
can select these guys and animate them I
don't<00:00:05.670> have<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:05.970> hunt<00:00:06.180> through<00:00:06.390> my<00:00:06.540> geometry

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
don't have to hunt through my geometry

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.509 
don't have to hunt through my geometry
to<00:00:07.080> find<00:00:07.319> it<00:00:07.500> hunt<00:00:07.950> through<00:00:08.160> my<00:00:08.250> hierarchy

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
to find it hunt through my hierarchy

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.850 
to find it hunt through my hierarchy
here<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.719> what<00:00:10.019> I'm<00:00:10.080> gonna<00:00:10.170> do<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.410> create<00:00:10.559> some

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
here so what I'm gonna do is create some

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.470 
here so what I'm gonna do is create some
controls<00:00:11.250> by<00:00:11.580> just<00:00:11.820> using<00:00:11.969> curves<00:00:14.330> scale<00:00:15.330> that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
controls by just using curves scale that

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
controls by just using curves scale that
down<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.719> little<00:00:15.929> bit<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.900> component<00:00:19.380> mode

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
down a little bit and in component mode

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.570 
down a little bit and in component mode
I'm<00:00:19.619> just<00:00:19.740> gonna<00:00:19.859> make<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> little<00:00:20.400> bit

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
I'm just gonna make this a little bit

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.560 
I'm just gonna make this a little bit
more<00:00:20.699> interesting<00:00:23.029> and<00:00:24.029> anything<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.390> gets

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
more interesting and anything that gets

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.529 
more interesting and anything that gets
rotated<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.170> tend<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.650> give<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:27.320> more<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.470> a

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
rotated I tend to give it more of a

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.970 
rotated I tend to give it more of a
eight<00:00:30.539> symmetrical<00:00:31.080> shapes<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.830> can

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
eight symmetrical shapes that you can

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.979 
eight symmetrical shapes that you can
tell<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.610> been<00:00:32.700> rotated<00:00:33.390> if<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.870> use<00:00:33.960> a

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
tell that it's been rotated if you use a

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.690 
tell that it's been rotated if you use a
circle<00:00:34.500> what<00:00:34.649> happens<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.280> get<00:00:35.460> confused

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
circle what happens is you get confused

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.520 
circle what happens is you get confused
or<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.300> confused<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> can't<00:00:37.230> tell<00:00:37.410> it's

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
or not confused but you can't tell it's

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.369 
or not confused but you can't tell it's
a<00:00:37.649> rotated<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.750> okay<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.110> gonna<00:00:40.200> use

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
a rotated or not okay so I'm gonna use

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.549 
a rotated or not okay so I'm gonna use
that<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:44.570> let's<00:00:45.570> make<00:00:45.750> sure<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.989> pivot<00:00:46.379> is

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that and let's make sure it's pivot is

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.560 
that and let's make sure it's pivot is
that<00:00:46.739> zero<00:00:47.010> zero<00:00:47.250> zero<00:00:48.350> next<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.590> snap<00:00:49.829> that

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
that zero zero zero next to snap that

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.790 
that zero zero zero next to snap that
and<00:00:51.570> I'm<00:00:51.660> gonna<00:00:51.809> snap<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.320> front<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.710> my

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and I'm gonna snap it to the front of my

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.470 
and I'm gonna snap it to the front of my
toe<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> control<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.270> want<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
toe and this is the control I want to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
toe and this is the control I want to
use<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.050> toe<00:00:55.350> roll<00:00:55.649> I'm<00:00:56.550> gonna

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
use for that toe roll I'm gonna

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.240 
use for that toe roll I'm gonna
duplicate<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.539> actually<00:00:58.320> rotate<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.800> 180

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
duplicate it and actually rotate it 180

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.340 
duplicate it and actually rotate it 180
degrees<00:01:02.180> then<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.270> move<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.570> straight<00:01:03.870> back<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
degrees then I move it straight back and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.240 
degrees then I move it straight back and
that's<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.769> gonna<00:01:04.860> use<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.070> our

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that's not what I'm gonna use for our

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.109 
that's not what I'm gonna use for our
heel<00:01:05.519> control<00:01:06.979> something<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
heel control something like that so

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.020 
heel control something like that so
let's<00:01:09.270> put<00:01:09.930> those<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.470> first<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.760> let's<00:01:11.939> select

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
let's put those in first so let's select

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.249 
let's put those in first so let's select
that<00:01:12.740> toe<00:01:14.720> circle<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.780> I've<00:01:15.869> created<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that toe circle that I've created a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.440 
that toe circle that I've created a
freeze<00:01:16.650> its<00:01:16.830> transformations<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.210> arrow

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
freeze its transformations if I arrow

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.620 
freeze its transformations if I arrow
down<00:01:18.540> once<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.640> showed<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.150> gob<00:01:21.420> tricks

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
down once and if I showed a gob tricks

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.969 
down once and if I showed a gob tricks
in<00:01:21.750> my<00:01:21.780> outliner<00:01:23.810> well<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:24.960> bad<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.290> sorry<00:01:25.650> so

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
in my outliner well not bad I'm sorry so

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.410 
in my outliner well not bad I'm sorry so
shapes<00:01:26.310> away<00:01:27.049> outliner<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.710> you'll<00:01:28.829> see<00:01:29.420> is

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
shapes away outliner what you'll see is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.700 
shapes away outliner what you'll see is
I've<00:01:30.570> actually<00:01:30.720> used<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.320> select<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
I've actually used that to select the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.980 
I've actually used that to select the
joint<00:01:31.979> or<00:01:32.310> select<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> curve<00:01:33.030> underneath<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
joint or select the curve underneath the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.859 
joint or select the curve underneath the
knee<00:01:34.619> objects<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.280> select<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> curve<00:01:38.720> if<00:01:39.720> I

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
knee objects so I select the curve if I

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.990 
knee objects so I select the curve if I
select<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> curve<00:01:40.439> an<00:01:41.100> arrow<00:01:41.369> down<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.670> get

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
select the curve an arrow down I get

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.380 
select the curve an arrow down I get
that<00:01:42.150> shape<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:44.579> now<00:01:44.700> when<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.149> control

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
that shape and now when we do is control

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.060 
that shape and now when we do is control
now<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.960> control<00:01:49.560> select<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
now we do is just control select that

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.870 
now we do is just control select that
toe<00:01:50.340> control<00:01:50.579> or<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.479> toe<00:01:51.750> roll<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.880> I'm

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
toe control or that toe roll and I'm

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.010 
toe control or that toe roll and I'm
going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> use<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> simple<00:01:54.479> script<00:01:54.750> which<00:01:54.960> is

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
going to use a simple script which is

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.840 
going to use a simple script which is
parent<00:01:56.780> -<00:01:57.780> R<00:01:58.049> -<00:01:58.079> shape<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.520> should

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
parent - R - shape and what that should

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.929 
parent - R - shape and what that should
do<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.320> now<00:02:01.320> move<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.399> shape<00:02:02.700> down

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
do is now move that shape down

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.060 
do is now move that shape down
underneath<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.420> NURBS<00:02:03.689> circle<00:02:03.960> who<00:02:04.890> actually

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
underneath the NURBS circle who actually

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.270 
underneath the NURBS circle who actually
underneath<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:06.689> but<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.229> toe<00:02:07.439> roll<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.099> if<00:02:08.190> I

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
underneath the but the toe roll and if I

underneath the but the toe roll and if I
turn<00:02:08.340> off<00:02:08.580> show<00:02:08.610> shapes<00:02:09.149> well<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.840> notice

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
turn off show shapes well you notice

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.210 
turn off show shapes well you notice
that<00:02:10.050> our<00:02:10.170> total<00:02:10.319> role<00:02:10.560> looks<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.069> now

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
that our total role looks like it's now

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.860 
that our total role looks like it's now
occur

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
occur

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.960 
occur
that's<00:02:12.019> because<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.379> has<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.860> shape<00:02:13.160> parent

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
that's because it has that shape parent

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.000 
that's because it has that shape parent
underneath<00:02:14.420> us<00:02:14.629> that's<00:02:15.440> exactly<00:02:15.830> what<00:02:15.950> we

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
underneath us that's exactly what we

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.530 
underneath us that's exactly what we
want<00:02:16.250> now<00:02:16.489> I<00:02:16.519> have<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> quick<00:02:16.970> way<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.150> select

want now I have a quick way to select

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.960 
want now I have a quick way to select
that<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:17.900> rotate<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.470> object<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.160> I'll<00:02:19.819> do

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
that and rotate that object so I'll do

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.220 
that and rotate that object so I'll do
the<00:02:20.090> same<00:02:20.239> thing<00:02:20.300> for<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.629> heel<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.140> what

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
the same thing for the heel and what

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.830 
the same thing for the heel and what

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.640 
use the same script in the script editor
if<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.120> just<00:02:29.299> arrow<00:02:29.510> up<00:02:29.780> I'll<00:02:29.959> get<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.379> last

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
if I just arrow up I'll get that last

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.440 
if I just arrow up I'll get that last
command<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.549> I<00:02:31.640> can<00:02:31.760> just<00:02:31.849> hit<00:02:31.970> enter<00:02:32.180> and

we'll<00:02:32.540> go<00:02:32.660> ahead<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:32.959> do<00:02:33.049> it<00:02:33.140> four<00:02:33.349> ways<00:02:33.440> so

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
we'll go ahead and do it four ways so

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.130 
we'll go ahead and do it four ways so
now<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.830> can<00:02:34.010> select<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.340> heel<00:02:34.670> roll<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.780> I

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
now I can select that heel roll and I

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.339 
now I can select that heel roll and I
can<00:02:36.290> rotate<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.739> from<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:37.040> position<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.260> now

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
can rotate it from that position so now

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.170 
can rotate it from that position so now
I<00:02:39.379> just<00:02:39.410> need<00:02:39.650> one<00:02:39.890> for<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.250> ball<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:40.879> the

are left behind let's go ahead and

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.210 
are left behind let's go ahead and
delete<00:03:23.329> those<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:24.410> now<00:03:24.500> I've<00:03:24.620> got<00:03:24.769> need<00:03:25.160> to

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
delete those so now I've got need to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.410 
delete those so now I've got need to
make<00:03:25.340> one<00:03:25.489> for<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:25.700> toe<00:03:25.819> control<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.329> the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
make one for the toe control and the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.370 
make one for the toe control and the
foot<00:03:26.600> control<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:29.630> I'll<00:03:29.720> make<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:29.900> circle<00:03:30.290> again

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
foot control so I'll make a circle again

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.490 
foot control so I'll make a circle again
we're<00:03:30.739> just<00:03:30.859> gonna<00:03:30.950> V<00:03:31.220> snap<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:32.290> rotate<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.410> up

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
we're just gonna V snap it rotate it up

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.240 
we're just gonna V snap it rotate it up
90<00:03:34.010> degrees<00:03:37.060> let's<00:03:38.060> make<00:03:38.269> it<00:03:39.250> somewhat

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
90 degrees let's make it somewhat

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.840 
90 degrees let's make it somewhat
interesting

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
and I'm going to freeze its

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.000 
and I'm going to freeze its
transformations<00:03:56.220> narrow<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.310> down<00:03:57.340> once<00:03:59.010> and

transformations narrow it down once and

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.590 
transformations narrow it down once and
I'm<00:04:00.100> gonna<00:04:00.220> find<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.459> toe<00:04:00.790> control<00:04:01.030> and

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
I'm gonna find that toe control and

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.130 
I'm gonna find that toe control and
parentage<00:04:02.319> ardèche<00:04:02.739> shape<00:04:03.010> just<00:04:03.280> like<00:04:03.400> before

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
parentage ardèche shape just like before

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.390 
parentage ardèche shape just like before
now<00:04:05.140> I<00:04:05.170> can<00:04:05.440> go<00:04:05.560> there<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:05.890> flop<00:04:06.190> my<00:04:06.340> toe

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
now I can go there and flop my toe

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.080 
now I can go there and flop my toe
around<00:04:08.400> it's<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.459> last<00:04:09.640> thing<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:09.819> need<00:04:09.970> is

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
around it's the last thing I need is

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.800 
around it's the last thing I need is
make<00:04:10.270> a<00:04:10.360> foot<00:04:10.600> control<00:04:10.959> so<00:04:11.290> I'll<00:04:11.440> circle<00:04:12.430> again

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
make a foot control so I'll circle again

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.000 
make a foot control so I'll circle again
snap<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:14.080> I'm<00:04:14.440> gonna<00:04:14.590> rotate<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:15.040> 90<00:04:15.190> degrees

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
snap it I'm gonna rotate it 90 degrees

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.909 
snap it I'm gonna rotate it 90 degrees
get<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.190> go<00:04:18.609> it<00:04:18.730> component<00:04:19.269> mode<00:04:22.650> I'm<00:04:23.650> side

dropped<00:04:24.160> it

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.240 

it's<00:04:31.610> very<00:04:31.760> simple<00:04:32.180> shape<00:04:32.390> that'll<00:04:32.630> work<00:04:33.250> make

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
it's very simple shape that'll work make

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.130 
it's very simple shape that'll work make
sure<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.580> freeze<00:04:34.970> its<00:04:35.180> transformations<00:04:35.360> arrow

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
sure to freeze its transformations arrow

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.880 
sure to freeze its transformations arrow
down<00:04:36.350> once<00:04:38.050> it's<00:04:39.050> like<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.320> foot<00:04:39.500> control

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
down once it's like the foot control

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
parent to charge a shape and I can

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.890 
parent to charge a shape and I can
delete<00:04:42.380> this<00:04:42.680> here<00:04:42.980> and<00:04:43.940> you<00:04:43.970> notice<00:04:44.450> I<00:04:44.540> didn't

history in there I can go ahead and

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.940 
history in there I can go ahead and
delete<00:04:47.720> that<00:04:47.780> history<00:04:48.230> I<00:04:48.350> should<00:04:48.560> be<00:04:48.650> okay

so I have a quick way to grab that foot
I<00:04:52.070> can<00:04:52.520> rotate<00:04:52.790> it<00:04:53.030> from<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.270> heel<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.780> can<00:04:54.650> run

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
I can rotate it from the heel I can run

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.970

it forward let's make it look like

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.360 
it forward let's make it look like
