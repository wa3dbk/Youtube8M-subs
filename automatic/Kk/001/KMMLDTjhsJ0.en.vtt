update<00:00:03.419> on<00:00:05.690> my<00:00:06.690> Megatron<00:00:07.319> here<00:00:07.680> I<00:00:08.250> spent

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
update on my Megatron here I spent

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.259 
update on my Megatron here I spent
pretty<00:00:09.120> much<00:00:09.269> all<00:00:09.630> day<00:00:09.690> yesterday<00:00:12.290> trying<00:00:13.290> to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
get his arms right now just so you know

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.679 
get his arms right now just so you know
this<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> real<00:00:19.650> pain<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.609> now<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.510> showed

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
this is a real pain to do now it showed

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.599 
this is a real pain to do now it showed
you<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.900> before<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.560> added<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.189> joint

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you this before but I added a joint

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.900 
you this before but I added a joint
right<00:00:23.939> there<00:00:25.340> so<00:00:26.340> now<00:00:26.519> he<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:27.650> his<00:00:28.650> arm<00:00:28.949> can

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
right there so now he can his arm can

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:39.400 
right there so now he can his arm can
swivel<00:00:32.570> all<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.809> way<00:00:33.899> around<00:00:33.960> go<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:36.170> straight

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.220 

that<00:00:40.410> still<00:00:40.739> works<00:00:41.180> I've<00:00:42.180> done<00:00:42.629> some<00:00:42.690> work<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
that still works I've done some work to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.950 
that still works I've done some work to
this<00:00:43.410> arm<00:00:43.940> giving<00:00:44.940> them<00:00:45.120> kind<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.660> law

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
this arm giving them kind of that law

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.650 
this arm giving them kind of that law
that<00:00:46.410> he<00:00:46.590> has<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> movie<00:00:47.539> combining<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that he has in the movie combining the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.299 
that he has in the movie combining the
book<00:00:48.870> both<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.190> hands<00:00:51.559> looks<00:00:52.559> pretty<00:00:52.890> good

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
book both the hands looks pretty good

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.250 
book both the hands looks pretty good
that<00:00:53.579> way<00:00:54.739> this<00:00:55.739> took<00:00:55.920> forever<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.640> mean<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.260> cut

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that way this took forever I mean I cut

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.090 
that way this took forever I mean I cut
myself<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.840> all<00:01:00.840> kinds<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.289> stuff<00:01:01.469> trying<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
myself and all kinds of stuff trying to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.179 
myself and all kinds of stuff trying to
do<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:03.030> not<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.390> easy<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:04.229> something

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
do this so it's not as easy as something

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.359 
do this so it's not as easy as something
that<00:01:05.339> some<00:01:05.670> kind<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.880> quick<00:01:06.860> thing<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.189> do

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that some kind of quick thing you can do

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.000 
that some kind of quick thing you can do
but<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:08.729> least<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.150> he<00:01:09.210> has<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:10.010> articulate

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
but at least now he has to articulate

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.160 
but at least now he has to articulate
arms<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:16.850> more<00:01:17.850> realistic<00:01:18.240> law<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
arms and more realistic law like the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.840 
arms and more realistic law like the
movie<00:01:20.420> good<00:01:21.420> luck<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.680> used<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
movie good luck if you do this I used a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.440 
movie good luck if you do this I used a
bumblebee<00:01:24.810> joint<00:01:26.540> right<00:01:27.540> there<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.930> his<00:01:28.080> arm

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
bumblebee joint right there for his arm

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.039 
bumblebee joint right there for his arm
works<00:01:30.450> pretty<00:01:30.689> good<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.630> basically

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
works pretty good and I basically

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.740 
works pretty good and I basically
combine<00:01:34.680> both<00:01:34.920> claws<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.150> fit<00:01:36.600> together

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
combine both claws they all fit together

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.210 
combine both claws they all fit together
on<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.790> peg<00:01:38.790> down<00:01:39.090> here<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:40.409> between<00:01:41.070> his

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
on this one peg down here in between his

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.639 
on this one peg down here in between his
hand<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:42.780> does<00:01:43.049> make<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.380> look<00:01:43.500> pretty<00:01:43.530> nice<00:01:45.649> so

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
hand it does make it look pretty nice so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.569 
hand it does make it look pretty nice so
basically<00:01:47.720> cannibalized<00:01:48.720> two<00:01:49.229> figures<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
basically cannibalized two figures to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.749 
basically cannibalized two figures to
create<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.210> good<00:01:51.920> Megatron<00:01:52.920> here<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.250> did<00:01:53.520> keep

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
create one good Megatron here I did keep

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.249 
create one good Megatron here I did keep
this<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.149> didn't<00:01:54.360> want<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.630> switch<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> whole

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
this I didn't want to switch the whole

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.459 
this I didn't want to switch the whole
arm<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> he<00:01:56.310> had<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.469> kind

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
arm I like that he had a you know kind

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.540 
arm I like that he had a you know kind
of<00:01:58.560> piece<00:01:59.219> together<00:02:00.210> arm

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
of piece together arm

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.080 
of piece together arm
and<00:02:02.060> but<00:02:02.980> there<00:02:03.980> he<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.780> Megatron<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:07.090> Sam

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
and but there he is Megatron and Sam

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.040 
and but there he is Megatron and Sam
Witwicky<00:02:08.350> all<00:02:09.350> dead<00:02:09.860> on<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.130> floor<00:02:11.050> but

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
Witwicky all dead on the floor but

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.780 
Witwicky all dead on the floor but
that's<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.830> just<00:02:13.220> wanted<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.490> show<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.700> that

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
that's I just wanted to show you that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.580 
that's I just wanted to show you that
it's<00:02:14.540> not<00:02:15.020> as<00:02:15.260> easy<00:02:15.440> as<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:16.310> looks<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.450> mean<00:02:17.780> had

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
it's not as easy as it looks I mean had

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.460 
it's not as easy as it looks I mean had
to<00:02:18.710> cut<00:02:18.890> through<00:02:19.070> this<00:02:19.870> find<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.990> way<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.170> put<00:02:21.440> it

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
to cut through this find a way to put it

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.500 
to cut through this find a way to put it
in<00:02:21.710> makes<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.670> missile<00:02:23.000> doesn't<00:02:23.270> fire

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
in makes it so the missile doesn't fire

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.280 
in makes it so the missile doesn't fire
anymore<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:25.720> I'm<00:02:26.720> going<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.900> figure<00:02:27.140> out<00:02:27.230> a

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
anymore but I'm going to figure out a

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.160 
anymore but I'm going to figure out a
way<00:02:27.410> for<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.860> fire<00:02:28.190> still<00:02:28.930> I'll<00:02:29.930> do<00:02:30.050> an

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
way for it to fire still I'll do an

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.370 
way for it to fire still I'll do an
update<00:02:30.410> when<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.590> do<00:02:30.710> that<00:02:32.080> but<00:02:33.080> yeah<00:02:33.230> there<00:02:33.650> is

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
update when I do that but yeah there is

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.300 
update when I do that but yeah there is
more<00:02:36.380> accurate<00:02:36.680> Megatron<00:02:37.400> thanks
