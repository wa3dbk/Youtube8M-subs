inside here we have the extra ear buds
out<00:01:36.690> here<00:01:36.930> which<00:01:37.170> I'll<00:01:37.350> go<00:01:37.470> ahead<00:01:37.590> take<00:01:38.010> one<00:01:38.460> of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
out here which I'll go ahead take one of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.910 
out here which I'll go ahead take one of
them<00:01:38.700> how<00:01:39.030> each<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.230> can<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.620> that<00:01:40.650> this

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
them how each so you can see that this

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.420 
them how each so you can see that this
one<00:01:41.190> is<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:42.180> biggest<00:01:42.690> size<00:01:42.900> here<00:01:43.250> it's<00:01:44.250> also

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
one is the biggest size here it's also

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.460 
one is the biggest size here it's also
you<00:01:44.640> know<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.910> lot<00:01:45.180> fatter<00:01:45.540> because<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.380> know

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
you know a lot fatter because you know

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.830 
you know a lot fatter because you know
some<00:01:46.710> people<00:01:46.740> having<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.370> really<00:01:47.610> big<00:01:47.760> is<00:01:47.910> this

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
some people having a really big is this

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.770 
some people having a really big is this
one<00:01:49.230> is<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.770> smallest<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.430> believe<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.630> can

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
one is the smallest I believe as you can

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.960 
one is the smallest I believe as you can
see<00:01:52.050> if<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.650> do<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.830> comparison<00:01:53.340> between<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.850> two

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
see if I do a comparison between the two

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.580 
see if I do a comparison between the two
you<00:01:54.120> can<00:01:54.270> see<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.750> one's<00:01:54.990> more<00:01:55.140> faster

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you can see that this one's more faster

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.010 
you can see that this one's more faster
this<00:01:55.740> one's<00:01:55.950> thinner<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.900> you<00:01:57.900> know

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
this one's thinner and you know

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.390 
this one's thinner and you know
obviously<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.560> bigger<00:01:58.800> than<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.190> one's

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
obviously it's bigger than this one's

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.109 
obviously it's bigger than this one's
smaller<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:02.250> earphones<00:02:02.610> themselves

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
smaller the earphones themselves

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.210 
smaller the earphones themselves
actually<00:02:03.270> contain<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.960> medium<00:02:04.500> sized<00:02:04.830> ear

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
actually contain the medium sized ear

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.550 
actually contain the medium sized ear
buds<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:08.149> which<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.330> what<00:02:09.540> most<00:02:09.750> people's<00:02:10.290> ears
