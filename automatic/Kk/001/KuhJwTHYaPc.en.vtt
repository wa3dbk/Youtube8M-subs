00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.150
 with youtube friends here mister banano 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:08.900
 and well let's do a review of 4 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.829
 mods that are what I normally use and 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.509
 well let's see good academy the 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:16.100
 first two are at first glance that 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.789
 is the one to remove the fog and to 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.839
 render long the map I do not remember 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.870
 very good names but there it is 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:30.310
 because it looks like that rare camera 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.310
 because the other mod comes 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.120
 the east is to run faster 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.770
 and then 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.770
 let's try it with parkour 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.470
 and there comes the fourth mod that is to fly 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.030
 in creative 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.030
 these bikes are very good 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:03.650
 or superior or not 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.840
 I'm going to leave the link of how from 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.979
 of the discharge 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.979
 to check them 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.960
 is today 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 bbva 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.659
 pity pity that this is great 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.890
 perfect for the 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.890
 parkour maps 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.180
 just for that because using it in a 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.830
 survival would be like cheat or something 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.860
 A) Yes 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 the one to run double not why 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.360
 it is good to travel distances 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.220
 although the worlds are not so big 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.220
 but it helps you 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.560
 and well let's show them how 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.010
 install them and they already have to know 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.010
 but good 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.610
 for the pp 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.970
 it's good 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.970
 let's do something 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.490
 let's finish the map 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.890
 comes 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.270
 because you do not leave the cases 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.990
 something that does not let you out good 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.750
 we are going to 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.460
 yes as you will see it is the only problem that 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.460
 I see the mod that is not very level 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.390
 let's check it out let's check what 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.760
 but if it goes very well for parkour for the 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.420
 Normal survival , I do not think so 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.420
 the same of 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.670
 that is very level 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.670
 all be fighting with the controls 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.410
 and well let's see how it is installed 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.700
 I think that will not be on the good side 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.730
 he 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.720
 Well, I'm going to leave this page in 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.819
 the description and here it will appear 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.030
 this good 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.280
 and here are the motorcycles put here is going 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.950

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.989
 take to the mission patch 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.379
 and they will put it here and they will be able to 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.050

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.450

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.670
 appear where it says normal past the van 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.360
 to select the will be able to apply 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.660
 patches 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:44.490
 and they are already going to pass you should not 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.819
 have the micro open because if you do not 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.040
 it's going to swallow 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.599
 Well, goodbye, mister banana, I hope 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.830
