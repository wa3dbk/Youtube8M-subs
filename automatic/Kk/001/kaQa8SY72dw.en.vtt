think<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.330> need<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.510> much<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.990> an<00:02:46.110> advantage

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
think I need that much of an advantage

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.830 
think I need that much of an advantage
on<00:02:47.160> people<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.520> kill<00:02:47.700> them<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.600> me<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.780> just

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
on people to kill them and to me it just

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.590 
on people to kill them and to me it just
risky<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:49.560> your<00:02:49.710> back<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.310> know<00:02:50.480> open<00:02:51.480> to

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
risky to have your back you know open to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.240 
risky to have your back you know open to
fire<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.260> that's<00:02:52.530> basically<00:02:52.650> why<00:02:52.980> don't<00:02:53.160> like

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
fire so that's basically why don't like

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.780 
fire so that's basically why don't like
the<00:02:53.340> research<00:02:53.640> bodies<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:56.580> know<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
the research bodies and you know the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.550
