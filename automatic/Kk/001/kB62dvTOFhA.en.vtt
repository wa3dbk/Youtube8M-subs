00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
that they qualify and I think that Clint

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.820 
that they qualify and I think that Clint
Dempsey<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.049> interesting<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.470> he's<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
Dempsey it's interesting that he's the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.649 
Dempsey it's interesting that he's the
guy<00:01:04.949> who's<00:01:05.189> coming<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.000> saying<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.330> he
