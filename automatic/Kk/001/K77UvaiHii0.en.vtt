00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
element in front of that for focus and

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.429 
element in front of that for focus and
things<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> has<00:01:14.999> a<00:01:15.030> filter<00:01:15.810> tray<00:01:15.990> back<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.409> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
things it has a filter tray back here I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.440 
things it has a filter tray back here I
guess<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.679> can<00:01:16.770> drop<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.189> yeah<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:17.999> a<00:01:18.060> 72

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
guess you can drop in yeah it's a 72

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.569 
guess you can drop in yeah it's a 72
millimeter<00:01:18.990> screw<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.890> conventional

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
millimeter screw and conventional

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.309 
millimeter screw and conventional
screwin<00:01:20.850> filters<00:01:21.179> into<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.600> drop-in<00:01:22.020> filter

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
screwin filters into the drop-in filter

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.260 
screwin filters into the drop-in filter
holder<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.770> that's<00:01:23.369> his<00:01:23.549> slid<00:01:23.819> into<00:01:23.969> the<00:01:24.119> back

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
holder and that's his slid into the back

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.910 
holder and that's his slid into the back
of<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.479> lens<00:01:24.630> bowel<00:01:24.899> and<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.679> there's<00:01:25.859> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
of the lens bowel and then there's a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.529 
of the lens bowel and then there's a
mechanism<00:01:26.280> built<00:01:26.520> into<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.939> lens<00:01:27.090> that

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
mechanism built into the lens that

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.480 
mechanism built into the lens that
allows<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.049> filter<00:01:28.469> to<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.740> rotated<00:01:29.249> within

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
allows the filter to be rotated within

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.700 
allows the filter to be rotated within
the<00:01:29.579> lens<00:01:29.759> barrel<00:01:30.109> so<00:01:31.109> if<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.350> circular

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the lens barrel so if a circular

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.469 
the lens barrel so if a circular
polarizer<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.399> used<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:33.060> adjust<00:01:33.359> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
polarizer is used you can adjust the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.059 
polarizer is used you can adjust the
filter<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.139> the<00:01:34.289> degree<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.590> polarization

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
filter to get the degree of polarization

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:36.770 
filter to get the degree of polarization
that's<00:01:35.310> desired<00:01:35.700> okay<00:01:36.149> well<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.509> quite<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that's desired okay well that is quite a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.529 
that's desired okay well that is quite a
quite<00:01:37.289> a<00:01:37.319> beast<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.969> what<00:01:38.969> do<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.359> know<00:01:39.450> what

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
quite a beast so what do we know what

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.660 
quite a beast so what do we know what

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this is going to cost yet or no the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.010 
this is going to cost yet or no the
factory<00:01:41.969> hasn't<00:01:42.329> established<00:01:42.719> the<00:01:42.810> price

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
factory hasn't established the price

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.169 
factory hasn't established the price
it's<00:01:43.679> being<00:01:43.889> shown<00:01:44.100> now<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.429> prototype<00:01:44.729> form

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
it's being shown now in prototype form

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.380 
it's being shown now in prototype form
but<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.539> nearly<00:01:45.749> completed<00:01:46.429> we've<00:01:47.429> had

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
but it is nearly completed we've had

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.330 
but it is nearly completed we've had
when<00:01:48.900> we've<00:01:49.050> asked<00:01:49.500> people<00:01:50.040> what<00:01:50.310> they

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
when we've asked people what they

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.590 
when we've asked people what they
thought<00:01:50.490> would<00:01:50.730> be<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.880> reasonable<00:01:51.240> price

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
thought would be a reasonable price

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.810 
thought would be a reasonable price
range<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.050> it<00:01:52.350> we've<00:01:52.500> had<00:01:52.710> prices<00:01:53.490> ranging

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
range for it we've had prices ranging

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.100 
range for it we've had prices ranging
from<00:01:53.970> about<00:01:54.180> ten<00:01:54.390> or<00:01:54.510> twelve<00:01:54.540> thousand

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
from about ten or twelve thousand

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.870 
from about ten or twelve thousand
dollars<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.500> twenty<00:01:55.860> thousand<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.490> I'm

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
dollars up to twenty thousand so I'm

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.180
