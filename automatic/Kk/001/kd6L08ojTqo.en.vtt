00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.949 
3 although call of duty plays at least
for<00:02:34.360> time<00:02:34.630> maybe<00:02:35.110> 3.9<00:02:36.040> times<00:02:36.070> better<00:02:36.790> then<00:02:37.600> it

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
for time maybe 3.9 times better then it

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.449 
for time maybe 3.9 times better then it
doesn't<00:02:38.110> play<00:02:38.350> station<00:02:38.650> because<00:02:38.770> well<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
which shouldn't because it should be

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.750
