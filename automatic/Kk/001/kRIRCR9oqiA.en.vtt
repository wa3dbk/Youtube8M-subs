well it turns out I'm not gonna wait

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.400 
well it turns out I'm not gonna wait
through<00:00:04.250> the<00:00:04.340> winter<00:00:04.700> to<00:00:04.819> work<00:00:05.000> on<00:00:05.180> the<00:00:05.410> 1946

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.410 
through the winter to work on the 1946

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.200 
through the winter to work on the 1946
I'm<00:00:06.890> really<00:00:07.279> kind<00:00:07.520> of<00:00:07.609> itching<00:00:07.879> to<00:00:08.000> see

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
I'm really kind of itching to see

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.180 
I'm really kind of itching to see
whether<00:00:08.360> it's<00:00:08.540> kind<00:00:08.750> of<00:00:08.809> run<00:00:08.960> or<00:00:09.080> not<00:00:09.200> so<00:00:10.070> as

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
whether it's kind of run or not so as

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.740 
whether it's kind of run or not so as
you<00:00:10.280> can<00:00:10.400> see<00:00:10.459> I<00:00:10.639> pulled<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:11.090> handlebars<00:00:11.629> and

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
you can see I pulled the handlebars and

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.600 
you can see I pulled the handlebars and
the<00:00:11.959> hood<00:00:12.110> up<00:00:12.230> and<00:00:12.350> everything<00:00:12.799> and<00:00:13.190> I<00:00:13.369> got<00:00:13.490> the

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
the hood up and everything and I got the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.340 
the hood up and everything and I got the
fan<00:00:13.789> shroud<00:00:14.000> off<00:00:14.330> so<00:00:14.570> I<00:00:14.600> can<00:00:14.750> get<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:15.020> joke<00:00:15.230> out

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
fan shroud off so I can get the joke out

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.960 
fan shroud off so I can get the joke out
of<00:00:15.529> here<00:00:15.770> and<00:00:15.949> hopefully<00:00:16.100> get<00:00:16.400> that<00:00:16.550> exhaust

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
of here and hopefully get that exhaust

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.330 
of here and hopefully get that exhaust
valve<00:00:17.210> unstuck<00:00:17.690> I've<00:00:18.380> also<00:00:18.590> been<00:00:18.890> spraying

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
valve unstuck I've also been spraying

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.460 
valve unstuck I've also been spraying
with<00:00:19.790> some<00:00:20.000> oil<00:00:20.120> over<00:00:20.360> the<00:00:20.540> past<00:00:20.780> week<00:00:21.260> or<00:00:21.410> so

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
with some oil over the past week or so

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.190 
with some oil over the past week or so
now<00:00:21.800> anyway<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:22.450> and<00:00:23.450> as<00:00:23.600> you<00:00:23.720> can<00:00:23.810> see<00:00:23.870> it's

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
now anyway so and as you can see it's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.580 
now anyway so and as you can see it's
also<00:00:24.380> very<00:00:24.880> dirty<00:00:25.880> hit<00:00:26.330> a<00:00:26.360> lot<00:00:26.780> of<00:00:27.050> oil<00:00:27.260> and

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
also very dirty hit a lot of oil and

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.500 
also very dirty hit a lot of oil and
stuff<00:00:28.039> built<00:00:28.340> up<00:00:28.520> on<00:00:28.730> it<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.000> I<00:00:29.060> got<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:29.270> scrape

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
stuff built up on it so I got to scrape

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.049 
stuff built up on it so I got to scrape
that<00:00:29.720> off<00:00:29.780> before<00:00:30.170> I<00:00:30.410> pull<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:30.740> jug<00:00:30.949> off<00:00:31.190> and

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
that off before I pull the jug off and

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.610 
that off before I pull the jug off and
clean<00:00:32.419> this<00:00:32.570> up<00:00:32.719> a<00:00:32.840> little<00:00:32.960> bit<00:00:33.199> so<00:00:33.379> that<00:00:33.410> way

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
clean this up a little bit so that way

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.350 
clean this up a little bit so that way
when<00:00:33.800> it<00:00:33.890> comes<00:00:33.950> off<00:00:34.400> nothing<00:00:34.850> falls<00:00:35.120> down

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
when it comes off nothing falls down

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.140 
when it comes off nothing falls down
inside<00:00:35.690> of<00:00:35.810> the<00:00:35.870> crankcase<00:00:36.940> so<00:00:37.940> we'll<00:00:38.060> get

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
inside of the crankcase so we'll get

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.180 
inside of the crankcase so we'll get
that<00:00:38.210> pulled<00:00:38.630> off<00:00:38.810> and<00:00:39.079> I<00:00:39.290> also<00:00:39.440> took<00:00:40.070> this

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
that pulled off and I also took this

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.550 
that pulled off and I also took this
magneto<00:00:40.640> off<00:00:40.880> today<00:00:41.149> just<00:00:41.540> mess<00:00:42.140> around<00:00:42.170> with

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
magneto off today just mess around with

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.260 
magneto off today just mess around with
it<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:42.829> I<00:00:42.890> got<00:00:43.040> some<00:00:43.220> nice<00:00:43.399> blue<00:00:43.610> spark<00:00:43.970> out<00:00:44.149> of

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
it and I got some nice blue spark out of

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.110 
it and I got some nice blue spark out of
it<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.230> magneto<00:00:45.620> is<00:00:45.770> definitely<00:00:46.190> good<00:00:46.399> so

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
it so the magneto is definitely good so

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.210 
it so the magneto is definitely good so
hopefully<00:00:47.390> we<00:00:48.110> get<00:00:48.260> this<00:00:48.380> exhaust<00:00:48.800> valve<00:00:49.070> on

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
hopefully we get this exhaust valve on

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.580 
hopefully we get this exhaust valve on
stuff<00:00:49.520> can<00:00:49.730> we<00:00:49.820> can<00:00:49.940> get<00:00:50.000> it<00:00:50.120> running<00:00:50.590> all

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
stuff can we can get it running all

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.990 
stuff can we can get it running all
right<00:00:51.770> I<00:00:51.800> got<00:00:51.980> that<00:00:52.100> jug<00:00:52.309> all<00:00:52.489> cleaned<00:00:52.820> off<00:00:52.940> and

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
right I got that jug all cleaned off and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.120 
right I got that jug all cleaned off and
everything<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.750> took<00:00:53.899> a<00:00:53.960> while<00:00:54.230> but<00:00:54.559> all<00:00:54.800> the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
everything it took a while but all the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.549 
everything it took a while but all the
fins<00:00:55.430> are<00:00:55.640> all<00:00:55.790> cleaned<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:56.390> seems<00:00:57.290> like<00:00:57.440> they

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
fins are all cleaned and seems like they

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.319 
fins are all cleaned and seems like they
should<00:00:57.590> be<00:00:57.770> all<00:00:57.950> set<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.460> I<00:00:58.520> got<00:00:58.940> around<00:00:59.149> all

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
should be all set and I got around all

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.940 
should be all set and I got around all
the<00:00:59.420> valve<00:00:59.600> covers<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:00.110> stuff<00:01:00.469> those<00:01:00.680> are<00:01:00.710> all

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
the valve covers and stuff those are all

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.369 
the valve covers and stuff those are all
set<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.000> that<00:01:02.059> when<00:01:02.239> I<00:01:02.420> pull<00:01:02.690> it<00:01:02.719> up<00:01:02.870> junk<00:01:03.140> won't

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
set so that when I pull it up junk won't

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.980 
set so that when I pull it up junk won't
fall<00:01:03.620> out<00:01:03.649> and<00:01:03.980> we<00:01:04.699> had<00:01:04.850> quite<00:01:05.119> a<00:01:05.180> bit<00:01:05.269> so<00:01:05.869> I'll

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
fall out and we had quite a bit so I'll

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.559 
fall out and we had quite a bit so I'll
have<00:01:06.109> to<00:01:06.200> get<00:01:06.319> that<00:01:06.439> swept<00:01:06.799> up<00:01:06.979> later<00:01:07.569> anyways

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:08.569 
have to get that swept up later anyways

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.090 
have to get that swept up later anyways
we'll<00:01:08.840> see<00:01:09.020> if<00:01:09.109> we<00:01:09.200> get<00:01:09.319> these<00:01:09.469> bolts<00:01:09.829> loose

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
we'll see if we get these bolts loose

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:29.600 
we'll see if we get these bolts loose
and<00:01:10.429> lift<00:01:11.179> the<00:01:11.299> jug<00:01:11.479> off<00:01:11.719> the<00:01:11.869> piston

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.270 

all<00:01:30.300> right<00:01:30.480> we<00:01:30.660> get<00:01:30.780> all<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.200> nuts<00:01:31.800> off<00:01:32.010> for

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
all right we get all the nuts off for

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.460 
all right we get all the nuts off for
the<00:01:32.370> jug<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.060> now<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.690> we<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.930> slip<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.320> up

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:02:01.490 

that's<00:01:40.470> came<00:01:41.190> off<00:01:41.370> pretty<00:01:41.640> easy

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:14.740 

I'm<00:02:02.500> caught<00:02:02.860> on<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:03.220> ring<00:02:03.400> or<00:02:03.580> something

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:25.730 

much<00:02:15.750> as<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.020> hate<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:23.300> snap<00:02:24.620> here<00:02:25.620> we

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
much as I hate to do that snap here we

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.220 
much as I hate to do that snap here we
go<00:02:26.690> had<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> little<00:02:28.020> bit<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.230> water<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:30.230> see

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
go had a little bit of water in it see

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.970 
go had a little bit of water in it see
it<00:02:31.350> was<00:02:31.500> sitting<00:02:33.050> probably<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.350> piston

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
it was sitting probably in the piston

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.210 
it was sitting probably in the piston
was<00:02:35.130> sitting<00:02:35.400> down<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.700> bottom<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.300> while

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
was sitting down the bottom for a while

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.420 
was sitting down the bottom for a while
so<00:02:41.060> came<00:02:42.060> off<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.270> little<00:02:42.390> tough<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.470> should

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
so came off a little tough but I should

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.650 
so came off a little tough but I should
be<00:02:44.490> able<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.670> clean<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.060> up<00:02:45.210> with<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.480> hole<00:02:45.630> in

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
be able to clean it up with the hole in

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.680 
be able to clean it up with the hole in
a<00:02:45.840> bit<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:47.130> piston<00:02:47.640> doesn't<00:02:47.910> look<00:02:48.030> overly<00:02:48.210> bad

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
a bit and piston doesn't look overly bad

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.130 
a bit and piston doesn't look overly bad
it<00:02:48.900> does<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.970> some<00:02:50.970> water<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.690> you

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
it does have some water in it and you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.710 
it does have some water in it and you
can<00:02:52.290> feel<00:02:52.500> some<00:02:52.740> grit<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.460> I'll<00:02:54.240> have<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.570> get

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
can feel some grit so I'll have to get

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.660 
can feel some grit so I'll have to get
all<00:02:54.840> sprayed<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.500> cleaned<00:02:55.740> up<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.100> actually

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.680 

looks<00:02:59.670> like<00:02:59.850> it's<00:03:00.060> good<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.300> don't<00:03:00.420> know<00:03:00.570> how

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
looks like it's good I don't know how

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.140 
looks like it's good I don't know how
well<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.900> guys<00:03:01.170> see<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:03.000> got<00:03:03.090> a

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
well you guys see that you got a

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.610 
well you guys see that you got a
flashlight<00:03:04.460> but<00:03:05.460> there's<00:03:05.700> rust<00:03:06.120> on<00:03:06.620> the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
flashlight but there's rust on the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:15.800 
flashlight but there's rust on the
inside<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:12.709> block<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.300> see<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.630> right

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
inside of the block you can see it right

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.120 
inside of the block you can see it right
there<00:03:15.840> on<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:17.190> exhaust<00:03:17.730> valve<00:03:18.000> camshaft<00:03:18.690> and

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
there on the exhaust valve camshaft and

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.330 
there on the exhaust valve camshaft and
also<00:03:20.130> see<00:03:20.370> on<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.670> connecting<00:03:21.209> rod<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
also see on the connecting rod to the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.370 
also see on the connecting rod to the
gear<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.090> thing<00:03:24.360> had<00:03:24.600> moisture<00:03:25.140> in<00:03:25.260> it

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
gear so this thing had moisture in it

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.860 
gear so this thing had moisture in it
for<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.650> while<00:03:26.630> hopefully<00:03:27.630> it's<00:03:27.780> not

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
for a while hopefully it's not

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.860 
for a while hopefully it's not
completely<00:03:28.560> gone<00:03:28.590> inside<00:03:29.510> intake<00:03:30.510> doesn't

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
completely gone inside intake doesn't

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.520 
completely gone inside intake doesn't
look<00:03:30.959> too<00:03:31.110> bad<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:33.690> know<00:03:33.840> if<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.200> could<00:03:34.350> see

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
look too bad you know if you could see

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.290 
look too bad you know if you could see
the<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:35.070> probably<00:03:35.370> can't<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.820> I<00:03:35.850> could<00:03:36.120> see

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
the you probably can't the I could see

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.970 
the you probably can't the I could see
the<00:03:36.420> oil<00:03:36.450> way<00:03:36.930> down<00:03:37.140> there<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.590> doesn't<00:03:37.890> look

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
the oil way down there and doesn't look

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.759 
the oil way down there and doesn't look
doesn't<00:03:38.970> look<00:03:39.090> overly<00:03:39.269> bad<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.140> we'll<00:03:40.500> have<00:03:40.590> to

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
doesn't look overly bad so we'll have to

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.860 
doesn't look overly bad so we'll have to
see<00:03:41.239> so<00:03:42.239> let's<00:03:42.390> see<00:03:42.480> if<00:03:42.540> we<00:03:42.600> can<00:03:42.690> get<00:03:42.780> this

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
see so let's see if we can get this

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.830 
see so let's see if we can get this
exhaust<00:03:43.230> valve<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.800> move<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.840> hopefully

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
exhaust valve to move and hopefully

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.060 
exhaust valve to move and hopefully
everything<00:03:46.170> else<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.410> be<00:03:46.530> okay<00:03:46.830> for<00:03:46.890> the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
everything else to be okay for the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.430 
everything else to be okay for the
bottom<00:03:47.340> end<00:03:47.489> all<00:03:48.390> right<00:03:48.690> well<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:48.959> was<00:03:49.170> able<00:03:49.290> to

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
bottom end all right well I was able to

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.110 
bottom end all right well I was able to
get<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.800> go<00:03:49.980> down<00:03:50.010> some<00:03:50.459> when<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.730> put<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.060> in

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
get it to go down some when I put it in

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.340 
get it to go down some when I put it in
the<00:03:51.209> vise<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:52.200> used<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.880> brass<00:03:53.880> drift<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:55.200> a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
the vise and I used a brass drift and a

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.350 
the vise and I used a brass drift and a
hammer<00:03:55.530> so<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.550> was<00:03:56.670> able<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.910> get<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.209> down

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
hammer so I was able to get it down

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.720 
hammer so I was able to get it down
pretty<00:03:57.630> close<00:03:57.930> which<00:03:58.650> should<00:03:59.220> give<00:03:59.370> me<00:03:59.489> enough

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
pretty close which should give me enough

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.960 
pretty close which should give me enough
room<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.000> push<00:04:00.360> down<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:01.580> retainer<00:04:02.580> there<00:04:02.850> and

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
room to push down the retainer there and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.520 
room to push down the retainer there and
get<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.180> clip<00:04:03.390> out<00:04:03.540> which<00:04:04.140> is<00:04:04.290> what<00:04:04.440> I'm

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
get the clip out which is what I'm

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.990 
get the clip out which is what I'm
shooting<00:04:04.709> for<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.160> then<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.340> can<00:04:05.489> drive<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:05.910> up

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
shooting for and then I can drive it up

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.210 
shooting for and then I can drive it up
this<00:04:06.180> way<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:07.320> know<00:04:07.380> I'm<00:04:07.590> gonna<00:04:07.709> need<00:04:07.980> a<00:04:08.010> new

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
this way and I know I'm gonna need a new

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.759 
this way and I know I'm gonna need a new
valve<00:04:08.519> because<00:04:09.360> I'm<00:04:09.930> sure<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.290> can<00:04:10.440> probably

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
valve because I'm sure you can probably

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.370 
valve because I'm sure you can probably
see<00:04:11.070> that<00:04:11.220> with<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.150> can<00:04:12.390> it's

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
see that with you can it's

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.830 
see that with you can it's
lower<00:04:13.620> on<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.010> left<00:04:14.220> hand<00:04:14.400> side<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:15.300> is<00:04:15.330> warped

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
lower on the left hand side it is warped

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.199 
lower on the left hand side it is warped
from<00:04:16.110> me<00:04:16.230> hitting<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.680> over<00:04:16.920> the<00:04:17.760> past<00:04:17.970> couple

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
from me hitting it over the past couple

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.090 
from me hitting it over the past couple
of<00:04:18.360> days<00:04:18.510> now<00:04:18.810> which<00:04:19.470> isn't<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.800> big<00:04:19.920> deal

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
of days now which isn't a big deal

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.140 
of days now which isn't a big deal
because<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.400> got<00:04:20.520> plenty<00:04:20.700> more<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.060> these

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
because I got plenty more of these

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.210 
because I got plenty more of these
valves<00:04:21.630> around<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.530> let's<00:04:22.680> see<00:04:22.800> if<00:04:22.860> we<00:04:22.920> get<00:04:23.070> the

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
valves around so let's see if we get the

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.500 
valves around so let's see if we get the
clip<00:04:23.430> open<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.820> then<00:04:23.910> we<00:04:24.000> can<00:04:24.120> drive<00:04:24.360> the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
clip open and then we can drive the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.950 
clip open and then we can drive the
valve

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
valve

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.630 
valve
alright<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.560> was<00:04:25.770> able<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:25.950> get<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.280> valves

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
alright I was able to get the valves

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.220 
alright I was able to get the valves
springing<00:04:27.060> everything<00:04:27.420> off<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.900> cleaned

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
springing everything off and I cleaned

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.800 
springing everything off and I cleaned
up<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.530> valve<00:04:28.740> stem<00:04:29.130> here<00:04:29.910> with<00:04:30.150> some<00:04:30.330> 400

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
up the valve stem here with some 400

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.200 
up the valve stem here with some 400
grit<00:04:30.930> sandpaper<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:32.460> I'll<00:04:32.550> give<00:04:32.730> it<00:04:32.850> some<00:04:33.000> oil

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
grit sandpaper so I'll give it some oil

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.030 
grit sandpaper so I'll give it some oil
and<00:04:33.540> hopefully<00:04:34.020> we<00:04:34.140> can<00:04:34.170> get<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.560> slip<00:04:34.770> down

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
and hopefully we can get it to slip down

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.710 
and hopefully we can get it to slip down
through<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.610> I'll<00:04:36.060> hit<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.300> down<00:04:36.510> with<00:04:36.630> the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
through and I'll hit it down with the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.950 
through and I'll hit it down with the
hammer<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:41.000> obviously<00:04:42.000> I'm<00:04:42.330> not<00:04:42.510> too<00:04:42.690> worried

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
hammer and obviously I'm not too worried

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.330 
hammer and obviously I'm not too worried
about<00:04:42.990> wrecking<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.500> stem<00:04:43.770> because<00:04:43.980> the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
about wrecking the stem because the

00:04:44.340 --> 00:05:08.760 
about wrecking the stem because the
valve<00:04:44.520> heads<00:04:44.760> already<00:04:44.970> bent

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.640 

just<00:05:09.770> snap<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.220> bottom<00:05:10.520> of<00:05:10.640> it<00:05:10.730> off

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.140 

well<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:14.800> took<00:05:14.950> a<00:05:15.010> while<00:05:15.250> but<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:15.580> finally<00:05:16.000> got

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
well it took a while but I finally got

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.210 
well it took a while but I finally got
the<00:05:16.360> exhaust<00:05:16.690> valve<00:05:17.080> out<00:05:17.320> of<00:05:17.470> this<00:05:17.590> jug

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
the exhaust valve out of this jug

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.300 
the exhaust valve out of this jug
as<00:05:18.760> you<00:05:18.970> can<00:05:19.090> see<00:05:19.500> came<00:05:20.500> out<00:05:20.650> in<00:05:20.770> four<00:05:21.040> pieces

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
as you can see came out in four pieces

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.340 
as you can see came out in four pieces
one<00:05:22.030> of<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.180> pieces<00:05:22.570> was<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.960> one<00:05:23.110> that<00:05:23.260> you

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
one of the pieces was the one that you

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.430 
one of the pieces was the one that you
saw<00:05:23.590> break<00:05:24.100> off<00:05:24.310> in<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.520> previous<00:05:24.940> video<00:05:25.440> then

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
saw break off in the previous video then

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.960 
saw break off in the previous video then
I<00:05:26.530> had<00:05:26.680> to<00:05:26.770> cut<00:05:26.980> the<00:05:27.100> rest<00:05:27.280> of<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.550> stem<00:05:27.790> off

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
I had to cut the rest of the stem off

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.430 
I had to cut the rest of the stem off
and<00:05:28.180> that<00:05:28.270> came<00:05:28.480> down<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.750> bottom<00:05:29.230> and

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
and that came down the bottom and

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.950 
and that came down the bottom and
there's<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:30.340> stem<00:05:31.240> that<00:05:31.420> was<00:05:31.540> in<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.750> guide

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
there's the stem that was in the guide

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.020 
there's the stem that was in the guide
and<00:05:32.290> then<00:05:32.980> I<00:05:33.070> had<00:05:33.160> to<00:05:33.280> snap<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.730> head<00:05:33.850> of<00:05:33.940> the

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
and then I had to snap the head of the

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.770 
and then I had to snap the head of the
valve<00:05:34.240> off<00:05:34.480> to<00:05:35.440> finally<00:05:35.770> get<00:05:35.920> it<00:05:36.010> out<00:05:36.160> so<00:05:36.780> this

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
valve off to finally get it out so this

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.600 
valve off to finally get it out so this
morning<00:05:38.290> I<00:05:38.350> took<00:05:38.620> and<00:05:38.800> I<00:05:38.860> heated<00:05:39.160> up<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.400> guide

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
morning I took and I heated up the guide

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.870 
morning I took and I heated up the guide
and<00:05:39.820> everything<00:05:40.320> got<00:05:41.320> it<00:05:41.410> red-hot<00:05:41.760> tried<00:05:42.760> to

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
and everything got it red-hot tried to

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.700 
and everything got it red-hot tried to
drive<00:05:43.120> it<00:05:43.270> down<00:05:43.420> through<00:05:43.810> and<00:05:44.080> as<00:05:44.440> you<00:05:44.590> could

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
drive it down through and as you could

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.580 
drive it down through and as you could
see<00:05:45.010> it<00:05:45.160> just<00:05:45.310> kept<00:05:45.550> mushrooming<00:05:46.000> out<00:05:46.240> on<00:05:47.140> the

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
see it just kept mushrooming out on the

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.410 
see it just kept mushrooming out on the
stem<00:05:47.830> so<00:05:48.100> I<00:05:48.160> cut<00:05:48.370> the<00:05:48.490> stem<00:05:48.700> off<00:05:48.880> so<00:05:49.210> it<00:05:49.300> was

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
stem so I cut the stem off so it was

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.080 
stem so I cut the stem off so it was
flush<00:05:49.720> with<00:05:49.900> the<00:05:49.990> bottom<00:05:50.260> of<00:05:50.320> the<00:05:50.410> guide<00:05:50.590> and<00:05:51.090> I

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
flush with the bottom of the guide and I

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.940 
flush with the bottom of the guide and I
kept<00:05:52.300> driving<00:05:52.510> and<00:05:52.810> kept<00:05:53.350> driving<00:05:53.500> it<00:05:53.770> down

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
kept driving and kept driving it down

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.310 
kept driving and kept driving it down
and<00:05:54.250> it<00:05:55.120> wasn't<00:05:55.270> budging<00:05:55.540> or<00:05:55.780> anything<00:05:55.960> so<00:05:56.290> I

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
and it wasn't budging or anything so I

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.950 
and it wasn't budging or anything so I
snapped<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:56.860> head<00:05:57.040> off<00:05:57.300> and<00:05:58.300> I<00:05:58.420> turned<00:05:58.660> it<00:05:58.810> up

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
snapped the head off and I turned it up

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.990 
snapped the head off and I turned it up
and<00:05:59.470> it<00:05:59.620> broke<00:05:59.920> probably<00:06:00.400> about<00:06:00.550> a<00:06:00.580> quarter<00:06:00.970> of

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
and it broke probably about a quarter of

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.670 
and it broke probably about a quarter of
an<00:06:01.180> inch<00:06:01.270> down<00:06:01.420> inside<00:06:01.930> of<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.140> guide<00:06:02.350> so<00:06:02.650> I

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
an inch down inside of the guide so I

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.860 
an inch down inside of the guide so I
filled<00:06:03.100> it<00:06:03.190> with<00:06:03.220> some<00:06:03.460> oil<00:06:03.640> and<00:06:03.970> let<00:06:04.570> it<00:06:04.660> sit

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
filled it with some oil and let it sit

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.540 
filled it with some oil and let it sit
for<00:06:04.900> a<00:06:05.050> couple<00:06:05.110> hours<00:06:05.650> and<00:06:05.890> then<00:06:05.920> I<00:06:06.100> just<00:06:06.310> drove

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
for a couple hours and then I just drove

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.700 
for a couple hours and then I just drove
without<00:06:07.020> probably<00:06:08.020> didn't<00:06:08.200> even<00:06:08.320> take<00:06:08.530> me<00:06:08.680> a

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
without probably didn't even take me a

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.760 
without probably didn't even take me a
minute<00:06:09.070> and<00:06:09.550> it<00:06:09.670> came<00:06:09.880> right<00:06:09.940> out<00:06:10.180> so<00:06:10.750> I<00:06:11.170> don't

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
minute and it came right out so I don't

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.290 
minute and it came right out so I don't
know<00:06:11.830> if<00:06:11.890> it's<00:06:12.010> gonna<00:06:12.160> focus<00:06:12.610> well<00:06:12.820> but<00:06:13.030> as<00:06:13.150> you

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
know if it's gonna focus well but as you

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.840 
know if it's gonna focus well but as you
can<00:06:13.450> see<00:06:13.690> there's<00:06:13.900> a<00:06:13.930> lot<00:06:14.110> of<00:06:14.430> a<00:06:15.430> lot<00:06:15.700> of

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
can see there's a lot of a lot of

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.550 
can see there's a lot of a lot of
buildup<00:06:16.210> right<00:06:16.480> there<00:06:16.810> almost<00:06:17.200> looks<00:06:17.500> like

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
buildup right there almost looks like

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.260 
buildup right there almost looks like
flakes<00:06:17.950> of<00:06:18.220> metal<00:06:18.250> and<00:06:18.610> stuff<00:06:18.700> from<00:06:19.090> and

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
flakes of metal and stuff from and

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.740 
flakes of metal and stuff from and
pulling<00:06:19.630> out<00:06:19.780> more<00:06:20.260> or<00:06:20.320> less<00:06:20.440> likely<00:06:21.600> 20<00:06:22.600> ways

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
pulling out more or less likely 20 ways

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.780 
pulling out more or less likely 20 ways
I<00:06:22.930> find<00:06:23.140> get<00:06:23.350> that<00:06:23.500> out<00:06:23.680> so<00:06:23.920> I'll<00:06:24.490> look<00:06:24.640> around

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
I find get that out so I'll look around

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.030 
I find get that out so I'll look around
for<00:06:25.120> another<00:06:25.540> valve<00:06:25.870> and<00:06:26.230> then<00:06:26.530> I<00:06:26.620> should<00:06:26.920> be

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
for another valve and then I should be

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.320 
for another valve and then I should be
able<00:06:27.100> to<00:06:27.220> laughs<00:06:27.400> that<00:06:27.640> in<00:06:27.820> there<00:06:28.060> and<00:06:28.210> as<00:06:28.300> long

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
able to laughs that in there and as long

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.660 
able to laughs that in there and as long
as<00:06:28.510> the<00:06:28.720> guide<00:06:28.900> isn't<00:06:29.230> too<00:06:29.350> worn<00:06:29.650> out<00:06:29.830> from<00:06:30.490> the

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
as the guide isn't too worn out from the

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.280 
as the guide isn't too worn out from the
heating<00:06:31.060> and<00:06:31.240> having<00:06:31.600> all<00:06:31.720> that<00:06:31.840> rust<00:06:32.080> get

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
heating and having all that rust get

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.720 
heating and having all that rust get
pushed<00:06:32.740> through<00:06:33.010> there<00:06:33.220> and<00:06:33.310> everything

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
pushed through there and everything

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.530 
pushed through there and everything
should<00:06:34.360> be<00:06:34.540> able<00:06:34.600> to<00:06:34.720> reuse<00:06:35.050> it<00:06:36.420> well<00:06:37.420> it's

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
should be able to reuse it well it's

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.180 
should be able to reuse it well it's
been<00:06:37.720> a<00:06:37.750> while<00:06:38.050> but<00:06:38.350> we're<00:06:38.650> back<00:06:38.800> here<00:06:39.130> again

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
been a while but we're back here again

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.300 
been a while but we're back here again
with<00:06:39.520> the<00:06:39.780> 1946<00:06:40.780> gravely<00:06:41.230> brass<00:06:41.470> tag<00:06:41.800> model<00:06:42.160> L

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
with the 1946 gravely brass tag model L

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.840 
with the 1946 gravely brass tag model L
and<00:06:43.650> where<00:06:44.650> I<00:06:44.710> left<00:06:44.860> off<00:06:45.070> with<00:06:45.340> you<00:06:45.430> guys<00:06:45.580> last

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:45.850 
and where I left off with you guys last

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.760 
and where I left off with you guys last
time<00:06:46.180> I<00:06:46.450> finished<00:06:47.080> getting<00:06:47.200> the<00:06:47.350> exhaust

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
time I finished getting the exhaust

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.620 
time I finished getting the exhaust
valve<00:06:48.100> out<00:06:48.310> and<00:06:48.580> I<00:06:48.820> had<00:06:48.970> to<00:06:49.000> put<00:06:49.210> another<00:06:49.390> one

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
valve out and I had to put another one

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.720 
valve out and I had to put another one
in<00:06:49.660> so<00:06:50.140> as<00:06:50.260> you<00:06:50.440> can<00:06:50.530> see<00:06:50.800> I<00:06:51.010> have<00:06:51.640> another

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:51.730 
in so as you can see I have another

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.850 
in so as you can see I have another
valve<00:06:52.090> in<00:06:52.330> there<00:06:52.510> it's<00:06:52.660> been<00:06:52.810> lapped<00:06:53.050> in<00:06:53.320> and

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
valve in there it's been lapped in and

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.310 
valve in there it's been lapped in and
it<00:06:53.980> seats<00:06:54.250> really<00:06:54.520> nicely<00:06:55.050> it's<00:06:56.050> out<00:06:56.140> of<00:06:56.260> a

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:56.320 
it seats really nicely it's out of a

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.600 
it seats really nicely it's out of a
newer<00:06:56.500> style<00:06:56.860> when<00:06:57.070> it<00:06:57.160> doesn't<00:06:57.400> have<00:06:57.520> the

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
newer style when it doesn't have the

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.150 
newer style when it doesn't have the
cutout<00:06:58.230> in<00:06:59.230> the<00:06:59.350> center<00:06:59.620> of<00:06:59.650> the<00:06:59.770> valve<00:06:59.980> or

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 
cutout in the center of the valve or

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.670 
cutout in the center of the valve or
anything<00:07:00.750> so<00:07:01.750> that<00:07:01.810> worked<00:07:02.080> out<00:07:02.230> good

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
anything so that worked out good

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.860 
anything so that worked out good
I<00:07:02.710> was<00:07:03.370> also<00:07:03.670> planning<00:07:03.970> on<00:07:04.180> pulling<00:07:04.420> off<00:07:04.690> the

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:04.870 
I was also planning on pulling off the

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.720 
I was also planning on pulling off the
bottom<00:07:05.200> in<00:07:05.350> because<00:07:05.920> of<00:07:06.040> all<00:07:06.160> the<00:07:06.310> rust<00:07:06.490> that

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.730 
bottom in because of all the rust that

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.830 
bottom in because of all the rust that
was<00:07:06.910> in<00:07:07.060> it<00:07:07.180> on<00:07:07.630> the<00:07:08.140> flywheel

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
was in it on the flywheel

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.290 
was in it on the flywheel
right<00:07:10.320> there<00:07:11.040> you<00:07:11.400> can<00:07:11.520> probably<00:07:11.730> see<00:07:12.030> it<00:07:12.060> was

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
right there you can probably see it was

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.260 
right there you can probably see it was
kind<00:07:12.540> of<00:07:12.630> bumpy<00:07:13.400> blistered<00:07:14.400> rusts<00:07:14.850> but<00:07:15.060> it

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
kind of bumpy blistered rusts but it

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.090 
kind of bumpy blistered rusts but it
scraped<00:07:15.600> off<00:07:15.780> with<00:07:15.810> a<00:07:15.960> razor<00:07:16.169> pretty<00:07:16.620> good<00:07:16.860> and

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 
scraped off with a razor pretty good and

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.220 
scraped off with a razor pretty good and
down<00:07:17.639> on<00:07:17.760> the<00:07:17.850> inside<00:07:18.000> it<00:07:18.630> had<00:07:18.780> a<00:07:18.810> little<00:07:19.020> bit

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:19.230 
down on the inside it had a little bit

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.590 
down on the inside it had a little bit
of<00:07:19.260> goopy<00:07:19.710> oil<00:07:19.919> so<00:07:20.280> what<00:07:20.970> I<00:07:21.000> did<00:07:21.210> is<00:07:21.270> I<00:07:21.389> pulled

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 
of goopy oil so what I did is I pulled

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.780 
of goopy oil so what I did is I pulled
out<00:07:21.720> the<00:07:21.870> drain<00:07:22.110> plug<00:07:22.440> and<00:07:22.470> I<00:07:23.010> drained<00:07:23.700> a

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.790 
out the drain plug and I drained a

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.970 
out the drain plug and I drained a
little<00:07:24.030> bit<00:07:24.120> of<00:07:24.210> it<00:07:24.330> out<00:07:24.450> so<00:07:24.930> I'm<00:07:25.530> just<00:07:25.710> letting

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:25.980 
little bit of it out so I'm just letting

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.030 
little bit of it out so I'm just letting
it<00:07:26.070> tilt<00:07:26.850> up<00:07:27.030> in<00:07:27.410> week<00:07:28.410> out<00:07:28.590> for<00:07:28.860> a<00:07:28.889> little

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.040 
it tilt up in week out for a little

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.400 
it tilt up in week out for a little
while<00:07:29.450> so<00:07:30.450> I'm<00:07:30.540> not<00:07:30.660> going<00:07:30.840> to<00:07:30.900> bother<00:07:31.020> pulling

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.410 
while so I'm not going to bother pulling

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.990 
while so I'm not going to bother pulling
off<00:07:31.650> the<00:07:31.830> bottom<00:07:32.160> end<00:07:32.310> because<00:07:32.520> it's<00:07:32.639> not<00:07:32.820> as

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
off the bottom end because it's not as

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.730 
off the bottom end because it's not as
bad<00:07:33.419> as<00:07:33.480> I<00:07:33.780> was<00:07:33.870> really<00:07:34.139> figuring<00:07:34.470> it<00:07:34.620> was

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
bad as I was really figuring it was

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.310 
bad as I was really figuring it was
gonna<00:07:34.889> be<00:07:35.130> so<00:07:36.060> what<00:07:36.210> we're<00:07:36.360> gonna<00:07:36.419> do<00:07:36.750> is<00:07:37.139> we're

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:37.320 
gonna be so what we're gonna do is we're

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.020 
gonna be so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:07:37.410> finish<00:07:37.680> getting<00:07:38.220> this<00:07:38.370> jug<00:07:38.639> ready<00:07:38.880> to

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.030 
gonna finish getting this jug ready to

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.850 
gonna finish getting this jug ready to
go<00:07:39.350> unfortunately

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 
go unfortunately

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.159 
go unfortunately
this<00:07:41.280> bolt<00:07:41.580> hole<00:07:41.790> here<00:07:42.120> stripped<00:07:42.540> out<00:07:42.720> or<00:07:42.900> the

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:43.169 
this bolt hole here stripped out or the

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:45.680 
this bolt hole here stripped out or the
exhaust<00:07:43.530> manifold<00:07:44.130> but<00:07:44.310> I<00:07:44.370> have<00:07:44.580> these<00:07:44.790> five

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:45.690 
exhaust manifold but I have these five

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:50.990 
exhaust manifold but I have these five
16<00:07:46.110> 18<00:07:46.650> lock<00:07:47.550> nuts<00:07:47.880> really<00:07:48.660> thin<00:07:48.990> ones<00:07:49.200> and<00:07:50.000> or

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 
16 18 lock nuts really thin ones and or

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.469 
16 18 lock nuts really thin ones and or
jam<00:07:51.419> nuts<00:07:51.660> actually<00:07:52.110> not<00:07:52.410> lock<00:07:52.590> nuts<00:07:53.090> so<00:07:54.090> I

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 
jam nuts actually not lock nuts so I

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:59.950 
jam nuts actually not lock nuts so I
could<00:07:55.440> stick<00:07:55.710> that<00:07:55.740> underneath<00:07:56.340> there<00:07:56.700> and

00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.540 

it'll<00:08:00.960> line<00:08:01.200> up<00:08:01.380> right<00:08:01.620> with<00:08:01.740> the<00:08:01.800> hole<00:08:02.070> so

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.550 
it'll line up right with the hole so

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.520 
it'll line up right with the hole so
that<00:08:02.700> way<00:08:02.790> I<00:08:02.820> can<00:08:02.970> get<00:08:03.180> a<00:08:03.210> good<00:08:04.020> thread<00:08:04.380> on<00:08:04.500> it

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:04.530 
that way I can get a good thread on it

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.400 
that way I can get a good thread on it
and<00:08:04.830> I<00:08:04.860> can<00:08:05.040> still<00:08:05.250> get<00:08:05.370> my<00:08:05.550> head<00:08:05.729> torque<00:08:06.000> down

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:06.410 
and I can still get my head torque down

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.260 
and I can still get my head torque down
so<00:08:07.410> that's<00:08:07.470> the<00:08:07.620> plan<00:08:07.889> at<00:08:08.040> least<00:08:08.250> so<00:08:09.180> I'll

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:09.270 
so that's the plan at least so I'll

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.030 
so that's the plan at least so I'll
finish<00:08:09.419> getting<00:08:09.750> the<00:08:09.870> oil<00:08:09.900> drained<00:08:10.470> and<00:08:10.710> then

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:11.040 
finish getting the oil drained and then

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.690 
finish getting the oil drained and then
we<00:08:11.100> can<00:08:11.220> get<00:08:11.310> the<00:08:11.430> jug<00:08:11.669> back<00:08:11.880> on<00:08:12.120> to<00:08:12.270> the<00:08:12.389> engine
