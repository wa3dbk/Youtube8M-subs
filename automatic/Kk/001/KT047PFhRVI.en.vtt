you can see is a really good for turf a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.789 
you can see is a really good for turf a
football<00:01:19.299> training<00:01:19.659> or<00:01:20.020> whatever<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.680> want

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.870 
football training or whatever you want
to<00:01:20.829> do<00:01:21.009> indoor<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:24.189> have<00:01:24.400> really<00:01:24.759> nice

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
to do indoor we have really nice

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.109 
to do indoor we have really nice
condition<00:01:25.710> probably<00:01:26.710> one<00:01:26.829> about<00:01:27.040> once<00:01:27.340> and

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
condition probably one about once and

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.420 
condition probably one about once and
those<00:01:29.020> two<00:01:29.229> raters<00:01:29.439> do<00:01:29.680> not<00:01:29.829> come<00:01:30.040> with<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.220> box

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
those two raters do not come with a box

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.050 
those two raters do not come with a box
but<00:01:30.790> everything<00:01:31.119> else<00:01:31.329> has<00:01:31.450> its<00:01:31.780> original<00:01:32.200> box

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
but everything else has its original box

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.210 
but everything else has its original box
so<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.299> first<00:01:34.479> pair<00:01:34.780> with<00:01:35.049> a<00:01:35.079> box<00:01:35.380> we're<00:01:36.100> going

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
so the first pair with a box we're going

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.240 
so the first pair with a box we're going
to<00:01:36.280> be<00:01:36.430> eating<00:01:36.509> 2005<00:01:38.189> 2013's<00:01:41.100> really<00:01:42.100> nice

flaws on these like so separation
anything<00:02:11.580> biggest<00:02:12.580> flaw<00:02:12.820> probably<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.750> little

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
anything biggest flaw probably a little

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.570 
anything biggest flaw probably a little
red<00:02:14.410> stain<00:02:15.330> right<00:02:16.330> there<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.490> easily

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
red stain right there but it can easily

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.060 
red stain right there but it can easily
be<00:02:18.820> cleaned<00:02:19.060> off<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:21.130> fine<00:02:21.460> 13<00:02:25.440> next<00:02:26.440> up<00:02:26.560> pair

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
be cleaned off so fine 13 next up pair

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.860 
be cleaned off so fine 13 next up pair
of<00:02:27.310> jordan<00:02:27.850> spizike<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:30.480> not<00:02:31.480> too<00:02:31.690> many

people know a ton about this physics and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.480 
people know a ton about this physics and
actually<00:02:39.670> pretty<00:02:39.850> cool<00:02:40.210> shoe<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.190> can<00:02:42.280> see
