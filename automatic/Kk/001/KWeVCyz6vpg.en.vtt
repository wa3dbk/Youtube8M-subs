used to work for a switching company I'm

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.189 
used to work for a switching company I'm
running<00:00:23.130> into<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> lot<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.580> clients<00:00:23.880> who<00:00:24.199> use

automatic<00:00:25.710> provisioning<00:00:26.400> where<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:26.670> plug

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
automatic provisioning where they plug

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.300 
automatic provisioning where they plug
in<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.359> VoIP<00:00:27.599> phone<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.109> then<00:00:28.199> based<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
in a VoIP phone and then based on the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.070 
in a VoIP phone and then based on the
mac<00:00:29.880> address<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.390> VLAN<00:00:30.660> tag<00:00:30.900> that

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
mac address and VLAN tag that

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.709 
mac address and VLAN tag that
automatically<00:00:31.590> migrate<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.940> phone<00:00:33.270> into<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
automatically migrate the phone into the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.430 
automatically migrate the phone into the
voice<00:00:33.930> VLAN<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.940> make<00:00:36.510> your<00:00:36.840> Linux

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
voice VLAN so you can make your Linux

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.790 
voice VLAN so you can make your Linux
box<00:00:37.760> look<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.360> voice<00:00:39.629> over<00:00:39.809> IP<00:00:40.050> phone<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
box look like a voice over IP phone and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
box look like a voice over IP phone and
get<00:00:40.980> bumped<00:00:41.340> into<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.700> voice<00:00:41.820> VLAN<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.960> this

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
get bumped into the voice VLAN so this

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.450 
get bumped into the voice VLAN so this
is<00:00:43.140> great<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.590> getting<00:00:43.890> past<00:00:44.190> knack

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
is great for getting past knack

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.760 
is great for getting past knack
solutions<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.149> then<00:00:45.539> generally<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.649> know

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
solutions and then generally you know

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.069 
solutions and then generally you know
since<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.219> most<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.550> your<00:00:47.760> clients<00:00:48.300> all<00:00:48.899> of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
since you most of your clients all of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.330 
since you most of your clients all of
your<00:00:49.200> phones<00:00:49.379> need<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.770> talk<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> call

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
your phones need to talk to the call

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.340 
your phones need to talk to the call
manager<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.329> talk<00:00:51.660> straight<00:00:51.989> into<00:00:52.320> the

manager you can talk straight into the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.080 
manager you can talk straight into the
internal<00:00:52.800> DMZ<00:00:53.280> where<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> servers<00:00:53.969> are

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
internal DMZ where all the servers are

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.090 
internal DMZ where all the servers are
because<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> call<00:00:54.629> managers<00:00:55.079> right<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:55.949> all

admin or local system that's even better

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
admin or local system that's even better
because<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.439> next<00:01:40.710> thing<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.070> do<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
because the next thing that I do is I

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.550 
because the next thing that I do is I
look<00:01:42.090> around<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.509> network<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
look around the network for that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.609 
look around the network for that
specific<00:01:43.890> user<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.509> machine<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.590> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
specific user on that machine so you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.109 
specific user on that machine so you
just<00:01:46.920> script<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.549> these<00:01:47.729> different<00:01:47.939> things

to look around the network to figure out

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.340

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
where that domain admins box is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.109

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
thing that I didn't get on my slide

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.780 
thing that I didn't get on my slide
someone<00:02:41.709> asked<00:02:42.040> me<00:02:42.099> about<00:02:42.370> because<00:02:42.609> they<00:02:42.700> were

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
someone asked me about because they were

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.490 
someone asked me about because they were
like<00:02:42.909> well<00:02:43.120> when<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:43.390> do<00:02:43.629> that<00:02:43.840> with<00:02:43.989> mcafee

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
like well when you do that with mcafee

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.599 
like well when you do that with mcafee
the<00:02:44.620> first<00:02:44.829> thing<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.099> you<00:02:45.220> need<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.430> do<00:02:45.519> is

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
the first thing is you need to do is

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.059 
the first thing is you need to do is
escalate<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.480> system<00:02:46.930> right<00:02:47.109> same<00:02:47.859> thing

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
escalate the system right same thing

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.349 
escalate the system right same thing
works<00:02:48.220> for<00:02:48.489> Symantec<00:02:48.940> endpoint<00:02:49.060> protection

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
works for Symantec endpoint protection

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.479 
works for Symantec endpoint protection
you<00:02:50.109> have<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.319> escalate<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.889> system<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:51.430> that

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
you have to escalate to system so that

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.860 
you have to escalate to system so that
you<00:02:51.639> can<00:02:51.790> start<00:02:51.970> trying<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.269> kill<00:02:52.540> all<00:02:52.690> this

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
you can start trying to kill all this

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.970 
you can start trying to kill all this
stuff<00:02:53.079> off<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:54.129> you<00:02:54.190> kill<00:02:54.579> all<00:02:54.609> this<00:02:54.909> stuff<00:02:55.180> off

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
stuff off so you kill all this stuff off

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.349 
stuff off so you kill all this stuff off
and<00:02:57.659> after<00:02:58.659> a<00:02:58.689> while<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.200> restarts<00:02:59.939> so<00:03:00.939> you'll

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
and after a while it restarts so you'll

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.599 
and after a while it restarts so you'll
have<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:01.689> unhook<00:03:02.139> the<00:03:02.680> DLLs<00:03:03.189> that<00:03:03.370> are<00:03:03.459> in

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
have to unhook the DLLs that are in

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.089 
have to unhook the DLLs that are in
memory<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.359> stop<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:05.049> okay<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:05.829> didn't

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
memory to stop that okay and I didn't

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.440 
memory to stop that okay and I didn't
put<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.459> my<00:03:06.579> slide<00:03:06.849> but<00:03:07.090> if<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.269> holler

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.750 
do that okay another trick that I just

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
learned about mcafee was there are names

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.150 
learned about mcafee was there are names
of<00:03:16.120> excluded<00:03:16.720> files<00:03:16.989> specifically<00:03:17.859> by<00:03:18.099> name
