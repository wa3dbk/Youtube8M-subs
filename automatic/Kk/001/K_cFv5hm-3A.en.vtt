00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:14.090
 The figure of the horse has improved 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.090
 The fact that the wing is attached is still the order of the horse 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.609
 Because the curse is not over 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.720
 Eagle Chan it island 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.380
 Ummm 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.689
 Seriously in the sister Ma 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.689
 When you do 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.670
 Come back 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.060
 Taking tired to murda date smoothly 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.630
 The training menu is complete 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.460
 Middle also because you have moved firmly of You go back to the movement of the time we really 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:58.660
 this time 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.660
 There is a feeling that the better one can move 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:07.730
 It wasn't that so tired that I could use it in good condition , but for the Derby well 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.510
 I was able to adjust 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.380
 The movement is that 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:20.290
 Good I think it was very good 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:24.480
 In the united because it is not a chance early as stables 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.730
 I 'm going to challenge everyone 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.800
 It became a little hot though 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.940
 The condition of the horse is good 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:41.020
 As you can see if you can see the watch of the run- off clock , only the book can be done 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.020
 Well I will say that there will be more than the last 4 clothes 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.630
 I since they are already thinking Fu 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.630
 There is hope that a little good horse racing will not be done 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:59.550
 Well, or rather have been able to I guess the body I do I say while use 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.180
 This is better than the trial. 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.820
 The answer is that 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:10.940
 Yes it there a response of wonder if the state is getting better 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:15.920
 Well, that's the second time in Amagasaki Jockey , and I can put it in my hands rather than the previous one. 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.070
 Also I want to work hard now hopefully part it 's such a say? 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.070
 Yes 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.410
 Well, it's the first condition of Bra's condition , but when you lose it 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.710
 This a little bit 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.180
 I think learned Naa run if Kigaere it if fighting spirit is put 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.050
 Well that I because the next sound 1006 I was strong Well crank up also possibly one shot 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.570
 I had thought that there 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.560
 We put out a really ne of another seminal full Watari King O power I will be the 33rd Derby 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.720
 that 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:49.150
 Nehonto in to something Anoman's it from officials made was good a child of the armor and place Ganino 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.150
 To over I would not go unless issued the goodness of the neighboring districts 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.880
 Hmm 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.870
 The order is reasonable 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.360
 Chanting 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.660
 I have seen 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.660
 End girl 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.050
 First Well young person meeting 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.050
 Fan Nana 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.830
 Good fun 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.660
 Performance 1 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.690
 I think that I want to raise 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.530
 everyone 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.530
 Please be nice to meet 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:35.120
 I think that I really became powerful from Haneda Akira and I was running 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:40.310
 Given good fighting spirit up there in the Well a little 1 week ago Nde also outright chase has really changed 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.220
 This time it was a bit too early for the horse to come back as it wasn't so picky 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.000
 so 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:50.790
 Let's make sure that our sisters are in good spirits and that the horse races 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.250
 I firmly beat it in and this book chase has moved firmly 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.770
 Say Do me firmly finished with this 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.770
 I think that there will be about last year's work 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.920
 After all I just can not be a little fortunate because it has only become a warrior 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:11.260
 I'm tired and so on 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.020
 That amount tomorrow is a little And this intermediate is went to emphasis that you unplug the firm tired 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.940
 I took it 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.720
 Nde had remained looseness 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.880
 Well there every sound and blue tree firmly that one again 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.030
 In I think I If you do not have to raise the 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:30.160
 We pile on what you say so 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:33.009
 issue I think it has been a bit late and I think I want to watch it additionally 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.580
 Since the vertical feelings still did not fit in there 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:40.120
 Although a little this time I thought firmly slowed more and say the future of the little 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.910
 I have sold it, but in terms of movement Aria's 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.849
 Rise 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.529
 Because it was a movement to feel 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.529
 I think it's a passing score though 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:55.260
 I've come to really well I about the first time Tteyuu 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.460
 I think it's really good to bring it to the peak 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.360
 Yes 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.720
 Because I had finished making long body hair 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.870
 Yes, the extent to put a yell 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.010
 During this also name tool 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.130
 Jockey is not suitable for Iwata-kun because it is a type that can be used for healing 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.130
 that
