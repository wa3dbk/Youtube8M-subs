00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:30.210
 [music] 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.420
 it's not fair why are we all the time 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.269
 score but we didn't score a single goal 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.910
 we just play as a team and you all 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:51.510
 quarrel more on the field how to become 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:53.970
 this team will play more food 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.569
 level and said that we have no team 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.810
 but we live and we play no worse 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.450
 why then did they win 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.130
 the team is persistent training before 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.920

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:18.950
 our team is one and it means 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.950

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:50.909
 [music] 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.069
 So 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:59.879
 reliable goalkeepers have a fast striker 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:08.489
 there is an impassable defense there is also the most 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:09.390
 team spirit is also a team 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:16.030
 ready to play 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.030

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.549

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:37.360
 [music] 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.820
 win hard 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.520
 it's good but it's better to be real 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:56.790
 by team 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:56.790
