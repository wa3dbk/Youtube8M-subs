00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.519
 hello everyone and welcome here asus 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.420
 today the most incredible replay 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.150
 my whole career 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.440
 clash of clouds we will change the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.449
 format of the video because there I believe 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.670
 that it stops with the strategies on 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.369
 this attack even if careful 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.590
 since it has to attack well it's 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.119
 just amazing 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.949
 so to put that back into his 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.180
 context 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.430
 this seaweed at the bottom word so a balloon 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.710
 three mastiffs mastiffs in camps 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.550
 a level 5 golem in the castle of 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.930
 clans 18 balloons some sappers 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.399
 some wizard to prepare the way 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.590
 normally I will see that it happens 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.809
 not like that a few million for 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.379
 clean giants for the beginning of the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.059
 tacc and so people is not on the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.640
 make up 100% classic one usually 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.640
 we have five tank or two flaps but 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.350
 three mastiffs a golem is too much 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.789
 ugly there for once it's going to happen 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.850
 if the mauls his level 1 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.950
 like the whole opposite the sound that at the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.779
 level 6 it can pass 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.759
 good but watch out these stone parks 

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:20.189
 it really is really an attack of 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.380
 improbable madness one sees that the queen and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.659
 fascinates and is s expose that means 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.639
 that it will be enough to break the wall to kill it 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.419
 so nobody for thirty-two fate 

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:32.219
 to jump it's played well so we can 

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:36.270
 have a lightning for the content of the 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:38.159
 clan castle and 3h for removal 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.450
 balloons and molosses except that 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.909
 you'll see 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.090
 little surprise me I do not tell you I 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.229
 you say no I put the replay 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.759
 and discussed after I believe that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.859
 reindeer to say a good little music 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.539
 and that will be enough for you 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.429
 understand the magic of this attack 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.969
 to put it back anyway in his 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.139
 context 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:01.559
 it was the first attack goba words of 

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:02.700
 michael with us here I believe when 

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:05.840
 there is nothing to say just look at 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.840
 this art 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.140
 that's me I think it's okay 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.910
 comment 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:11.140
 there is not much to say it was 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.150
 it was just magic 1 go down word 100 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.980
 fate of a rage a no need it serves that 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.040
 is worthless one alone will suffice widely 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.150
 to shave the village so I present 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.040
 there are still very good points 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.480
 but already at his three stars so bravo 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.000
 to the three stars without using their age 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.410
 against the village of Quebec households that 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.210
 is not disgusting the harkis that this 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.680
 in solar mode we have integers 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.340
 who are not disgusting level if it's not 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.270
 so badly that the archers' tricks and the 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.340
 wizard towers are not max is 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.220
 okay but honestly what has 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.710
 really been very well done is that 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.360
 each balloon was protected by a 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.500
 molosse almost everyone attack 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.810
 so obviously there was a little bit of 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.210
 luck on some aspects but when 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.830
 even the very good point is that the 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.840
 mollahs the molosses are really tank 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.860
 and all the damage to the balloons and 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.950
 that's why he has not needed them 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.120
 fate of rage I hope you like it 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.540
 tell me what you think about them in 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.280
 comments 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.540
 a pretty magical attack it is not seen 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.260
 every day in attack like that so 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.060
 you should take advantage 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.610
 I hope to present you some more 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.050
 michael starts at 100 Shari'a and 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.300
 starts to attack well in bales 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.919
 So the next ones and wounds 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.729
 will be cleaner from his wife in all 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.210
 surprising case but his pass is there one 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.210
 will be very soon
