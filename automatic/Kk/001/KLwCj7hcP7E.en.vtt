00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.140
 So here we are to give the bells of this year and that to good 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.340
 sure will be more eye-catching than the issues that are right now in the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.639
 Sun Gate 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.409
 so he had taken the plenary at the right time that is to say 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:17.420
 at 12 in the seven minutes you will be ready to see the chimes 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:18.909
 live racing 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:23.129
 but before and to bid farewell to 2008 we will do it with the best images 

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:24.980
 of the year 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.789
 10 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.349
 of 2008 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.699
 we hope you like these bells 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.699
 and happy 2009 for all 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.130
 in position number 10 we find Pedro Matador 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.360
 and Ángela Fernández Noriega at the rallysprint of Ribamontán al Mar 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.700
 saving with a spin what looked like everything on the fringe 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.510
 that added to the fact of doing it with nocturnality and treachery has allowed them 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.510
 enter the top ten 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.200
 everyone 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.480
 it is not weird 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.480
 r 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.020
 in 9 he has many pieces that are 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.180
 in this sense 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.430
 which in the Subaru CDs in Guernica left us this button that 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.510
 although in the video it does not impress so much the truth that hid between the 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.510
 matojos put the creeps 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.510
 the number eight is for the ex-globalist xevi pons 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.030
 condition take care of your right disputing the stuffing to the ram 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.140
 a hard rally duty for the viewer because of bad weather but those who 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.870
 We advance in cold mud, wind and incessant rain we could enjoy 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.970
 which for me was the best rally of the year with much difference 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.080
 We showed that the road does not always have to be brown 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.080
 Sometimes it is also green 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.749
 do not 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.889
 the seventh place Spain and a net curtain freedoms 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.349
 marking is a hug with two cojones in him they left the infinite cantabria 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.079
 showing that they are from the old school that we like so much 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.009
 the gutters 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.729
 I do not want to forget about Chabelo hike Ivan's partner on many occasions 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:53.049
 to the right and to the one who says especially the best for 2009 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:07.979
 Aviniese is waiting anxiously the gutter what to say of Jesus Manuel 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:08.869
 ferreiro 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:13.099
 in the ces we see the star of the wheel that vibrates the new generations and 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.129
 that excited 30 meters no doubt another crack 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.959
 i co-piloted by Roberto Lorenzo and throwing himself for the treacherous descent of 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.700
 bring we touch the guardaraíles 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.589
 funes mori 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.589
 makes it clear that you can not go any further 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.149
 in the 5 'we have the example of what is and the sheet 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:48.040
 the visibility will be Sanchez 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.930
 they came to run the rallysprint of land of santillana with his opel kadett 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.600
 he poked and left us several samples of the true meaning of thoroughly with faith 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:58.709
 as proof this take 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.929
 half the track my house in oscar bread and cut 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.559
 the world 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.090
 if we look for an intermediate point between July and August 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.810
 we found to smoke such today that here cristina liébana in the position number 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.919
 four 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.340
 always spectacular with his bmw in carranza gave us this beautiful 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.340
 skid in the fanb with one another 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:47.559
 the third step of the podium waiting and piggied in one of its many barriers 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.270
 in the rally of Renedo were the protagonists of a shot to frame 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.449
 a ten in technique a ten in execution and other ten between the grafía 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.240
 the second place is for Pedro Ortiz better known as Coyote and for that reason 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.309
 so Sunday 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.209
 for those who do not know you can say chairs of the real born in France 

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:17.969
 it allows that coyotes to the saxo what rajoy has no job and well 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.670
 in the rallysprint of just pulled out of the stable top hat 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.189
 now 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:37.990
 but what 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.979
 we will see 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.779
 I the first place in the best shot of the year 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.590

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:50.739
 Cantabrian rallysprint May and in his first pass two crazy Eliseo Perez 

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:54.899
 at the wheel josé angel pérez to the notebook delighted us with a work of 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:58.279
 art that has served to keep you first from start to finish
