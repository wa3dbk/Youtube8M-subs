it is 624 meters long it's funnily
enough<00:00:47.050> of<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.320> singletrack<00:00:47.710> tunnel

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320

metropolitan colliery leasts the tunnel

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.169 
metropolitan colliery leasts the tunnel
for<00:00:52.300> years<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.980> is<00:00:54.190> now<00:00:54.339> used<00:00:54.579> as<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.819> dam

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
for years and it is now used as a dam

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:56.849 
for years and it is now used as a dam
like<00:00:55.420> deep<00:00:55.659> in<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.899> tunnel<00:00:56.050> so<00:00:56.409> that's<00:00:56.679> why<00:00:56.829> I

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
like deep in the tunnel so that's why I

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.470 
like deep in the tunnel so that's why I
go<00:00:57.129> too<00:00:57.190> far<00:00:57.550> necessarily<00:00:58.210> want<00:00:58.359> to<00:00:58.390> go

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
go too far necessarily want to go

interesting<00:01:11.500> that<00:01:11.740> I've<00:01:11.890> actually<00:01:12.040> read

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
interesting that I've actually read

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.580 
interesting that I've actually read
about<00:01:13.000> this<00:01:13.150> tunnel<00:01:13.330> which<00:01:13.630> I<00:01:13.930> hope<00:01:14.229> it's<00:01:14.380> true

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
about this tunnel which I hope it's true

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.969 
about this tunnel which I hope it's true
but<00:01:14.830> I<00:01:14.890> don't<00:01:15.100> think<00:01:15.220> it<00:01:15.370> is<00:01:15.490> because<00:01:16.979> yeah

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
but I don't think it is because yeah

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.550 
but I don't think it is because yeah
they<00:01:18.370> say<00:01:18.640> that<00:01:18.820> there<00:01:19.000> is<00:01:19.180> a<00:01:19.210> steam<00:01:19.960> train<00:01:20.290> or

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
they say that there is a steam train or

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.130 
they say that there is a steam train or
steam<00:01:20.860> local<00:01:21.160> something<00:01:21.430> like<00:01:21.640> that<00:01:21.990> deep<00:01:22.990> in

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
steam local something like that deep in

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.500 
steam local something like that deep in
this<00:01:23.260> tunnel<00:01:23.530> under<00:01:23.980> water<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:25.240> probably

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
this tunnel under water that's probably

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.840 
this tunnel under water that's probably
not<00:01:25.660> true<00:01:25.840> but<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.170> know<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:27.640> could<00:01:27.760> only

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
not true but you know one could only

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.610 
not true but you know one could only
hope<00:01:28.000> it<00:01:28.690> could<00:01:28.870> make<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.200> very<00:01:29.320> interesting

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
hope it could make it very interesting

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.840 
hope it could make it very interesting
at<00:01:29.890> least<00:01:29.950> it'll<00:01:30.130> be<00:01:30.190> a<00:01:30.250> train<00:01:30.460> in<00:01:30.580> this<00:01:30.670> vlog

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
at least it'll be a train in this vlog

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.080 
at least it'll be a train in this vlog
and<00:01:31.230> as<00:01:32.230> I<00:01:33.100> had<00:01:33.190> said<00:01:33.370> in<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.610> other<00:01:33.730> parts

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
and as I had said in the other parts

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.690 
and as I had said in the other parts
these<00:01:34.510> tunnels<00:01:34.960> are<00:01:35.170> also<00:01:36.010> known<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.460> be

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
these tunnels are also known to be

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.360 
these tunnels are also known to be
haunted<00:01:36.850> due<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.600> number<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:38.200> deaths<00:01:38.500> so

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
haunted due to a number of deaths so

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.810 
haunted due to a number of deaths so
there's<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:40.140> face<00:01:41.140> of<00:01:41.760> metropolitan<00:01:42.760> tunnel

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
there's the face of metropolitan tunnel

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.420 
there's the face of metropolitan tunnel

and also seen in a couple of videos of
this<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.630> sort<00:02:34.170> from<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.769> steam<00:02:35.160> or<00:02:35.370> smoke<00:02:35.580> of

this is sort from the steam or smoke of

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.300 
this is sort from the steam or smoke of
steam<00:02:36.239> trains<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.260> that's<00:02:37.470> something

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310

steam trains so that's something
exciting<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.480> tracks<00:02:39.750> actually<00:02:40.019> look<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
exciting and the tracks actually look a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.259 
exciting and the tracks actually look a
bit<00:02:40.290> more<00:02:40.440> dry<00:02:40.739> here<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.819> what<00:02:42.030> I'm<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.239> to

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
bit more dry here so what I'm going to

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.490 
bit more dry here so what I'm going to
do<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.600> actually<00:02:42.810> go<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.290> little<00:02:43.380> bit

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500

do is actually go in a little bit
further<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.700> second<00:02:45.030> after<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.239> take<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> few

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
