00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.189 

which<00:04:32.550> looks<00:04:32.789> almost<00:04:33.000> exactly<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.690> same<00:04:33.990> as

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
which looks almost exactly the same as

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.969 
which looks almost exactly the same as
the<00:04:34.349> deluxe<00:04:35.629> so<00:04:36.629> Deluxe<00:04:36.960> has<00:04:37.110> two<00:04:37.319> patties<00:04:37.740> oh

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.890 
the deluxe so Deluxe has two patties oh
this<00:04:38.699> special<00:04:39.120> is<00:04:39.180> basically<00:04:39.509> probably<00:04:39.840> the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
this special is basically probably the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.309
