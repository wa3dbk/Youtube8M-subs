00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.490
 very good I'm nico and in this video 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.830
 we are going to talk about aspects that have to be 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.010
 keep in mind if you are robbed you lose 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.900
 buy or sell an iphone ipad or ipod 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.300
 touch with the new security system 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.030
 anti-theft device 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.590
 it's very important since you can spend 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.410
 for example five hundred euros in a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.350
 second-hand iphone and if this one is 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.200
 associated with an air of apple you can not 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.960
 neither turn it on or activate it 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.850
 you will be without the 500 euros is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.500
 advisable to share this video by 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.020
 social networks for various reasons 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.450
 to avoid losing money as the case 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.670
 that we just explained to you 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.770
 deter the thieves since they will not be able to 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.130
 use it in case you lose the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.129
 device there are many possibilities of 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.980
 that they return it to you and if you are going to give away 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.899
 or sell we explain how to do it already 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.489
 we had spoken in another video although 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.309
 want to take a look we leave you a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.980
 link of the new system that implements 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.620
 Apple from ios 7 called 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.140
 activation of security that is no more 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.980
 to activate the option to search for my 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.290
 iphone with an apple idea and with this 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.450
 we would have activated the best system by 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.460
 theft or loss of the world but also 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.990
 there are other drawbacks if we are not 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.610
 aware of some situations 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.430
 here we all have our 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.560
 responsibility let's imagine 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.530
 several situations we started with the most 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.830
 important to imagine that someone 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.659
 steal the device can occur several 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.659
 casuistics for example that we have 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:41.220
 On this security code 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.020
 case they will not be able to use it and so far 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.350
 could be solved by restoring from 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.259
 itunes in faith mode but now if you 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.259
 try to activate it will connect to the 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:57.560
 apple servers and will ask the air of 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:00.049
 Apple and the password associated with icloud 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.869
 and as we do not know you can not go from 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.689
 that screen in this case we will stay 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.569
 without iphone but good if this diffuses 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.390
 message this deter the thieves and 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.459
 so they will avoid stealing it if they do not 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.319
 let's have security code the thief 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.930
 you can use it but at the moment you 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.450
 you connect to the internet either by wifi 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.519
 or putting in a sim card with access 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.130
 to mobile data 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.260
 we could locate it through icloud 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.800
 dot com 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.060
 from there we can 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.160
 locate it on a map or send a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.010
 message to communicate with the thief 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.680
 put a security code delete the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.290
 device or even activate the mode 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.300
 loss imagine you've lost it 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.600
 here we can also try 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.870
 locate it from icloud.com for example 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.570
 in case we think that we have left it in 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.240
 the car and so locate it on the map and 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.190
 communicate by message with which 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.860
 I found it offering a 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.680
 reward for the return or in case 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.410
 that can not connect on the internet 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.640
 as you will not be able to use the most 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.160
 It is probable that I will deliver it to the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.440
 police station in either of the two cases 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.020
 It would be convenient to notify the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.810
 police or put a complaint so that 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.120
 the email is reflected in case someone 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.410
 returns it or if the thief is caught with the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.810
 phone 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.750
 if someone wants to buy an iphone ipad 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.090
 ipod touch second-hand first 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.850
 what the buyer would have to do is 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.760
 require that you have the option disabled 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.120
 of icloud is to say that it is not associated 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.430
 to no apple air for example if 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.770
 we buy by ebay it would be convenient that 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.320
 put in the advertisement description that 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.840
 the device is not associated with any 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.000
 support air in case you already 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.670
 we have bought and appear associated there 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.300
 to contact the seller so that 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.900
 about that partner from the page 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.210
 icloud.com 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.210
 fink remotely 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.510
 if we are going to sell or give away one 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.549
 we will have to do the same or 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.610
 enter within settings 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.209
 icloud and in the bottom remove 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.209
 the account 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.730
 It is important that you do not eliminate 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.010
 manually contacts calendars 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.560
 reminders documents sequences 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.050
 shared or any other data of 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.870
 icloud while you are connected to your 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.760
 icloud account since the content 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.190
 it will also be removed from the servers 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.130
 of icloud and all devices 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.490
 associated with that account instead of doing 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.490
 that the best thing is to enter into adjustments 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.490
 general 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.480
 to reset 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.880
 and delete settings content or else 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.820
 enter the icloud.com page and 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.289
 erase device and then it 's associate 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.749
 the 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.300
 if you are going to take it to repair to a 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:05.610
 apple store you must also turn off 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.949
 icloud because if they do not return the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.080
 device and in case you already 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.599
 you have taken and you have not given 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.509
 you can also disassociate it 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.189
 from the dotcom cloud page in 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.550
 if you do not remember the 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:22.020
 your aid and apple password 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:26.369
 you can reset the page 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.839
