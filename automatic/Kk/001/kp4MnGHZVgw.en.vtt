00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.460
 or 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
 we 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.390
 m 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.110
 hello and thank you for granting this 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.419
 interview for cannon then April 2 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.610
 take out your next movie that's a lot 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.809
 of noise right now salomon theme is 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.850
 what you can tell us a few words 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.320
 on linen sort of how she 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.420
 film instinct film that will ask 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.530
 a long preparation is long 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.290
 reflection since I'm talking about a subject 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.809
 I know well I was lucky 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.239
 to have this child with five women 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.449
 different and so I told myself that 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.869
 it could make a good movie subject 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.479
 so this is a movie about love on the 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:05.150
 dead of his craft on the love we 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.790
 can wear a woman on love that we 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.840
 can bring to his boyfriend and love 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.990
 that one can bring to one's children 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.090
 so that's what I tried to 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.320
 treat as usual maybe when 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.179
 we have a very important place at 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.950
 casting so how did it come to you 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:24.420
 the idea of mixing like this all the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.909
 world is dead I thought of a lot of 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.079
 people and then at one point I thought 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.679
 to johnny and eureka it's him 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.569
 character 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.000
 if he has the face of the character and there 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.750
 really the mouth of a meter that lived 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.920
 A lot of things 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.360
 yes when i thought aÃ¯t had jonnier 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.179
 so right now I thought about it said 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.030
 that boyfriend and then I book I 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.459
 find the woman of the ideal woman the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.640
 woman we all dream to meet 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:55.679
 ie a tolerant woman who 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.780
 who knows we talk to who we can 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.239
 more tell the story than we can 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.209
 baratiner a real woman 

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:04.829
 sorry we made known because you were 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.770
 the first French turned high 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.560
 definition 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.420
 it was ridiculous at the time 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.920
 behind killed late the first also to 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.470
 put cameras on a 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.240
 shooting 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.890
 his latest film why this 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.700
 permanent search to be at the forefront 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.500
 of the technique 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.200
 today you are the first French to 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.030
 turned entirely true projected in 4 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.250
 case why do you attach so much 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.390
 of importance because here I will be the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.959
 technical it's indissociable I say 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.300
 that for 120 years the cinema has followed the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.190
 revolution that was all true attached 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.010
 to a technique is there the big the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.130
 digital revolution is a 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.680
 fundamental capital revolution you to a 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.519
 huge thing that does that in one fell swoop 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.400
 now can project a movie with 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.320
 thousands of copies 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.180
 the same day at the same time and the 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.519
 cinema is a technology art and I have 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.890
 always been sensitive and shadows them 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.120
 even a cameraman at the start i'm going 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.580
 to be a bartender I've always been behind 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.650
 the camera 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.060
 so I had to judge the cameras 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.180
 today I heard them I got it 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.940
 dreamed all my life I shot and some 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.590
 gear used threshers who 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.269
 had two minutes of autonomy so 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.880
 today to end up with 50 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.230
 minutes of autonomy 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.780
 I did not think I attended all of that from my 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.569
 alive I am happy at the age I have 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.129
 to have more expensive 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:37.900
 salomon theme because that's it's the 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:42.010
 film that was adapted this technology 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.930
 so it's true that with the c5 meaning we 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.459
 can go very far we can go 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.969
 very far away and I'm delighted to do 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.439
 part of those who believe in it I believe 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:56.500
 these new technologies 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.909
 I suffered so much to enlighten 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.099
 for hours I have so much 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.349
 suffered from these cameras that weighed 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.709
 of storages me I try to wear at home 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.299
 it is 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.329
 here I am very happy to have 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.620
 met the season and their website 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.489
 project 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.500
 a little early I know you 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.240
 already working on your next movie 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.850
 how do you see the camera is the ideal 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.989
 precisely the future camera the ideal 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:24.560
 conflict made life the camera idh the voice 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.660
 the copat without accessories between 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.850
 of accessories for now so I 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:34.730
 dream of this compact lightweight camera and 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.270
 who sees both the day and the day 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.370
 night what so my daughter and good luck 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.550
 for the future soon on this 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.550
 city
