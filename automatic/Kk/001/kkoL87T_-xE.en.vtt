that it did peel off and it peeled off
in<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.930> really<00:02:44.170> cool<00:02:44.890> way<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:45.579> not<00:02:45.939> good

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
in a really cool way but it's not good

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.240 
in a really cool way but it's not good
when<00:02:46.239> it<00:02:46.450> does<00:02:46.599> that<00:02:46.629> so<00:02:47.560> i'm<00:02:47.859> going<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.099> show

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
you an example because i can probably

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.270 
you an example because i can probably
get<00:02:49.599> it<00:02:49.629> to<00:02:49.810> do<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.079> right<00:02:50.319> now<00:02:50.349> in<00:02:50.859> front<00:02:51.010> of

was trying to fix what I'd messed up on

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.089 
was trying to fix what I'd messed up on
and<00:02:56.650> went<00:02:56.799> on<00:02:56.859> my<00:02:57.010> skin<00:02:57.810> um<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.109> then<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.439> nail

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099

and went on my skin um and then the nail
polish<00:03:00.430> just<00:03:00.790> peeled<00:03:01.109> so<00:03:02.109> see<00:03:03.069> how<00:03:03.099> that's<00:03:03.400> up

polish just peeled so see how that's up

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.360 
polish just peeled so see how that's up
right<00:03:03.760> there<00:03:04.590> well<00:03:05.590> if<00:03:06.159> you<00:03:06.549> just<00:03:06.760> pull<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.150> it

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
right there well if you just pull it it

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.309 
right there well if you just pull it it
stretches<00:03:09.659> like<00:03:10.659> just<00:03:11.560> like<00:03:11.650> handy<00:03:12.099> but<00:03:13.319> it

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
stretches like just like handy but it

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.220 
stretches like just like handy but it
pulls<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.859> whole<00:03:15.310> nail<00:03:15.939> off<00:03:16.950> with<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.129> whole

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
pulls the whole nail off with the whole

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.190 
pulls the whole nail off with the whole
painted<00:03:20.230> now<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:22.030> just<00:03:22.359> off<00:03:22.510> my<00:03:22.750> finger<00:03:23.049> now

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
painted now is just off my finger now

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.980 
painted now is just off my finger now
and<00:03:23.739> it's<00:03:24.010> right<00:03:24.220> there

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
and it's right there

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.320 
and it's right there
so<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.920> was<00:03:27.100> really<00:03:27.130> kind<00:03:27.580> of<00:03:27.700> disappointing

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
so that was really kind of disappointing

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.990 
so that was really kind of disappointing
I<00:03:28.420> thought<00:03:28.860> maybe<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:30.040> would<00:03:30.100> last<00:03:30.280> longer<00:03:30.640> so

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
I thought maybe it would last longer so

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.050 
I thought maybe it would last longer so
I<00:03:31.300> would<00:03:31.690> recommend<00:03:32.070> putting<00:03:33.070> a<00:03:33.340> top<00:03:33.580> coat<00:03:33.850> on

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
I would recommend putting a top coat on

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.540 
I would recommend putting a top coat on
I<00:03:34.380> hadn't<00:03:35.380> done<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.530> but<00:03:35.860> now<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.040> have<00:03:36.190> done

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
I hadn't done that but now I have done

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.240 
I hadn't done that but now I have done
on<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.850> other<00:03:37.000> nails<00:03:37.180> I<00:03:37.710> got<00:03:38.710> this<00:03:38.890> one<00:03:38.950> at

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
on the other nails I got this one at

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.760 
on the other nails I got this one at
icing<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:40.300> just<00:03:40.570> says<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:41.350> know<00:03:41.470> chip

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770
