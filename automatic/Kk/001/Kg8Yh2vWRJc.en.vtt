00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.990
 the acai truck manufacturers they take 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.990
 the hope on the face 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.840
 they are the amazon but they chose to leave 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.610
 to cultivate the seed of prosperity 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.880
 opportunity experienced by them that 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.070
 They believe in the medium fruit cultivation 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.879
 Amazon as his and marielson joaci e 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.300
 Joseph 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.850
 Thank God I did several 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.460
 training in how to live this is so 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.230
 today I'm pre-producing my songs 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.840
 you see that fashion that is with 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.829
 few days after I was born here, I passed 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.829
 for the sack here is in the nursery and this 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.200
 here it is around for almost a year 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.079
 it is already fashionable that it is around a 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.809
 Subway a little so this change here is 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.250
 ideal plant for us is to know that she 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.470
 will have to wait another three months 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.470
 for us to be able to plant it 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.180
 Hmm 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.130
 the municipality of codajás already has a 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.070
 agroindustry for the processing of 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.979
 açaí the 2012 harvest 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.020
 were about 29 thousand tons and was 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.259
 this year starting with the history of 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.810
 Cooperative is the little monteiro doctor 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.670
 son of codajás superintendent of 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:45.270
 Suframa made a covenant between the Suframa 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.619
 the city hall and cooperative and the sufframa 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.899
 financed this project finds 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:55.930
 jazz and hence arose the agricultural industry it 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.190
 12 years ago it has developed 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.520
 very 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:07.869
 we have 73 cooperative producers 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:11.380
 we produced this year is 370 tons 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:17.140
 of acai berry and acai pulp type b 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:19.120
 of these 3 370 40 went to lunch 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.560
 government program with the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.940
 government school lunch program 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.459
 of State 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.750
 and the rest goes all to rio são paulo 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.750
 beautiful horizon through the area 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.380
 other countries like japan argentina 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.240
 emirates have already shown interest 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.910
 in coda açaí 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.340
 according to the certification of 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.100
 producers is an alternative for the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.430
 county get more and more 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.430
 buyers 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.209
 a business that awakens farmers 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.290
 increasing interest in increasing the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.690
 production 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.990
 nowadays the majority of farmers produce 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.790
 in the land that was once a parent 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.640
 inheritance left by the ancestors 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.420
 today the mark of the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.830
 production that is growing every day 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.350
 illuminating the palm plantation in the 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.530
 middle Amazon forest I believe 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.239
 This is an unprecedented partnership. 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.040
 strategy is extremely beneficial for 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.800
 the rural development of the state 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.880
 Amazon and that it values the chain 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.100
 production of açaí and that in obtaining 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.280
 success that we all expect with this 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.350
 other productive chains of the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.360
 our segment of fruit 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.780
 also open the doors of the market 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.930
 national and even international 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.450
 juice production is not that today are 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.580
 demanded by the Brazilian population 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.580
 increasingly acquires healthy habits 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.299
 that consuming the fruit is not 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.090
 effectively the açaí and this project will 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.370
 have a great social and economic reach 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.000
 considering that from this project 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.980
 is significant income improvement for the 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.310
 rural population for rural families 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:16.060
 involved will be realized and 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.700
 prospect of a purchase is guaranteed 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.459
 not because a segment is from a chain 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.890
 agribusiness that it will value is not the 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.890
 productive activity of the forest 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.040
 the new sell out has already included 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.430
 pre-contract that wins yes from carauari 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.100
 in the high Juruá to the low Amazon where 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.320
 where you have structure of 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.650
 primary benefit that people 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.930
 can be upgraded to ensure the 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.389
 quality of the product this product will 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.940
 be marketed within this chain 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.220
 full consumption doing with windows and 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.220
 opening of secondary roads where 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.700
 highways like the one being made 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.280
 between anori and codajás for example vai 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.950
 further boost this production 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.130
 why time you to a highway 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.650
 it will enable the exploration and 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.950
 flow very quickly that 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.770
 product and at the same time 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.990
 obviously you will shorten distances 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.520
 what today is the person who is hospitalized 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.800
 Jazz 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.070
 he has a long distance to reach 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.810
 in Manaus that I saw you, I love you forever 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.240
 evidently want very bad to 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.750
 to arouse the interest of these producers 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.630
 is to give incentive to them produced to leave 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.070
 with quality that has market value 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.070
 This is what is missing here. 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.230
 O 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.560
 see in the next block one of the largest 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.330
 açaí plantations of codajás 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.330
 the rural amazon returns already
