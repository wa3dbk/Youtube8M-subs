if you cut between joints you should not

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.620 
if you cut between joints you should not
have<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.590> exert<00:02:58.980> any<00:02:59.280> force<00:02:59.760> whatsoever

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.259 
have to exert any force whatsoever
if<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:01.079> having<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.530> exert<00:03:01.680> force<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:03.000> means

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
if you having to exert force that means

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.210 
if you having to exert force that means
you're<00:03:03.870> trying<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.290> cut<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:04.590> between<00:03:04.709> bones

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
and that's not necessary

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.530 
and that's not necessary
so<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.709> save<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.069> for<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> diluted<00:03:09.269> stock

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
so you can save this for a diluted stock

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.589 
so you can save this for a diluted stock

disease-causing bacteria are dead but

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.370 
disease-causing bacteria are dead but
the<00:03:33.389> blood<00:03:33.569> cooks<00:03:33.959> at<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.109> higher<00:03:34.349> temperature

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
the blood cooks at a higher temperature

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.190 
the blood cooks at a higher temperature
so<00:03:35.160> if<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.459> want<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.030> cook<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.750> blood<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.169> that
