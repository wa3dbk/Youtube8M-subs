00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
us to do this a couple of coupler

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.860 
us to do this a couple of coupler
swishes<00:01:55.430> through<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:55.880> water<00:01:56.090> nothing<00:01:56.600> yet

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
swishes through the water nothing yet

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.420 
swishes through the water nothing yet
but<00:01:58.120> we'll<00:01:59.120> keep<00:01:59.330> trying<00:01:59.630> because<00:01:59.810> I<00:02:00.050> think

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
but we'll keep trying because I think

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.620 
but we'll keep trying because I think
live<00:02:01.430> bait<00:02:02.380> it'll<00:02:03.380> be<00:02:03.470> sensible<00:02:04.360> get<00:02:05.360> me<00:02:05.510> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
live bait it'll be sensible get me the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:34.400 
live bait it'll be sensible get me the
big<00:02:05.780> birds<00:02:06.080> today

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.800 

it's<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.070> cold<00:02:35.400> morning<00:02:35.610> water<00:02:36.180> temperatures

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
it's a cold morning water temperatures

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.710 
it's a cold morning water temperatures
4.8<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.100> quite<00:02:38.400> quite<00:02:39.090> low<00:02:39.270> could<00:02:39.600> be

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
4.8 so it's quite quite low could be

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.380 
4.8 so it's quite quite low could be
worse<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:40.140> course<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.340> recent<00:02:41.850> cold

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
worse of course but the recent cold

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.900 
worse of course but the recent cold
weather<00:02:42.630> has<00:02:43.140> stabilized<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.670> water

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
weather has stabilized the water

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.670 
weather has stabilized the water
temperature<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.540> that's<00:02:45.780> er<00:02:45.990> that's<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.500> good

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
temperature so that's er that's a good

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.860 
temperature so that's er that's a good
sign<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.580> trend<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:48.060> quite<00:02:48.390> it's<00:02:48.810> quite

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
sign so the trend is quite it's quite

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.990 
sign so the trend is quite it's quite
level<00:02:49.320> at<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.470> moment<00:02:49.860> we're<00:02:50.430> both<00:02:50.580> fishing
