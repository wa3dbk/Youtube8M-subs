00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
are in ourselves but I think there is a

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.940 
are in ourselves but I think there is a
knowledge<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:28.460> nobody<00:03:29.180> else<00:03:29.300> in<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.720> world

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
knowledge that nobody else in the world

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.240 
knowledge that nobody else in the world
knows<00:03:30.950> what<00:03:31.960> it's<00:03:32.960> like<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.470> have<00:03:33.560> done<00:03:33.890> been

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
knows what it's like to have done been

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.660 
knows what it's like to have done been
on<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.520> mad<00:03:35.530> kind<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.620> 10-year<00:03:36.860> journey

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
on this mad kind of 10-year journey

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.910 
on this mad kind of 10-year journey
which<00:03:38.390> is<00:03:38.510> not<00:03:38.690> over<00:03:39.050> yet<00:03:39.080> not<00:03:39.380> by<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.590> long<00:03:39.770> way

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
which is not over yet not by a long way

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.820 
which is not over yet not by a long way
um<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.720> think<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:42.110> fact<00:03:42.320> that<00:03:42.410> we<00:03:42.620> know

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
um and I think the fact that we know

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.860 
um and I think the fact that we know
that<00:03:43.760> they<00:03:43.910> are<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.090> only<00:03:44.240> other<00:03:44.360> people<00:03:44.750> that

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
that they are the only other people that

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.810 
that they are the only other people that
you<00:03:45.020> know<00:03:45.380> there's<00:03:45.770> been<00:03:45.980> like<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.430> be<00:03:46.610> in<00:03:46.700> this

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
you know there's been like to be in this

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.000 
you know there's been like to be in this
situation<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.630> think<00:03:48.020> that<00:03:48.170> does<00:03:48.500> that<00:03:48.710> just

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
situation I think that does that just

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.740 
situation I think that does that just
create<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.280> bond<00:03:49.610> which<00:03:49.850> can't<00:03:50.120> necessarily<00:03:50.240> be

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
create a bond which can't necessarily be

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.820 
create a bond which can't necessarily be
broke

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.580 

this<00:03:55.220> year<00:03:55.550> all<00:03:56.240> Tamar's<00:03:56.660> chosen<00:03:57.290> Draco

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.880 

evil<00:04:02.810> will<00:04:03.110> pass<00:04:03.320> through<00:04:03.940> from<00:04:04.940> their<00:04:05.240> world
