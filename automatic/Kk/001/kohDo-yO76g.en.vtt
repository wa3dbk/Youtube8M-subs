i think of the new yugioh series at

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.570 
i think of the new yugioh series at
first<00:01:08.810> when<00:01:09.140> i<00:01:09.200> started<00:01:09.439> watching<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:09.890> I<00:01:10.070> was

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
first when i started watching it I was

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.980 
first when i started watching it I was
not<00:01:10.759> very<00:01:10.939> impressed<00:01:11.299> with<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.780> main

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
not very impressed with it the main

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.899 
not very impressed with it the main
character<00:01:12.409> Yuma<00:01:12.770> was<00:01:12.979> not<00:01:13.159> someone<00:01:13.460> who<00:01:13.880> I

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
character Yuma was not someone who I

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.999 
character Yuma was not someone who I
could<00:01:14.060> really<00:01:14.270> get<00:01:14.479> behind<00:01:14.630> he<00:01:15.499> reminded<00:01:15.859> me<00:01:15.920> a

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
could really get behind he reminded me a

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.609 
could really get behind he reminded me a
little<00:01:16.219> too<00:01:16.429> much<00:01:16.579> of<00:01:16.850> Jaden<00:01:17.409> which<00:01:18.409> was

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
little too much of Jaden which was

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.499 
little too much of Jaden which was
probably<00:01:18.979> my<00:01:19.249> least<00:01:19.460> favorite<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.329> main

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
probably my least favorite of the main

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.969 
probably my least favorite of the main
Yugi<00:01:20.869> characters<00:01:21.320> from<00:01:21.439> all<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.679> different

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
Yugi characters from all the different

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.969 
Yugi characters from all the different
series<00:01:22.249> but<00:01:23.210> as<00:01:23.420> time<00:01:23.689> went<00:01:23.869> on<00:01:24.109> and<00:01:24.380> the

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
series but as time went on and the

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.880 
series but as time went on and the
series<00:01:25.460> started<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.759> progress<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.450> kind<00:01:26.689> of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
series started to progress I kind of

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.499 
series started to progress I kind of
more<00:01:27.890> appreciated<00:01:28.399> the<00:01:28.490> dynamic<00:01:28.939> he<00:01:29.090> had<00:01:29.270> with

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
more appreciated the dynamic he had with

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.809 
more appreciated the dynamic he had with
a<00:01:29.539> stroll<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.340> just<00:01:31.340> kind<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.579> the

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
a stroll and just kind of the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.219 
a stroll and just kind of the
relationship<00:01:32.390> that<00:01:32.509> started<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.840> grow<00:01:32.990> and

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
relationship that started to grow and

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.469 
relationship that started to grow and
then<00:01:33.350> by<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:33.950> 10th<00:01:34.280> episode<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.939> season<00:01:35.149> I

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
then by the 10th episode of the season I

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.059 
then by the 10th episode of the season I
think<00:01:35.719> I<00:01:35.810> was<00:01:35.929> kind<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.200> firmly<00:01:36.499> behind<00:01:36.770> it

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
think I was kind of firmly behind it

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.980 
think I was kind of firmly behind it
once<00:01:37.579> sharp<00:01:37.909> kind<00:01:38.149> of<00:01:38.240> came<00:01:38.390> back<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.929> they

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
once sharp kind of came back and they

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.919 
once sharp kind of came back and they
had<00:01:39.170> their<00:01:39.439> you<00:01:40.429> know<00:01:40.490> duel<00:01:40.789> once<00:01:41.329> again<00:01:41.600> from

firmly behind in the series and then

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.200 
firmly behind in the series and then
when<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:51.920> got<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.249> the<00:01:52.609> end<00:01:52.789> of<00:01:52.969> the<00:01:53.030> first
