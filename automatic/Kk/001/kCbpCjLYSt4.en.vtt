universe there it didn't seem to do that
well<00:05:40.820> which<00:05:41.060> is<00:05:41.090> why<00:05:41.210> they<00:05:41.480> took<00:05:41.660> an<00:05:41.780> alternate

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
well which is why they took an alternate

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.780 
well which is why they took an alternate
take<00:05:42.320> with<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:42.650> another<00:05:42.920> century's<00:05:43.490> there

starting with g but v gundam comes in at
number<00:05:46.730> 11<00:05:47.390> certainly<00:05:47.870> a<00:05:47.900> high<00:05:48.110> casualty<00:05:48.740> rate

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
number 11 certainly a high casualty rate

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.860 
number 11 certainly a high casualty rate
but<00:05:49.400> certainly<00:05:49.730> fun<00:05:50.030> to<00:05:50.180> go<00:05:50.300> back<00:05:50.510> and<00:05:50.750> watch

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.530 
but certainly fun to go back and watch
it<00:05:51.200> is<00:05:51.440> very<00:05:51.860> early<00:05:52.160> 90s<00:05:52.760> but<00:05:53.210> it's<00:05:53.390> certainly

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
it is very early 90s but it's certainly

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.720 
it is very early 90s but it's certainly
an<00:05:53.780> interesting<00:05:54.070> continuation<00:05:55.070> although<00:05:55.310> i'd

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
an interesting continuation although i'd

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.220 
an interesting continuation although i'd
love<00:05:55.970> to<00:05:56.120> see<00:05:56.270> a<00:05:56.300> little<00:05:56.540> bit<00:05:56.660> more<00:05:56.810> fill<00:05:57.080> in

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
love to see a little bit more fill in

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.650 
love to see a little bit more fill in

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
there to connect it to the main body

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.210 
there to connect it to the main body
that<00:05:59.870> we've<00:06:00.020> seen<00:06:00.230> at<00:06:00.350> the<00:06:00.380> beginning<00:06:00.710> of<00:06:00.980> the

while I'm gonna wrap up this part of the

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.600 
while I'm gonna wrap up this part of the

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
list before moving on to the top one so

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.920 
list before moving on to the top one so
don't<00:06:12.730> forget<00:06:12.940> to<00:06:13.090> stick<00:06:13.420> around<00:06:13.450> for<00:06:13.900> that

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
don't forget to stick around for that

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.480 
don't forget to stick around for that
and<00:06:14.440> anyway<00:06:14.800> why<00:06:14.980> don't<00:06:15.040> you<00:06:15.220> let<00:06:15.340> me<00:06:15.460> know

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
and anyway why don't you let me know

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.950 
and anyway why don't you let me know
what<00:06:15.820> you<00:06:16.000> think<00:06:16.210> it's<00:06:16.480> sort<00:06:16.750> of<00:06:16.840> not

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
what you think it's sort of not

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.450 
what you think it's sort of not
surprising<00:06:17.440> that<00:06:17.470> we<00:06:17.620> got<00:06:17.770> hathaway<00:06:18.190> splash

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
surprising that we got hathaway splash

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.430 
surprising that we got hathaway splash
perhaps<00:06:19.180> it's<00:06:19.360> surprising<00:06:19.720> that<00:06:19.750> a<00:06:19.870> novel<00:06:20.230> got

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
perhaps it's surprising that a novel got

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.740 
perhaps it's surprising that a novel got
on<00:06:20.620> that<00:06:20.680> list<00:06:21.190> in<00:06:21.400> the<00:06:21.490> first<00:06:21.700> place<00:06:21.880> but<00:06:22.600> when

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
on that list in the first place but when
