because it's not really we haven't
really<00:02:56.790> resolved<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.390> because<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:57.959> a

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
really resolved it because it's a

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.840 
really resolved it because it's a
cyclical<00:02:58.560> kind<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.950> history<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.700> this

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
cyclical kind of history so this is this

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.100
