00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.799 
time on this server will rank up the
fastest<00:00:32.579> because<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> more<00:00:33.360> time<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.719> they

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
fastest because the more time that they

of most likely scoreboard you can enable
it<00:01:31.770> true<00:01:32.100> or<00:01:32.189> false<00:01:32.460> there's<00:01:32.759> also<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.030> command

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it true or false there's also a command

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
themself so I haven't Allen true anyways

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.130 
themself so I haven't Allen true anyways
but<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.549> guys<00:01:38.700> refresh<00:01:39.509> time<00:01:39.990> you

but it's up to you guys refresh time you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.870 
but it's up to you guys refresh time you
can<00:01:40.259> make<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.560> shorter<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.340> title<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
can make that shorter the title of a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.719 
can make that shorter the title of a
scoreboard<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.750> display<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.649> shows<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
scoreboard the display what it shows so

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.330
