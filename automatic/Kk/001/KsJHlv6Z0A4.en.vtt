bed<00:00:53.780> fish<00:00:54.049> you<00:00:54.830> know<00:00:54.979> what<00:00:55.220> there's<00:00:55.519> a<00:00:55.580> better

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
bed fish you know what there's a better

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.270 
bed fish you know what there's a better
way<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.839> main<00:00:57.110> theory<00:00:57.620> in<00:00:57.710> bed<00:00:57.979> fishing

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
way and the main theory in bed fishing

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.939 
way and the main theory in bed fishing
is<00:00:58.670> that<00:00:59.239> you<00:00:59.360> want<00:00:59.659> to<00:00:59.720> present<00:00:59.949> different

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
is that you want to present different

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.969 
is that you want to present different
sizes<00:01:01.549> and<00:01:01.790> different<00:01:02.720> colors<00:01:02.769> that's<00:01:03.769> the

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
sizes and different colors that's the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.770 
sizes and different colors that's the
whole<00:01:04.159> key<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:04.940> got<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.269> keep<00:01:05.420> presenting

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
whole key you got to keep presenting

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.170 
whole key you got to keep presenting
different<00:01:06.049> size<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.830> different<00:01:07.010> colors<00:01:07.520> to

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
different size and different colors to

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.750 
different size and different colors to
figure<00:01:08.659> out<00:01:08.869> what<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:09.170> fish<00:01:09.590> wants<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.640> know

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
figure out what that fish wants you know

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.359 
figure out what that fish wants you know
each<00:01:11.090> bed<00:01:11.540> fish<00:01:11.810> every<00:01:12.409> fish<00:01:12.650> I<00:01:12.890> don't<00:01:12.979> care<00:01:13.280> if

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
each bed fish every fish I don't care if

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.969 
each bed fish every fish I don't care if
there's<00:01:13.520> five<00:01:13.820> in<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.150> row<00:01:14.229> each<00:01:15.229> one<00:01:15.650> is<00:01:15.830> gonna

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
there's five in a row each one is gonna

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.190 
there's five in a row each one is gonna
have<00:01:16.189> a<00:01:16.220> different<00:01:16.670> personality<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:17.630> you've

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
have a different personality and you've

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.110 
have a different personality and you've
got<00:01:18.409> to<00:01:18.560> figure<00:01:18.860> out<00:01:18.890> what<00:01:19.430> is<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.850> trigger

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
got to figure out what is the trigger
