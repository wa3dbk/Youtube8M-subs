you'd<00:03:49.210> really<00:03:49.390> like<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.690> get<00:03:49.990> out<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:51.010> your

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
you'd really like to get out of your

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.700 
you'd really like to get out of your
garlic<00:03:51.520> so<00:03:52.150> now<00:03:52.540> what<00:03:52.990> I'm<00:03:53.080> gonna<00:03:53.170> do<00:03:53.410> here<00:03:53.650> is

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
garlic so now what I'm gonna do here is

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:00.180 
garlic so now what I'm gonna do here is
I'm<00:03:54.310> gonna<00:03:54.460> whisk<00:03:54.850> all<00:03:55.090> this<00:03:55.270> together<00:03:59.190> with

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
I'm gonna whisk all this together with

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.400 
I'm gonna whisk all this together with
that<00:04:00.310> sugar<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.880> that<00:04:00.940> salt<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.660> dissolve<00:04:01.690> and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
that sugar and that salt to dissolve and

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.770 
that sugar and that salt to dissolve and
those<00:04:02.620> flavors<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.580> marry<00:04:05.100> we<00:04:06.100> put<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.880> oil<00:04:06.910> in

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
those flavors to marry we put the oil in

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.610 
those flavors to marry we put the oil in
there<00:04:08.470> because<00:04:08.970> oil<00:04:09.970> goes<00:04:10.690> really<00:04:10.960> well<00:04:11.080> with

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
there because oil goes really well with
