the silver thing right here is and I'm
gently<00:02:25.450> heating<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.650> back<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.940> pallet

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
gently heating the back of the pallet

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.490 
gently heating the back of the pallet
against<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:30.480> kind<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.570> like<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.810> side<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
against the kind of like the side of the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.980 
against the kind of like the side of the
candle<00:02:32.920> not<00:02:33.100> directly<00:02:33.459> over<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.970> but<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:34.420> off

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
candle not directly over it but just off

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.430 
candle not directly over it but just off
to<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.200> side<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.830> what<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.280> does<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.440> warms

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
to the side and what it does is it warms

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.340 
to the side and what it does is it warms
the<00:02:38.650> pallet<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.610> causes<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.780> glue<00:02:41.080> to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
the pallet and it causes the glue to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.130 
the pallet and it causes the glue to
become<00:02:41.680> tacky<00:02:41.980> again<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.510> way<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:43.750> can

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
become tacky again and that way you can

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.530 
become tacky again and that way you can
just<00:02:44.170> take<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.560> pin<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.280> work<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.820> pin<00:02:46.060> around

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
just take a pin and work the pin around

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.010 
just take a pin and work the pin around
the<00:02:46.630> edges<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.350> then<00:02:47.980> pry<00:02:48.459> up<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.820> pan<00:02:49.420> from

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
the edges and then pry up the pan from

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.009 
the edges and then pry up the pan from
the<00:02:50.370> plastic<00:02:51.370> pallet<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.030> I've<00:02:52.510> just<00:02:52.690> got<00:02:52.870> it

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
mayor I got to clean it up that's what

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.610

the<00:04:35.400> outside<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.300> case<00:04:36.540> looks<00:04:36.870> like<00:04:37.170> and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
the outside of the case looks like and

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.430 
the outside of the case looks like and
the<00:04:37.890> bottom<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:39.060> case<00:04:39.300> looks<00:04:39.750> like<00:04:40.050> that

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.720 
the bottom of the case looks like that
and<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:42.630> also<00:04:42.990> made<00:04:43.320> another<00:04:43.440> modification<00:04:44.010> of

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
and I also made another modification of

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.330 
and I also made another modification of
clipping<00:04:45.330> these<00:04:45.690> little<00:04:46.080> things<00:04:46.410> on<00:04:47.130> either

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
clipping these little things on either

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.670 
clipping these little things on either
side<00:04:47.730> which<00:04:48.060> helped<00:04:48.390> keep<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.690> case<00:04:49.170> closed

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
side which helped keep the case closed

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.510 
side which helped keep the case closed
in<00:04:49.890> a<00:04:49.980> snap<00:04:50.370> and<00:04:51.260> I<00:04:52.260> did<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.860> because<00:04:53.040> when<00:04:53.490> I

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
in a snap and I did that because when I

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.720 
in a snap and I did that because when I
closed<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:54.900> I<00:04:55.050> wanted<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.920> push<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.460> case

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
closed it and I wanted to push the case

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.870 
closed it and I wanted to push the case
to<00:04:57.150> open<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:57.860> that's<00:04:58.860> when<00:04:59.160> I<00:04:59.190> cracked<00:04:59.580> these

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
to open it that's when I cracked these

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.330 
to open it that's when I cracked these
two<00:05:00.150> eyeshadows<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:01.080> this<00:05:01.830> is<00:05:01.980> just<00:05:02.100> going<00:05:02.280> to

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.560 
maybe I'll put a little tie on it or
something<00:05:09.070> but<00:05:09.760> it's<00:05:09.940> not<00:05:10.150> going<00:05:10.270> to<00:05:10.360> snap

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570
