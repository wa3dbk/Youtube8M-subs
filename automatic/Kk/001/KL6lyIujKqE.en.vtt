of us eight of them but there's 12 major

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.519 
of us eight of them but there's 12 major
scales<00:00:27.570> because<00:00:27.900> there's<00:00:28.050> 12<00:00:28.320> different

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
scales because there's 12 different

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.700

ladder of notes that runs from the root
up<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> octave<00:00:38.940> note<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:40.050> does<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.379> in

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
up to the octave note and it does it in

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.280 
up to the octave note and it does it in
a<00:00:40.559> series<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.920> half<00:00:41.250> step<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.910> whole<00:00:42.149> steps<00:00:42.510> for

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
example a major scale is a whole step

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.090 
example a major scale is a whole step
followed<00:00:45.750> by<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> whole<00:00:46.110> step<00:00:46.379> I'll<00:00:46.680> by<00:00:46.860> half

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
followed by a whole step I'll by half

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.400 
followed by a whole step I'll by half

step whole step whole step whole step

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.910 
step whole step whole step whole step
and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.010> half<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.899> now<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.960> blue<00:00:52.320> scale<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and then a half so now the blue scale is

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.979 
and then a half so now the blue scale is
that<00:00:53.280> plus<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.710> flat<00:00:55.710> third<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:57.210> flat<00:00:57.510> fifth

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that plus the flat third the flat fifth

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.680 
that plus the flat third the flat fifth
and<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.530> flat<00:00:58.800> seven<00:00:59.370> sometimes<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.510> see

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and the flat seven sometimes if you see

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.830 
and the flat seven sometimes if you see
the<00:01:00.840> blue<00:01:00.960> scale<00:01:01.320> printed<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:02.359> it<00:01:03.359> won't

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the blue scale printed out it won't

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.539 
the blue scale printed out it won't
include<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.439> regular<00:01:04.799> third<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.250> river

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
include the regular third of the river

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.880 
include the regular third of the river
fifth<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> regular<00:01:06.420> seventh<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.710> that's

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
fifth of the regular seventh but that's

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
fifth of the regular seventh but that's
a<00:01:08.010> mistake<00:01:08.220> because<00:01:08.580> jazz<00:01:09.180> musicians

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
a mistake because jazz musicians

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.980 
a mistake because jazz musicians
improvisation<00:01:10.369> people<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.490> improvise<00:01:12.360> they

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
improvisation people that improvise they

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.929 
improvisation people that improvise they
use<00:01:13.170> those<00:01:13.380> all<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> time<00:01:13.710> because<00:01:14.610> what

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
use those all the time because what

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.340 
use those all the time because what
we're<00:01:15.119> really<00:01:15.330> reaching<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
we're really reaching for it is the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.370 
we're really reaching for it is the
crack<00:01:16.650> between<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> third<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> flat

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
crack between the third and the flat

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.020 
crack between the third and the flat
third<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> blues<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.850> know<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
third because in the blues you know you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.190 
third because in the blues you know you
have<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.570> sad<00:01:21.869> feeling<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> only<00:01:23.040> reach<00:01:23.280> by

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
have that sad feeling the only reach by

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.890 
have that sad feeling the only reach by
trying<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.340> buy<00:01:26.340> by<00:01:26.909> reaching<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.540> crack

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
trying to buy by reaching for that crack

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.359 
trying to buy by reaching for that crack
and<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.770> voice<00:01:28.829> if<00:01:29.280> you

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and you can do it in your voice if you

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.340 
and you can do it in your voice if you
do<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.670> trombone<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> piano<00:01:31.140> you

do it on trombone but on a piano you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.069 
do it on trombone but on a piano you
have<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.590> play<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.720> both<00:01:33.720> at<00:01:33.960> the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
scale of it was like that it is and I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.590 
scale of it was like that it is and I
would<00:02:07.520> also<00:02:07.550> add<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.410> third<00:02:09.410> which<00:02:09.770> is<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.070> flat

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
would also add the third which is a flat

would also add the third which is a flat
flat<00:02:11.600> fare<00:02:12.080> would<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.560> seek<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.040> light<00:02:13.160> looks

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
flat fare would you seek the light looks

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.430
