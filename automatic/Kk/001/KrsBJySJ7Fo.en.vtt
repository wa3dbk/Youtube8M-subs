00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.820
 What has been left in the dilapidated box? 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.740
 I cried with a loud voice, I have lost. 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.120
 Once again, there is no way to replace your existence. 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.680
 This is just a doll who can’t forget to smile. 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:13.320
 Now I open the threshold and go to the new world. 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:21.460
 Holding the courage to move forward to face the long-lost sky 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.820
 I will never lose happiness that exists in my hands. 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.400
 I am afraid, please don’t show such a face. 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:44.400
 I will not forget the relationship that is connected by the invisible line. 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.160
 Sad thoughts go straight to the winter sky 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.280
 The ropes that are intertwined begin to slowly unravel. 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:17.300
 Was given the freedom to smile for the first time 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:25.860
 Clearly hidden in the depths of the heart 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.860
 Lonely but opened my eyes, I have to endure tears 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.120
 Make my heart disorder an unacceptable lie 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:48.000
 The feelings that passed to my hand are missing on my fingertips. 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.980
 I can only pretend that I can't recognize this loneliness but can't put it away. 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.980
 The thoughts hidden in the heart will not spread. 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:29.780
 I am alone in the world of fantasy and nothing else. 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:43.340
 I found you because of the dilapidated box I wanted to find the loneliness. 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.600
 I will never lose happiness that exists in my hands. 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.900
 I am afraid, please don’t show such a face. 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:06.060
 I will not forget the relationship that is connected by the invisible line. 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:13.020
 Sad thoughts go straight to the winter sky 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.060
