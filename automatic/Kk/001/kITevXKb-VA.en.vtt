00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
what I recommend for the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.720

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
you can add a little bit more air to

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.730

roll it up all the air comes out and it

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.460 
roll it up all the air comes out and it
will<00:04:38.130> roll<00:04:38.430> up<00:04:38.700> to<00:04:39.540> this<00:04:39.720> size<00:04:40.020> of<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.230> pad

underneath the tent will suck out their
heat<00:05:53.820> at<00:05:54.000> night<00:05:54.240> so<00:05:55.080> even<00:05:55.410> if<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:55.680> have<00:05:55.919> a<00:05:55.950> good

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
heat at night so even if you have a good

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.279 
heat at night so even if you have a good
sleeping<00:05:56.639> bag<00:05:56.700> your<00:05:57.150> child<00:05:57.389> will<00:05:57.720> be<00:05:57.900> cold

their<00:06:00.389> heat<00:06:00.630> so<00:06:01.380> I<00:06:01.740> think<00:06:02.610> they<00:06:02.850> just<00:06:02.880> call

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
their heat so I think they just call
