00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
used to vibrator that the goal is pretty

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:46.780 
used to vibrator that the goal is pretty
much<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.690> get<00:01:57.870> all<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.620> bubbles<00:01:58.830> out<00:02:01.760> kind<00:02:02.760> of

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.120 

we're<00:02:47.790> poor<00:02:48.090> basically<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.110> main<00:02:49.320> idea<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:49.950> to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
we're poor basically the main idea is to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.150 
we're poor basically the main idea is to
get<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.550> two<00:02:50.790> teeth<00:02:51.030> on<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.300> site<00:02:51.690> or<00:02:51.990> maybe<00:02:52.950> one

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
get the two teeth on a site or maybe one

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.340 
get the two teeth on a site or maybe one
one<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.700> one<00:02:53.730> side<00:02:54.270> one<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.840> other<00:02:54.960> side

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
one to one side one to the other side

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.710 
one to one side one to the other side
and<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.740> tooth<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.220> we<00:02:56.460> have<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.540> don't

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
and the tooth that we have so we don't

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.140 
and the tooth that we have so we don't
need<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.080> pour<00:02:58.290> really<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.710> lot<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.640> risk<00:02:59.940> is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
need to pour really a lot so the risk is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.740 
need to pour really a lot so the risk is
which<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.600> doing<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.350> basics<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:03.000> you're
