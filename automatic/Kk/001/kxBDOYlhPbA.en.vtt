00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.520
 Talk to the line of games and I hope. 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.710
 nabuco beauty 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.400
 We're bringing the making video today. 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.010
 off to war bringing stock 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.230
 multiplayer gameplay 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.600
 our backyard was multiplayer mode 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.700
 has several game modes in which to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.500
 you can be from six different nations 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:29.760
 beauty games modes are roque 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.720
 pottes quintas med-seg touched opzz e 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.850
 other than the now number on the head may 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.010
 having the following guys is the best of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.330
 five a team attack another defend and the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.640
 attacking team simply has to 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.519
 to bomb the target 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.400
 detonate three goals done this wins 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.190
 and has what advocates have to logically 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.300
 defend three bases without any 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.070
 to blow this up is a way of 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.080
 I can not get out of control in the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.330
 with taste of battlefield 3 for those who already 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.909
 played where you have to conquer 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.470
 Internet banners do not need 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.729
 comment because everyone knows how 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.390
 works the bagasse as the river op is a 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.100
 model is the way to decor the game mode 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.800
 hardcore anyway it's not for 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.120
 tell the truth I mentioned earlier wanted 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.160
 also talk some cool things that 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.320
 I found a game like for example rech 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.300
 For example, you will give a 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.920
 support your friend if he is 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.790
 carrying bullet in any situation of 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 Danger 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.810
 You can answer her things here at 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.820
 button wasted happens you're done 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.620
 often dying 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.510
 Another thing I found strange game here 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.830
 the game has practically not collected 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.690
 in arms 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.890
 because it means it has but it is the minimum that 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.150
 you will see 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.420
 but nothing compared to battlefield 3 is 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.710
 the graphics I found very cool fuck 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.350
 I had no disappointment with the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.510
 charts with two maps are also well 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.630
 worked and done so that the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.290
 enemy combatant always occurs game 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.929
 basically it was what I said going 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.880
 for the part of the gameplay is nothing more 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.030
 than a battlefield graphic code 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.880
 3 only game physics the movement of 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.680
 doll that changes a little glue and a lot 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.959
 people who were talking about those who 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.910
 strike a because you're going to have to strike 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.530
 I will not like it, bye, bye, bye, bye 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.330
 beauty 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.480
 I 'll also talk here a little bit of what 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.390
 the spirit as to what strike you nothing 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.610
 as heavy as a jury safe that 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.790
 You put a helicopter on the bus. 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.170
 whole 8 you leave a 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.890
 machine gun on the ground and kill 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.200
 everyone 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.390
 not entirely unlike those who strike 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.190
 of the best movie of the year and I'm there 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.709
 simply to give more support. 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.260
 on the team like smoke radar 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.150
 Of course there is one that has arrived 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.329
 there and for nothing more to kill the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.860
 full - time who can give lapa vision 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:04.140
 killing everyone finally is higher for 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.630
 supports all weapons per galley and has 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.290
 lots of gun the game you can customize 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.370
 to study a practically everything everything 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.120
 all weapon 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.920
 you can personalize touch cartridge 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.620
 avon if you want to change the cartridge 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.590
 may try to change the sights of the tarsus 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.420
 price or you can put what you want in 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.580
 An excuse, but finally. 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.260
 It's something I did not like I stayed 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.670
 A lot of traveling here in the game I do not know if 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.530
 it was a bug 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.410
 I do not think so or if it was any 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.120
 configuration of your I do not know but one 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.319
 thing I found it strange that it had a 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.330
 The time I was playing with my friends. 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.420
 and just could not talk 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.730
 with no one serving nothing 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.790
 I could change a word and I tried 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.770
 change there the voip module there nothing 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.090
 I was able to talk to anyone only when 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.920
 end game 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.349
 I do not know if a bug does not know if it will be 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.450
 thing of life or not at all 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.700
 Another thing that I found bad was that 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.280
 for example when you stayed it is not 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.660
 balanced the times 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.280
 my friends passed by on one side I did not 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.930
 be able to change teams in any way 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.390
 able to switch sides for dinner with 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.769
 they even after people came in did not 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.959
 get sideways 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.639
 I do not know if it was because I was dumb I 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.180
 I do not know but I could not change 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.100
 side 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:26.040
 finally there game for those who like flowers 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:29.639
 pre-shock I advise a lot I like it 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.890
 much of the game is like almost no 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.680
 defect and graphics are very cool 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:38.270
 the gameplay is very good multiplayer 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.979
 very good manners are very good then 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.370
 I will now just take a look at the mode 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.620
 campaign after knowing how it is but 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.280
 how much or multiplayer mode does anything 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.140
 complain 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.910
 beauty is good until the next 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.680
 I do not know when tomorrow after 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.470
 I do not know anymore 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.260
 I'll bring a video for you or me or 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.880
 of shock tried to make-up I do not know the 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.000
 People bring beauty there. 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.000
 Thanks guys to the next arm.
