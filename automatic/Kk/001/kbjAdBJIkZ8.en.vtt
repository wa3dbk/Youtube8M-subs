 has the agreement that the candle has in the funeral 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.470
 but why this aggression 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.950
 true that yes I guess it is aimed 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.000
 to moms 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.680
 when mom does not even have 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.500
 nothing to see 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.059
 Why the woman 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.689
 well the bible is clear and when people say is that we ask everything is a 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.900
 woman is logical then 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.640
 God has taken out 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.989
 to the man of the woman but we come to the bible and it is upside down because 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.789
 science proves it 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.710
 the name have 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.190
 two chromosomes 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.450
 there would be 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.749
 the woman has 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.080
 xx 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.310
 if God had pulled out 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.310
 of the genetic material 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.010
 the man of the woman would have been a race activity 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.960
 but by taking God out of the genetic material of the man who has 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.469
 x and ask 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.059
 then the human race 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:57.850
 it could 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.370
 play 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.370
 and the bible had the race 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.090
 the third place 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.870
 third the bible also says that god wanted all this is scientific 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.750
 which we are not speculating 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.400
 nor philosophizing at the best there may be a that book for example stl the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.230
 origin of the species of Carlos Darwin 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.420
 chance and 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.550
 maybe I'm not sure I think so 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.250
 maybe 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.110
 How can a language be these characteristics called scientific 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.860
 but when you come from the bible you do not find the best 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.659
 God does not try to even prove that it does not exist 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.650
 simply to 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.320
 sign your existence 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.480
 and it is the only book that contains absolute truths 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.470
 the bible says that God made man 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.420
 physically from the dust of the earth 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.550
 and the sciences with proof 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.189
 that the 19 elements indicated that the human body magnesium fluoride 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.379
 potassium esteche 13 tracks are the same chemical elements that form the earth 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.040
 and the four houses that make up the human body 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.870
 hydrogen oxygen extra carbon are the four bases that also contains 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.589
 the dust of the earth 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:21.680
 and the bible 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.399
 I had satin 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:27.909
 who was first then zeta el chango que añana 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.209
 let's see now in third place 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.680
 the testimony of the universal flood the bible writes in chapters 7 and 8 of the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.079
 genesis 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.049
 what the world was buried 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.409
 everything under a deluge under a cataclysm 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.189
 universal 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.969
 that buried the mountains herrera esq 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.969
 the snow of toluca the popocatépetl and the iztaccíhuatl 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.199
 s3f was the highest mountains in the world 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.659
 they were covered by water 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.079
 and acquired modern technology 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.079
 check that in the mountain you must 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.560
 1 when finding sediment by alicia euros 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.370
 checking that those fines 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.410
 the nasa some at the time in the past 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.819
 they were buried by the water 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.559
 from sea 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:24.699
 also 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:27.799
 not only archeology but 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.069
 all the ancient civilizations 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.449
 gentlemen historians 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:34.819
 your means 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.000
 Egyptians 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.130
 Babylonians 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.159
 m2 Roman Greek Persians all civilizations recorded in their most 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.779
 ancient writings 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:48.319
 an old cataclysm already mature the flood 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.580
 for pujol to prove 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.659
 that the bible 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.740
 do not write fictional stories 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.069
 if not that what the bible writes 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.799
 it's just me as rat the cities the kings the places the geography is 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.309
 absolute 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.599
 mind sierralta 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.540
 if you went to any sacred book 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.270
 it does not give you geographical or historical records the bible says in the year 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.310
 of the king number tal in fulham otan being governor of judea poncio 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.120
 piles 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.120
 etcetera etcetera 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.850
 bynum came an official census center with history that exactly in that year was 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.559
 descent when christ and they are going to be 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:29.330
 everything is proven in the light of history 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.210
 and what the david student had 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.780
 and it is that the tomb that discovered France and that hides a stone 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.900
 all archeology continues to come while more 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.440
 they dig up things 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.110
 the world more discover that geography 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.710
 and the history and evidences that the bible are scientifically demonstrable 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.889
 in fourth place 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.999
 the roundness of the earth 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:59.979
 was discovered by galileo galilei 1620 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.740
 approximately 2000 targeted 2380 years 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.520
 before galileo 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.189
 in Isaiah 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:15.319
 chapter 40 verse 22 the bible russia claimed 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.339
 that the earth 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.020
 round isaiah 40 22 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.020
 2380 years an 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.689
 of galileo 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:26.659
 carlyle

 fisher-price them 40 22 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.089
 he is sitting on the 100 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.960
 a look of the earth 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.949
 whose inhabitants are like the coasts 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.460
 before it was discovered that the earth 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.639
 it was not sustained by anything 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.960
 I took an agreement the books that was a turtle and the living earth of the 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.840
 turtle ochoa reza atlas 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.729
 loading of the earth whatever books 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.550
 because scientists can not explain what there was nothing that 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.990
 will study them 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.789
 already warning 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.069
 four thousand years 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.800
 before it was discovered 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.009
 that the earth was not sustained by anything 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.290
 chapter 26 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.300
 verses 7 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.410
 that got rid of the oldest of the bible 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.510
 describes that the earth hangs over nothing 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:17.990
 before it was discovered that the wind has weight 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:22.309
 the Italian torrid geli 

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:25.520
 in the year one thousand 644 when 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.029
 he invented the barometer to measure the weight of the air 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.419
 and the bible the chapter 38 chapter 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.589
 penti verse 5 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:37.860
 he claimed 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.199
 four thousand years before that chile towers that the wind had weight 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.990
 before the astronomers discovered 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.659
 that stars can not be counted and that they are 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:50.979
 innumerable 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.340
 in the genesis chapter 15 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.270
 verses 5 the bible claimed 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.729
 more than three thousand 500 years before 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.790
 that the stars could not be 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.390
 tell
