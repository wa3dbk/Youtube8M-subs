00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 from the united states of the method more 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.359
 newer advanced in treatment 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.490
 hip replacement or the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.860
 positioning of a prosthesis with 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.620
 margin of error equal to zero 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.160
 new frontiers of surgery 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.350
 orthopedic with futuristic technologies 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.170
 and really one at the san francesco clinic 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.820
 which for the first time in Europe are 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.150
 two were successfully executed 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.800
 prosthetic surgery 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.289
 hip robotics in as many 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 patients with coxarthrosis ad 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.460
 execute the interventions more at giuseppe 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.040
 perazzini responsible for the unit 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.870
 functional orthopedics and traumatology 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.910
 of San Francesco in a crowded 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 press conference illustrated the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.480
 procedure that he himself investigated 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.370
 in the United States 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.079
 I run with the two plants at 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.719
 outside the united states at the end of 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.309
 2012 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.020
 innovation lies in the technique of 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.270
 application is not innovative to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.859
 prosthesis that reproduces or retraces the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.219
 road is already marked by prosthesis of 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.559
 very useful but it is the innovative 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.369
 technique with which it is applied one speaks 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.049
 of a methodology that navigated guided that 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.080
 allows to have parameters in the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.939
 perfect planning stage 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.670
 then reproducible during surgery 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.650
 surgical giving the surgeon certainty 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.470
 of the gesture that the relapse is making 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.990
 positive how to define it for the patient 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.299
 what is it but the main problems of a 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.490
 prostheses are the post complications 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.869
 operating theater and among these the most 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.820
 the instability is important 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.130
 then the implant of the prosthesis 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.560
 dislocations that reduce the times you 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.759
 lengthen recovery times and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.490
 medium to long term complications 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.890
 related to component wear due 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.479
 to the bad positioning this method in 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.770
 able to give the surgeon the possibility 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.549
 to be certain of the positioning 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.990
 correct and therefore to minimize 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.759
 to minimize this type of 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.399
 complications then to speed up in the 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.390
 recovery and to reduce the percentages of the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.390
 re interventions
