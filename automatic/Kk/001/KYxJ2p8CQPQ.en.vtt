00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.240
 Y 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.000
 the installation of pre-grills 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.280
 mobility is binner and should be done on 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.890
 material floor that is perfectly 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.810
 leveled or failing to level the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.630
 ring that is the basis of all the 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.240
 grill we do not advise installing them 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.240
 about grass land collection 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:41.030
 inside the base ring we place the floor 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.780
 leÃ±ero we support the back woodshed on 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.780
 the lineman floor 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 we place the square on the back 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.100
 from miera 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.550
 we place the sides and the abalone 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.550
 masters with the squad 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.229
 finally we raise the back wool and 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.229
 we adjust it to the square 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.220
 the sides are placed level and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.220
 move the set back 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.690
 with a wedge we fix the sides with 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.690
 miera's back 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.420
 once the base of 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.900
 signature and in position we place the ring 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.900
 number 2 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.300
 with a second wedge we ensure the 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.300
 ring number 2 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
 ah 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.930
 we place the refractory floor on the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.180
 ring number 2 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.640
 the refractory floor contains two 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.099
 cavities where the guides will settle 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.200
 of the grill take into account that the 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.060
 cavities of the guides are more 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.060
 next from the front of the grill 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.599
 in the pre-molded binelli grills 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.310
 number 1 the refractory floor already contains 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.959
 The front 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.210
 we position the refractory back 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:46.100
 on the refractory floor 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.100
 then we place the sides 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.819
 and we adjust them to the square 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.410
 we raise the refractory back 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.569
 and we finished adjusting the sides 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.770
 we place the internal sides 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.770
 refractory 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.180
 then we put the ratchet of chin 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.340
 the grid ratchet lock should 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.340
 look towards the front 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.220
 we put the ring number 3 that will be the 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.220
 seat of the bell 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.350
 to facilitate the placement of the 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.490
 bell are placed two wooden equipment 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.490
 over the ring 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.400
 before raising the bell untie the 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.970
 wires that will serve as fixation for 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.970
 Fireplace 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.280
 over these the bell slides inside 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.280
 of the mission 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.940
 then the chimney extension is placed 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.940
 adjusting the to the bell 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.180
 we can add up to 4 extensions 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.180
 of dynamic maximum 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.090
 finally the hat is installed 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.580
 finally we put the frame of 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:26.139
 grill 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.139
 the grill modules 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.870
 and the fat was good 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.870
 in the case of installation of interiors 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.969
 These grills can be sealed with 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.489
 cement and refractory material 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:46.029
 it is possible that some brands are generated 

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:48.249
 in the transfer and assembly of the grill 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:50.739
 these are easily repairable with a 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:53.039
 cement patina and paint included in 

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:53.039
 the foot 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.389
 the binelli pre-molded grills are 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:11.419
 of simple and excellent assembly 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.419
 quality
