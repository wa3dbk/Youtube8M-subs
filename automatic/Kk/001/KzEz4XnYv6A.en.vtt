00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
so this is the alienware 17 you'll see

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.270 
so this is the alienware 17 you'll see
that<00:00:07.779> it<00:00:07.899> has<00:00:07.929> the<00:00:08.170> same<00:00:08.380> design<00:00:08.769> features

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.280 
that it has the same design features

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.140 
that it has the same design features
structure<00:00:10.150> as<00:00:10.300> the<00:00:10.480> 49<00:00:10.960> we<00:00:11.050> saw<00:00:11.200> before<00:00:12.150> same

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150

feel to it really the key
differentiations<00:00:20.710> between<00:00:20.710> we<00:00:21.220> went<00:00:21.430> through

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
differentiations between we went through

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.330 
differentiations between we went through
on<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:21.730> 14<00:00:22.150> and<00:00:22.360> the<00:00:22.500> 17<00:00:23.500> you're<00:00:24.040> getting<00:00:24.250> a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
on the 14 and the 17 you're getting a

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.030 
on the 14 and the 17 you're getting a
big<00:00:24.580> step<00:00:24.850> up<00:00:25.060> in<00:00:25.240> performance<00:00:25.750> so<00:00:26.260> on<00:00:26.470> a<00:00:26.500> 17

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
big step up in performance so on a 17

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
able to get inside it's one of our core

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.630 
able to get inside it's one of our core
centers<00:01:02.710> want<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:02.980> make<00:01:03.070> sure<00:01:03.100> people<00:01:03.219> have

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
centers want to make sure people have

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.910 
centers want to make sure people have
that<00:01:03.820> experience<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.469> life<00:01:05.619> of<00:01:05.799> their

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
that experience with the life of their

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.980 
that experience with the life of their
system<00:01:06.340> so

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
system so

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.440 
system so
so<00:01:08.560> yeah<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.860> biggest<00:01:09.159> difference<00:01:09.460> is<00:01:09.610> also

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
so yeah the biggest difference is also

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.380 
so yeah the biggest difference is also
from<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.750> panel<00:01:11.079> size<00:01:11.290> but<00:01:11.560> alienware<00:01:12.009> 17<00:01:12.390> we

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
from a panel size but alienware 17 we

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.350 
from a panel size but alienware 17 we
have<00:01:13.509> a<00:01:13.540> 3d<00:01:13.930> option<00:01:14.140> as<00:01:14.409> well<00:01:14.470> so<00:01:15.330> right<00:01:16.330> now

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
have a 3d option as well so right now

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.789 
have a 3d option as well so right now
we're<00:01:16.570> not<00:01:16.689> showing<00:01:16.810> in<00:01:17.110> 3d<00:01:17.229> but<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.649> comes

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
we're not showing in 3d but it comes

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.440 
we're not showing in 3d but it comes

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
steel-reinforced cage on the back and

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.069 
steel-reinforced cage on the back and
really<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.159> to<00:03:31.370> minimize<00:03:31.879> the<00:03:32.569> flex<00:03:32.870> on<00:03:33.049> the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
really it is to minimize the flex on the

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.110 
really it is to minimize the flex on the
system<00:03:33.560> right<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:34.129> can<00:03:34.280> obviously<00:03:34.549> bend<00:03:34.969> this

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
system right I can obviously bend this

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.479 
system right I can obviously bend this
when<00:03:35.359> it's<00:03:35.480> in<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.689> scenario<00:03:36.219> but<00:03:37.219> when<00:03:37.370> i'm

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
when it's in the scenario but when i'm

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.759 
when it's in the scenario but when i'm
doing<00:03:37.730> this<00:03:38.060> i'm<00:03:38.329> going<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.199> see<00:03:39.349> minimal

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
doing this i'm going to see minimal

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.589 
doing this i'm going to see minimal
flexing<00:03:40.189> the<00:03:40.280> keys<00:03:40.519> on<00:03:40.879> when<00:03:41.120> i'm<00:03:41.209> doing<00:03:41.359> that

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
flexing the keys on when i'm doing that

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.610 
flexing the keys on when i'm doing that
right<00:03:41.780> this<00:03:42.439> is<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.620> really<00:03:42.949> important<00:03:43.370> part

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.940 

now<00:03:46.129> I'll<00:03:46.280> take<00:03:46.459> out<00:03:47.200> once<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.349> take<00:03:48.560> off<00:03:48.739> the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
now I'll take out once you take off the

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.160 
now I'll take out once you take off the
top<00:03:49.129> panel<00:03:49.370> which<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.180> very<00:03:50.450> easy<00:03:50.629> to<00:03:50.780> pull<00:03:51.019> up

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
top panel which is very easy to pull up

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.839 
top panel which is very easy to pull up
there's<00:03:51.349> no<00:03:51.409> screws<00:03:51.860> to<00:03:52.010> take<00:03:52.190> that<00:03:52.370> top<00:03:52.640> man

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
there's no screws to take that top man

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.390 
there's no screws to take that top man
along<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.450> mean<00:03:53.870> just<00:03:53.900> all<00:03:54.140> lips<00:03:54.379> up<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:55.220> see

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
along I mean just all lips up you see

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.940 
along I mean just all lips up you see
the<00:03:55.519> inside<00:03:55.849> of<00:03:55.879> the<00:03:56.090> system<00:03:56.480> all<00:03:57.200> very<00:03:57.560> clean

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the inside of the system all very clean

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.220 
the inside of the system all very clean
crazy<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.879> get<00:03:59.030> into<00:03:59.269> you<00:03:59.360> have<00:03:59.480> two<00:03:59.720> memory

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
crazy to get into you have two memory

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.110 
crazy to get into you have two memory
slots<00:04:00.500> here<00:04:00.769> you<00:04:01.220> can<00:04:01.370> afraid<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:01.760> yourself

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
slots here you can afraid that yourself

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.110 
slots here you can afraid that yourself
later<00:04:02.299> on<00:04:02.480> if<00:04:02.599> you<00:04:02.690> want<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:03.340> we<00:04:04.340> have<00:04:04.459> an<00:04:04.579> msata

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
later on if you want to we have an msata

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.030 
later on if you want to we have an msata
hard<00:04:05.510> drive<00:04:05.780> gear<00:04:06.049> so<00:04:06.260> it's<00:04:06.409> a<00:04:06.470> solid-state

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
hard drive gear so it's a solid-state

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.610 
hard drive gear so it's a solid-state
memory<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.940> can<00:04:08.090> have<00:04:08.180> up<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.390> 128<00:04:09.230> gigs<00:04:09.470> of

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
memory you can have up to 128 gigs of

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.470 
memory you can have up to 128 gigs of
solid-state<00:04:09.920> memory<00:04:10.159> just<00:04:11.060> on<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.360> little

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
solid-state memory just on that little

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.750 
solid-state memory just on that little
chip<00:04:11.780> right<00:04:11.930> there<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.950> then<00:04:13.340> on<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.549> bottom

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
chip right there and then on the bottom

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.030 
chip right there and then on the bottom
is<00:04:14.000> really<00:04:14.360> where<00:04:14.510> story<00:04:14.989> comes<00:04:15.170> through<00:04:15.409> so

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
is really where story comes through so

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.550 
is really where story comes through so
you<00:04:16.100> have<00:04:16.190> two<00:04:16.370> screws<00:04:16.699> one<00:04:17.030> year<00:04:17.239> one<00:04:17.389> year

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
you have two screws one year one year

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.840 
you have two screws one year one year
take<00:04:18.560> them<00:04:18.739> out<00:04:18.889> and<00:04:19.070> then<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.400> panel<00:04:19.669> just

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
take them out and then the panel just

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.120 
take them out and then the panel just
slides<00:04:20.060> off<00:04:20.239> well<00:04:20.660> very<00:04:21.440> easy<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.859> get<00:04:21.949> into

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
slides off well very easy to get into

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.960 
slides off well very easy to get into
and<00:04:22.550> this<00:04:23.449> is<00:04:23.600> what<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.840> inside<00:04:24.080> looks<00:04:24.110> like

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
and this is what the inside looks like

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.279 
and this is what the inside looks like
so<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.060> have<00:04:26.180> two<00:04:26.330> more<00:04:26.510> memory<00:04:26.840> slots<00:04:27.110> here

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
so you have two more memory slots here

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.379 
so you have two more memory slots here
so<00:04:27.410> is<00:04:27.590> where<00:04:27.740> you<00:04:27.800> get<00:04:27.889> up<00:04:27.979> to<00:04:28.100> 32<00:04:28.580> but<00:04:29.240> the

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
so is where you get up to 32 but the

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.210 
so is where you get up to 32 but the
real<00:04:29.570> story<00:04:29.900> comes<00:04:30.199> to<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:30.440> thermal<00:04:30.860> cooling

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
real story comes to the thermal cooling

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.189 
real story comes to the thermal cooling
solution<00:04:31.699> this<00:04:32.389> is<00:04:32.510> where<00:04:32.660> your<00:04:32.810> graphics

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
solution this is where your graphics

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.570 
solution this is where your graphics
card<00:04:33.260> sets<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:34.280> have<00:04:34.370> your<00:04:34.550> own

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
card sets and you have your own

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.240 
card sets and you have your own
individual<00:04:35.570> cooling<00:04:35.990> solution<00:04:36.440> just<00:04:36.979> for<00:04:37.190> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
individual cooling solution just for the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.860 
individual cooling solution just for the
graphics<00:04:37.669> card<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.360> have<00:04:38.449> copper

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
graphics card so you have copper

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.480 
graphics card so you have copper
heatpipes<00:04:39.110> that<00:04:39.500> runs<00:04:39.740> from<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.010> heatsink

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
heatpipes that runs from the heatsink

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.159 
heatpipes that runs from the heatsink
competition<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.270> blower<00:04:41.510> blowing<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.080> out

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
competition the blower blowing it out

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.110 
competition the blower blowing it out
the<00:04:42.320> back<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.770> then<00:04:43.370> a<00:04:43.400> separate<00:04:43.910> cooling

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
the back and then a separate cooling

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.790 
the back and then a separate cooling
solution<00:04:44.600> for<00:04:44.780> your<00:04:44.870> processor<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.590> change

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
solution for your processor and change

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.080 
solution for your processor and change
and<00:04:46.039> having<00:04:46.460> these<00:04:46.580> separate<00:04:47.000> cooling

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
and having these separate cooling

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.210 
and having these separate cooling
solutions<00:04:47.600> really<00:04:47.840> what<00:04:47.990> allows<00:04:48.289> you<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:49.070> have

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
solutions really what allows you to have

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.100

of these two hard drives plus the M side

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:00.580 
of these two hard drives plus the M side
are<00:04:59.660> you're<00:04:59.780> getting<00:04:59.840> the<00:05:00.050> three<00:05:00.229> hard<00:05:00.410> drive

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
are you're getting the three hard drive

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.370 
are you're getting the three hard drive
capabilities<00:05:01.160> on<00:05:01.310> edge<00:05:01.490> you<00:05:02.270> also<00:05:02.450> have<00:05:02.780> AC
