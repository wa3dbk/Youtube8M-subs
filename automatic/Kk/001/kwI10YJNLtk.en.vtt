00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
a little bit of a decay there will turn

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.899 
a little bit of a decay there will turn
the<00:01:04.890> decamp<00:01:05.160> 12<00:01:05.399> o'clock<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.550> a<00:01:08.580> full

all<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.140> over<00:01:10.380> how<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.530> percent<00:01:10.920> decay<00:01:14.420> so

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
all the way over how to percent decay so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.690

so that's that's cool room all the way
up<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.229> decay<00:01:47.600> he<00:01:48.600> has<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.900> really<00:01:49.140> long

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
up of the decay he has a really long

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.560 
up of the decay he has a really long
decay<00:01:49.650> and<00:01:50.040> then<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> shim<00:01:50.760> setting<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.360> kind

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
decay and then the shim setting is kind

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.390 
decay and then the shim setting is kind
of<00:01:51.659> more<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.110> an<00:01:52.260> indie<00:01:52.560> rock<00:01:52.590> setting

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
of more of like an indie rock setting

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.600

and he it's really crazy sound it's like

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:08.210 
and he it's really crazy sound it's like
almost<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.940> particle<00:01:57.300> verb

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.710 

since<00:02:08.880> with<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.060> level<00:02:09.420> all<00:02:09.510> the<00:02:09.540> way<00:02:09.630> up

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
since with the level all the way up

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.280 
since with the level all the way up
we'll<00:02:09.900> go<00:02:09.990> level<00:02:10.350> back<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.650> twelve<00:02:10.950> o'clock

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
we'll go level back to twelve o'clock

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.420 
we'll go level back to twelve o'clock
and<00:02:13.290> what<00:02:13.440> kind<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.650> play<00:02:13.800> some<00:02:14.010> chords<00:02:14.250> let

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and what kind of play some chords let

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.630 
and what kind of play some chords let
here

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.130 

so<00:02:22.640> there's<00:02:22.879> a<00:02:22.909> lot<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.150> versatility<00:02:23.599> in<00:02:23.840> this

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
so there's a lot of versatility in this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.990 
so there's a lot of versatility in this
you<00:02:24.379> can<00:02:24.530> hear<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.799> de<00:02:24.920> cádiz<00:02:25.340> carrying<00:02:25.819> out

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
you can hear that de cádiz carrying out

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.720 
you can hear that de cádiz carrying out
on<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.540> Shem<00:02:26.750> setting<00:02:27.430> there's<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.489> lot<00:02:28.640> of

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
on the Shem setting there's a lot of

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.089 
on the Shem setting there's a lot of
versatility<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.360> this<00:02:29.599> in<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:29.930> pedal<00:02:30.319> 3

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
versatility in this in this pedal 3

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.110 
versatility in this in this pedal 3
differents<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.700> three<00:02:31.879> different

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
differents the three different

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.580 
differents the three different
switchable<00:02:32.510> settings<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.049> then<00:02:33.140> all<00:02:33.319> of<00:02:33.349> your

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
switchable settings and then all of your

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.039 
switchable settings and then all of your
levels<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.069> mean<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.310> can<00:02:34.430> get<00:02:34.579> a<00:02:34.640> wide<00:02:35.120> range

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
levels I mean you can get a wide range

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.410 
levels I mean you can get a wide range
of<00:02:36.349> reverb<00:02:37.310> sounds<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:37.909> I<00:02:37.970> really<00:02:38.209> fully

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
of reverb sounds so I really fully

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.360
