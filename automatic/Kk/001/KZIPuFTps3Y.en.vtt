00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
looks like comparison to a minifigure i

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.050 
looks like comparison to a minifigure i
know<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.380> axis<00:01:10.380> minifigure<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.310> that's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
know is not a axis minifigure but that's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.020

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
focus yeah there we go and then a Sten

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.440 
focus yeah there we go and then a Sten
gun<00:03:29.959> which<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.139> another<00:03:31.470> not<00:03:32.459> access<00:03:33.739> gun<00:03:34.739> but

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
gun which is another not access gun but

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.000 
gun which is another not access gun but
it<00:03:36.450> may<00:03:36.720> be<00:03:36.750> captured<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.709> know<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
it may be captured and I know the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.849 
it may be captured and I know the
Italian<00:03:38.579> Army<00:03:38.700> use<00:03:39.120> something<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.569> was<00:03:40.530> kind

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
Italian Army use something that was kind

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.940 
Italian Army use something that was kind
of<00:03:40.950> like<00:03:41.099> this<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.480> guess<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:43.200> could<00:03:43.440> say<00:03:43.680> it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
of like this so I guess you could say it

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.920 
of like this so I guess you could say it
is<00:03:44.069> access<00:03:44.609> if<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.060> put<00:03:45.989> into<00:03:46.139> thought<00:03:47.930> so

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
is access if you put into thought so

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.300 
is access if you put into thought so
yeah<00:03:49.169> then<00:03:49.650> again<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:50.450> put<00:03:51.450> everything<00:03:51.569> there<00:03:52.019> I

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
yeah then again I put everything there I

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.069 
yeah then again I put everything there I
think<00:03:53.310> all<00:03:53.519> in<00:03:53.819> all<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.359> great<00:03:54.810> thing

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
think all in all this is a great thing

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.920 
think all in all this is a great thing
to<00:03:55.139> get<00:03:55.669> it<00:03:56.669> comes<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.000> from<00:03:57.180> amazing<00:03:57.630> weapon

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
to get it comes in from amazing weapon

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.360 
to get it comes in from amazing weapon
crate<00:03:58.200> ah<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.870> improve<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.470> pack<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.950> think<00:04:02.280> it

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
crate ah to improve this pack I think it

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.250 
crate ah to improve this pack I think it
would<00:04:02.489> have<00:04:02.609> been<00:04:02.700> nice<00:04:02.940> if<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.959> came<00:04:04.109> with

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
would have been nice if it came with

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.649 
would have been nice if it came with
another<00:04:04.560> mg<00:04:04.950> 34<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:06.000> because<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.360> comes<00:04:06.540> with

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
another mg 34 just because it comes with

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.740 
another mg 34 just because it comes with
mg<00:04:07.319> 34<00:04:07.650> crate<00:04:08.219> or<00:04:08.879> just<00:04:09.090> be<00:04:09.209> nice<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.629> have

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
mg 34 crate or just be nice to have

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.420 
mg 34 crate or just be nice to have
another

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
another

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.260 
another
mp3<00:04:11.430> for<00:04:11.790> but<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:13.610> pretty<00:04:14.610> much<00:04:14.790> as<00:04:15.180> good

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
mp3 for but that is pretty much as good

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.960 
mp3 for but that is pretty much as good
as<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.660> gets<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.290> I<00:04:17.220> think<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.610> a<00:04:17.760> very

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
as it gets and I think that is a very

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.850 
as it gets and I think that is a very
good<00:04:18.270> pack<00:04:18.600> i<00:04:18.870> recommend<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.410> getting<00:04:19.620> it's

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
good pack i recommend you getting it's

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.160 
good pack i recommend you getting it's
only<00:04:20.130> twenty<00:04:20.430> dollars<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:21.090> jeburk<00:04:21.660> has<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:21.989> lot

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
only twenty dollars and jeburk has a lot

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.870 
only twenty dollars and jeburk has a lot
of<00:04:22.200> sales<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.190> could<00:04:23.310> probably<00:04:23.550> get<00:04:23.790> it

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
of sales so you could probably get it

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.360 
of sales so you could probably get it
for<00:04:23.910> less<00:04:24.060> than<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.650> show<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.830> box<00:04:26.040> art

for less than that show you the box art
