00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.389
 fifa all guys are rich for 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.910
 last inficia italy and we are here today 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.290
 with school builder for the san tournament 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.050
 patrician 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.790
 then you guys have two initial premises 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.560
 fast because in this way you don't attack me 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.350
 immediately because Jesus will come later 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.300
 any comments about it then i 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.180
 I just bought them for players 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.340
 make you the team immediately to make you for 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.019
 immediately give the video so with 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.290
 when I show you the statistics 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.629
 you see 0 games you already know everything and then 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.280
 other thing some players know there is 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.830
 some players a little bit better 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.049
 for the team, however, some are not 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.850
 they are right on the market there is for 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.549
 these bands they have created are 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.530
 rightly stolen on one side 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.239
 we saved us with that iv ii 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.000
 I will show you why they cost less 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.580
 compared to when they cost before 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.049
 swaddling clothes and for some we found ourselves ill 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.350
 but we leave immediately 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.330
 the goalkeeper I used is second 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.790
 me is great because I this team 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.890
 roughly I had already approved it before 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.109
 of the tournament to get an idea and run 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.119
 really well apart from two or three that are 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.049
 different but the goalkeeper turns well 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.899
 errant off 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.909
 you can see the prices because they are massive 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.969
 it is really difficult to take the 76 of 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.890
 tufo 70 reflex seats 72 of references and 71 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.380
 of placement for a silver goalkeeper 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.149
 rare in my opinion is great 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.060
 central defenders unfortunately the defense e 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.009
 the point a little bit weaker than the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.990
 team because the Irish are not that 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.909
 in defense both with very strong a 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.549
 defender I have that has a good one 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.340
 speed 67 maybe with umbra you get 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.469
 also at the 70 and then 71 of defense 75 of 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.539
 I would say physical that they can go work at 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.329
 good warcraft 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.909
 great for skiing, however, there is no 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.499
 version iv at the moment but I would say that 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.439
 Also this can go unfortunately flaw 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:04.249
 in speed however great defense 78 e 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.639
 good physical 72 right back 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:10.399
 coleman upgrade we used it a 

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:13.060
 lot and 14 games and I liked it 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.040
 a lot also in other teams then 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.200
 highly recommended left-back I'm 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.090
 speaking of o'brien which does not seem to me 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.099
 as bad as work 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.810
 I think it can go because it is always 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.269
 in defense as the defense is not 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.849
 much at least helps and does not go up too much e 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.269
 then 73 defended the 72 of the tax in my opinion 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:34.340
 then the 2 cc I put them are excellent 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.310
 especially for the defensive phase seen 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.470
 that we have a good attack 1 and mccarthy 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.390
 oh well you all know great workers 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.420
 is always behind and features 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.830
 very very balanced then other cc 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.500
 always defensive and gibson maybe he didn't 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.950
 much speed but see defense 74 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.590
 and 74 building with 78 of passage and 4 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.290
 weak foot stars so perfect then 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.950
 the coc is the first hit of this one 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.970
 team 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.860
 oh well it's robbie keane costs as a price 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.329
 up to 140 thousand which in the end can 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.720
 also stand because a great player 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.489
 I've already tried it outside of 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.430
 St. Patrick's tournament of course in a 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.700
 crazy long shot 86 shooting is really 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.299
 forte then 76 of passage 15 or ride can 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.310
 do without problems as here unfortunately 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.620
 I managed to take this like 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.480
 decent player let's say so 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.780
 others are a bit went to evening steals 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.400
 there are many external claims or as and is 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.530
 I told myself that since it is a good speed 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.829
 I will exploit it I think especially for 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.139
 cross in the middle at this point then a 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.060
 oh well I think it will use it all 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.849
 world and emme who says these 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.690
 great fantastic speed possibility 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.340
 dribbling is a shot that is not bad 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.500
 jokes perfect here too i think 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.780
 doctors will be in all the teams of the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.859
 patrician tournament and then the tip 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.669
 central is shane long and how could I not 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:07.280
 use he 85 speed and 79 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.989
 then retirement is also strong of head that 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.870
 I tried it outside this 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.340
 tournament guys this belief is amazing 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.310
 that I liked already in its version 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.900
 unif with this version becomes 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.419
 fortissimo also find the review on 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.910
 our channel then very strong this 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.250
 like that nice guys this is the team 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.170
 according to me it can turn really well us 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.280
 we try to win this tournament of 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.990
 Saint Patrick 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.330

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.580
