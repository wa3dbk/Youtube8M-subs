00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
longer about grinding leveling up

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.800 
longer about grinding leveling up
getting<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:30.670> point<00:04:30.940> where<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.360> can<00:04:31.540> just

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
getting to that point where you can just

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.720 
getting to that point where you can just
destroy<00:04:32.440> everyone<00:04:32.740> with<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.100> best<00:04:33.310> skill<00:04:33.610> in

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
destroy everyone with the best skill in

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.970 
destroy everyone with the best skill in
the<00:04:33.820> game<00:04:34.000> no<00:04:34.330> it's<00:04:34.510> more<00:04:34.750> about<00:04:34.870> taking<00:04:35.860> out

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
the game no it's more about taking out

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.530 
the game no it's more about taking out
the<00:04:36.130> right<00:04:36.340> enemies<00:04:36.760> in<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.120> right<00:04:37.300> order

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540
