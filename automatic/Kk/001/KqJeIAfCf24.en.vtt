00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.090
 the thing first 9 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.220
 because it goes to the Hanseatic city 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.060
 hamburg I'm just wondering why 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.060
 actually airports 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.099
 was there apparently no one 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.230
 not better for me then it is 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.730
 hopefully decency so full in the 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.670
 camera in any case with what I mean 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:41.020
 the proven 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:54.909
 this is the children's playground 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:57.100
 her the thing now to hamburg in the 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.040
 camera with to turn and then we see 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.080
 right back in the Hanseatic city 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:07.500
 we have a problem is that out 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.500
 we all stood together 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:20.370
 namely on the camera camera is 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.370
 dry again 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:39.810
 a maximum of five parts I have almost look 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.810
 we can see you here too 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.800
 1 hour now we are so nice 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.020
 slowUp 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.020
 with coffee and cake 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.420
 after red bull 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.229
 sneaking into youtube is currently 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.489
 Yes 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.730
 it tastes incredibly delicious 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:16.430
 that brings him that much 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.900
 2004 but at least got caught 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.909
 but now it has already 25 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.680
 minutes late she is for it 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.680
 known that she is generally late 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.630
 I think he sits far too 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.819
 attributable 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.030
 It is open information 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.030
 to have 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.790
 unwound 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.790
 With 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.250
 red 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.379
 We have now rotating break and so 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:03:06.299
 slowly is a bit dark 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:03:25.590
 I now in the sunset and 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:27.450
 Timo Wess with the world's best hockey 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.099
 challenge in the harbor city and I think 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.669
 the worst we have immediately change 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.150
 we do not wear that through the area 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.150
 always the hardest 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.419
 the topic really easy if you like that 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.419
 have to carry a lot 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.580
 Great I think I win one 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:18.420
 had self-study something like that 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:18.420
 or say so too 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.700
 that is a typical picture when 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.700
 spin of joyce 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.140
 actually exhausting 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:06.699
 because maybe you 're the underground 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.699
 knowledge 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.879
 that's marta I have now 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.279
 fresh marta is in the editors 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.199
 this show at marta you have to 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:10.779
 say we are all behind the scenes 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:13.180
 report and now martha turns around 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:15.610
 because now it shows time 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:23.949
 com shows sometimes show what a 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:27.849
 the face was pixelated , but the ice was closed 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:34.889
 Great I may have achieved that 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:38.759
 pants sexy team take a look 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.759
 then I did not have it now 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.820
 what is it 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.730
 that now 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.540
 I have the same shit in my sleep 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.540
 from above 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.099
 just nothing 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.330
 I hope so 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.400
 there is 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.660
 red 

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.440
 Yes
