00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
issue with the marker style as you can

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.009 
issue with the marker style as you can
see<00:01:00.420> each<00:01:00.600> each<00:01:01.230> style<00:01:01.710> has<00:01:01.890> its<00:01:02.489> own

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
see each each style has its own

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.020 
see each each style has its own
backgrounds<00:01:04.019> although<00:01:04.680> some<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.070> them<00:01:05.250> may<00:01:05.670> be

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
backgrounds although some of them may be

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.920 
backgrounds although some of them may be
in<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> few<00:01:06.979> styles<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.880> example<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.479> paper

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
in a few styles for example the paper

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.000 
in a few styles for example the paper
background<00:01:10.640> now<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.939> I'm<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.860> mark<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
background now if I'm going to mark a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.480 
background now if I'm going to mark a
style<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:15.080> I<00:01:16.080> choose<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.740> whiteboard<00:01:17.159> frame

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
style and I choose the whiteboard frame

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.550 
style and I choose the whiteboard frame
and<00:01:18.320> I<00:01:19.320> character<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.780> as<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and I character here as you can see the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.810 
and I character here as you can see the
character<00:01:22.920> has<00:01:23.159> no<00:01:23.430> white<00:01:24.240> fill<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.460> but<00:01:26.460> if

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
character has no white fill in it but if

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.330 
character has no white fill in it but if
instead<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.420> would<00:01:27.630> choose<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.590> background<00:01:29.189> for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
instead I would choose a background for

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.179 
instead I would choose a background for
the<00:01:29.460> picture<00:01:30.030> style<00:01:30.530> then<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.799> see<00:01:31.979> that

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the picture style then you can see that

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.819 
the picture style then you can see that
the<00:01:32.790> character<00:01:33.420> does<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:34.079> white<00:01:34.530> fill

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the character does have white fill

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.990 
the character does have white fill
inside<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.200> reason<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.009> when<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.670> work

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
inside so the reason is that when I work

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.270 
inside so the reason is that when I work
with<00:01:39.030> markers<00:01:39.630> style<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.140> usually<00:01:40.619> want<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
with markers style I usually want the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.210 
with markers style I usually want the
character<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.700> look<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.860> drawn<00:01:43.860> on

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
character to look as if it was drawn on

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.660 
character to look as if it was drawn on
the<00:01:45.030> board<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.869> that's<00:01:46.020> an<00:01:46.229> additional<00:01:46.799> filter

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the board so that's an additional filter

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
the board so that's an additional filter
we<00:01:47.909> added<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.869> make<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.170> look<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.380> way

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
we added to to make it look that way

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.030 
we added to to make it look that way
but<00:01:50.640> when<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.360> import<00:01:51.630> images<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.619> example

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
but when you import images for example

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.609 
but when you import images for example
see<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.280> image<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.180> double<00:01:54.960> click<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
see this image I double click it and you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.160 
see this image I double click it and you
see<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.189> an<00:01:56.399> image<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:57.030> white<00:01:57.479> color<00:01:57.930> in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
see this is an image with white color in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.670 
see this is an image with white color in
it<00:01:58.350> now<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.520> copy<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:01.009> URL<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.509> I<00:02:03.509> paste<00:02:04.350> it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
it now I copy the URL and I paste it

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.469 
it now I copy the URL and I paste it
here<00:02:06.469> apply

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
here apply

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.719 
here apply
let's<00:02:08.720> see<00:02:08.929> what<00:02:09.080> happens<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:09.739> as<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.550> can

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
let's see what happens and as you can

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.240 
let's see what happens and as you can
see<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:11.750> image<00:02:12.290> just<00:02:12.650> lost<00:02:13.000> its<00:02:14.000> white<00:02:14.480> collar

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
see the image just lost its white collar

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.420 
see the image just lost its white collar
so<00:02:16.250> basically<00:02:17.030> everything<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.510> was<00:02:17.810> white

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
so basically everything that was white

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.750 
so basically everything that was white
gets<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:20.060> background<00:02:20.810> color<00:02:21.319> instead<00:02:21.760> you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
gets the background color instead you

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.670 
gets the background color instead you
see<00:02:22.970> even<00:02:23.360> here<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:23.750> can<00:02:23.930> see<00:02:24.110> what<00:02:24.260> happens

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
see even here you can see what happens

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.809 
see even here you can see what happens
so<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:26.030> can<00:02:26.349> work<00:02:27.349> beautifully<00:02:27.980> if<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.550> want

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
so this can work beautifully if you want

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.759 
so this can work beautifully if you want
your<00:02:29.150> character<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.810> look<00:02:30.110> as<00:02:30.290> if<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.560> was

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
your character to look as if it was

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.930 
your character to look as if it was
drawn<00:02:31.670> on<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.330> board<00:02:32.660> but<00:02:33.620> sometimes<00:02:34.340> when

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
drawn on the board but sometimes when

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.580 
drawn on the board but sometimes when
you<00:02:35.060> have<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.269> more<00:02:35.480> realistic<00:02:35.780> character<00:02:36.349> you

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
you have a more realistic character you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.589 
you have a more realistic character you
just<00:02:36.890> don't<00:02:37.160> want<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.849> be<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.180> way

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
just don't want it to be that way

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.720 
just don't want it to be that way
so<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.349> should<00:02:39.799> be<00:02:39.950> aware<00:02:40.069> that<00:02:40.280> each<00:02:40.700> of

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
so you should be aware that each of

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.390 
so you should be aware that each of
these<00:02:41.060> backgrounds<00:02:41.900> in<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.709> marker<00:02:43.099> style

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
these backgrounds in the marker style

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.350 
these backgrounds in the marker style
has<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.239> same<00:02:44.510> effect<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:46.459> if<00:02:46.730> we<00:02:46.880> don't<00:02:47.090> want

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
has the same effect so if we don't want

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.600 
has the same effect so if we don't want
that<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.840> happen<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.380> just<00:02:48.709> have<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.160> pick<00:02:49.340> a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
that to happen you just have to pick a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.839 
that to happen you just have to pick a
background<00:02:49.880> from<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.890> picture<00:02:52.250> style<00:02:52.549> and
