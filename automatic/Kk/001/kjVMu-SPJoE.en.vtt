00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
together and a nice thing about this

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.170 
together and a nice thing about this
guitar<00:01:19.290> they're<00:01:19.619> made<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.920> China<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.790> they

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
guitar they're made in China but they

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.670 
guitar they're made in China but they
are<00:01:21.330> then<00:01:22.170> shipped<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.759> US<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.530> set<00:01:25.530> up

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
are then shipped to the US and set up

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.929

before<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.729> send<00:01:27.060> them<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.590> jobs<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> that's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
before they send them to jobs so that's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.469 
before they send them to jobs so that's
a<00:01:30.090> big<00:01:30.299> thing<00:01:31.549> because<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.119> look<00:01:33.299> at

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
a big thing because then they look at

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.780 
a big thing because then they look at
all<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.810> fine<00:01:34.320> details<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.670> very

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
all the fine details and it's it's very

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.640 
all the fine details and it's it's very
well-made<00:01:37.729> feels<00:01:38.729> very<00:01:38.939> solid<00:01:39.210> feels<00:01:39.689> yeah

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
well-made feels very solid feels yeah

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.770 
well-made feels very solid feels yeah
there's<00:01:40.920> nothing's<00:01:41.340> pointing<00:01:42.150> out<00:01:42.270> anywhere

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
there's nothing's pointing out anywhere

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.469 
there's nothing's pointing out anywhere
and<00:01:43.200> all<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> parts<00:01:44.430> seems<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.180> hold<00:01:45.270> together

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
and all the parts seems to hold together

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.980 
and all the parts seems to hold together
well<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:47.540> materials<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.630> hardware<00:01:48.720> gets<00:01:49.320> an<00:01:49.470> 8

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
well so materials and hardware gets an 8

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.899 
well so materials and hardware gets an 8
the<00:01:51.990> only<00:01:52.229> thing<00:01:52.409> I'm<00:01:52.560> maybe<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.189> crazy<00:01:53.700> about

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
the only thing I'm maybe not crazy about

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.719 
the only thing I'm maybe not crazy about
this<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.450> headstock<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:58.070> seems<00:01:59.070> very<00:01:59.460> easy

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
this this headstock and seems very easy

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.679 
this this headstock and seems very easy
to<00:01:59.880> break<00:02:00.090> it

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.249 

but<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.009> gave<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.579> a<00:02:07.610> 7<00:02:08.509> for<00:02:08.720> build<00:02:08.959> quality

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
but so I gave it a 7 for build quality

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.320 
but so I gave it a 7 for build quality
durability<00:02:09.860> but<00:02:12.640> other<00:02:13.640> than<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.300> seems

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
durability but other than that it seems

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.660 
durability but other than that it seems
rather<00:02:14.780> solid<00:02:17.170> it's<00:02:18.170> graphic<00:02:18.769> you<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:18.920> love
