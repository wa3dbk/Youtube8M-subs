and<00:01:24.740> we<00:01:25.460> also<00:01:25.610> learned<00:01:25.909> about<00:01:25.970> different

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
and we also learned about different

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.480 
and we also learned about different
types<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:26.600> energy<00:01:26.990> by<00:01:27.430> experimenting<00:01:28.430> with

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
types of energy by experimenting with

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.550 
types of energy by experimenting with
different<00:01:28.670> things<00:01:29.030> at<00:01:29.780> different<00:01:29.810> stations

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
building and so that was going to take

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.740 
building and so that was going to take
on<00:02:18.440> our<00:02:18.470> website<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.910> race<00:02:20.240> for<00:02:20.270> awareness

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.440 
on our website so the race for awareness
with<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.140> school<00:02:21.350> community<00:02:21.530> we<00:02:22.460> did<00:02:22.700> Climaco

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
with the school community we did Climaco

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.290

chain<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.680> basically<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.360> earth<00:02:29.660> and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
chain so basically it's the earth and

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.490 
chain so basically it's the earth and
each<00:02:30.620> generation<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:32.000> part<00:02:32.240> of<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.420> check<00:02:32.690> so

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
each generation is a part of a check so

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.130 
each generation is a part of a check so
it<00:02:33.560> all<00:02:33.770> goes<00:02:33.980> into<00:02:34.310> one<00:02:34.640> chain<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.330> then<00:02:35.540> now

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
it all goes into one chain and then now

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.830 
it all goes into one chain and then now
in<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.340> last<00:02:37.490> generation<00:02:37.730> there's<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.630> lock

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
in the last generation there's a lock

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.170 
in the last generation there's a lock
and<00:02:39.080> we<00:02:39.380> can<00:02:39.590> break<00:02:39.800> that<00:02:40.010> chain<00:02:40.070> because<00:02:40.910> we

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
and we can break that chain because we

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.270 
and we can break that chain because we
are<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.360> key<00:02:41.690> in<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.290> generation<00:02:42.710> who<00:02:43.100> can

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
are the key in this generation who can

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.620 
are the key in this generation who can
unlock<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:44.410> break<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.590> chain<00:02:45.920> in<00:02:46.730> global

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630

to<00:04:16.000> install<00:04:16.510> solar<00:04:16.780> panels<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.470> in<00:04:18.310> the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
to install solar panels and in the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.550 
to install solar panels and in the
holidays<00:04:18.790> we<00:04:19.060> make<00:04:19.299> electricity<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:20.350> feed

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560

back into the grid actually learn to

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.700 
back into the grid actually learn to
really<00:04:24.220> cool<00:04:24.490> fact<00:04:24.790> it's<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.690> every<00:04:26.290> minute

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
really cool fact it's that every minute

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.340 
really cool fact it's that every minute
enough<00:04:27.100> energy<00:04:27.400> arrives<00:04:28.270> on<00:04:28.420> earth<00:04:28.660> to<00:04:29.200> meet

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
enough energy arrives on earth to meet

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.560 
enough energy arrives on earth to meet
our<00:04:29.530> demands<00:04:29.920> for<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.340> whole<00:04:30.520> year<00:04:30.570> but

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
our demands for a whole year but

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.120 
our demands for a whole year but
unfortunately<00:04:31.600> we<00:04:32.590> aren't<00:04:32.680> harness<00:04:33.010> it

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
unfortunately we aren't harness it

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.240 
unfortunately we aren't harness it
properly<00:04:33.540> so<00:04:34.540> that's<00:04:34.720> why<00:04:34.930> I<00:04:34.960> solar<00:04:35.440> energy

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
properly so that's why I solar energy

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.330 
properly so that's why I solar energy
solar<00:04:36.580> power<00:04:36.850> is<00:04:37.120> so<00:04:37.300> important

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.420
