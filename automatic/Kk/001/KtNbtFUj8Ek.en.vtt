it will do 1080 that's only at 30 frames
so<00:00:24.449> because<00:00:25.020> we're<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.230> relatively<00:00:25.830> low

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
so because we're in relatively low

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.650 
so because we're in relatively low

you how I'm going to fit these motor

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.799 
you how I'm going to fit these motor
power<00:00:40.110> heated<00:00:40.680> grips<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.420> best<00:00:42.660> for

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
power heated grips and to my best for

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.470 
power heated grips and to my best for
GTS<00:00:43.140> 300<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.280> go<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.000> flip

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
GTS 300 so here we go I'm going to flip

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.090 
GTS 300 so here we go I'm going to flip
this<00:00:48.540> into<00:00:48.899> macro<00:00:49.290> mode<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.710> hopefully<00:00:50.010> we

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
this into macro mode and hopefully we

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.049 
this into macro mode and hopefully we
can<00:00:51.710> have<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.040> bit<00:00:53.340> closer<00:00:53.640> look<00:00:53.879> at<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
can have a just a bit closer look at the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.209 
can have a just a bit closer look at the
bits<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.540> pieces<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.020> come<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.620> wood

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
bits and pieces that come with the wood

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.200 
bits and pieces that come with the wood
grips<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:59.039> we've<00:00:59.190> got<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.460> first<00:00:59.910> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
grips so what we've got here first of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.760 
grips so what we've got here first of
all<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.160> control<00:01:02.579> unit<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> can

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
all is a little control unit so you can

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.830 
all is a little control unit so you can
see<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.160> there<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.759> got<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> three-position

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
see that there it's got a three-position

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.150 
see that there it's got a three-position
switch<00:01:07.050> in<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.380> middle<00:01:07.590> position<00:01:07.920> where<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
switch in the middle position where it

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.760 
switch in the middle position where it
is<00:01:08.250> now<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.610> off<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.020> flip<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.289> up<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
is now it's off and then flip it up and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.309 
is now it's off and then flip it up and
its<00:01:11.069> high<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.340> flip<00:01:11.819> it<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.330> slow<00:01:12.569> or

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:13.319 
its high and flip it down and it slow or

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:14.449 
its high and flip it down and it slow or
maybe<00:01:13.590> get<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> way<00:01:13.890> around<00:01:13.979> or<00:01:14.220> maybe<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:14.459 
maybe get the way around or maybe the

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:16.490 
maybe get the way around or maybe the
holder<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.880> way<00:01:15.050> what<00:01:16.050> I've<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.200> said

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
holder that way what I've just said

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.430 
holder that way what I've just said

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
the bike rugs going to flip back to

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.529 
the bike rugs going to flip back to
normal<00:01:56.369> mode<00:01:56.550> on<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.119> camera<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> first

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
normal mode on the camera so the first

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:01.729 
normal mode on the camera so the first
part<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:01.080> what<00:02:01.229> i'm<00:02:01.319> actually<00:02:01.410> going<00:02:01.649> to

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
part that's what i'm actually going to

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:07.540 
part that's what i'm actually going to
try<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:04.880> take<00:02:05.880> this

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
try and do is and take this

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.790 
try and do is and take this
I<00:02:07.810> think<00:02:08.810> I'll<00:02:08.900> need<00:02:08.990> to<00:02:09.080> go<00:02:09.140> back<00:02:09.290> into<00:02:09.410> macro

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
I think I'll need to go back into macro

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:23.670 
I think I'll need to go back into macro
mode<00:02:09.979> now<00:02:17.710> there<00:02:18.710> we<00:02:18.860> go<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:20.060> if<00:02:20.120> we<00:02:20.210> take<00:02:20.240> this

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.660 

let's<00:02:24.680> say<00:02:24.890> I've<00:02:24.980> already<00:02:25.100> taken<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.520> back

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
let's say I've already taken the back

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.110 
let's say I've already taken the back
off<00:02:25.850> it<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.620> what<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:27.830> want<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.040> do<00:02:28.250> is<00:02:28.520> mount<00:02:28.940> it
