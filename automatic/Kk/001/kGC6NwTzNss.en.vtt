on each side now we'll go ahead and
double<00:02:58.960> check<00:02:59.170> our<00:02:59.320> marks<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.650> we<00:02:59.770> made

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
double check our marks that we made

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.980 
double check our marks that we made
earlier<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.640> line<00:03:01.240> it<00:03:01.270> up<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.600> then<00:03:01.780> we'll<00:03:01.900> go

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
earlier and line it up and then we'll go

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.140 
earlier and line it up and then we'll go
ahead<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.260> tighten<00:03:02.410> down<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.950> knobs<00:03:03.250> we

don't have to over tighten them just to

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.500 
don't have to over tighten them just to
where<00:03:05.590> it's<00:03:05.740> firm<00:03:05.950> once<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.030> have<00:03:07.150> both<00:03:07.270> sides

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
where it's firm once you have both sides

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.330 
where it's firm once you have both sides
tightened<00:03:07.930> down<00:03:07.990> we'll<00:03:08.740> go<00:03:08.890> ahead<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.160> unfold

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340

it<00:03:57.390> against<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.660> cab<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.110> make<00:03:58.230> sure<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.410> makes

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
it against the cab to make sure it makes

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.950 
it against the cab to make sure it makes
good<00:03:58.770> contact<00:03:58.980> all<00:03:59.970> right<00:04:00.150> then<00:04:00.660> we'll<00:04:00.750> go<00:04:00.930> to

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
good contact all right then we'll go to

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.320 
good contact all right then we'll go to
the<00:04:01.140> each<00:04:01.380> side<00:04:01.710> of<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:01.920> cab<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.430> measure<00:04:03.120> out

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
the each side of the cab I measure out

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.430 
the each side of the cab I measure out
what<00:04:03.450> we<00:04:03.540> need<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:03.900> this<00:04:04.110> case<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
what we need in this case the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.810

about<00:04:06.300> three<00:04:06.540> inches<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.050> then<00:04:07.680> start<00:04:07.980> our

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
about three inches and then start our

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.030 
about three inches and then start our

pad we made a mark and then put her pad

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.280 
pad we made a mark and then put her pad
on<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.400> edge<00:04:11.490> and<00:04:11.820> then<00:04:12.240> lightly<00:04:12.660> attached<00:04:13.080> it

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
on the edge and then lightly attached it

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.820 
on the edge and then lightly attached it
and<00:04:13.470> did<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.620> quick<00:04:13.770> test<00:04:14.070> fit<00:04:14.250> against<00:04:14.490> the<00:04:14.640> cab

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
and did a quick test fit against the cab

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.080 
and did a quick test fit against the cab
once<00:04:16.830> we're<00:04:16.950> satisfied<00:04:17.070> with<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.700> we'll<00:04:17.970> go
