00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
him in at age seven if you're doing the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.120

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
right things and is enjoying himself in

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.559 
right things and is enjoying himself in
the<00:03:32.220> lighting<00:03:32.400> environment<00:03:32.639> you'll<00:03:33.209> keep<00:03:33.510> him

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
the lighting environment you'll keep him

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.229 
the lighting environment you'll keep him
until<00:03:33.989> he's<00:03:34.470> under<00:03:34.739> 16<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.489> then<00:03:36.060> hopefully

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
until he's under 16 and then hopefully

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.580 
until he's under 16 and then hopefully
then<00:03:36.599> get<00:03:36.780> him<00:03:36.840> on<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> two-year<00:03:37.319> scholarship

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
then get him on a two-year scholarship

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.069 
then get him on a two-year scholarship
and<00:03:38.099> I<00:03:39.000> think<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.299> becomes<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.630> little<00:03:39.840> bit<00:03:39.930> more

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
and I think it becomes a little bit more

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.199 
and I think it becomes a little bit more
difficult<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.620> get<00:03:40.769> kids<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.340> say<00:03:41.639> Frances<00:03:42.090> of

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
difficult to get kids and say Frances of

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.470 
difficult to get kids and say Frances of
the<00:03:42.299> 14<00:03:42.720> year<00:03:42.930> old<00:03:43.109> oh<00:03:43.670> not<00:03:44.670> being<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:45.359> know

the 14 year old oh not being you know

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.349 
the 14 year old oh not being you know
being<00:03:45.780> bought<00:03:46.109> by<00:03:46.139> another<00:03:47.010> club<00:03:47.340> it's<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> lot

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
being bought by another club it's a lot

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:49.879 
being bought by another club it's a lot
easier<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.810> get<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.019> minute<00:03:49.290> young<00:03:49.410> gate<00:03:49.680> and

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
easier to get a minute young gate and

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.860 
easier to get a minute young gate and
then<00:03:49.950> keep<00:03:50.160> him<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.489> club<00:03:50.720> because<00:03:51.720> you're

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
then keep him in the club because you're

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.020 
then keep him in the club because you're
very<00:03:52.049> rarely<00:03:52.319> fine<00:03:52.620> boys<00:03:52.950> playing<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.700> this

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
skating and yeah I mean I think what

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.479 
skating and yeah I mean I think what
you've<00:04:10.650> gotta<00:04:10.799> do<00:04:10.919> is<00:04:11.069> create<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.370> right

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
you've gotta do is create the right

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.099 
you've gotta do is create the right
environment<00:04:11.549> so<00:04:12.090> first<00:04:12.359> of<00:04:12.480> all<00:04:12.599> you<00:04:12.780> staff

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
going to make it to the top standard

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:04.760 
going to make it to the top standard
know<00:05:03.569> exactly<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.169> like<00:05:04.500> for<00:05:04.710> instance

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
know exactly and like for instance

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.350 
know exactly and like for instance
obviously<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.430> goal<00:05:05.550> their<00:05:05.729> free<00:05:05.970> afternoons

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
obviously the goal their free afternoons

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.379 
obviously the goal their free afternoons
a<00:05:06.479> week<00:05:06.509> so<00:05:06.900> they<00:05:07.050> do<00:05:07.110> do<00:05:07.970> continue<00:05:08.970> their

i think all clubs will have a
personality<00:07:20.049> profile<00:07:20.679> and<00:07:21.269> it's<00:07:22.269> quite<00:07:22.569> you

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:26.889 
would spit the usually we use it and I

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:28.799 
would spit the usually we use it and I
apps<00:07:27.069> which<00:07:27.279> is<00:07:27.429> like<00:07:27.609> speed<00:07:28.029> personality

00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:28.809 
apps which is like speed personality

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:31.169 
apps which is like speed personality
intelligence<00:07:29.169> technique<00:07:29.919> every<00:07:30.819> club<00:07:31.059> will

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:31.179 
intelligence technique every club will

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:33.839 
intelligence technique every club will
have<00:07:31.269> different<00:07:31.509> personality<00:07:32.289> profiles<00:07:32.849> and

have different personality profiles and

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:35.159 
have different personality profiles and
I<00:07:33.909> think<00:07:34.089> from<00:07:34.239> West<00:07:34.599> Bottoms<00:07:34.749> point<00:07:35.019> of<00:07:35.079> view

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:35.169 
I think from West Bottoms point of view

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:36.749 
I think from West Bottoms point of view
you<00:07:35.319> know<00:07:35.409> it's<00:07:35.559> just<00:07:35.619> it<00:07:35.919> you<00:07:36.069> know<00:07:36.489> there's

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 
you know it's just it you know there's

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:38.249 
you know it's just it you know there's
certain<00:07:36.969> things<00:07:37.149> that<00:07:37.389> we<00:07:37.689> want<00:07:37.869> to<00:07:37.899> speed<00:07:38.139> up

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:38.259 
certain things that we want to speed up

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:40.979 
certain things that we want to speed up
ously<00:07:38.469> speed<00:07:38.949> and<00:07:39.219> power<00:07:39.399> is<00:07:39.759> a<00:07:40.209> big<00:07:40.599> thing<00:07:40.809> in

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:40.989 
ously speed and power is a big thing in

00:07:40.989 --> 00:07:43.259 
ously speed and power is a big thing in
the<00:07:41.079> game<00:07:41.259> at<00:07:41.409> the<00:07:41.499> minute<00:07:41.739> now<00:07:42.249> that<00:07:43.089> doesn't

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:43.269 
the game at the minute now that doesn't

00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:44.519 
the game at the minute now that doesn't
necessarily<00:07:43.509> mean<00:07:43.929> you're<00:07:44.049> gonna<00:07:44.169> be<00:07:44.319> able<00:07:44.409> to

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:44.529 
necessarily mean you're gonna be able to

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:45.899 
necessarily mean you're gonna be able to
spot<00:07:44.709> things<00:07:44.769> like<00:07:45.189> in<00:07:45.399> an<00:07:45.489> eight-year-old

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:45.909 
spot things like in an eight-year-old

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:47.669 
spot things like in an eight-year-old
because<00:07:46.179> they<00:07:46.779> develop<00:07:47.109> you've<00:07:47.259> got<00:07:47.379> so<00:07:47.619> many

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:47.679 
because they develop you've got so many

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:49.829 
because they develop you've got so many
physical<00:07:48.069> demands<00:07:48.549> on<00:07:48.639> him<00:07:48.759> so<00:07:48.999> I<00:07:49.209> think<00:07:49.599> it's

00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:49.839 
physical demands on him so I think it's

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:52.169 
physical demands on him so I think it's
just<00:07:49.989> having<00:07:50.079> an<00:07:50.289> eye<00:07:50.439> for<00:07:50.939> someone<00:07:51.939> who's<00:07:52.029> got

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:52.179 
just having an eye for someone who's got

00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:53.609 
just having an eye for someone who's got

I'm<00:07:53.799> a<00:07:53.889> little<00:07:54.129> bit<00:07:54.249> different<00:07:54.579> to<00:07:54.669> the<00:07:54.729> other

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:54.849

I'm a little bit different to the other
players<00:07:55.089> you<00:07:55.779> know<00:07:55.869> I<00:07:55.899> watched<00:07:56.799> my<00:07:57.309> boys<00:07:57.519> see

the<00:07:59.949> teams<00:08:00.189> you<00:08:00.369> find<00:08:00.639> where<00:08:00.849> they're<00:08:00.999> just

00:08:01.049 --> 00:08:01.059 
the teams you find where they're just

00:08:01.059 --> 00:08:02.669 
the teams you find where they're just
chasing<00:08:01.569> after<00:08:01.629> the<00:08:01.779> same<00:08:01.959> ball<00:08:02.259> and<00:08:02.499> then<00:08:02.559> you

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:02.679 
chasing after the same ball and then you

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:04.439 
chasing after the same ball and then you
see<00:08:02.889> the<00:08:03.009> clever<00:08:03.249> ones<00:08:03.459> are<00:08:03.639> going<00:08:03.909> or<00:08:04.299> I<00:08:04.360> don't
