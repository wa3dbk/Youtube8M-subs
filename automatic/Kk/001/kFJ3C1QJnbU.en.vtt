00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hi what about if you follow them in the video 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.569
 I bring you a box without surprises 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.370
 because I did not really know what was coming 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.500
 I know it's there but I only know that it's coming 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.000
 from editorial planet so it's been very 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.679
 excited to open it because that's what I'm going to 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.809
 to be able to open with you and we will be able to 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.130
 see with my otter inside here I have my 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.560
 scissors where I think I 'm not going to 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.439
 need because usually the packages 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.880
 of planets are pretty easy to 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.880
 open and chicken 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.410
 all right 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.410
 to see the first book 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.830
 Bunker Diary of Kevin Brooks No 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.780
 I have no idea what it is about 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.220
 Actually I've never seen so 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.810
 let me read the synopsis quickly 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.060
 to see what it is about 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.310
 ok I think this book is going to be my type 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.740
 of a book because it seems to be about a 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.309
 kidnapping like a guy being kidnapped 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.380
 in london and they put it in a bunker and not 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.120
 there are windows that matter to me and things 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.360
 communications and then it 's like that 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.310
 a few days later a girl comes down and 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.750
 four people more then like that 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.970
 they have to see what it is 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.410
 happening what is it that we why 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.200
 kidnapped and this kind of thing 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.610
 then complex to veins I do not know if what 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.110
 remember but already mentioned 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.900
 earlier that the book was hijacked 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.580
 I like them a lot so let's see 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.260
 I will try to read it soon and see and 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.930
 good bit more about it and then they 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.930
 I tell you what depression you feel 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.170
 connected prisoner 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.690
 by carlos garcÃ­a miranda 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.890
 heard from him ok 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.440
 this book you also listened so 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.300
 interesting apparently some students 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.270
 they were on their way to their school called 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.760
 connected and went there like that is the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.980
 train had an accident in a tunnel by 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.810
 the mountains but apparently no one has 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.580
 like the worry of looking for them 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.830
 because in the school there are people who 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.930
 have given to them that is to say there is a 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.750
 clone of each of them at school 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.910
 then you have to see why they are 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.210
 crossed you have to see why it is 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.200
 happening that and also do not feel 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.850
 know as a science fiction book 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.740
 perhaps 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.740
 the center team looks like daddy 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.080
 ok the next one is before the end of 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.210
 world operation 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.210
 of ruby or cones 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.100
 I do not know how to pronounce it 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.390
 are tones of xoconostle in ok I think that 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.120
 this book also as science 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.830
 fiction because apparently there are some 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.260
 phones that are creating a war 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.790
 civil in mexico then the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.950
 protagonists are like hackers that 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.390
 can penetrate the mind those tele 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.180
 kicks and have to save the world 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.730
 practically then the government 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.650
 asks to destroy the phone is like 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.540
 more dangerous they actually look like I 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.280
 is remembering this book to stewart 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.860
 waiting for a sanderson who also tries 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.690
 like guys who have superpowers 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.820
 but they are bad then they have to 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.530
 overthrow these kinds of things then 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.340
 If you like it, I think it's also 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.630
 it may be interesting this is not speculate 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.630
 because the next book is 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.480
 the girls of 3 that if I know it is like that 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.819
 I know him because he listened enough 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.950
 as about this book because apparently 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.350
 they are doing it like they are 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.990
 doing the comparison to this book with 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.790
 where he lost it because at the end he has 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.650
 as a pretty similar subject and if you 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.990
 like driver adopt this book 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.209
 then heard enough from him 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.130
 let me open the plastic to be able 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.130
 read the synopsis inside 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.160
 does not have the face 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.930
 does not pull synapses only has like 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.030
 small opinions about the book according to 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.190
 what he heard earlier like that 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.020
 the protagonist of this book is not 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.510
 reliable only you have can not trust 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.760
 what he is saying and apparently as 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.780
 which is a book or a thriller that in the 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.600
 that you have to find out what it is that 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.010
 happened in the person you should know 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.450
 I feel like I'm telling you nonsense 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.820
 because I'm not really sure what it's about 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.440
 but if I really want to 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.480
 read it because now he has heard things 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.050
 very good about him although there are two 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.340
 more books 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.340
 Holy God how many sent 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:34.969
 today they sent me out to this book of 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:41.529
 that I am 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:41.529
 because she is the creator of it 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.719
 of destroys this diary that in truth to 

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:49.580
 I loved it then I am very 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:51.679
 excited to have what you see has me 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.300
 a complete line of books as well as 

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:56.629
 craft of that kind of thing 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.849
 then I finally have something new 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.309
 to do but there is nothing right 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.659
 developing this book but yes the same 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.739
 if you would notice that I 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.269
 I made a video 

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:06.649
 I'm very inclined towards the ones because 

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:08.330
 they answer to me I love this the 

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:12.559
 extras this diary because there is one left 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:15.439
 more but no more because this one I think 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:16.669
 also seen in English it seems to me 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:21.080
 call 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:23.509
 for a greater hobby even though I think it 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.849
 It's about a girl who is a nerd 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.219
 basically that fight at school 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.619
 that basically like it does not feel 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:32.990
 good to herself then she wants 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:34.699
 become a model I suppose that 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.829
 it's basically about your 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.019
 transformation about how your levels of 

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:41.089
 self-esteem are varying this type of 

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:42.739
 things then I'm as cute as this 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:44.300
 that then say that what I most 

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:44.689
 excites morito, they are just this 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.759
 book 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:48.199
 and the girl on the train because I already heard 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.089
 previously on them and I've heard 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.229
 great things about good not so much 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:53.599
 about this because nobody did me 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.849
 about this one but about the girl of 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.239
 train then I think this will be one of 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:03.559
 the next thing to read is here are the 

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:04.879
 loins of the books there but yes many 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:06.739
 thanks everyone's plan was always 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.569
 conscious one too much and that's all 

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:10.369
 for today's video I really hope that 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.379
 has been cooked next to me to see these 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:14.629
 books and then yes I hope that in enjoy 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:19.149
 of the video and that's all forbidden today 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:19.149
 I am Lucia and see you soon bye
