00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
one thing I realized was that in 2k14 I

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.760 
one thing I realized was that in 2k14 I
couldn't<00:02:05.939> do<00:02:06.030> well<00:02:06.240> with<00:02:06.420> Isiah<00:02:06.719> Thomas<00:02:07.020> first

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.880 
off he's extremely
short<00:02:09.610> he<00:02:10.240> is<00:02:10.420> super<00:02:10.959> short<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:11.680> if<00:02:11.770> you're

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
short he is super short so if you're

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.770 
short he is super short so if you're
putting<00:02:12.130> up<00:02:12.250> those<00:02:12.400> threes<00:02:12.850> he<00:02:13.420> might<00:02:13.600> get

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
putting up those threes he might get

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.530 
putting up those threes he might get
blocked<00:02:14.080> but<00:02:14.740> wait<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> second<00:02:15.490> one<00:02:16.030> might<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.510> a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
blocked but wait a second one might be a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.960 
blocked but wait a second one might be a
counter<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:17.770> height<00:02:18.040> if<00:02:18.280> he<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.850> get

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.970 
rebounding that has been improved
recently<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.840> I'm<00:02:47.200> happy<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.620> see<00:02:47.800> him<00:02:47.890> at<00:02:47.950> a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
recently and I'm happy to see him at a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.420 
recently and I'm happy to see him at a
78<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.510> only<00:02:49.750> thing<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.440> would<00:02:50.920> not<00:02:51.100> put<00:02:51.130> him

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
78 the only thing is I would not put him

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.550 
78 the only thing is I would not put him
only<00:02:51.580> two<00:02:51.970> points<00:02:52.209> under<00:02:52.630> Isiah<00:02:52.989> Thomas<00:02:53.260> I

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
only two points under Isiah Thomas I

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.750 
only two points under Isiah Thomas I
think<00:02:53.800> there<00:02:53.890> should<00:02:54.069> be<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.190> little<00:02:54.400> bit<00:02:54.580> more

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
think there should be a little bit more

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.550 
think there should be a little bit more
of<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.910> gap<00:02:55.180> because<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.870> feel<00:02:56.050> like<00:02:56.080> Isiah

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
of a gap because I feel like Isiah

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.620 
of a gap because I feel like Isiah
Thomas<00:02:56.830> it's<00:02:57.220> kind<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.489> a<00:02:57.580> next<00:02:58.060> level<00:02:58.239> player

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
Thomas it's kind of a next level player

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.020 
Thomas it's kind of a next level player
then<00:02:59.230> Jared<00:02:59.620> Sullinger<00:02:59.800> don't<00:03:00.610> get<00:03:00.760> me<00:03:00.850> wrong

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
then Jared Sullinger don't get me wrong

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.479 
then Jared Sullinger don't get me wrong
Sullinger<00:03:01.600> is<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.780> phenomenal<00:03:02.319> player<00:03:02.530> just

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.210 
Sullinger is a phenomenal player just
not<00:03:03.790> exactly<00:03:04.300> at<00:03:04.600> Isaiah<00:03:05.230> Thomas's<00:03:05.739> level<00:03:06.069> in

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220

not exactly at Isaiah Thomas's level in
my<00:03:06.550> opinion<00:03:07.000> after<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.930> we've<00:03:08.110> got<00:03:08.170> Wilson

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
my opinion after that we've got Wilson

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.160 
my opinion after that we've got Wilson
Chandler<00:03:09.040> also<00:03:09.790> had<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.030> 78<00:03:10.510> overall<00:03:10.930> in

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
previous two case he had some higher

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.750

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
sad bit not exactly the same Wilson

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.280

Jared<00:03:31.690> Sullinger<00:03:31.900> I<00:03:32.410> think<00:03:32.890> there<00:03:33.010> should<00:03:33.280> be

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
Jared Sullinger I think there should be

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.580 
Jared Sullinger I think there should be
a<00:03:33.459> bit<00:03:33.700> more<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.060> gap<00:03:34.269> between<00:03:34.630> chandler<00:03:35.230> and

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
a bit more of a gap between chandler and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.310 
a bit more of a gap between chandler and
Isiah<00:03:35.950> Thomas<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.760> hey<00:03:36.910> is<00:03:37.090> 78<00:03:37.600> overall<00:03:38.079> I

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
think I'll take that still a reliable

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.240 
think I'll take that still a reliable
shooter<00:03:41.109> and<00:03:41.260> he<00:03:41.350> can<00:03:41.560> attack<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:42.100> basket
