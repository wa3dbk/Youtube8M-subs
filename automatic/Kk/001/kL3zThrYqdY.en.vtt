00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100

the breakdown I thought we were slow you
know<00:00:47.130> slow<00:00:47.580> ball<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.060> pass<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.660> somebody

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
know slow ball we pass it on to somebody

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.450 
know slow ball we pass it on to somebody
was<00:00:49.020> static<00:00:49.230> they'd<00:00:49.590> pass<00:00:49.860> onto<00:00:50.070> somebody's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
was static they'd pass onto somebody's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.460 
was static they'd pass onto somebody's
static<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.630> seem<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.260> going

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
static and then we just seem to be going

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.490 
static and then we just seem to be going
nowhere<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.290> Australia<00:00:55.290> it<00:00:55.380> was

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
nowhere was you know Australia it was

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.050 
nowhere was you know Australia it was
just<00:00:55.680> great<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.190> see<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.520> backs<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.880> just

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
just great to see the backs it just

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.670 
just great to see the backs it just
sucked<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.540> comfortable<00:00:58.110> on<00:00:58.200> the<00:00:58.320> ball<00:00:58.470> I

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
sucked so comfortable on the ball I

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.500 
sucked so comfortable on the ball I
think<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.130> saw<00:00:59.370> today<00:00:59.700> with<00:01:00.060> Ben<00:01:00.239> Alexander

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
think we saw today with Ben Alexander

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
think we saw today with Ben Alexander
coming<00:01:01.140> back<00:01:01.290> from<00:01:01.440> injury<00:01:01.620> he<00:01:01.950> wasn't<00:01:02.250> there

last week Robinson and Alexander in the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
last week Robinson and Alexander in the
front<00:01:05.189> row<00:01:05.399> I<00:01:05.759> just<00:01:06.450> feel<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.899> that's<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
front row I just feel that that's a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.890 
front row I just feel that that's a
strong<00:01:07.829> front<00:01:08.340> row<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.390> put<00:01:09.570> pelota

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
strong front row and then you put pelota

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.149 
strong front row and then you put pelota
now<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.500> or<00:01:10.620> stephen<00:01:10.979> moore<00:01:11.130> i

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
now and there or stephen moore i

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.590 
now and there or stephen moore i
personally<00:01:11.909> would<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.150> started<00:01:12.390> with

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
personally would have started with

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.840 
personally would have started with
stephen<00:01:12.990> moore<00:01:13.170> today<00:01:13.440> but<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.890> bottom<00:01:14.700> now

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
stephen moore today but and bottom now

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.430 
stephen moore today but and bottom now
made<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> few<00:01:15.479> areas<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> first<00:01:16.200> half

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
made a few areas in the first half

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.649 
made a few areas in the first half
missed<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.830> few<00:01:16.979> jumpers<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.850> turned<00:01:18.300> over<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
missed a few jumpers and turned over the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.210 
missed a few jumpers and turned over the
ball<00:01:18.690> a<00:01:18.870> little<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> think<00:01:19.770> sort<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
ball a little bit that I think sort of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.149 
ball a little bit that I think sort of
England<00:01:20.580> capitalized<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:22.260> I<00:01:22.530> don't<00:01:22.710> think

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
England capitalized on but I don't think

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.039 
England capitalized on but I don't think
I<00:01:23.370> think<00:01:23.580> today<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.940> proved<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.659> forward

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
I think today it proved that the forward

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.320 
I think today it proved that the forward
once<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.470> get<00:01:25.590> our<00:01:25.770> number<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.790> pack<00:01:27.090> out

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
once we get our number one pack out

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
once we get our number one pack out
there<00:01:27.570> we're<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.440> too<00:01:28.650> bad<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
there we're not too bad one of the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.160 
there we're not too bad one of the
features<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:30.060> afternoon<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.570> how<00:01:30.720> little

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170

England and the lines going forward is

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.710 
England and the lines going forward is
when<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:24.640> come<00:02:24.879> down<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.239> Australia<00:02:25.480> they're

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
when you come down to Australia they're

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.720 
when you come down to Australia they're
out<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.140> out<00:02:26.409> seventh<00:02:26.890> now<00:02:27.099> Chris<00:02:27.310> Robshaw<00:02:27.549> a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
out in out seventh now Chris Robshaw a

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.280 
out in out seventh now Chris Robshaw a
great<00:02:27.939> player<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.420> he<00:02:28.480> used<00:02:28.659> great<00:02:28.870> captain

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
a big admirer of Chris but I think he's

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.110 
a big admirer of Chris but I think he's
more<00:02:31.360> adept<00:02:32.200> at<00:02:32.379> six<00:02:32.680> there's<00:02:33.549> not<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.760> out

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
more adept at six there's not that out

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.880 
more adept at six there's not that out
and<00:02:34.299> out<00:02:34.420> guy<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.140> just<00:02:35.290> gets<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.769> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
and out guy that just gets to the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.680 
and out guy that just gets to the
breakdown<00:02:36.310> first<00:02:36.640> makes<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.060> decision<00:02:37.540> is

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
breakdown first makes the decision is

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.170 
breakdown first makes the decision is
real<00:02:37.989> nuisance<00:02:38.260> not<00:02:38.709> nobody<00:02:39.129> wins<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:40.060> ball

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
real nuisance not nobody wins the ball

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.170 
real nuisance not nobody wins the ball
every<00:02:40.480> now<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:40.750> then<00:02:40.930> but<00:02:40.959> he<00:02:41.640> then<00:02:42.640> slows<00:02:42.939> it

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
every now and then but he then slows it

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.300 
every now and then but he then slows it
down<00:02:43.209> or<00:02:43.659> what<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.319> makes<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.650> nuisance<00:02:45.010> of

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
down or what just makes a nuisance of

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.069 
down or what just makes a nuisance of
himself<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:45.909> I<00:02:45.940> think<00:02:46.030> he's<00:02:46.359> really<00:02:46.900> come

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
himself so I think he's really come

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.930 
himself so I think he's really come
about<00:02:47.319> people<00:02:47.739> now<00:02:47.859> know<00:02:47.890> who<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.430> we've<00:02:48.819> been
