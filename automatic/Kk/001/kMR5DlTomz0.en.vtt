00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.600
 here this is the new finarelli how much 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.390
 it concerns 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.330
 mike is the first was a bicycle 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.520
 for cross country marco 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.360
 has a lot of features 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.400
 details 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.500
 starting from the front that 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.560
 we have a fork 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.790
 with dedicated 90 mm excursion e 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.940
 we use a fort stop to stop 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.760
 to avoid also the handlebar I go to 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.900
 contact with the frame that create 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.150
 breakages 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.610
 the carbon frame comes on 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.750
 producer 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.750
 in italy the pinarello 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.900
 then we also have some features 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.100
 regarding the entry of the wires 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.680
 which are also prepared for 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.409
 blockage of this 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.320
 system allows to stop the fork 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.150
 to avoid 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.220
 in the event of a fall and that mine tried to 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.700
 contact with the chassis plus we 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.270
 these mandatory interiors that allows us 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.840
 to mount the gearbox over the brake 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.270
 also possible 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.399
 the king of telescopic fela always like this 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.960
 hell the fork is produced by 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.150
 fox 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.549
 to a treatment that ashima that 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.260
 scroll and a fork that you can 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.800
 to block 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.020
 rubio and the peculiarity is that to one 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.000
 expulsion designed for this 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.600
 bicycle here of 90 minutes 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.250
 this future has its own system stand 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.220
 electrical mastery side 65 points of the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.180
 fulcrum more to make the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.970
 one part is used 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.170
 where the carbon flexes to make it work 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.479
 the kinematics of this bicycle 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.989
 an excursion of 80 mm a ratio of 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.510
 one of julia's characteristic of this 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.840
 bicycle is that backhoe sketches are 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.670
 morgan khalis of the ninis bushes has 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.910
 given scrolling 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.030
 how to say 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.200
 another feature of this 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.420
 apart from that we avoided to fix 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.060
 the shock absorber in the frame directly 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.209
 using a plate starting from 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.790
 bottom bracket thus creating less 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.400
 tension on the part of the visit 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.880
 the shock absorber is fitted asymmetrically 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.880
 just for 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.299
 and as said then giving this system 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.599
 of wagon without the joint we voted 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:57.359
 the caliper of the vertical implementation e 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.849
 braking increases stiffness now the 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:04.350
 plus we introduced the through pin 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.970
 and from the 140 2 of width with consumption 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.020
 good braking advantage 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.020
 and the twist of money
