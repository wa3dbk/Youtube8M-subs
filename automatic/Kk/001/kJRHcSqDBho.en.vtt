to show you where that's purchased when
you<00:02:10.530> purchase<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.069> system<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:12.480> get<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:13.020> piece

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
you purchase the system you get a piece

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.610 
you purchase the system you get a piece
of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.140 
of
hardware<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.010> hooks<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.459> your<00:02:14.700> router

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
hardware that hooks up to your router

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.440 
hardware that hooks up to your router
and<00:02:15.599> then<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:17.099> an<00:02:17.430> emulator<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.299> a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
and then is is an emulator of a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.720 
and then is is an emulator of a
telephone<00:02:18.750> line<00:02:18.930> once<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.159> chunk

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
telephone line once you have that chunk

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.479 
telephone line once you have that chunk
of<00:02:20.909> hardware<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:22.049> now<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.650> gain<00:02:22.950> access<00:02:23.220> to

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
of hardware you now can gain access to

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.089 
of hardware you now can gain access to
that<00:02:23.760> anywhere<00:02:24.299> when<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.110> use<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.709> software

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
that anywhere when you use the software

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.369 
that anywhere when you use the software
these<00:02:26.310> folks<00:02:26.610> have<00:02:26.760> using<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:27.480> software<00:02:27.750> or

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
these folks have using this software or

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.309 
these folks have using this software or
using<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.670> iphone<00:02:30.060> software<00:02:30.360> that's

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
using the the iphone software that's

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.800 
using the the iphone software that's
similar<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.150> gain<00:02:33.540> access

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
similar to this so you can gain access

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.970 
similar to this so you can gain access
