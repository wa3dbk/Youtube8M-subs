00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.899
 this is huawei g350 which is interesting to those 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.180
 that has protection from moisture and dust it 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:13.000
 corresponds to the class ip 68 syw from me 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.400
 literally before this video dome under 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.440
 Crane, he generally okay worry 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.510
 anything with it does not happen by itself 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.090
 not very big 4 inch screen with 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.610
 480 by 800 do not need 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.390
 became a kind of standards and less 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.619
 no one plan permission does so 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.039
 easy enough to operate with one hand 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.670
 it is very big and will suit very many 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.339
 users 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.499
 design itself and quite ordinary nothing 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.620
 special this is matte plastic well good 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:43.300
 we want that does not look pine there from 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.850
 such a simple plastic he has 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.769
 a notch on the sides ie he won't 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.409
 should slip out of hand 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.809
 case it should help them 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.269
 use the rear of the camera lens 5 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.709
 megapixel led flash 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.269
 speaker hole and brand logo 

00:00:56.709 --> 00:01:00.850
 nothing else is a cover made of 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.829
 rubber plastic as you can see 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.520
 moisture droplets and dissolve easily in 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.500
 Generally practical difficult decision on 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.490
 sides and silver edging 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.190
 slightly above the surface 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.650
 so if you put the phone face down 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.390
 will be all kind of protection partner there 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.150
 front camera is light 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.050
 the indicator has a speaker below 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.910
 3 touch buttons all standard and 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.620
 huawei shell 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.750
 i.e. this is a lock screen where you can 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.050
 display the control player or 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:36.460
 clock we quickly go to the menu at the mail 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.900
 there is a camera post lock compilation 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.730
 everything is fine it is very tightly assembled 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.000
 nothing creaks no squeaks 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.550
 the back cover is securely fixed buttons 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.790
 little there is a screen lock key 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.970
 top and volume button here 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.070
 here by the buttons the river is not that awkward 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.680
 at the top is a headphone jack and 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.659
 for micro usb cable format and here 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.840
 here it closes everything 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.520
 stubs but by the way now after swimming 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.039
 there is no water but it protects and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.800
 It protects from moisture behind it 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:13.739
 the cover by the way wants to note is fixed 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.980
 source is possible by such an effort he 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.680
 removed 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.680
 what can be shown after swimming 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.260
 there is no water here and here it is 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.450
 but apparently these are the small bumpers 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.000
 who pass must protect 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.629
 phone anyway the area where 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.030
 the battery is dry but here 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.190
 here the wires still have what it is 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.790
 it is worth considering but nevertheless still 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.989
 working normally not visible by version 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.329
 manufacturers of this enough 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.230
 to 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:51.250
 nothing happened to the phone 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.530
 actually what's inside inside android 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.400
 version 412 hell feeder 1 gigahertz and 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.400
 qualcomm msm 82 25 operational processor 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.140
 the memory here is a little all 512 megabytes we 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.700
 built-in memory is also not very much and 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.250
 and there is a memory card slot 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.100
 father's cover he took off they are located 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.530
 and there you can put a card up to 64 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.150
 gigabyte data on the system is visible here 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.139
 need mud needs enough 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.690
 weak phone information i.e. whole 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.750
 he is not remarkable except the level 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.030
 all protection all works enough 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.230
 fast ie interface imposes no 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.709
 tupit desktop and 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.440
 befall briskly and smoothly with you it 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.650
 also everything is fine in function 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.299
 can the camera here 5 megapixels 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.180
 autofocus she has no front 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.989
 the camera has flash in principle with modules 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.799
 as much as possible we see simple and inexpensive 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.769
 take pictures but shooting text is 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:53.040
 there will be problems 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:53.040
 the door runs fast you can come in to me 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.170
 look to make sure that it's working 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.780
 OK 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.060
 and then there is a radio there is a musical 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.790
 Player have a flashlight his role 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.099
 flash itself with video is also a problem 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.099
 because it will only play 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.270
 limited number of codecs by virtue of its 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.680
 country of support is better to put 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.750
 some player 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.299
 Well, here comes the standard set 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.790
 apps from google to show even 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.970
 I do not know the principle of all the usual familiar by 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.150
 many android smartphone with heavy 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.669
 trasher problems will be something like angry 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.040
 birds on the lane is not there in principle 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.910
 350 models are also interesting first 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:39.479
 queue so that this protection class will fall 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.220
 ip 68 falls but otherwise not much 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.040
 noteworthy quite extraordinary 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.889
 smartphone it costs 8,000 rubles 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.270
 Well you are seven weeks old 90 such recommended 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.800
 retail price think he will 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.930
 interesting to me and to those who 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.120
 wants phone protection is not very big and 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.270
 not very expensive principle in the market of such 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.030
 Arrange now a little on that 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.699
 look but again what apps 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.129
 offers are limited and among these 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:09.460
 options huawei g350 is one 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:11.409
 of the most expensive solutions but for 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.419
 security has to pay so that 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.159
 then the camera is rather weak 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.580
 autonomy is about a day and a half 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.190
 work may be the day the core if little 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.449
 actively use that is the principle 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.849
 standard such android smartphone with 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.530
 focusing on heat and moisture protection thanks for 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.310
 attention put likes subscribe to 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.310
