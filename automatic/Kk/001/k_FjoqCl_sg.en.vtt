 source of description and discover then 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.700

 you will be seeing on the screen a good 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.299
 command of xbox one with a couple a 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.849
 apparatus a pretty weird gadget and it's 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.390
 that a user creates a robot so that 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.250
 play sting for the truth is that 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.060
 this player this robot for saying some 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.010
 way he went up from 16 to 20 in 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.349
 a few hours thanks to this invention 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.209
 a player as I said of destiny 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.670
 has invented this robot that goes up 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.090
 level by the in this title in order 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.129
 to avoid everything that task that 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.030
 arrives to change of character not of level 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:44.579
 20 to up to level 20 I use it doing 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.620
 all a microcontroller warned that 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.049
 automates simple actions in a 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.090
 low risk mission in order to 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.190
 example of eliminating a lot of 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.939
 enemies and get experience for 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.579
 quickly level up the user 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.489
 burdensome until you can see it in the fountain 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.220
 of the description this user used 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.440
 an arduino board that controls a 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.900
 series of servomotors joined with a 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.510
 Adhesive tape to control to press 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.430
 in the coup command again and again in 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.790
 followed the character thus exposed in the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.680
 mission for example ocean of stories for 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.319
 eliminate as much hype 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.120
 possible before dying and appear 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.609
 again at the checkpoint to 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.980
 hit the enemies without fatigue a 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.590
 and again and thus be able to rise quickly 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.170
 of level while he is sleeping 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.300
 so well there you have that news is 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.580
 really amazing what he gets to do 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.230
 people to climb levels and nothing 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.400
 more see you next and thanks to 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.480
 everyone is there we'll see each other in the 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.480
 next me
