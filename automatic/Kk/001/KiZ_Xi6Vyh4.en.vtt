00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.840 
I really I looked at your earlier video
and<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.390> saw<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.070> were<00:02:05.340> talking

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and I saw that you know you were talking

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.449 
and I saw that you know you were talking
about<00:02:05.909> card<00:02:06.420> destruct<00:02:06.840> card<00:02:07.459> descriptions

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
about card destruct card descriptions

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.950 
about card destruct card descriptions
and<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:09.270> think<00:02:10.050> dark<00:02:10.319> pipe<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.830> well<00:02:11.280> worth

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
and I think dark pipe is well worth

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.110 
and I think dark pipe is well worth
your<00:02:13.170> discussion<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.400> would<00:02:14.640> really<00:02:14.880> like

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
your discussion and I would really like

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.820 
your discussion and I would really like
to<00:02:15.150> know<00:02:15.420> what<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.140> other<00:02:16.440> people

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
to know what you and other people

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.920 
to know what you and other people
watching<00:02:17.040> or<00:02:17.400> hearing<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.790> video<00:02:18.150> well<00:02:18.900> I

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
watching or hearing this video well I

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.680 
watching or hearing this video well I
think<00:02:19.050> about<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.500> dark<00:02:19.710> vibe<00:02:19.920> card<00:02:20.690> overall

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
think about the dark vibe card overall

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.690 
think about the dark vibe card overall
if<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.050> were<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.260> put<00:02:22.470> myself<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:24.030> certain<00:02:24.840> um

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
if I were to put myself and I certain um

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.750 
if I were to put myself and I certain um
I<00:02:26.700> guess<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.120> could<00:02:27.390> say<00:02:28.130> side<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.490> debate

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
I guess you could say side of the debate

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.510 
I guess you could say side of the debate
I<00:02:30.240> think<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.020> can<00:02:31.230> argue<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.860> dark<00:02:32.280> bright

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
I think we can argue that dark bright

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.720 
I think we can argue that dark bright
for<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.880> most<00:02:33.090> part<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> good<00:02:33.750> card<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.730> you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
for the most part is a good card and you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.460 
for the most part is a good card and you
know<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:35.940> think<00:02:36.180> because<00:02:36.600> not<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.260> many

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
know I think because not that many

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.190 
know I think because not that many
people<00:02:37.710> run<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:39.540> makes<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.900> an<00:02:40.080> even

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
people run it it makes it an even

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.530 
people run it it makes it an even
tougher<00:02:40.500> card<00:02:40.890> because<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.460> mean<00:02:41.940> usually<00:02:42.210> when

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
tougher card because I mean usually when

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.270 
tougher card because I mean usually when
you<00:02:42.660> activate<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> spell<00:02:43.410> or<00:02:43.560> trap<00:02:43.740> card<00:02:44.070> you

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
you activate a spell or trap card you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.910 
you activate a spell or trap card you
would<00:02:44.430> expect<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.240> get<00:02:45.780> what<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.080> want<00:02:46.320> so

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
would expect to get what you want so

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.620 
would expect to get what you want so
then<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.220> activate<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.640> spell<00:02:47.850> card<00:02:47.910> dark

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
then you activate a spell card dark

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.580 
then you activate a spell card dark
bribe<00:02:49.430> um<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:51.570> last<00:02:51.810> thing<00:02:52.020> I'm<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.200> point<00:02:52.470> out

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
bribe um the last thing I'm a point out

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.710 
bribe um the last thing I'm a point out
of<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.710> BART<00:02:52.920> dark<00:02:53.190> bribe<00:02:53.490> is<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:55.200> think<00:02:55.320> not<00:02:56.250> a

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
of the BART dark bribe is I think not a

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.510 
of the BART dark bribe is I think not a
fact<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:58.020> mean<00:02:58.560> okay<00:02:58.950> negate<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.490> activation

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
fact I mean okay negate the activation

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.430 
fact I mean okay negate the activation
of<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.150> spoiler<00:03:00.420> trap<00:03:00.690> card<00:03:00.930> your<00:03:01.110> opponent
