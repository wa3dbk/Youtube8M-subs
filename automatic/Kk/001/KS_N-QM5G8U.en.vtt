00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 yes hello people what is going on and warm 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.730
 Welcome to another episode 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.020
 the minecraft news if you like 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.340
 then you are very welcome to 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.800
 twitter follow the band lately 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.120
 really indescribably active there you can 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.980
 you good and we communicate 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.599
 discuss and always up to date 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.949
 could also be on news 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.300
 submit topics and maybe are 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.949
 these, however, in the next episode on 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.480
 start so but not as spoken around 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:33.630
 i would say right after that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:35.399
 intro is going to be banned, at least 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.380
 This is very possible in Turkey 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.510
 authorities of turkey are currently examining the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.350
 violence depicted in the game but why 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.820
 the whole 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.140
 just because a journalist of the Turkish 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.809
 Minister of Family and Social Affairs 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.180
 reported that it was in the game for the kill 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.250
 of figures including women's points 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.930
 should give which the player for his 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.010
 let's call it cruel acts 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.719
 will reward 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.160
 and quite honestly, if I have something like that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.870
 then I really ask myself if the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.579
 People do not have other problems with it 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.719
 to solve is considered minecraft as 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.559
 glorifying violence the game 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.120
 show 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.170
 your opinion on this would affect me 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.170
 If I'm interested, it seems to me 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.490
 times in the comments 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.470
 many of you surely know that 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.119
 channel element animation which ago 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.100
 all through the minecraft villiger news 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.960
 animation or the minecraft shorts 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.850
 Died out now is one of the rectors 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560
 the team died the dubbed 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.030
 always the character Steve and even if 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.320
 Of course you never knew which ones 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.850
 people behind the dubbed 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.020
 characters have already determined 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.520
 a majority of you before 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.229
 his voice in a minecraft 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.180
 That's why I want animation 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.230
 quite a shame and definitely my 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.880
 sympathy for that 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.680
 mock my one of the staff mojang 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.330
 There was a recent request 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.520
 community member on twitter 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.840
 what one of the possible minecraft 1.9 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.370
 features could be 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840
 according to his statement, we can do one 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.550
 Improvement of shader performance 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.860
 expect this will be much higher 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.300
 fps and a smoother gameplay too 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.160
 on less powerful pcs 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.540
 I think this is up 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.880
 every step a step into the right one 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.620
 direction 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.540
 mai colleague dc minecraft news has now 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.310
 a relief channel with the name easy 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.290
 there he will block some from time to time 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.880
 rila videos upload and so far 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.410
 these videos are also quite entertaining and 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.090
 really well done and unfortunately I have 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.679
 said that the second video on his 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.830
 channel a product placement was good 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.300
 But that 's it, that's it 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.800
 with this consequence of - if it is you 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.630
 I liked it then I would be huge 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.040

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.110
