00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
starting to mimic that now this one

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.490 
starting to mimic that now this one
actually<00:02:59.640> puts<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.269> on<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.720> side<00:03:00.989> you'll<00:03:01.320> see

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
actually puts it on the side you'll see

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.600 
actually puts it on the side you'll see
what<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.890> H<00:03:02.130> there<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:03.530> we<00:03:04.530> can<00:03:04.709> slide

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
what I have H there and we can slide

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.080

over<00:03:05.820> hit<00:03:06.090> D<00:03:06.530> Y<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.459> think<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.790> really

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
over hit D Y it I think it really

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.820 
over hit D Y it I think it really
depends<00:03:09.450> on<00:03:09.570> on<00:03:09.870> what<00:03:10.230> side<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.650> keyboard

hand side I don't like that I mean I

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.830 
hand side I don't like that I mean I
don't<00:03:19.350> have<00:03:19.530> too<00:03:20.160> big<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.430> hands<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:21.269> it's

don't have too big of hands but it's

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.270 
don't have too big of hands but it's
something<00:03:22.079> that<00:03:22.260> makes<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.799> just<00:03:22.980> harder<00:03:23.250> to

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
something that makes it just harder to

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.190 
something that makes it just harder to
see<00:03:23.640> like<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.030> can't<00:03:24.299> even<00:03:24.360> see<00:03:24.630> me<00:03:24.660> hitting<00:03:24.930> J

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
see like you can't even see me hitting J

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.590 
see like you can't even see me hitting J
hardly<00:03:25.880> whenever<00:03:26.880> I'm<00:03:27.000> actually<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.510> know

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
hardly whenever I'm actually you know

hardly whenever I'm actually you know
whenever<00:03:27.780> you're<00:03:27.959> actually<00:03:28.260> typing<00:03:28.530> really

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
whenever you're actually typing really

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.610 
whenever you're actually typing really
fast<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.730> didn't<00:03:30.570> really<00:03:30.630> like<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:30.989> too<00:03:31.380> much

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
fast so didn't really like that too much

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.890 
fast so didn't really like that too much
you<00:03:32.190> probably<00:03:32.220> will<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:33.209> know<00:03:33.299> each<00:03:33.570> is<00:03:33.750> own

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
you probably will you know each is own
