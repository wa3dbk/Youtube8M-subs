was wrong with the iPad 1 it is
thirty-three<00:00:37.410> percent<00:00:37.559> thinner<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.219> never

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
thirty-three percent thinner I never

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.729 
thirty-three percent thinner I never
thought<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.820> iPad<00:00:39.149> one<00:00:39.390> was<00:00:39.629> relatively<00:00:40.200> fat

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739

it is noticeably faster I never thought
the<00:00:44.940> iPad<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.690> slow<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.559> a5<00:00:47.100> processor

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
triangle motion there get that raised

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.440 
triangle motion there get that raised
surface<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.190> found<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.850> be<00:03:50.880> very<00:03:51.000> useful

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450

and a very welcome addition when I'm
typing<00:03:53.640> do<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:54.330> think<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.840> is<00:03:54.870> worth<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.380> money

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
typing do I think it is worth the money

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.640 
typing do I think it is worth the money
no<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.280> most<00:03:56.760> definitely<00:03:57.000> do<00:03:57.360> not<00:03:57.570> if<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.500> want

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
no I most definitely do not if you want

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.810 
no I most definitely do not if you want
to<00:03:58.709> have<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.830> smart<00:03:59.100> cover<00:03:59.310> just<00:03:59.489> because<00:03:59.700> the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
to have a smart cover just because the

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.060 
to have a smart cover just because the
magnetic<00:04:00.330> business<00:04:00.660> is<00:04:00.780> kind<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.080> cool<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.920> it

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
magnetic business is kind of cool and it

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.979 
magnetic business is kind of cool and it
is<00:04:02.190> very<00:04:02.489> cool<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.060> go<00:04:03.239> ahead<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.570> do<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:03.720> no

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
is very cool and go ahead and do so no

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.000 
is very cool and go ahead and do so no
it's<00:04:04.110> going<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.320> protect<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.680> front<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:04.950> the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
it's going to protect the front of the

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.759 
it's going to protect the front of the
device<00:04:05.239> but<00:04:06.239> you<00:04:06.540> are<00:04:06.690> not<00:04:06.959> going<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:07.410> get<00:04:07.530> any

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
device but you are not going to get any

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.039 
device but you are not going to get any
sort<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:08.100> protection<00:04:08.340> for<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.730> back<00:04:08.940> so<00:04:09.870> my

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
sort of protection for the back so my

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.770 
sort of protection for the back so my
advice<00:04:10.200> is<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.890> get<00:04:11.070> a<00:04:11.100> full<00:04:11.430> case<00:04:11.700> for<00:04:12.090> the

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
advice is to get a full case for the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.990 
advice is to get a full case for the
ipad<00:04:13.290> 2<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.040> have<00:04:14.459> something<00:04:14.760> that's<00:04:14.910> going

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
ipad 2 and have something that's going

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.670 
ipad 2 and have something that's going
to<00:04:15.060> offer<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.390> increased<00:04:15.900> functionality<00:04:16.079> of

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
to offer that increased functionality of

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.920 
to offer that increased functionality of
the<00:04:17.310> raised<00:04:17.700> surface<00:04:18.120> as<00:04:18.239> well<00:04:18.269> most<00:04:18.690> cases

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
the raised surface as well most cases

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.800 
the raised surface as well most cases
now<00:04:19.290> have<00:04:19.799> some<00:04:20.130> sort<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:21.030> little<00:04:21.600> bit<00:04:21.720> of

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
now have some sort of a little bit of

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.360 
now have some sort of a little bit of
mechanism<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.289> back<00:04:22.470> that'll<00:04:22.740> raise<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.220> up

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
mechanism the back that'll raise it up

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.610 
mechanism the back that'll raise it up
for<00:04:24.000> when<00:04:24.120> you're<00:04:24.240> typing<00:04:24.419> oral<00:04:25.169> prop<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.530> up

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
for when you're typing oral prop it up

things i have lamented on many many many
occasions<00:06:28.280> and<00:06:28.820> that<00:06:29.000> is<00:06:29.180> iOS<00:06:29.720> itself<00:06:30.349> it<00:06:31.159> has

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
occasions and that is iOS itself it has

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.690 
occasions and that is iOS itself it has
not<00:06:31.849> changed<00:06:32.300> really<00:06:32.840> much<00:06:33.229> at<00:06:33.440> all<00:06:33.590> since<00:06:34.370> its

not changed really much at all since its
launch<00:06:35.000> in<00:06:35.270> debut<00:06:35.690> in<00:06:35.810> 2007<00:06:36.740> I<00:06:36.889> think<00:06:37.370> the

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
launch in debut in 2007 I think the

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.910 
launch in debut in 2007 I think the
notification<00:06:37.969> system<00:06:38.300> is<00:06:38.479> extreme

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920

the<00:06:39.070> obtrusive<00:06:39.340> I<00:06:39.820> think<00:06:40.180> the<00:06:40.270> way<00:06:40.390> that

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
the obtrusive I think the way that

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.540 
the obtrusive I think the way that
handles<00:06:40.930> multitasking<00:06:41.680> is<00:06:41.800> quite<00:06:42.040> archaic

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
handles multitasking is quite archaic

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.910 
handles multitasking is quite archaic
