00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.970 

yeah<00:05:45.490> I<00:05:46.080> wouldn't<00:05:47.080> say<00:05:47.170> however<00:05:47.560> that<00:05:47.950> I

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
yeah I wouldn't say however that I

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.690 
yeah I wouldn't say however that I
really<00:05:48.340> think<00:05:48.580> that<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:48.820> water<00:05:49.110> changes<00:05:50.700> the

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
really think that the water changes the

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.640 
really think that the water changes the
flavor<00:05:52.030> when<00:05:52.570> you<00:05:52.660> drink<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:53.050> I<00:05:53.290> think<00:05:53.530> it<00:05:53.620> just

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
flavor when you drink it I think it just

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.470 
flavor when you drink it I think it just
kind<00:05:54.040> of<00:05:54.100> evolves<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:54.700> a<00:05:54.760> little<00:05:54.940> bit<00:05:55.090> I<00:05:55.270> think

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
kind of evolves it a little bit I think

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.410 
kind of evolves it a little bit I think
if<00:05:55.750> I<00:05:55.870> walked<00:05:56.110> away<00:05:56.790> and<00:05:57.790> put<00:05:58.000> a<00:05:58.030> cover<00:05:58.300> over

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
if I walked away and put a cover over

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.990 
if I walked away and put a cover over
this<00:05:58.780> and<00:05:59.170> you<00:05:59.890> know<00:06:00.130> started<00:06:00.760> doing
