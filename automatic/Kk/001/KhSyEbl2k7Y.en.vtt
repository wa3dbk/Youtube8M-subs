00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.880 
that's 25 percent of them you'll get a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
feather so there's pretty good chances

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.950 
feather so there's pretty good chances
they<00:00:50.610> come<00:00:50.789> quite<00:00:51.480> often<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.199> see<00:00:53.960> and
