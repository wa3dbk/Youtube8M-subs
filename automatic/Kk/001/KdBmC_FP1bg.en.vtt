 constituted how children's people 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.559
 children earn less than a dollar 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.030

 I'm going to tell you one thing in the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.000
 modesty as I speak now 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.920
 not just in the appearance of the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.379
 wearing scarf then that in 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640
 appearance like that but modesty at 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.059
 sense of modesty of the heart and 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.039
 of intelligence you find normal to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.680
 put 200 euros and walk you in 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:08.040
 france with clothes that have been 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.950
 made up by the pressure of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.189
 millions of children around the world I 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.110
 find it a shameless modest 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.150
 that is, there are children who 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.970
 are sold by their parents who wins 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.920
 a dollar a day that are hit and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.200
 you wear shoes ten months 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.710
 I paid them 200 dollars or two hundred 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.720
 euros 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.220
 and then have the cathine lasserre to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.220
 the islamic my brother 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.540
 Well, one day, we'll have to 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.610
 say we did not know because when 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.050
 you walk to the philippines when 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.340
 you walk in Asia and you 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.610
 see the treatment that is being done to 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.420
 kids buy that to your kids that's 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.310
 not modest I 'm sorry it's not 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.570
 modest at all and that's how it 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.680
 must speak to our children 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.470
 that's how you have to talk to 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.700
 teens as to 15 years for not 18 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.650
 years and you have to get dressed 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.900
 modestly islamically rely on 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.510
 a morality on an ethics one does not 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.400
 does not dress well in europe on the dead 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.130
 and the pressure of children in the third 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.480
 world does not know it's not here and 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.640
 you can not even tell marois lane 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.620
 where is justice and noura book on the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.490
 justice right now or why because we have 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:24.980
 reduces Islam to appearances and jaar where 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.570
 Paris handles this is an insult made to 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.430
 our religion does not have that in our 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.740
 region it is much richer than 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.020
 that much more demanding a lot 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.500
 more about justice on how to get 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.150
 dress 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.830
 so what they do at a given moment 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.020
 it is that we all fell together 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.790
 the challenge of modesty of the heart of the 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.070
 modesty of the modesty intelligence of 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.330
 the word of the modesty of modesty and 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.010
 modesty of dress 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.989
 that we went to modesty 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.970
 actually dresses that we 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.590
 know that we are really and 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.950
 we must understand that there are 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.950
 rules
