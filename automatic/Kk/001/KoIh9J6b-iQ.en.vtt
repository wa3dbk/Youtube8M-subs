00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
and perhaps the easiest and most

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to change our dietary habits I believe

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.600 
to change our dietary habits I believe
the<00:01:09.540> world<00:01:09.720> today<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.380> consuming<00:01:11.100> far<00:01:11.340> too

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the world today is consuming far too

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.090 
the world today is consuming far too
much<00:01:11.790> meat<00:01:12.150> protein<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:13.020> eating<00:01:13.380> far<00:01:13.680> too<00:01:13.920> much

much meat protein we eating far too much

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.789 
much meat protein we eating far too much
meat<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.240> therefore<00:01:15.900> what<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.290> really<00:01:16.590> need

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
meat and therefore what we really need

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.060 
meat and therefore what we really need
to<00:01:16.830> do<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.640> cut<00:01:17.850> down<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.299> meat<00:01:18.479> consumption

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
to do is to cut down on meat consumption

notion<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.299> cutting<00:02:14.689> down<00:02:14.840> on<00:02:15.049> meat

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
notion of cutting down on meat

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.490 
notion of cutting down on meat
consumption<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.159> one<00:02:16.849> person<00:02:17.269> actually<00:02:17.500> was

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
consumption and one person actually was

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.589 
consumption and one person actually was
humorous<00:02:19.069> enough<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.549> course<00:02:20.060> he<00:02:20.209> meant<00:02:20.359> it

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
humorous enough of course he meant it

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.440 
humorous enough of course he meant it

seriously that I was undernourished and

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.119 
seriously that I was undernourished and
