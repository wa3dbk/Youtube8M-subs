00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
crushed quite a bit but he is going to

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.930 
crushed quite a bit but he is going to
be<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.410> striker<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.160> think<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.520> lot<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.760> you

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
be a striker and I think a lot of you

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.640 
be a striker and I think a lot of you
would<00:03:18.120> probably<00:03:18.570> have<00:03:18.660> already<00:03:18.840> guessed<00:03:19.080> who

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
would probably have already guessed who

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.590 
would probably have already guessed who
were<00:03:19.770> gonna<00:03:19.920> be<00:03:20.010> getting<00:03:20.130> left<00:03:20.460> wing<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:21.390> going

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
were gonna be getting left wing is going

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.860 
were gonna be getting left wing is going
to<00:03:21.660> be<00:03:21.750> lavezzi<00:03:22.550> 6400<00:03:23.550> coins<00:03:23.850> in<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.510> left-wing

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
to be lavezzi 6400 coins in a left-wing

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.950 
to be lavezzi 6400 coins in a left-wing
four<00:03:25.140> three<00:03:25.290> two<00:03:25.440> one<00:03:26.570> if<00:03:27.570> I'd<00:03:27.780> waited

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
four three two one if I'd waited

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.480 
four three two one if I'd waited
probably<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.470> little<00:03:28.590> bit<00:03:28.800> longer<00:03:28.950> we<00:03:29.310> probably

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
probably a little bit longer we probably

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.620 
probably a little bit longer we probably
would<00:03:29.670> have<00:03:29.730> been<00:03:29.790> able<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.090> pick<00:03:30.240> him<00:03:30.360> up<00:03:30.420> for

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
would have been able to pick him up for

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.320 
would have been able to pick him up for
maybe<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.200> couple<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.560> K<00:03:31.680> cheaper<00:03:32.100> but<00:03:32.970> others

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
maybe a couple of K cheaper but others

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.270 
maybe a couple of K cheaper but others
just<00:03:33.510> going<00:03:33.780> by<00:03:33.960> him<00:03:34.200> soon<00:03:34.800> as<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.010> was<00:03:35.100> around

just going by him soon as it was around
two<00:03:35.490> in<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.670> morning<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.060> thus<00:03:36.150> wanted<00:03:36.360> to

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
two in the morning and thus wanted to

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.180 
two in the morning and thus wanted to
get<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.630> team<00:03:36.840> made<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.770> go<00:03:37.890> out<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:37.980> play

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
get this team made and go out and play

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.430 
get this team made and go out and play
of<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.550> so<00:03:38.820> doesn't<00:03:39.600> see<00:03:39.810> here<00:03:40.020> as<00:03:40.140> well<00:03:40.380> I

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
of it so doesn't see here as well I

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.700 
of it so doesn't see here as well I
think<00:03:40.560> we<00:03:40.950> do<00:03:41.250> go<00:03:41.640> into<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.970> market<00:03:42.300> again

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
think we do go into the market again

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.540 
think we do go into the market again
after<00:03:43.710> we've<00:03:43.830> had<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:44.010> little<00:03:44.220> look<00:03:44.370> at<00:03:44.490> our

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
after we've had a little look at our

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.610 
after we've had a little look at our
team<00:03:44.790> looking<00:03:45.690> pretty<00:03:45.930> decent<00:03:46.200> at<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.320> moment

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
team looking pretty decent at the moment

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.230 
team looking pretty decent at the moment
but<00:03:46.770> we<00:03:46.980> do<00:03:47.070> going<00:03:47.280> through<00:03:47.460> into<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.910> market

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
but we do going through into the market

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.410 
but we do going through into the market
and<00:03:48.420> pick<00:03:48.930> up<00:03:49.050> this<00:03:49.170> bronze<00:03:49.470> player<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:50.670> think

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
and pick up this bronze player I think

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.060

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
score does in the right formation and

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.970 
score does in the right formation and
position<00:04:18.330> it<00:04:18.450> really<00:04:18.810> does<00:04:18.959> help<00:04:19.140> so<00:04:19.709> much

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
position it really does help so much

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.199 
position it really does help so much
when<00:04:20.250> you're<00:04:20.340> actually<00:04:20.489> playing<00:04:20.790> in<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.060> game

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
when you're actually playing in the game

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.480 
when you're actually playing in the game
you<00:04:21.960> don't<00:04:22.080> even<00:04:22.260> realize<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:23.130> know<00:04:23.220> even

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
you don't even realize it you know even

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.070 
you don't even realize it you know even
if<00:04:23.580> they've<00:04:23.760> even<00:04:24.360> if<00:04:24.450> they<00:04:24.600> still<00:04:24.810> have<00:04:24.840> like

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
if they've even if they still have like

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.170 
if they've even if they still have like
four<00:04:25.440> chem<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.820> just

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
four chem and it just

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.210 
four chem and it just
a<00:04:27.210> massive<00:04:27.750> difference<00:04:27.900> than<00:04:28.380> being<00:04:28.620> in<00:04:28.830> the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
a massive difference than being in the

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.400 
a massive difference than being in the
right<00:04:29.370> formation<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:30.060> position<00:04:30.479> so<00:04:30.750> let's

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
right formation and position so let's

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.409 
right formation and position so let's
see<00:04:31.590> here<00:04:31.800> now<00:04:32.039> I<00:04:32.070> think<00:04:32.580> we<00:04:32.699> do<00:04:32.850> go<00:04:33.060> into<00:04:33.300> a

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
see here now I think we do go into a

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.680 
see here now I think we do go into a
match<00:04:34.100> trying<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.190> you<00:04:35.550> know<00:04:35.580> come<00:04:36.240> up<00:04:36.389> against

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
match trying to you know come up against

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.990 
match trying to you know come up against
someone<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:37.289> won't<00:04:37.800> back<00:04:38.310> out<00:04:38.520> because<00:04:38.759> they

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
someone that won't back out because they

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.909 
someone that won't back out because they
see<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.270> 85<00:04:39.660> raid<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.440> we<00:04:40.500> do<00:04:40.590> actually<00:04:40.680> come

see the 85 raid and we do actually come

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.590 
see the 85 raid and we do actually come
across<00:04:41.190> this<00:04:41.580> guy<00:04:41.789> called<00:04:42.060> grouped<00:04:42.300> glory

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
across this guy called grouped glory
