00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.460 

we<00:00:15.300> have<00:00:15.420> two<00:00:15.540> different<00:00:15.660> recline<00:00:16.049> systems

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
we have two different recline systems

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.429 
we have two different recline systems
available<00:00:16.950> we<00:00:17.130> have<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.720> regular<00:00:18.720> recline<00:00:19.170> and

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
available we have a regular recline and

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.230 
available we have a regular recline and
then<00:00:19.560> we<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.860> a<00:00:19.890> no<00:00:20.189> share<00:00:20.520> or<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.790> sliding

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
then we have a no share or a sliding

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.089 
then we have a no share or a sliding
back<00:00:21.390> recline<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.560> proportional

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
back recline and it's proportional

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.740 
back recline and it's proportional
control<00:00:23.400> which<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.670> kind<00:00:23.849> of<00:00:23.910> unique<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:24.599> our

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
control which is kind of unique with our

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.410 
control which is kind of unique with our
chairs<00:00:25.020> and<00:00:25.290> that<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.619> if<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.640> deflect<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
chairs and that is if you deflect the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.310 
chairs and that is if you deflect the
joystick<00:00:29.300> it<00:00:30.300> moves<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> seating<00:00:30.869> system<00:00:31.199> but

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
joystick it moves the seating system but

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
joystick it moves the seating system but
it's<00:00:31.410> proportional<00:00:31.800> control<00:00:32.129> so<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> freezie

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
it's proportional control so the freezie

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.520 
it's proportional control so the freezie
that<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.120> deflect<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.660> joystick<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
that you deflect this joystick the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.229 
that you deflect this joystick the
faster<00:00:34.890> your<00:00:35.010> seating<00:00:35.280> system<00:00:35.580> operates<00:00:35.970> so

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
faster your seating system operates so

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.840 
faster your seating system operates so
if<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.420> slowly<00:00:37.140> deflect<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> joystick<00:00:38.580> just<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
if I slowly deflect the joystick just a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.439 
if I slowly deflect the joystick just a
little<00:00:39.090> bit

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
little bit

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.150 
little bit
the<00:00:39.960> seating<00:00:40.260> system<00:00:40.590> will<00:00:40.739> move<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the seating system will move just a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.710 
the seating system will move just a
little<00:00:41.190> bit<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.879> deflect<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.360> more<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
little bit if I deflect it more the

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.990 
little bit if I deflect it more the
seating<00:00:42.989> system<00:00:43.290> moves<00:00:43.470> faster<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.879> our

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
seating system moves faster this is our

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.060 
seating system moves faster this is our
13-inch<00:00:45.540> elevator<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.799> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.949> highest

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
13-inch elevator it's one of the highest

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.660 
13-inch elevator it's one of the highest
elevators<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.729> the<00:00:47.760> market<00:00:48.559> like<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.799> chair

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.539 

it's<00:00:56.670> very<00:00:56.940> high<00:00:57.530> our<00:00:58.530> elevator<00:00:59.129> uses<00:00:59.519> a

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
it's very high our elevator uses a

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.119 
it's very high our elevator uses a
scissor<00:00:59.850> lift<00:01:00.210> mechanism<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.129> being

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
scissor lift mechanism and being

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
scissor lift mechanism and being
attached<00:01:02.460> at<00:01:02.670> four<00:01:02.879> points<00:01:03.269> on<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.510> chair

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
attached at four points on the chair

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.700 
attached at four points on the chair
it's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> very<00:01:04.350> stable<00:01:05.750> platting<00:01:06.750> system<00:01:07.110> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it's a very stable platting system so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.200 
it's a very stable platting system so
you<00:01:07.799> don't<00:01:08.040> get<00:01:08.190> a<00:01:08.250> lot<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.580> sway<00:01:08.820> when<00:01:09.060> you're

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
you don't get a lot of sway when you're

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.120 
you don't get a lot of sway when you're
in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> elevated<00:01:10.020> position<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.560> allows<00:01:10.890> us

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
in the elevated position this allows us

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.740 
in the elevated position this allows us
to<00:01:11.310> give<00:01:11.460> people<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> ability<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.240> drive<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
to give people the ability to drive the
