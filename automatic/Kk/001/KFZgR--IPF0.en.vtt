copper clay and a steel and an iron and
there's<00:00:13.889> some<00:00:14.009> other<00:00:14.160> varieties<00:00:14.549> just<00:00:14.580> kind

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
there's some other varieties just kind

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.599 
there's some other varieties just kind
of<00:00:14.969> hang<00:00:15.690> out<00:00:15.839> an<00:00:16.080> under<00:00:16.260> development<00:00:16.650> -<00:00:16.980> okay

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
of hang out an under development - okay

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.880 
of hang out an under development - okay
so<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:21.439> yeah<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.500> have<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> whole

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
so you really yeah you have a whole

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.740 
so you really yeah you have a whole
spectrum<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.519> these<00:00:23.939> clays<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.630> they're

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
spectrum of these clays and they're

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.929 
spectrum of these clays and they're
commercially<00:00:25.289> available<00:00:25.430> materials<00:00:26.430> usually

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
commercially available materials usually

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.390 
commercially available materials usually
used<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.539> by<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> jewelry<00:00:28.260> industry<00:00:28.410> okay

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
used just by the jewelry industry okay

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.840 
used just by the jewelry industry okay
so<00:00:29.660> you<00:00:30.660> mentioned<00:00:31.019> some<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.850> end-users

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
so you mentioned some of the end-users

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.389 
so you mentioned some of the end-users
of<00:00:33.000> my<00:00:33.120> my<00:00:33.630> new<00:00:33.809> jewelers<00:00:34.350> craftspeople<00:00:35.130> I

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
of my my new jewelers craftspeople I

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:44.959 
of my my new jewelers craftspeople I
just<00:00:41.960> use<00:00:43.010> surveys<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.309> might<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:44.789> whether

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
just use surveys you might see whether

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.900 
just use surveys you might see whether

that they need you can even if you're

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.240 
that they need you can even if you're
mixing<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> right<00:01:37.470> materials<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.130> instance

mixing the right materials for instance

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.240 
mixing the right materials for instance
iron<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.240> ceramic<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.320> copper<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.100> even

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
iron and ceramic and copper you can even

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.060 
iron and ceramic and copper you can even
print<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.000> test<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:42.630> own<00:01:42.689> motor<00:01:43.079> designs<00:01:43.740> I

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
print and test your own motor designs I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.190 
print and test your own motor designs I
printed<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.090> an<00:01:45.180> example<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.600> printed<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.960> really

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
printed as an example I printed a really

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.039 
printed as an example I printed a really
small<00:01:46.619> impulse<00:01:47.310> turbine<00:01:47.759> attached<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
small impulse turbine attached it to a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.319 
small impulse turbine attached it to a
tiny<00:01:49.320> generator<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> blew<00:01:50.549> air<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.270> I

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
tiny generator and blew air at it and I

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.600 
tiny generator and blew air at it and I
was<00:01:51.450> able<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.689> light<00:01:51.930> up<00:01:52.079> some<00:01:52.290> LEDs<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.070> it's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
was able to light up some LEDs so it's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.700 
was able to light up some LEDs so it's
kind<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.780> made<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.110> turbine<00:01:55.680> engine

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
kind of you know I made a turbine engine

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.609 
kind of you know I made a turbine engine
at<00:01:56.310> home<00:01:56.549> with<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.930> possibilities

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
at home with this so the possibilities

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.760 
at home with this so the possibilities
are<00:01:58.649> are<00:01:59.600> limited<00:02:00.600> only<00:02:00.689> by<00:02:00.869> your<00:02:00.990> imagination

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
are are limited only by your imagination

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.690 
are are limited only by your imagination
do<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.880> 3d<00:02:03.390> printing<00:02:03.869> really<00:02:04.700> offsetting

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
do I see 3d printing really offsetting

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.459 
do I see 3d printing really offsetting
or<00:02:05.820> replacing<00:02:06.360> more<00:02:06.570> traditional<00:02:07.140> sorts<00:02:07.380> of

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
or replacing more traditional sorts of

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.490 
or replacing more traditional sorts of
manufacture<00:02:08.129> not<00:02:08.759> exactly<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.929> think<00:02:10.259> that

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
manufacture not exactly but I think that

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.950 
manufacture not exactly but I think that
there<00:02:11.099> will<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.670> use<00:02:12.569> for

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
there will be a use for

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.020 
there will be a use for
an<00:02:13.020> example<00:02:13.470> would<00:02:13.620> be<00:02:13.680> let's<00:02:14.490> say<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.700> needed

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
an example would be let's say I needed

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.170 
an example would be let's say I needed
one<00:02:15.480> really<00:02:15.930> odd<00:02:16.110> size<00:02:16.500> metric<00:02:17.010> bolt<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
one really odd size metric bolt so the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.210 
one really odd size metric bolt so the
bolts<00:02:18.450> are<00:02:18.600> made<00:02:18.630> for<00:02:19.290> pennies<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.950> dollar

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
bolts are made for pennies on the dollar

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.270 
bolts are made for pennies on the dollar
somewhere<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.030> India<00:02:21.710> but<00:02:22.710> for<00:02:22.950> me<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.130> get

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
somewhere in India but for me to get

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.830 
somewhere in India but for me to get
just<00:02:23.490> one<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.120> order<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.360> whole<00:02:24.510> bagful

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
just one I have to order a whole bagful

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.560 
just one I have to order a whole bagful
so<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.350> might<00:02:25.620> spend<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.980> lot<00:02:26.160> more<00:02:26.210> getting<00:02:27.210> one

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
so I might spend a lot more getting one

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.600 
so I might spend a lot more getting one
bolt<00:02:27.930> from<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.620> factory<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.040> India<00:02:29.190> then<00:02:29.520> I

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
bolt from a factory in India then I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.250 
bolt from a factory in India then I
would<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:29.790> printing<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.450> one<00:02:30.600> metric<00:02:30.990> bolt

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
would just printing the one metric bolt

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.970 
would just printing the one metric bolt
and<00:02:31.500> firing<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.280> at<00:02:32.400> home<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.680> has<00:02:34.950> a

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
and firing it at home so it it has a

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.070 
and firing it at home so it it has a
real<00:02:35.430> purpose<00:02:36.090> when<00:02:36.600> you're<00:02:36.750> dealing<00:02:37.050> with

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
specialty or with repairs or just with

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.800 
specialty or with repairs or just with
anything<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.670> involves<00:02:42.090> maybe<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.390> one-off
