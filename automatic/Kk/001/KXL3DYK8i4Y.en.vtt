00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
all the bugs there's really no reason

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
all the bugs there's really no reason
the<00:00:22.410> glitching<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.920> annoying<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:23.970> not

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
the glitching is annoying but it's not

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.820 
the glitching is annoying but it's not
something<00:00:24.420> they<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:25.050> aware<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.680> they're

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
something they are aware of it they're

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.529 
something they are aware of it they're
going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.220> hopefully<00:00:26.430> be<00:00:26.760> fixing<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.240> before

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
going to hopefully be fixing it before

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.210 
going to hopefully be fixing it before
then<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.349> want<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.500> go<00:00:28.619> over<00:00:28.710> some<00:00:28.800> actual

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
then I just want to go over some actual

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.389 
then I just want to go over some actual
gameplay<00:00:30.439> issues<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.650> i<00:00:31.710> find<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.250> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
gameplay issues that i find to be a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.830 
gameplay issues that i find to be a
little<00:00:32.579> frustrating<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.390> i<00:00:33.450> think<00:00:33.660> needs

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
little frustrating and i think needs

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.750 
little frustrating and i think needs
some<00:00:33.989> tweaking<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.160> isn't<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.460> rant<00:00:35.670> that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
some tweaking so this isn't a rant that

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.850 
some tweaking so this isn't a rant that
the<00:00:35.969> game<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.270> glitchy<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.870> glitchy<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.829> i

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the game is glitchy it is glitchy but i

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.930 
the game is glitchy it is glitchy but i
wanted<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> little<00:00:38.700> bit<00:00:38.790> more

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
wanted to be a little bit more

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.130 
wanted to be a little bit more
constructive<00:00:39.510> than<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.780> because<00:00:39.930> that's

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
constructive than that because that's

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.229 
constructive than that because that's
not<00:00:40.290> really<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> get<00:00:40.800> us<00:00:40.890> anywhere<00:00:41.239> so

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
not really going to get us anywhere so

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.280 
not really going to get us anywhere so
the<00:00:42.360> first<00:00:42.480> thing<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.809> wanted<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> talk<00:00:43.230> about

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the first thing I wanted to talk about

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
the first thing I wanted to talk about
is<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.040> flashlights<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.239> at

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
is the flashlights that you can have at

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.569 
is the flashlights that you can have at
the<00:00:45.450> end<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.800> weapons<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.280> also

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the end of your your weapons and also

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
the end of your your weapons and also
the<00:00:47.700> lasers<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.239> think<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> cool<00:00:49.230> concept

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the lasers I think it's a cool concept

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.830 
the lasers I think it's a cool concept
but<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.010> think<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.340> needs<00:00:50.370> some<00:00:50.789> tweaking<00:00:51.030> as<00:00:51.329> of

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
but I think it needs some tweaking as of

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.660 
but I think it needs some tweaking as of
right<00:00:51.870> now<00:00:52.110> especially<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:53.160> you're<00:00:53.280> indoors

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
right now especially if you're indoors

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.850 
right now especially if you're indoors
and<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> dark<00:00:54.210> area<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.350> come<00:00:55.649> across

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and it's a dark area if you come across

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.459 
and it's a dark area if you come across
someone<00:00:56.250> who<00:00:56.399> has<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> flashlight<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.260> are

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
someone who has a flashlight you are

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.410 
someone who has a flashlight you are
completely<00:00:58.680> blinded<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> i<00:00:59.730> know<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.120> is

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
completely blinded and i know this is is

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
completely blinded and i know this is is
this<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.960> intended<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.920> i<00:01:01.949> think<00:01:02.190> right<00:01:02.340> now

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
this is intended but i think right now

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.469 
this is intended but i think right now
it<00:01:02.730> gets<00:01:02.820> its<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.570> little<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:04.110> overdone

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
it gets its it's a little bit overdone

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.210 
it gets its it's a little bit overdone
for<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> most<00:01:06.780> part<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.409> i<00:01:07.950> come<00:01:08.130> across

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
for the most part if i come across

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.590 
for the most part if i come across
someone<00:01:08.580> indoors<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
someone indoors and they have a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.030 
someone indoors and they have a
flashlight<00:01:09.900> they<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> huge<00:01:10.830> advantage

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
flashlight they have a huge advantage

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.820 
flashlight they have a huge advantage
over<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.140> while<00:01:13.140> i<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:13.650> is

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.530 
blinding light if there was some way to
counter<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.210> would<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.420> good

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
counter this I think it would be good

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.120 
counter this I think it would be good
but<00:01:33.720> right<00:01:33.900> now<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> flashlight<00:01:34.770> has<00:01:34.950> no

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
but right now the flashlight has no

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.530 
but right now the flashlight has no
countermeasures<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.030> think<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
countermeasures and I think that is a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.830 
countermeasures and I think that is a
problem<00:01:36.840> also<00:01:37.829> outside<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.450> little<00:01:39.689> bit

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
problem also outside it is a little bit

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.170 
problem also outside it is a little bit
too<00:01:40.020> bright<00:01:40.320> blinding<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:41.070> well<00:01:41.310> I'm<00:01:41.970> not

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
too bright blinding as well I'm not

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.490 
too bright blinding as well I'm not
really<00:01:42.329> sure<00:01:42.420> how<00:01:42.720> powerful<00:01:43.290> these

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
really sure how powerful these

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.609 
really sure how powerful these
flashlights<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:45.090> most<00:01:45.750> cases<00:01:45.869> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
flashlights are but in most cases you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.770 
flashlights are but in most cases you
know<00:01:46.710> when<00:01:47.040> you're<00:01:47.520> outside<00:01:47.640> your<00:01:48.149> eyes<00:01:48.329> are

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
know when you're outside your eyes are

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
know when you're outside your eyes are
less<00:01:49.470> dilated<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.700> they're<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.939> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
less dilated and so they're going to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.550 
less dilated and so they're going to
take<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.270> less<00:01:51.450> light<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.049> even<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.439> there

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
take in less light and so even if there

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.530 
take in less light and so even if there
is<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.220> flashlight<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
is a is a flashlight it's not going to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.569 
is a is a flashlight it's not going to
have<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.720> large<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.140> an<00:01:55.590> effect<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.189> this

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
have that large of an effect on you this

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.999 
have that large of an effect on you this
is<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.850> know<00:01:56.969> kind<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.270> science<00:01:57.770> at<00:01:58.770> least

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
is you know kind of science at least

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.830 
is you know kind of science at least
they<00:01:59.670> may<00:01:59.850> be<00:01:59.909> using<00:02:00.090> some<00:02:00.390> pretty<00:02:00.630> badass

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
they may be using some pretty badass

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.359 
they may be using some pretty badass
flashlights<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.159> don't<00:02:02.310> think

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
flashlights but I really don't think

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.190 
flashlights but I really don't think
that's<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> case<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.600> outside

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that's the case so I think outside

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.749 
that's the case so I think outside
flashlight<00:02:04.920> should<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.250> pretty<00:02:05.520> much

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
flashlight should be pretty much

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.340 
flashlight should be pretty much
nullified<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.329> really<00:02:06.750> don't<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.140> they

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
nullified I really don't think that they

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559 
nullified I really don't think that they
really<00:02:07.520> should<00:02:08.520> benefit<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.000> at<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.300> i<00:02:09.330> think

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
really should benefit you at all i think

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.580 
really should benefit you at all i think
they<00:02:09.750> should<00:02:09.989> actually<00:02:10.140> be<00:02:10.530> a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
they should actually be a

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.110 
they should actually be a
they<00:02:12.160> should<00:02:12.310> actually<00:02:12.459> hurt<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:12.879> they

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
they should actually hurt you they

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.550 
they should actually hurt you they
should<00:02:13.269> notify<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.629> enemy<00:02:14.080> as<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.379> where

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
should notify the enemy as to where

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.259 
should notify the enemy as to where
you're<00:02:14.709> at<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.610> should<00:02:15.790> get<00:02:15.879> you<00:02:16.030> killed

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
you're at and that should get you killed

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.750 
you're at and that should get you killed
to<00:02:16.510> be<00:02:16.599> honest<00:02:16.900> at<00:02:17.050> least<00:02:17.110> that's<00:02:17.349> my<00:02:17.410> opinion

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
to be honest at least that's my opinion

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.430 
to be honest at least that's my opinion
as<00:02:18.760> for<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> lasers<00:02:19.510> i<00:02:19.540> also<00:02:19.989> think<00:02:20.260> they're

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
as for the lasers i also think they're

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.470 
as for the lasers i also think they're
very<00:02:20.470> cool<00:02:20.830> but<00:02:21.129> I<00:02:21.160> not<00:02:21.970> sure<00:02:22.239> if<00:02:22.360> it's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
very cool but I not sure if it's

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.030 
very cool but I not sure if it's
implemented<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.200> where<00:02:23.410> if<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.709> laser<00:02:23.920> is

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
implemented to where if the laser is

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.339 
implemented to where if the laser is
pointed<00:02:24.730> at<00:02:24.819> your<00:02:24.910> head<00:02:24.970> if<00:02:25.360> that's<00:02:25.989> when<00:02:26.230> you

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
pointed at your head if that's when you

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.839 
pointed at your head if that's when you
actually<00:02:26.530> see<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.040> laser<00:02:27.190> on<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:27.730> know<00:02:27.819> on

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
actually see the laser on you know on

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.759 
actually see the laser on you know on
your<00:02:28.000> screen<00:02:28.480> or<00:02:28.629> if<00:02:29.140> it's<00:02:29.260> anywhere<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.739> your

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
your screen or if it's anywhere on your

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.619 
your screen or if it's anywhere on your
body<00:02:29.890> if<00:02:30.340> it's<00:02:30.489> anyone<00:02:30.819> your<00:02:31.030> body<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.330> think

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
body if it's anyone your body I think

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.330 
body if it's anyone your body I think
that's<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.840> little<00:02:31.959> bit<00:02:32.200> too<00:02:32.560> ridiculous

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
that's a little bit too ridiculous

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.860 
that's a little bit too ridiculous
because<00:02:33.549> it's<00:02:33.760> also<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.090> little<00:02:34.209> bit<00:02:34.330> blinding

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
because it's also a little bit blinding

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.780 
because it's also a little bit blinding
it<00:02:35.500> does<00:02:35.709> notify<00:02:36.129> you<00:02:36.190> if<00:02:36.400> someone<00:02:36.700> is

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
it does notify you if someone is

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.009 
it does notify you if someone is
shooting<00:02:36.940> or<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.330> know<00:02:37.420> trying<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.750> get<00:02:37.870> a

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
shooting or you know trying to get a

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.460 
shooting or you know trying to get a
shot<00:02:38.319> off<00:02:38.349> on<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.769> but<00:02:39.489> just<00:02:40.080> having<00:02:41.080> these

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
shot off on you but just having these

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.979 
shot off on you but just having these
blinding<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.940> know<00:02:43.060> lights<00:02:43.330> in<00:02:43.569> your<00:02:43.720> you

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
blinding you know lights in your you

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.630 
blinding you know lights in your you
know<00:02:44.079> on<00:02:44.230> your<00:02:44.380> screen<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.890> just<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.310> little<00:02:45.519> bit

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
know on your screen is just a little bit

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.039 
know on your screen is just a little bit
frustrating<00:02:46.209> i<00:02:46.299> think<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.569> should<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:46.750> toned

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
frustrating i think it should be toned

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.150 
frustrating i think it should be toned
down<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.260> little<00:02:47.410> bit<00:02:47.530> because<00:02:47.680> like<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.099> said

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
down a little bit because like I said

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.800 
down a little bit because like I said
there<00:02:48.459> really<00:02:48.670> is<00:02:48.849> or<00:02:49.000> at<00:02:49.060> least<00:02:49.120> not<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.720> my

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
there really is or at least not to my

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.449 
there really is or at least not to my
knowledge<00:02:49.840> there<00:02:50.739> isn't<00:02:50.920> anything<00:02:51.310> that

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
knowledge there isn't anything that

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.910 
knowledge there isn't anything that
actually<00:02:51.700> counters<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:52.690> i<00:02:52.900> think<00:02:53.319> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
actually counters it so i think the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.259 
actually counters it so i think the
flashlights<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.610> lasers<00:02:54.940> are<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> cool

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
flashlights and the lasers are a cool

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.670 
flashlights and the lasers are a cool
idea<00:02:55.420> i<00:02:55.599> just<00:02:55.720> think<00:02:56.019> they<00:02:56.110> need<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.319> be<00:02:56.410> toned

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
idea i just think they need to be toned

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.190 
idea i just think they need to be toned
down<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:56.890> little<00:02:57.069> bit<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.510> something<00:02:58.840> else<00:02:59.079> that

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
down a little bit so something else that

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.839 
down a little bit so something else that
i<00:02:59.230> would<00:02:59.379> really<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.799> to<00:02:59.980> see<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.370> the

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
i would really like to see in the

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.479 
i would really like to see in the
released<00:03:01.510> version<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:02.739> game<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:03.220> some

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
released version of this game is some

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.039 
released version of this game is some
sort<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.760> squad<00:03:04.030> management<00:03:04.540> when<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.810> are

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
sort of squad management when you are

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.470 
sort of squad management when you are
actually<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.829> game<00:03:06.160> right<00:03:06.760> now<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:07.180> i<00:03:07.269> think

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
actually in game right now and i think

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.119 
actually in game right now and i think
i've<00:03:07.569> heard<00:03:07.900> somewhere<00:03:08.349> that<00:03:08.410> they<00:03:08.680> have<00:03:08.920> no

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
i've heard somewhere that they have no

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.890 
i've heard somewhere that they have no
plans<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.700> implementing<00:03:10.239> this<00:03:10.420> i<00:03:10.599> could<00:03:10.810> be

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
plans of implementing this i could be

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.020 
plans of implementing this i could be
wrong<00:03:10.930> but<00:03:11.379> right<00:03:12.310> now<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.459> only<00:03:12.610> way<00:03:12.970> to

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
wrong but right now the only way to

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.289 
wrong but right now the only way to
actually<00:03:14.129> you<00:03:15.129> know<00:03:15.160> manage<00:03:15.519> your<00:03:15.670> squad<00:03:16.000> is

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
actually you know manage your squad is

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.780 
actually you know manage your squad is
to<00:03:16.630> do<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.900> through<00:03:17.079> Battlelog<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.730> you

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
to do it through Battlelog and so you

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.240 
to do it through Battlelog and so you
set<00:03:19.329> up<00:03:19.420> your<00:03:19.450> friends<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.290> join<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.620> party<00:03:20.889> and

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
set up your friends you join a party and

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.520 
set up your friends you join a party and
then<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.579> join<00:03:21.819> into<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.150> game<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:23.350> then<00:03:23.500> I

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
then you join into a game and then I

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.220 
then you join into a game and then I
think<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.310> are<00:03:24.549> all<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:25.389> the<00:03:25.510> same<00:03:25.540> squad<00:03:25.989> if

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
think you are all in the same squad if

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.470 
think you are all in the same squad if
that<00:03:26.709> is<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:26.950> case<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.459> that's<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.060> only<00:03:28.120> way

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
that is the case and that's the only way

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.879 
that is the case and that's the only way
to<00:03:28.540> actually<00:03:28.750> go<00:03:29.049> about<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.500> think<00:03:29.560> that

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
to actually go about it I think that

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.050 
to actually go about it I think that
that's<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.099> little<00:03:30.280> narrow<00:03:30.459> minded<00:03:30.880> and

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
that's a little narrow minded and

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.940 
that's a little narrow minded and
doesn't<00:03:31.480> really<00:03:31.750> speak<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.139> how<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.620> lot<00:03:32.829> of

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
doesn't really speak to how a lot of

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.650 
doesn't really speak to how a lot of
players<00:03:33.130> will<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.730> know<00:03:33.819> come<00:03:34.120> across<00:03:34.420> their

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
players will you know come across their

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.150 
players will you know come across their
friends<00:03:35.049> for<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.590> most<00:03:35.709> part<00:03:35.829> you're<00:03:36.099> going

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
friends for the most part you're going

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.620 
friends for the most part you're going
to<00:03:36.400> have<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:36.609> friend<00:03:36.760> who's<00:03:36.970> already<00:03:37.090> in<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.420> game

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
to have a friend who's already in a game

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.360 
to have a friend who's already in a game
you're<00:03:37.840> going<00:03:38.109> to<00:03:38.230> jump<00:03:38.590> into<00:03:38.739> that<00:03:38.889> game<00:03:39.099> and

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
you're going to jump into that game and

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.520 
you're going to jump into that game and
if<00:03:39.639> you're<00:03:39.819> placed<00:03:40.419> on<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.750> different<00:03:41.230> team<00:03:41.380> or

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
if you're placed on a different team or

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.650 
if you're placed on a different team or
let's<00:03:41.919> say<00:03:42.069> your<00:03:42.220> squad<00:03:42.579> is<00:03:42.730> already<00:03:42.970> full<00:03:43.209> I'm

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
let's say your squad is already full I'm

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.170 
let's say your squad is already full I'm
not<00:03:43.780> going<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:43.989> be<00:03:44.079> in<00:03:44.169> your<00:03:44.260> squad<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.190> just

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
not going to be in your squad so I just

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.599 
not going to be in your squad so I just
think<00:03:46.419> that<00:03:46.720> having<00:03:47.019> some<00:03:47.410> sort<00:03:47.980> of<00:03:48.099> squad

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
think that having some sort of squad

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.479 
think that having some sort of squad
management<00:03:49.180> when<00:03:49.530> when<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.560> actually<00:03:50.829> are<00:03:51.310> in

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
management when when you actually are in

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.509 
management when when you actually are in
the<00:03:51.609> game<00:03:51.819> is<00:03:52.030> just<00:03:52.840> essential<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.590> have<00:03:54.340> no

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
the game is just essential to I have no

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.339 
the game is just essential to I have no
reason<00:03:54.760> why<00:03:55.090> this<00:03:55.150> shouldn't<00:03:55.720> be<00:03:55.810> implemented

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
reason why this shouldn't be implemented

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.930 
reason why this shouldn't be implemented
i'm<00:03:56.500> not<00:03:56.709> sure<00:03:56.919> what<00:03:57.099> their<00:03:57.280> thought<00:03:57.519> process

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
i'm not sure what their thought process

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.780 
i'm not sure what their thought process
behind<00:03:57.970> not<00:03:58.930> having<00:03:59.349> it<00:03:59.500> in<00:03:59.650> game<00:03:59.889> is<00:04:00.160> they<00:04:00.639> had

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
behind not having it in game is they had

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.129 
behind not having it in game is they had
it<00:04:00.910> in<00:04:00.970> bad<00:04:01.090> company<00:04:01.299> they<00:04:01.840> had<00:04:01.989> it<00:04:02.109> in

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
it in bad company they had it in

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.920 
it in bad company they had it in
battlefield<00:04:02.590> two<00:04:02.889> so<00:04:03.669> I'm<00:04:04.269> just<00:04:04.720> not<00:04:04.810> sure

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
battlefield two so I'm just not sure

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.420 
battlefield two so I'm just not sure
what<00:04:05.440> their<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:06.010> know<00:04:06.130> what<00:04:06.280> they're

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
what their you know what they're

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.220 
what their you know what they're
thinking<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:06.940> if<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.480> could<00:04:07.630> have<00:04:07.750> something<00:04:08.109> I

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
thinking so if I could have something I

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.870 
thinking so if I could have something I
would<00:04:08.290> really<00:04:08.590> enjoy<00:04:08.889> some<00:04:09.400> sort<00:04:09.609> of<00:04:09.639> squad

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
would really enjoy some sort of squad

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.960 
would really enjoy some sort of squad
management<00:04:10.389> while<00:04:11.049> you're<00:04:11.319> in<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.560> game

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
management while you're in the game

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.509 
management while you're in the game
another<00:04:12.970> thing<00:04:13.269> is<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.930> recon<00:04:14.500> glint<00:04:14.919> I<00:04:15.130> know

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
another thing is the recon glint I know

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.729 
another thing is the recon glint I know
a<00:04:15.730> lot<00:04:15.940> of<00:04:15.970> people<00:04:16.060> are<00:04:16.570> pretty<00:04:17.079> upset<00:04:17.500> by<00:04:17.680> this

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
a lot of people are pretty upset by this

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.080 
a lot of people are pretty upset by this
but<00:04:18.130> if<00:04:18.220> you're<00:04:18.310> not<00:04:18.430> aware<00:04:18.700> of<00:04:18.760> what<00:04:19.000> it

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
but if you're not aware of what it

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.569 
but if you're not aware of what it
actually<00:04:19.239> is<00:04:19.620> if<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:20.799> have<00:04:20.979> a<00:04:21.010> high-powered

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
actually is if you have a high-powered

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.800 
actually is if you have a high-powered
scope<00:04:21.729> it<00:04:22.030> doesn't<00:04:22.270> have<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.479> you<00:04:22.630> don't<00:04:22.780> have

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
scope it doesn't have to you don't have

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.350 
scope it doesn't have to you don't have
to<00:04:22.930> be<00:04:23.050> playing<00:04:23.320> as<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.620> recon

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
to be playing as a recon

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.790 
to be playing as a recon
can<00:04:25.449> be<00:04:25.569> really<00:04:25.780> beyond<00:04:26.050> any<00:04:26.289> weapon<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:26.740> is

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
can be really beyond any weapon that is

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.040 
can be really beyond any weapon that is
using<00:04:27.099> the<00:04:27.159> high-powered<00:04:27.639> scope<00:04:27.900> there<00:04:28.900> will

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
using the high-powered scope there will

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.589 
using the high-powered scope there will
be<00:04:29.080> a<00:04:29.169> glint<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:29.919> shows<00:04:30.189> off<00:04:30.520> on<00:04:30.849> your<00:04:31.150> on

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
be a glint that shows off on your on

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.649 
be a glint that shows off on your on
your<00:04:31.659> rifle<00:04:32.229> or<00:04:32.409> you<00:04:33.159> know<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.370> scope<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.849> it

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:34.659 
your rifle or you know the scope and it

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.529 
your rifle or you know the scope and it
just<00:04:34.900> notifies<00:04:35.319> players<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:36.069> you<00:04:36.280> are<00:04:36.610> you

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
just notifies players that you are you

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.990 
just notifies players that you are you
know<00:04:37.629> you're<00:04:37.780> that<00:04:38.050> you're<00:04:38.169> there<00:04:38.439> and<00:04:38.879> to<00:04:39.879> be

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
know you're that you're there and to be

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.760 
know you're that you're there and to be
honest<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.360> think<00:04:40.419> that<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:41.020> is<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.199> little<00:04:41.500> bit

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
honest I think that it is a little bit

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.909 
honest I think that it is a little bit
too<00:04:42.360> ridiculous<00:04:43.360> as<00:04:43.539> of<00:04:43.960> right<00:04:44.139> now<00:04:44.169> if<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.680> try

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
too ridiculous as of right now if I try

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.129 
too ridiculous as of right now if I try
to<00:04:44.979> snipe<00:04:45.280> snipers<00:04:45.759> I<00:04:45.969> just<00:04:46.629> feel<00:04:46.810> like<00:04:46.840> I'm

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
to snipe snipers I just feel like I'm

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.219 
to snipe snipers I just feel like I'm
shooting<00:04:47.560> at<00:04:47.800> lights<00:04:48.520> i<00:04:48.819> I<00:04:49.000> don't<00:04:49.270> I<00:04:49.659> can't<00:04:49.990> see

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
shooting at lights i I don't I can't see

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.350 
shooting at lights i I don't I can't see
where<00:04:50.409> their<00:04:50.620> head<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:50.830> I<00:04:51.219> I<00:04:51.699> can<00:04:51.939> kind<00:04:52.210> of

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
where their head is I I can kind of

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.179 
where their head is I I can kind of
assume<00:04:52.840> where<00:04:52.990> their<00:04:53.139> head<00:04:53.289> is<00:04:53.319> but<00:04:53.650> it's<00:04:53.860> just

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:54.189 
assume where their head is but it's just

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.189 
assume where their head is but it's just
I<00:04:54.430> think<00:04:55.240> that<00:04:55.419> they<00:04:55.509> should<00:04:55.539> change<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:56.050> so

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
I think that they should change it so

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.170 
I think that they should change it so
that<00:04:56.229> it<00:04:56.560> isn't<00:04:56.889> just<00:04:57.129> a<00:04:57.280> constant<00:04:57.759> stream<00:04:58.120> of

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
that it isn't just a constant stream of

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.059 
that it isn't just a constant stream of
light<00:04:58.479> and<00:04:58.719> that<00:04:58.870> every<00:04:59.319> it<00:04:59.590> only<00:04:59.710> happens

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
light and that every it only happens

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.619 
light and that every it only happens
every<00:05:00.159> once<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:00.580> a<00:05:00.639> while<00:05:00.849> I<00:05:01.029> would<00:05:01.120> assume<00:05:01.419> in

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
every once in a while I would assume in

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.719 
every once in a while I would assume in
the<00:05:01.719> field<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.319> would<00:05:02.379> occur<00:05:02.740> when<00:05:03.219> a<00:05:03.250> sniper

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
the field it would occur when a sniper

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.179 
the field it would occur when a sniper
is<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:05.080> know<00:05:05.169> in<00:05:05.319> a<00:05:05.379> position<00:05:05.620> he<00:05:05.919> chained

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.189 
is you know in a position he chained

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:08.640 
is you know in a position he chained
here<00:05:06.370> he<00:05:06.580> moves<00:05:06.789> his<00:05:06.939> scope<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.509> a<00:05:08.169> flash<00:05:08.529> of

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
here he moves his scope and a flash of

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.529 
here he moves his scope and a flash of
light<00:05:08.860> hits<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.550> lens<00:05:09.729> and<00:05:10.000> then<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.240> bounces

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
light hits the lens and then it bounces

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.360 
light hits the lens and then it bounces
out<00:05:10.719> and<00:05:11.020> you<00:05:11.319> see<00:05:11.469> that<00:05:11.620> little<00:05:11.770> glint<00:05:12.099> really

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
out and you see that little glint really

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.029 
out and you see that little glint really
quickly<00:05:12.699> I<00:05:12.849> think<00:05:13.569> it<00:05:13.659> should<00:05:13.810> just<00:05:13.870> be<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.080> tool

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
quickly I think it should just be a tool

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.890 
quickly I think it should just be a tool
that<00:05:15.069> notifies<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:16.090> enemy<00:05:16.419> that<00:05:16.569> there<00:05:16.750> is<00:05:16.870> a

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
that notifies the enemy that there is a

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.689 
that notifies the enemy that there is a
sniper<00:05:17.229> that<00:05:17.529> could<00:05:17.740> be<00:05:17.979> camping<00:05:18.370> in<00:05:18.550> that

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
sniper that could be camping in that

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.999 
sniper that could be camping in that
area<00:05:18.939> just<00:05:19.659> to<00:05:19.840> have<00:05:19.990> this<00:05:20.139> constant<00:05:20.650> stream

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
area just to have this constant stream

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.730 
area just to have this constant stream
of<00:05:21.069> light<00:05:21.310> I<00:05:21.340> think<00:05:21.729> is<00:05:21.909> just<00:05:22.139> obnoxious<00:05:23.139> it

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
of light I think is just obnoxious it

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.589 
of light I think is just obnoxious it
takes<00:05:24.250> away<00:05:24.550> from<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.909> whole<00:05:25.210> sniping

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
takes away from the whole sniping

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.300 
takes away from the whole sniping
experience<00:05:25.990> or<00:05:26.110> killing<00:05:26.469> that<00:05:26.740> individual

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
experience or killing that individual

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.029 
experience or killing that individual
person<00:05:27.699> in<00:05:27.849> my<00:05:28.029> opinion<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.569> really<00:05:29.199> like<00:05:29.830> to

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
person in my opinion I really like to

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.040 
person in my opinion I really like to
see<00:05:30.279> where<00:05:30.639> you<00:05:31.029> know<00:05:31.060> what<00:05:31.389> I'm<00:05:31.509> killing<00:05:31.870> what

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
see where you know what I'm killing what

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.769 
see where you know what I'm killing what
I'm<00:05:32.139> shooting<00:05:32.349> it<00:05:32.650> and<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:33.729> just<00:05:34.270> don't<00:05:34.509> think

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:34.779 
I'm shooting it and I just don't think

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.480 
I'm shooting it and I just don't think
it<00:05:34.870> really<00:05:34.900> adds<00:05:35.259> a<00:05:35.650> whole<00:05:35.740> lot<00:05:36.099> to<00:05:36.250> the<00:05:36.339> game

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
it really adds a whole lot to the game

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.519 
it really adds a whole lot to the game
right<00:05:36.699> now<00:05:36.759> I'm<00:05:37.270> glad<00:05:38.020> that<00:05:38.199> they<00:05:38.289> are<00:05:38.409> trying

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
right now I'm glad that they are trying

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.200 
right now I'm glad that they are trying
to<00:05:38.740> take<00:05:38.889> precautions<00:05:39.490> to<00:05:39.580> eliminate<00:05:40.089> those

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
to take precautions to eliminate those

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.029 
to take precautions to eliminate those
those<00:05:40.690> campaign<00:05:41.199> snipers<00:05:41.589> that<00:05:41.800> really

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
those campaign snipers that really

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.100 
those campaign snipers that really
aren't<00:05:42.219> contributing<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:42.909> most<00:05:43.150> teen<00:05:43.629> battles

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
aren't contributing to most teen battles

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.749 
aren't contributing to most teen battles
but<00:05:44.650> I<00:05:44.710> think<00:05:45.069> that<00:05:45.190> they<00:05:45.279> have<00:05:45.310> overdone<00:05:45.729> it

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 
but I think that they have overdone it

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.550 
but I think that they have overdone it
in<00:05:45.940> this<00:05:46.000> case<00:05:46.240> and<00:05:46.449> I<00:05:46.629> would<00:05:46.779> like<00:05:46.930> to<00:05:46.960> like<00:05:47.469> I

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
in this case and I would like to like I

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.379 
in this case and I would like to like I
said<00:05:47.770> have<00:05:48.219> it<00:05:48.370> happened<00:05:48.639> you<00:05:49.029> know<00:05:49.120> less

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
said have it happened you know less

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.629 
said have it happened you know less
frequently<00:05:49.960> and<00:05:50.169> maybe<00:05:50.770> just<00:05:51.039> tone<00:05:51.250> down<00:05:51.279> the

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
frequently and maybe just tone down the

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.969 
frequently and maybe just tone down the
actual<00:05:51.909> flash<00:05:52.089> itself<00:05:52.479> so<00:05:52.659> I<00:05:52.839> think<00:05:53.620> if<00:05:53.860> they

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
actual flash itself so I think if they

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.040 
actual flash itself so I think if they
do<00:05:54.039> that<00:05:54.370> it<00:05:54.789> will<00:05:54.939> make<00:05:54.969> sniping<00:05:55.689> first<00:05:55.930> of

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
do that it will make sniping first of

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.769 
do that it will make sniping first of
all<00:05:56.169> a<00:05:56.349> little<00:05:56.710> bit<00:05:56.889> more<00:05:57.069> enjoyable<00:05:57.550> and<00:05:57.969> if

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779 
all a little bit more enjoyable and if

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:59.879 
all a little bit more enjoyable and if
you're<00:05:58.900> trying<00:05:59.050> to<00:05:59.139> actually<00:05:59.259> kill<00:05:59.560> a<00:05:59.589> sniper

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
you're trying to actually kill a sniper

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.200 
you're trying to actually kill a sniper
you<00:06:00.219> don't<00:06:00.400> just<00:06:00.460> feel<00:06:00.699> like<00:06:00.789> you're<00:06:00.939> shooting

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
you don't just feel like you're shooting
