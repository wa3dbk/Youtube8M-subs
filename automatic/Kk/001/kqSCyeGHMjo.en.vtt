by with our heads held high the other
rotation<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:44.969> rescued<00:00:45.300> Louie<00:00:45.539> has<00:00:45.840> vanished

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
rotation we rescued Louie has vanished

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.180 
rotation we rescued Louie has vanished
which<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.770> troubling

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
which is troubling

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.950 
which is troubling
I<00:00:47.309> thought<00:00:47.850> he<00:00:48.000> boarded<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> SS<00:00:48.480> Drake<00:00:48.809> with

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
I thought he boarded the SS Drake with

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.439 
I thought he boarded the SS Drake with
us<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.260> maybe<00:00:49.440> he<00:00:49.620> left<00:00:49.920> without<00:00:50.160> him<00:00:50.460> still

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
us but maybe he left without him still

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.880 
us but maybe he left without him still
from<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.930> we've<00:00:52.079> seen<00:00:52.110> I'm<00:00:52.559> sure<00:00:52.590> he'll<00:00:52.860> be

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
from what we've seen I'm sure he'll be

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.869 
from what we've seen I'm sure he'll be
ok<00:00:53.250> wherever<00:00:53.610> he<00:00:53.730> is

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
ok wherever he is

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.060 
ok wherever he is
so<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.750> reveals<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.350> Louie<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
so this reveals that Louie is

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.970 
so this reveals that Louie is
accidentally<00:00:56.550> left<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.120> PMF<00:00:57.510> 404<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.410> don't
