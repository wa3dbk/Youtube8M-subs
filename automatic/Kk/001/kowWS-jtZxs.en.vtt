00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.790
 or the one that more friends here speaks to you here 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.439
 retailer again and how is it 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.990
 custom bring them back something about 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.930
 food this time I want to show you 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.920
 what I bought in the store for me 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.830
 feeding for 2 to 3 days more or less 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.619
 here I show this is ground beef from 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.679
 turkey is a ground meat that is low in 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.159
 fat the turkey does not have much fat 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:31.949
 I bought two more or less one for each day 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:34.770
 here is ground beef too low 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.530
 in fat it is always good to vary the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.500
 types of meat you eat are types of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.829
 proteins a little different ones have 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 less fat more fat and good to me 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.289
 like to always vary here a little 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.289
 tuna is also tuna protein is 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.030
 great not only for its content 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.210
 proteins but because it's a food 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.940
 easy to prepare simply open it 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.609
 you take out the water and you can put it on 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.190
 rice to any carbohydrate 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.380
 It is definitely very very 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.810
 here I have apples I have more no refrigerators 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.560
 the apples as between meals for a 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.659
 little cheese coot the cottage cheese is 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.539
 high in low fat protein and 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.079
 carbohydrates and I use it for my snack 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.580
 I usually use it sometimes for 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:30.420
 combine it with eggs in the morning 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.570
 here what is never missing in my food in 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.660
 My food is oats, oats, 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.120
 I use every morning with her something my 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.980
 oatmeal pancakes those that already 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.670
 will show previous videos or else 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.000
 simply the accommodation I just love 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.160
 week here is the rennet that we have 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.150
 three of the video passed high in protein to 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.660
 low in fat 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.750
 for two sometimes what is said oats are 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.410
 very good are carbohydrates but they are 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.330
 good to avoid injuries here is the 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.940
 propolis always eating it with the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.170
 ground war broccoli also has 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.660
 protein is terrific has vitamin k2 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.950
 I would consider it essential 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.590
 here soy milk better than milk 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.680
 normal for me 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.260
 some green tea I always take 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.660
 after lunch and dinner I 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.120
 helps digestion and also helps 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.580
 a little accelerate the metabolism 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.269
 the eggs that can never miss me 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.560
 breakfast I can eat them so alone 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:45.110
 the pancakes or cooked or scrambled 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.980
 any way but always breakfast 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:53.120
 juicy and good that's basically my 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.180
 food of two to three days I am a 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.430
 person who like almost always the same 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.250
 it also does not matter after I 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.510
 serve to meet my goals and good 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.840
 this is what has helped me 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.590
 moment is sometimes clearly several 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.569
 checked fish checked chicken some 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.849
 other things but this is what it is for 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.980
 me easier to prepare because I live 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.739
 I just have to prepare my food all 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.049
 the meals of the day and good has 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.599
 result very much and these are the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.310
 foods that I recommend are are 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.819
 things that 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.950
 they are not high in calories they keep 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.489
 full for example oats is a 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.489
 Complex carbohydrate in oats is 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.560
 excellent for its fiber content and 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.140
 Besides, it helps you regulate 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.470
 insulin levels helps you lower the 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.060
 bad and good cholesterol this is 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.580
 basically everything as friends 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.709
 I hope you have an idea more or less 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.800
 of how your food should be and this 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.480
 will help them make profits 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.480
 hug friends and see you
