00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.059
 the territory thailand is located in 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.369
 Southeast Asia and extends 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.830
 southeast of the last foothills of the 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.369
 himalaya to pacific and indian 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.369
 ocean 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.279
 the deer of the machines are also becoming current 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.570
 used around the necessary 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.949
 infrastructural measures faster 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.949
 and perform better 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.230
 the road network of about 50,000 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.949
 kilometers is partly very bad 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.170
 expanded 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.379
 Steer machines are submerged here 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.120
 used for the removal 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.839
 Environmentally efficient and professional 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.839
 advance 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.520
 after the first steer machine 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.009
 Thailand reached were following 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.950
 some machinists and technicians through 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.759
 specialists right on the spot to the new 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.759
 system trained 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.810
 Stehr machines have a high level 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.970
 Energy efficiency through economical 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.229
 fuel consumption as well as low 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.229
 pollutant and noise emissions 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.450
 the thai company you at intertek 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.940
 machines quickly recognized the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.750
 Advantages of stone soil stabilization 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.030
 combination sbf 24 line 6 to 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.220
 Dust-free milling of binders 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.740
 man was so convinced of the system 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.080
 that one has decided the steer 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.710
 machines in future in thailand too 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.710
 to evict 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.869
 about a specially developed 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.239
 Onboard computers can and binders 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.050
 amount of water introduced exactly and 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.050
 be documented 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.489
 He was the first manufacturer ever 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.590
 the one machine combination for 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.930
 Apply dust-free and mix 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.790
 has developed of binders 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.890
 Advantages of sterr machines the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.440
 are now in use worldwide 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.440
 were also quickly recognized in Thailand 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.269
 when using standard machines comes 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.190
 it by the dusty de aggressive 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.860
 binders to a huge burden 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.870
 of man machine and environment 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.370
 this is not timely and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.930
 no longer corresponds to the state of 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.819
 technology 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.370
 that is why more and more are coming in the meantime 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.980
 unique steer machines made in 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.459
 germany on all continents to 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.459
 commitment 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.390
 Steer recognizes problems this 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.599
 It is our vision to solve quickly 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.340
 That's our advantage for that 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.340
 we precede all others 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:30.070
 other innovative steer machines
