been using on my demon seed these ones
are<00:00:17.380> 70<00:00:18.380> millimeter<00:00:18.800> ATA<00:00:19.640> they're<00:00:20.360> centerset

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 
are 70 millimeter ATA they're centerset

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.090 
are 70 millimeter ATA they're centerset
and<00:00:21.789> i<00:00:22.789> very<00:00:22.850> much<00:00:23.330> enjoy<00:00:23.840> these<00:00:24.020> wheels<00:00:24.289> they

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
and i very much enjoy these wheels they

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.609 
and i very much enjoy these wheels they
grip<00:00:25.400> really<00:00:25.789> well<00:00:25.939> out<00:00:26.210> of<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.990> box<00:00:27.260> when<00:00:27.529> you

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
grip really well out of the box when you

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.740 
grip really well out of the box when you
have<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.949> mold<00:00:28.820> release<00:00:29.000> which<00:00:29.539> I<00:00:29.689> don't

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
have the mold release which I don't

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.810 
have the mold release which I don't
anymore<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:30.560> mold<00:00:30.769> release<00:00:30.890> on<00:00:31.250> them<00:00:31.460> they're

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
anymore the mold release on them they're

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.210 
anymore the mold release on them they're
really<00:00:32.180> grippy<00:00:32.599> and<00:00:32.870> they<00:00:33.410> hold<00:00:33.680> speed<00:00:34.010> well

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
really grippy and they hold speed well

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.460 
really grippy and they hold speed well
they<00:00:34.489> actually<00:00:34.790> hold<00:00:34.940> speed<00:00:35.210> well<00:00:35.390> um<00:00:35.870> throw

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
they actually hold speed well um throw

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.979 
they actually hold speed well um throw
out<00:00:36.530> there<00:00:36.710> on<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.550> life<00:00:37.699> of<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:37.970> wheel<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:38.390> if

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
out there on the life of the wheel so if

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.450 
out there on the life of the wheel so if
you're<00:00:39.559> looking<00:00:39.680> for<00:00:39.829> downhill<00:00:40.130> it's

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
you're looking for downhill it's

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.880 
you're looking for downhill it's
definitely<00:00:40.969> something<00:00:41.149> to<00:00:41.300> think<00:00:41.329> about

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
definitely something to think about

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.470 
definitely something to think about
because<00:00:42.890> your<00:00:43.160> center<00:00:43.430> set<00:00:43.670> when<00:00:44.030> they<00:00:44.210> start

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
because your center set when they start

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.590 
because your center set when they start
coning<00:00:44.870> you<00:00:44.989> just<00:00:45.230> you<00:00:45.710> just<00:00:46.450> flip<00:00:47.450> them

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
coning you just you just flip them

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.260 
coning you just you just flip them
around<00:00:47.719> and<00:00:48.670> start<00:00:49.670> wearing<00:00:49.910> it<00:00:49.969> down<00:00:50.120> more

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
around and start wearing it down more

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.479 
around and start wearing it down more
evenly<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:50.930> they<00:00:51.230> do<00:00:51.289> they<00:00:51.860> last<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.309> long<00:00:52.340> time

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
evenly so they do they last a long time

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.000 
evenly so they do they last a long time
which<00:00:52.969> is<00:00:53.120> nice<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:53.680> some<00:00:54.680> great

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
which is nice to some great

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.389 
which is nice to some great
characteristics<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.760> this<00:00:55.879> wheel<00:00:57.070> brown<00:00:58.070> lips

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
characteristics of this wheel brown lips

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.350 
characteristics of this wheel brown lips
and<00:00:58.940> I<00:00:59.629> don't<00:00:59.690> know<00:00:59.989> if<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:00.289> can<00:01:00.469> tell<00:01:00.829> but

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
and I don't know if you can tell but

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.900 
and I don't know if you can tell but
right<00:01:02.360> here<00:01:02.629> it<00:01:03.410> has<00:01:03.620> like<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:03.890> sharper<00:01:04.640> inner

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
right here it has like a sharper inner

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.830 
right here it has like a sharper inner
and<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:06.140> little<00:01:06.380> bit<00:01:06.440> thicker<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.520> lip<00:01:07.759> and<00:01:08.720> on

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
and a little bit thicker of a lip and on

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.060 
and a little bit thicker of a lip and on
the<00:01:08.960> outside<00:01:09.110> which<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.680> a<00:01:09.710> little<00:01:09.979> more

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
the outside which is a little more

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.160 
the outside which is a little more
beveled<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.790> rounded<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:11.840> little<00:01:12.049> bit

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
beveled and rounded and a little bit

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.350 
beveled and rounded and a little bit
thinner<00:01:12.409> so<00:01:12.799> going<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:13.670> get<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:13.820> little<00:01:14.030> bit

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
thinner so going to get a little bit

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.130 
thinner so going to get a little bit
more<00:01:15.140> resistance<00:01:16.000> as<00:01:17.000> far<00:01:17.450> as<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.930> lip

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
more resistance as far as the lip

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.859 
more resistance as far as the lip
flexing<00:01:19.040> on<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.850> inside<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:20.330> your<00:01:20.479> your

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
flexing on the inside so your your

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.210 
flexing on the inside so your your
slides<00:01:21.140> are<00:01:21.260> going<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.439> be<00:01:21.500> really<00:01:21.799> smooth<00:01:22.100> and

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
slides are going to be really smooth and

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.370 
slides are going to be really smooth and
really<00:01:22.400> clean<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:26.210> another<00:01:26.630> thing<00:01:26.869> the

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
really clean and the another thing the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.399 
really clean and the another thing the
carrier<00:01:27.770> characteristic<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:28.909> urethane

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
carrier characteristic of the urethane

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.140 
carrier characteristic of the urethane
just<00:01:30.409> gives<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.799> smooth<00:01:31.220> consistent<00:01:32.000> a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
just gives it a smooth consistent a

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.100 
just gives it a smooth consistent a
predictable<00:01:35.150> slide<00:01:35.450> you're<00:01:35.750> going<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:35.960> hook

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
predictable slide you're going to hook

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.380 
predictable slide you're going to hook
up<00:01:36.320> right<00:01:36.619> it's<00:01:37.430> going<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.670> break<00:01:37.909> out<00:01:38.150> pretty

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
up right it's going to break out pretty

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.819 
up right it's going to break out pretty
easily<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.020> they're<00:01:39.170> going<00:01:39.259> to<00:01:39.350> be<00:01:39.470> smooth

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
easily and they're going to be smooth

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.819 
easily and they're going to be smooth
and<00:01:40.329> it's<00:01:41.329> just<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:41.990> really<00:01:42.140> good<00:01:42.409> wheel<00:01:42.590> and

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
and it's just a really good wheel and

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.380 
and it's just a really good wheel and
for<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.070> price<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:43.369> really<00:01:43.970> can't<00:01:44.210> go<00:01:44.360> wrong

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
for the price you really can't go wrong

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.690 
for the price you really can't go wrong
I<00:01:44.780> think<00:01:44.810> they're<00:01:45.110> like<00:01:45.259> 45<00:01:45.829> bucks<00:01:46.189> compared

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
I think they're like 45 bucks compared

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.539 
I think they're like 45 bucks compared
the<00:01:46.850> most<00:01:47.350> $55<00:01:48.350> wheels<00:01:48.619> like<00:01:48.829> a<00:01:48.890> thinking

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
the most $55 wheels like a thinking

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.289 
the most $55 wheels like a thinking
orangatang<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.119> like<00:01:50.240> 50<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.990> 54<00:01:51.590> dollars<00:01:52.009> and

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
orangatang is like 50 to 54 dollars and

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.289 
orangatang is like 50 to 54 dollars and
these<00:01:53.299> will<00:01:53.570> last<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.049> just<00:01:55.040> like<00:01:55.549> longer

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
these will last you just like longer

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.410 
these will last you just like longer

than an orangutang and slide better in

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.139 
than an orangutang and slide better in
my<00:01:59.869> opinion<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.920> like<00:02:01.220> an<00:02:01.399> orangutang<00:02:01.939> in

well<00:02:08.269> and<00:02:08.390> they're<00:02:08.509> really<00:02:08.660> smooth<00:02:09.049> but<00:02:09.829> they

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
well and they're really smooth but they

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.620 
well and they're really smooth but they
died<00:02:10.160> in<00:02:10.369> oval<00:02:10.700> eyes<00:02:10.820> really<00:02:11.150> quick<00:02:11.360> these

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
died in oval eyes really quick these

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.559 
died in oval eyes really quick these
ones<00:02:11.959> they<00:02:12.650> are<00:02:12.680> more<00:02:13.250> resistant<00:02:13.850> resilient

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
ones they are more resistant resilient

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.930

to<00:02:14.690> wear<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.489> resistant<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.760> where<00:02:16.910> I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
to wear so and resistant to where I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.020 
to wear so and resistant to where I
guess<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.420> would<00:02:17.569> say<00:02:17.599> so
