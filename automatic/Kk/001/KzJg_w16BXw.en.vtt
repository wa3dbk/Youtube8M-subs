start off splitting a few logs here
Mangia<00:04:16.560> every<00:04:16.799> piece<00:04:16.980> of<00:04:17.010> whatever<00:04:17.310> splitting

Mangia every piece of whatever splitting
is<00:04:18.120> maple

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.419 

well<00:05:06.599> that<00:05:07.379> seemed<00:05:07.589> to<00:05:07.739> be<00:05:07.769> pretty<00:05:07.859> easy<00:05:08.249> for

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:08.429 
well that seemed to be pretty easy for

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:10.069 
well that seemed to be pretty easy for
it<00:05:08.729> splitting<00:05:09.059> off<00:05:09.149> that<00:05:09.359> but<00:05:09.539> it<00:05:09.629> would<00:05:09.779> there

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:10.079 
it splitting off that but it would there

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:13.609 
it splitting off that but it would there
what<00:05:10.979> was<00:05:11.099> the<00:05:11.189> biggest<00:05:11.369> log<00:05:12.179> we<00:05:12.209> split<00:05:12.629> 8

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:13.619 
what was the biggest log we split 8

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:17.269 
what was the biggest log we split 8
inches<00:05:13.949> 10<00:05:14.189> inches<00:05:14.839> well<00:05:15.839> the<00:05:16.829> reason<00:05:17.189> that

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:17.279 
inches 10 inches well the reason that

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:19.429 
inches 10 inches well the reason that
you<00:05:17.399> need<00:05:17.549> power<00:05:17.909> and<00:05:18.359> the<00:05:18.779> reason<00:05:19.079> why<00:05:19.229> a<00:05:19.319> lot

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:19.439 
you need power and the reason why a lot

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.189 
you need power and the reason why a lot
of<00:05:19.469> those<00:05:19.619> softwood<00:05:20.249> splitters<00:05:20.639> not<00:05:21.629> not<00:05:22.019> any

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
of those softwood splitters not not any

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.859 
of those softwood splitters not not any
good<00:05:22.439> to<00:05:22.619> us<00:05:22.769> up<00:05:22.979> around<00:05:23.219> here<00:05:23.599> it's<00:05:24.599> because

good to us up around here it's because

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:28.249 
good to us up around here it's because
the<00:05:24.959> logs<00:05:25.169> like<00:05:25.409> this<00:05:26.989> what<00:05:27.989> do<00:05:28.079> you<00:05:28.139> think

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
the logs like this what do you think

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.809 
the logs like this what do you think
that<00:05:28.379> one<00:05:28.589> is<00:05:28.619> Floyd<00:05:29.149> he's<00:05:30.229> 150<00:05:31.229> pounds<00:05:31.859> pure

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819 
that one is Floyd he's 150 pounds pure

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.299 
that one is Floyd he's 150 pounds pure
maple<00:05:33.089> look<00:05:33.779> at<00:05:33.869> that<00:05:34.049> I<00:05:34.289> bet<00:05:34.769> you<00:05:34.889> that<00:05:35.009> trees

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:35.309 
maple look at that I bet you that trees

00:05:35.309 --> 00:07:22.029 
maple look at that I bet you that trees
a<00:05:35.339> thousand<00:05:35.999> years<00:05:36.179> old<00:05:36.419> man<00:05:38.119> all<00:05:39.119> right

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:27.529 

so<00:07:23.039> there<00:07:23.550> you<00:07:23.639> have<00:07:23.669> it<00:07:25.789> those<00:07:26.789> logs<00:07:27.150> that<00:07:27.419> we

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 
so there you have it those logs that we

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:28.820 
so there you have it those logs that we
split<00:07:27.780> up<00:07:27.810> on<00:07:28.050> there<00:07:28.289> is<00:07:28.380> probably<00:07:28.680> the

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830 
split up on there is probably the

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.890 
split up on there is probably the
biggest<00:07:29.009> that<00:07:29.370> we<00:07:29.580> probably<00:07:30.389> ever<00:07:30.630> put

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 
biggest that we probably ever put

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.200 
biggest that we probably ever put
through<00:07:31.139> it<00:07:31.850> as<00:07:32.850> you<00:07:33.060> can<00:07:33.180> see<00:07:34.759> two<00:07:35.759> pieces<00:07:36.150> of

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210 
through it as you can see two pieces of

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:43.700 
through it as you can see two pieces of
wood<00:07:36.330> turns<00:07:36.630> into<00:07:36.840> quite<00:07:37.110> the<00:07:37.229> pile<00:07:42.710> wood

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:43.710 
wood turns into quite the pile wood

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.009 
wood turns into quite the pile wood
