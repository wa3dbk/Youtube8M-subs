going right you just crossed the ball

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.260 
going right you just crossed the ball

over to your left hand and that's what
that's<00:02:18.540> made<00:02:18.750> main<00:02:19.110> reason<00:02:19.560> why<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
that's made main reason why the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.950 
that's made main reason why the
crossover<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.520> effective<00:02:21.000> because<00:02:21.390> when

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
crossover is so effective because when

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.870 
crossover is so effective because when
you<00:02:22.050> set<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.320> up<00:02:22.500> with<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.740> jab<00:02:23.100> step<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.670> looks

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
you set it up with a jab step it looks

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.240 
you set it up with a jab step it looks
as<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.120> you're<00:02:24.390> going<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.770> specific

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
as if you're going in a specific

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.190 
as if you're going in a specific
direction<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.030> cross<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.630> ball<00:02:27.810> over

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
direction but you cross the ball over

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.100 
direction but you cross the ball over
quickly<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.940> defender<00:02:30.420> gets<00:02:30.600> confused

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
quickly and the defender gets confused

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.350 
quickly and the defender gets confused
that's<00:02:31.380> why<00:02:31.620> that's<00:02:32.430> how<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.850> get<00:02:33.090> somebody

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
that's why that's how you get somebody

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.290 
that's why that's how you get somebody
with<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.750> crossover<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:35.490> watch<00:02:35.700> your<00:02:35.940> favorite
