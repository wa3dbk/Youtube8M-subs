00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
troops let's get to his base right here

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.540 
troops let's get to his base right here
is<00:00:28.050> some<00:00:28.199> nice<00:00:28.380> level<00:00:28.710> defenses<00:00:29.220> they're<00:00:29.460> all

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
is some nice level defenses they're all

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.580 
is some nice level defenses they're all
pretty<00:00:29.789> high<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> biggest<00:00:31.349> problem

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
pretty high up but the biggest problem

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.650 
pretty high up but the biggest problem
with<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.009> base<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.480> two

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
with this base that I have is the two

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.420 
with this base that I have is the two
air<00:00:33.870> defenses<00:00:34.350> while<00:00:34.620> they're<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> high<00:00:35.070> level

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
air defenses while they're a high level

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.639 
air defenses while they're a high level
they're<00:00:35.670> both<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> base<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.500> this

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
they're both out of the base so this

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.950 
they're both out of the base so this
would<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.829> very<00:00:38.280> very<00:00:38.460> easily<00:00:38.850> beaten<00:00:39.780> with

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
would be very very easily beaten with

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.720 
would be very very easily beaten with
like<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.290> dragons<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.829> something<00:00:41.100> just

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
like some dragons or something just

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.040 
like some dragons or something just
dropping<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.149> few<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.920> either<00:00:43.920> archers<00:00:44.520> or

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
dropping a few of either archers or

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.850 
dropping a few of either archers or
Giants<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.140> take<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.440> those<00:00:46.530> two<00:00:46.680> air

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
Giants to take out those two air

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.580 
Giants to take out those two air
defenses<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.670> dropping<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.030> few<00:00:48.590> dragons

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
defenses and just dropping a few dragons

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.529 
defenses and just dropping a few dragons
to<00:00:49.710> take<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:50.070> his<00:00:50.280> archer<00:00:50.820> towers<00:00:51.149> than<00:00:51.329> just

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to take out his archer towers than just

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
to take out his archer towers than just
all<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.350> resources<00:00:52.620> would<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.070> gone<00:00:53.250> so

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
all the resources would be gone so

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.750 
all the resources would be gone so
definitely<00:00:54.149> move<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.020> air<00:00:55.530> defense<00:00:56.100> I'd

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
definitely move that air defense I'd

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.220 
definitely move that air defense I'd
switch<00:00:57.180> those<00:00:57.360> two<00:00:57.390> air<00:00:57.690> defenses<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.140> have

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
switch those two air defenses you have

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.590 
switch those two air defenses you have
two<00:00:58.379> collectors<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.190> each<00:00:59.789> in<00:01:00.000> your<00:01:00.030> base<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
two collectors of each in your base so I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.039 
two collectors of each in your base so I
definitely<00:01:00.840> switch<00:01:01.260> out<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:03.449> air<00:01:03.629> defenses

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
definitely switch out the air defenses

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.390 
definitely switch out the air defenses
with<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> collectors<00:01:04.739> because<00:01:05.010> that'll<00:01:05.309> make

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
with the collectors because that'll make

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.940 
with the collectors because that'll make
your<00:01:05.519> base<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.880> hundred<00:01:06.360> times<00:01:06.450> better<00:01:06.950> right

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
your base a hundred times better right

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.690 
your base a hundred times better right
up<00:01:08.610> next<00:01:09.299> Joshua<00:01:10.229> okay<00:01:10.950> he's<00:01:11.189> also<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.490> town

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.780 
up next Joshua okay he's also a town
hall<00:01:11.880> level<00:01:11.909> 8<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.950> again<00:01:13.950> I'd<00:01:14.250> protect<00:01:14.640> your

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
hall level 8 and again I'd protect your

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.429 
hall level 8 and again I'd protect your
air<00:01:14.909> defenses<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> little<00:01:16.110> bit<00:01:16.290> easier

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
air defenses that be a little bit easier

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.620 
air defenses that be a little bit easier
to<00:01:16.650> Russian<00:01:17.070> destroy<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.850> because<00:01:18.330> your

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to Russian destroy that one because your

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390 
to Russian destroy that one because your
other<00:01:18.780> ones<00:01:18.990> currently<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.439> upgrading<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
other ones currently to upgrading and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.539 
other ones currently to upgrading and
it's<00:01:20.549> still<00:01:20.840> only<00:01:21.840> level<00:01:22.320> 2<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:23.400> still

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
it's still only level 2 and it's still

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.060 
it's still only level 2 and it's still
pretty<00:01:23.700> well<00:01:23.909> exposed<00:01:24.270> ok<00:01:24.860> another<00:01:25.860> thing

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
pretty well exposed ok another thing

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.679 
pretty well exposed ok another thing
your<00:01:26.280> defenses<00:01:26.880> aren't<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.270> high<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.479> they

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
your defenses aren't as high as they

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.120 
your defenses aren't as high as they
should<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.439> time<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> level<00:01:28.860> eight

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
should be for time to level eight

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.940 
should be for time to level eight
especially<00:01:29.579> at<00:01:29.670> 1569<00:01:30.450> trophies<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.680> could

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
especially at 1569 trophies you could

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.289 
especially at 1569 trophies you could
definitely<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.430> beaten<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.759> lot<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.090> just

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
definitely get beaten a lot with just

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.179 
definitely get beaten a lot with just
some<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.570> rust<00:01:33.840> strategies<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.890> I'd<00:01:34.979> either

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
some like rust strategies so I'd either

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.679 
some like rust strategies so I'd either
just<00:01:35.340> go<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.850> air<00:01:36.030> defense<00:01:36.299> take<00:01:36.540> out

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
just go for that air defense take out

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that and rush up and destroy it or just

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.170 
that and rush up and destroy it or just
do<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> big<00:01:39.299> rush<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.750> archers<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.030> Giants<00:01:42.030> and

barbarians<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.290> go<00:01:43.619> right<00:01:43.740> through<00:01:43.950> it

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
barbarians and just go right through it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
barbarians and just go right through it
one<00:01:45.240> big<00:01:45.450> thing<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:45.930> take<00:01:46.200> care<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
one big thing you do take care of is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.609 
one big thing you do take care of is
that<00:01:47.280> all<00:01:47.520> three<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> your<00:01:48.290> mortars<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:49.530> at

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that all three of your mortars are at

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
that all three of your mortars are at
the<00:01:49.710> bottom<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.460> they're<00:01:50.610> only<00:01:50.759> covering<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the bottom so they're only covering the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.880 
the bottom so they're only covering the
bottom<00:01:51.479> half<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> base<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.350> would

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
bottom half of the base I would

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.380 
bottom half of the base I would
definitely<00:01:53.009> move<00:01:53.490> at<00:01:53.700> least<00:01:53.939> one<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
definitely move at least one of the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.719 
definitely move at least one of the
mortar<00:01:54.600> up<00:01:54.840> top<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.070> their<00:01:56.219> mortar<00:01:56.549> power

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
mortar up top so their mortar power

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.459 
mortar up top so their mortar power
covers<00:01:57.180> every<00:01:57.600> single<00:01:57.899> part<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.170> your<00:01:58.290> base

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
covers every single part of your base

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.709 
covers every single part of your base
because<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.610> huge<00:01:59.850> desk<00:02:00.030> that's<00:02:00.360> huge

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
because that's a huge desk that's huge

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.780 
because that's a huge desk that's huge

defenses right there at the front are a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.560 
defenses right there at the front are a
little<00:02:34.260> exposed<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.910> had<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.450> bunch

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
little exposed like if you had a bunch

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.850 
little exposed like if you had a bunch
of<00:02:36.690> goblins<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.350> took<00:02:37.470> out<00:02:37.590> all<00:02:37.620> those

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
of goblins just took out all those

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.070 
of goblins just took out all those
resource<00:02:38.250> collectors<00:02:38.670> then<00:02:39.240> dropped<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.840> bunch

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
resource collectors then dropped a bunch

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.510 
resource collectors then dropped a bunch
of<00:02:40.230> archers<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.740> could<00:02:40.860> take<00:02:40.980> out<00:02:41.130> all<00:02:41.280> those

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
of archers you could take out all those

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.220 
of archers you could take out all those
and<00:02:41.880> for<00:02:42.390> some<00:02:42.540> reason<00:02:42.570> there's<00:02:42.960> just<00:02:43.140> a

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
and for some reason there's just a

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.050 
and for some reason there's just a
cannon<00:02:43.560> lying<00:02:43.740> around<00:02:43.890> there<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.310> definitely

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
cannon lying around there I definitely

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.000 
cannon lying around there I definitely
fixed<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.660> I'd<00:02:45.870> put<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.140> cane<00:02:46.380> indefinitely

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
fixed that I'd put the cane indefinitely

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.600 
fixed that I'd put the cane indefinitely
in<00:02:47.160> your<00:02:47.280> base<00:02:47.750> probably<00:02:48.750> switch<00:02:49.050> out<00:02:49.230> your

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
in your base probably switch out your

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
rush up straight through the middle she

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.930 
rush up straight through the middle she
using<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.410> bunch<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.620> giants<00:03:13.980> maybe<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.340> healer<00:03:14.700> I

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
using a bunch of giants maybe a healer I

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.330

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
but again his air defenses are a little

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.460 
but again his air defenses are a little
bit<00:03:38.490> exposed<00:03:38.760> while<00:03:39.570> they're<00:03:39.720> both<00:03:39.840> level<00:03:40.200> 3

bit exposed while they're both level 3

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.680 
bit exposed while they're both level 3
if<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.770> dropped<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.130> bunch<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.459> archers<00:03:42.450> at<00:03:42.600> the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
if you dropped a bunch of archers at the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.150 
if you dropped a bunch of archers at the
bottom<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.140> could<00:03:43.290> easily<00:03:43.530> take<00:03:43.830> those<00:03:44.040> out

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
bottom you could easily take those out

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.820 
bottom you could easily take those out
and<00:03:44.310> drop<00:03:44.540> dragons<00:03:45.540> or<00:03:45.780> balloons<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.709> just

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
take out his old base because in the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.390 
take out his old base because in the
middle<00:03:48.720> they<00:03:48.840> only<00:03:48.959> have<00:03:49.200> wizard<00:03:50.040> towers

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
which are very very ineffective against

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.340 
which are very very ineffective against
dragons<00:03:53.330> uh<00:03:54.330> if<00:03:54.750> i<00:03:54.900> were<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.110> i<00:03:55.230> would

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
the with a least one of the air defenses

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.600 
the with a least one of the air defenses
because<00:04:01.410> that'll<00:04:01.650> be<00:04:01.739> fine<00:04:01.890> if<00:04:02.100> you<00:04:02.220> put<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.430> air

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
because that'll be fine if you put a air

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.830 
because that'll be fine if you put a air
defence<00:04:02.850> where<00:04:02.970> your<00:04:03.090> clan<00:04:03.209> castle<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.630> this

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
farming base will be really good because

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.000 
farming base will be really good because
if<00:04:06.270> they<00:04:06.360> try<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.570> drop<00:04:06.750> dragons<00:04:07.230> or<00:04:07.470> balloons

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
if they try to drop dragons or balloons

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.590
