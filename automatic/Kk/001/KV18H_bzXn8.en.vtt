00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.519
 you feel a well-played game won 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.830
 good and now a first place he wants 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.720
 say so much on this good day 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.100
 we had done our job 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.650
 later after the victory out against 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.779
 the plant was not easy 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.990
 at the beginning 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.949
 they started very well press to 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.050
 pressing high 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.750
 but we managed to do ours 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.579
 I think I believe we are this 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.950
 evening everyone happy with the game 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.270
 made a game above all here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.430
 this was more with ancelotti 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.899
 counterattack with blanc maybe tonight 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.120
 for the first time you are truly a 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.750
 game of effective and beautiful I believe that 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.640
 everyone has their own way of working 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.120
 believe what the team can do 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.940
 a different method 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.670
 the important thing is that now today 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.280
 above all we did very well and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.530
 I think we have found the path to 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.439
 follow only depends on us player in 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.070
 field do what we have to do one 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.630
 choral performance with treble one 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.930
 great performance by Marco 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.930
 Verratti 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.610
 I believe that not only today, I mark from 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.220
 when he joined the team he is a point 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.740
 reference in midfield a 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.960
 player who has so much quality 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:45.790
 race when we have the ball 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.400
 we can find three among the lines 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.370
 we have so much realized our 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.630
 building the game and he is a man 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:02:03.520
 important right now not 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:08.500
 important the teams think it's two 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:13.930
 different things I think here in this 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:17.530
 moment mark marco i have a weight 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.910
 I think it is especially important 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.340
 construction of the game 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:27.120
 when we arrive in the national team maybe 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.400
 we play in another role we must 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.459
 we have to make another game suit 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.810
 but we are used to doing both 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.230
 I believe that this is no tano problem 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.920
 so much here as a national to play 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.320
 together, however, I tell you here 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.510
 I mark in this moment above all 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.080
 in the construction of the game we are 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.390
 important 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.070
 one last thing to ask you yesterday goes 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.090
 told the champions and europa vi 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.440
 know 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.720
 after this evening a signal even more 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.700
 important that you send to your opponents 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.700
 you want to do well you can win 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.830
 especially in the first half in my opinion it is 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.110
 a signal for us not for others 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.750
 I think we played well played 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.970
 we played as a team at the stage 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.800
 defensive and also to the phase 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.540
 to go on the attack we did like 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.990
 team always above all in the first one 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.900
 time to with another time and it's a 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.490
 signal to us that we play like this 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.710
 we can play it with everyone 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.700
 once in the game in football is so one 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.880
 once you lose another you can also 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.680
 to win 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.440
 I play this way in my opinion 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.440
 we have so much we have so much to win
