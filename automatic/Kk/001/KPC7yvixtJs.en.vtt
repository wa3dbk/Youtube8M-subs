on<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> tip<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> saw<00:02:04.820> or<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> brake

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
on the tip of the saw or on the brake

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.109 
on the tip of the saw or on the brake
the<00:02:07.890> ring<00:02:08.099> will<00:02:08.190> collapse<00:02:08.489> around<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.910> clutch

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the ring will collapse around the clutch

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.680 
the ring will collapse around the clutch
stopping<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> chain<00:02:10.080> immediately<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:12.540> is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
stopping the chain immediately this is

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.660 
stopping the chain immediately this is
activated<00:02:13.230> by<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.380> brake<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:14.340> move<00:02:14.519> it

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
activated by the brake you move it

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.930 
activated by the brake you move it
forward<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:16.049> puts<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.319> brake<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.940> you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
forward and it puts the brake on you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.809 
forward and it puts the brake on you
pull<00:02:18.180> back<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.959> releases<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.410> break<00:02:19.819> so

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
pull back and it releases the break so

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.850 
pull back and it releases the break so
that's<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.090> first<00:02:21.299> feature<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:22.470> second

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
that's the first feature the second

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.430 
that's the first feature the second
feature<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.640> body<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.660> saw<00:02:24.840> is

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
feature is the body of the saw is

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.710 
feature is the body of the saw is
separated<00:02:26.040> from<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.250> handle<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.540> all<00:02:27.690> that

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
separated from the handle so all that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.990 
separated from the handle so all that
vibration<00:02:28.440> that's<00:02:28.620> caused<00:02:28.799> by<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:29.069> engine<00:02:29.549> is

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
vibration that's caused by the engine is

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.280 
vibration that's caused by the engine is
actually<00:02:30.450> getting<00:02:30.660> pulled<00:02:30.959> into<00:02:31.140> these

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
actually getting pulled into these

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.680 
actually getting pulled into these
rubber<00:02:31.560> grommets<00:02:32.099> which<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.150> turn<00:02:33.390> reduces

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
rubber grommets which in turn reduces

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.839 
rubber grommets which in turn reduces
the<00:02:34.620> amount<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.890> fatigue<00:02:35.190> on<00:02:35.310> your<00:02:35.489> hand<00:02:35.670> so

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
the amount of fatigue on your hand so

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.240 
the amount of fatigue on your hand so
you<00:02:35.880> always<00:02:36.120> have<00:02:36.360> control<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> chainsaw

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
you always have control of the chainsaw

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.160 
you always have control of the chainsaw
third<00:02:38.250> thing<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.489> your<00:02:39.180> side<00:02:39.420> chain<00:02:39.690> tensioner

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
third thing is your side chain tensioner

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.720 
third thing is your side chain tensioner
you<00:02:40.829> always<00:02:41.130> want<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.340> have<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.579> right

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
you always want to have the right

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.819 
you always want to have the right
tension<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.630> bar<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.959> chain<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.680> your

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
tension on the bar and chain so your

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.009 
tension on the bar and chain so your
chains<00:02:44.069> not<00:02:44.310> slipping<00:02:44.640> off<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.819> bar<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.750> if

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
chains not slipping off the bar so if

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.170 
chains not slipping off the bar so if
you<00:02:46.140> pull<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.530> chain<00:02:46.739> up<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:47.910> see

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
you pull the chain up just so you see

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.180 
you pull the chain up just so you see
the<00:02:48.329> bottom<00:02:48.599> of<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.780> teeth<00:02:48.989> on<00:02:49.290> top<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.130> the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
the bottom of the teeth on top of the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.009 
the bottom of the teeth on top of the
bar<00:02:50.400> that's<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.390> perfect<00:02:51.599> tension<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.750> first

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
bar that's the perfect tension the first

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.620 
bar that's the perfect tension the first
thing<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.440> chain<00:02:55.859> catch<00:02:56.420> this<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.600> a

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
thing is the chain catch this is a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.270 
thing is the chain catch this is a
removable<00:02:58.290> piece<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.680> aluminum<00:02:59.130> or<00:02:59.250> plastic

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
removable piece of aluminum or plastic

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.150 
removable piece of aluminum or plastic
they'll<00:03:00.269> actually<00:03:00.450> catch<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.109> chain<00:03:01.380> if<00:03:01.920> it

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
they'll actually catch the chain if it

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.059 
they'll actually catch the chain if it
happens<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:02.549> come<00:03:02.730> off<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.090> its<00:03:03.239> rails<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.680> if

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
happens to come off of its rails so if

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.069 
happens to come off of its rails so if
your<00:03:05.310> chain<00:03:05.519> got<00:03:05.730> loose<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.660> came<00:03:06.810> off<00:03:07.049> of

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
your chain got loose and it came off of

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.410 
your chain got loose and it came off of
the<00:03:07.260> bar<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:08.069> chain<00:03:08.340> cats<00:03:08.579> would<00:03:09.000> catch<00:03:09.209> it

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
the bar the chain cats would catch it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.879 
the bar the chain cats would catch it
and<00:03:09.540> then<00:03:09.780> throw<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:10.079> directly<00:03:10.200> down<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:10.769> the
