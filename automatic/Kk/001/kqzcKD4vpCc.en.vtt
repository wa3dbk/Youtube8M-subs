00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.670
 good for today we are going to go how the cemex shares change 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.310
 they lost 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.649
 while I was cuddled and attentive 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.649
 and windows 7 7 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.420
 let's go for some success we have been in our territories 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.150
 xd winds 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.489
 We wanted chic with the right mouse button 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.429
 and a context menu opens 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.429
 and we click on the passion properties 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.610
 at that time a new opinion is opened 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.440
 where the screen properties do not stop 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.690
 i go to the tabs i wanted to screensaver 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.740
 here we saw several controversies 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.040
 there is one that is called industry demti I admit 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.360
 we click on 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.620
 the canton in spain 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.650
 and if we adopt screen 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.770
 ainhoa ​​windows sorry 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.800
 i can see 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.790
 we have set here to pay for the monito after six minutes either 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.730
 we can change it 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.860
 both lots of which we are comfortable with five minutes and 45 mm 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.260
 good times we did not have in this case we are going to do it in five minutes 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.470
 efe after five minutes now 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.150
 that there is no activity on our team 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.090
 the monitor his word tactically 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.280
 everything we have done is in the time we want and we say app 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.700
 and so 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.650
 again the shakhtar 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.710
 and seen the changes have taken their effect 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 well now we will see how to change the energy options 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.730
 coon 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.510
 edwin 12% 7 we have already seen in previous video windows xp now we will see in 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.690
 windows 7 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.660
 from here we proceed in a slightly different way we have to go first to 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.510
 the houston 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.970
 start 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.110
 we click on the control panel 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.239
 our control plan opens we verify that this percent 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:11.479
 the list of icons 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.209
 i inside of this one we look for 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.999
 unda option that is called energy options we click on it 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.389
 and as we can see here percent 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.309
 We have seen 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.419
 We have peter several options 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:36.040
 here is the one to change the frequency with which the equipment enters state of 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.339
 suspension 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.799
 here we have about 100 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.809
 similar occasions the coves that we saw in xp 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.299
 turn off the screen after 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.109
 so many minutes at that moment we have it in ten minutes let's leave it 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:53.979
 five minutes 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:57.579
 and put the suspension equipment after 30 minutes we are going to leave it 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.579
 in 20 minutes 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.839
 and all we have to do is simply cidh save changes 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:06.139
 that is all 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.029
 then we have percent 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:13.209
 in the regions of the country made in windows 7 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:15.499
