00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.100
 hello good afternoon welcome 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.740
 back to your channel 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.210
 let's make a vanilla jelly 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.429
 with orange flowers I already have here 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.220
 boiling two cups of water 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.800
 I'm going to use these gary packages 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.740
 I like this one because there's the 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.350
 hard consistency are not so watery 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.240
 like other brands I'm not a fan of 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.270
 show brands not much less but 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.419
 I know I like it and it looks good 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.390
 they can do it in the traditional way 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.370
 making his grenetina diluting the and 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.060
 then putting obviously the 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.920
 milk and cinnamon vanilla but for what 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.440
 complicate us and there are already packages 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.239
 Express as good as I already have here 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.390
 two cups of boiling water I'll 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.370
 add the gelatin little by little 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.370
 to avoid lumps 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.730
 Now let's add the two cups 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.640
 remaining of cold milk 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.620
 as I tell them to process faster 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.990
 the 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.190
 good to make the process more 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.990
 Quick 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.640
 and you can boil the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.190
 four cups of milk if they do not have 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.800
 present was reached quickly and 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.950
 we're just going to need a little bit 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.610
 to make cold milk come together 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.180
 the hot 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:47.340
 and since we have this ready we are going to 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.250
 put a layer more or less than two 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.890
 centimeters or a centimeter and a half in 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.200
 our mold my mold is not very thick 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.470
 if you can see then I'm going to put it 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.570
 more or less around here to half 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.570
 be able to make flower shapes 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.840
 so let's put our milk 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.329
 already finished here in our in our 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.329
 mold 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.600
 we're just going to put half what 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.380
 we let cool that set and we're going to 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.380
 put the rest 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.880
 now to make our flowers in the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.700
 yellow gelatin I already have the 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.250
 first we let you freeze so 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.810
 less about 30 minutes mine lasted 30 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.069
 minutes 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.530
 we are going to use cutters 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.930
 from flower we can use since we are 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.900
 in season next to halloween 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.599
 we can put as pumpkins is this 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.249
 very big that's why he does not do it but he 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.959
 You can get a few more 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:19.609
 little girls and make them look very pretty 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.859
 let's give our cutter and we're going 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.810
 to put only where we want to 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.709
 the flowers appear 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.709
 the short ones 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.550
 and at the same time with the afternoon of pulling 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.480
 the cutter 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:41.320
 when you get the relativity of the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.910
 little flower will come out here here and here 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.910
 I'm going to reserve them on a plate 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.680
 and now let's put the mixture of the 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.900
 orange jelly and is also 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.020
 a little cold so it will not melt 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.430
 a little the one that we already have here only 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.430
 let's fill the holes 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.509
 we're going to put it back in the 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:12.080
 refrigerator to finish curdling 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:16.260
 and they have the shapes of the flower already 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:20.240
 after this we are going to put the 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.630
 remaining vanilla jelly 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.330
 and the flowers are going to be like 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.970
 says the basal capsule 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.150
 that's all mine but I'm going to put it 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.659
 in the refrigerator and well then we continue 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.659
 with the process 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:43.190
 since the gelatin is curdled we are going to 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.190
 pass a knife along the edges 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.979
 this as a mold of this 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:57.550
 dark aluminum I do not need to put 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.020
 oil or anything to take it off the only thing 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.620
 yes the tools that can 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:07.000
 put a little in warm water not 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.069
 hot warm and since once you 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.400
 begins to take off its gelatin as it 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:16.000
 see up here they are pulling you so that 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.610
 it is totally taking off 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.810
 and at the moment of serving it, so that it remains 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.810
 well on our plate 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.080
 ah 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.200
 that's how our gelatin is with 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.210
 flowers 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.820
 this is an idea that occurred to me 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.980
 simply so to put a little 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.160
 of color to our jellies after 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.620
 of the typical colored squares good 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.710
 I hope you liked that the 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.320
 put into practice and then thanks to the 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.050
 who have subscribed again and then 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.600
 Have a good afternoon to put a 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.980
 make your gelatins enjoy it and even 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.980
 the next test there
