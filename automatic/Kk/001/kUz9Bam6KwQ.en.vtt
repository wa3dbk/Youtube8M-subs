00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.270 

and<00:00:48.660> we've<00:00:49.050> also<00:00:49.199> got<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> first<00:00:50.010> generation

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and we've also got a first generation

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.160 
and we've also got a first generation
iphone<00:00:52.100> let's<00:00:53.100> take<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.339> look<00:00:53.519> at<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:56.149> as

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
iphone let's take a look at that one as

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.970 
iphone let's take a look at that one as
you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.500> 3g<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.460> little<00:00:59.879> bit<00:01:00.000> thicker

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
you can see 3g is a little bit thicker

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.560 
you can see 3g is a little bit thicker
but<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.309> actually<00:01:02.460> tapered<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> edges

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
but it's actually tapered on the edges

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.899 
but it's actually tapered on the edges
so<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.920> don't<00:01:05.009> feel<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> thickness

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
so you really don't feel the thickness

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.219 
so you really don't feel the thickness
as<00:01:06.060> much<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.390> actually<00:01:06.509> feels<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:06.990> bit

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
as much it actually feels a little bit

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.320 
as much it actually feels a little bit
thinner<00:01:07.409> because<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.039> way<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.310> tapered

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.450 

and<00:01:15.500> this<00:01:16.500> will<00:01:16.619> kind<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.860> give<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.070> an<00:01:17.100> idea

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.809 
and this will kind of give you an idea
of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> tapering<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.950> let's<00:01:20.280> bust<00:01:20.550> out<00:01:20.700> the
