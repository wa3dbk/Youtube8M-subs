00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
elf the colors kind of correspond with

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.810 
elf the colors kind of correspond with
the<00:00:31.590> foundation<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.430> know<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.610> your

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the foundation so if you know that your

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.850 
the foundation so if you know that your
porcelain<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> powders<00:00:34.140> you'll<00:00:34.680> actually

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
be porcelain in the foundation because

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.750 
be porcelain in the foundation because
that's<00:00:37.079> what<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.260> found<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.829> me<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.219> kind<00:00:38.700> of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
that's what I found with me I'm kind of

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.119 
that's what I found with me I'm kind of
a<00:00:38.820> mixture<00:00:39.120> between<00:00:39.390> porcelain<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.260> sand<00:00:40.559> so

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
a mixture between porcelain and sand so

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.799 
a mixture between porcelain and sand so
this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> powder<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
this is the powder and then you have the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
this is the powder and then you have the
matching<00:00:43.140> foundation<00:00:43.559> these<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.190> all<00:00:44.340> from

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
matching foundation these are all from

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.220 
matching foundation these are all from
the<00:00:44.700> studio<00:00:45.180> line<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.809> I've<00:00:45.960> said<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the studio line and as I've said a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.600 
the studio line and as I've said a
million<00:00:46.559> times<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.980> love<00:00:47.190> pretty<00:00:47.489> much

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
everything from the studio line and I

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.900

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
think they've just come out with cream

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.639 
think they've just come out with cream
blushes<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> studio<00:00:51.989> line<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.289> I'm<00:00:52.350> kind

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
regularly and see what I thought of a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.359 
regularly and see what I thought of a
website<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.659> described<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.830> flawless

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
website it is described as a flawless

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.760 
website it is described as a flawless
finish<00:01:08.549> foundation<00:01:08.850> which<00:01:09.780> gives<00:01:10.110> semi<00:01:10.500> matte

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
finish foundation which gives semi matte

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.190 
finish foundation which gives semi matte
finish<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.520> lasts<00:01:12.119> pretty<00:01:12.299> long<00:01:12.659> time<00:01:12.900> now

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
finish and lasts pretty long time now

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.620 
finish and lasts pretty long time now
well<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> would<00:01:14.189> say<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:15.090> not<00:01:15.360> quite

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
well I would say is that it's not quite

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.179 
well I would say is that it's not quite
semi<00:01:16.110> matte<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.799> might<00:01:16.950> give

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
semi matte I think that might give

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.580 
semi matte I think that might give
people<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.610> wrong<00:01:17.729> opinion<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.810> kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.380> on

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
people the wrong opinion it's kind of on

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.710 
people the wrong opinion it's kind of on
the<00:01:19.680> juhi<00:01:19.950> side<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.700> quite<00:01:20.970> moisturizer

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the juhi side it's quite moisturizer

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.780 
the juhi side it's quite moisturizer

anybody who has oily skin now it also

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.609 
anybody who has oily skin now it also

isn't fantastic for people who have

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
isn't fantastic for people who have
breakouts<00:01:29.460> whenever<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.329> breakouts<00:01:30.780> like

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
breakouts whenever I have breakouts like

breakouts whenever I have breakouts like
I<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.650> bit<00:01:31.799> here<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> moment

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
I have a little bit here at the moment

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.880 
I have a little bit here at the moment
never<00:01:33.540> eye<00:01:33.689> breakouts<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.200> tend<00:01:34.470> not<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> use

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
never eye breakouts I tend not to use

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.310 
never eye breakouts I tend not to use
this<00:01:35.040> foundation<00:01:35.579> because<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> find<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
this foundation because I find with the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.100 
this foundation because I find with the
Jewish<00:01:37.710> finish<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.220> actually<00:01:38.670> emphasizes<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
Jewish finish it actually emphasizes the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.020 
Jewish finish it actually emphasizes the
problems<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.829> might<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.130> having<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.909> if

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
problems that you might be having so if

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.090 
problems that you might be having so if
you<00:01:42.150> do<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.600> any<00:01:42.899> blemishes<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.009> face

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
you do have any blemishes on the face

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.590 
you do have any blemishes on the face
this<00:01:44.490> might<00:01:44.790> not<00:01:45.000> give<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> coverage

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
this might not give you the coverage

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.990 
this might not give you the coverage
that<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.049> want<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:47.130> might<00:01:47.399> consider<00:01:47.729> using

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that you want you might consider using

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.460 
that you want you might consider using
something<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.659> little<00:01:48.840> bit<00:01:49.020> more<00:01:49.170> matte

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
something that's a little bit more matte

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.770 
something that's a little bit more matte
now<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> combination<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.420> plus

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
now I think the combination of this plus

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.690 
now I think the combination of this plus
the<00:01:51.930> powders<00:01:52.380> does<00:01:52.680> work<00:01:52.950> pretty<00:01:52.979> well<00:01:53.369> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the powders does work pretty well and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.370 
the powders does work pretty well and
that's<00:01:53.850> typically<00:01:54.329> wise<00:01:54.689> you're<00:01:54.990> enough<00:01:55.200> with

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
that's typically wise you're enough with

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.899 
that's typically wise you're enough with
the<00:01:55.500> primer<00:01:55.770> which<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.369> mineral<00:01:56.700> infused

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the primer which is the mineral infused

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
the primer which is the mineral infused
face<00:01:57.479> primer<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.259> fantastic<00:01:58.439> goes

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
face primer and this is fantastic goes

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.160 
face primer and this is fantastic goes
on<00:01:59.219> really<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.460> super<00:01:59.880> super<00:02:00.270> smooth<00:02:00.540> then

on really really super super smooth then

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.289 
on really really super super smooth then
I<00:02:01.200> will<00:02:01.380> blend<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:02.070> over<00:02:02.520> my<00:02:02.640> face<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.119> use<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
I will blend this over my face I use a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.090 
I will blend this over my face I use a
mixture<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.049> both<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.409> then<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.619> set<00:02:04.890> it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
mixture of the both and then I set it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.889 
mixture of the both and then I set it
with<00:02:05.369> my<00:02:05.610> pressed<00:02:05.939> powder<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.689> make<00:02:06.869> sure

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
with my pressed powder just to make sure

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.270 
with my pressed powder just to make sure
that<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.259> does<00:02:07.439> last<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.920> little<00:02:08.069> bit<00:02:08.190> longer

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that it does last a little bit longer

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.010 
that it does last a little bit longer
when<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.940> when<00:02:09.420> you've<00:02:09.569> used<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.840> pressed

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
when you when you've used the pressed

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.830 
when you when you've used the pressed
powder<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.560> also

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
powder but it also

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.570 
powder but it also
keeps<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.290> shine<00:02:11.620> down<00:02:11.890> which<00:02:12.370> can

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
keeps that shine down which can

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.790 
keeps that shine down which can
emphasize<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.060> lot<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.420> blemishes<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.170> open

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
emphasize a lot of blemishes and open

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.330 
emphasize a lot of blemishes and open
pores

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
pores

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.949 
pores
now<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.760> haven't<00:02:16.209> found<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:16.629> a<00:02:16.690> huge

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
now I haven't found that it's a huge

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.809 
now I haven't found that it's a huge
problem<00:02:17.019> for<00:02:17.470> my<00:02:17.560> open<00:02:17.769> pores<00:02:17.980> but<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.280> do<00:02:18.400> like

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
problem for my open pores but I do like

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.430 
problem for my open pores but I do like
to<00:02:18.849> have<00:02:19.209> my<00:02:19.390> foundation<00:02:19.510> quite<00:02:20.110> matte

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
to have my foundation quite matte

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.020 
to have my foundation quite matte
because<00:02:20.709> otherwise<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.580> look<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.849> little

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
because otherwise it can look a little

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.119 
because otherwise it can look a little
bit<00:02:22.390> overly<00:02:23.140> shiny<00:02:23.319> I<00:02:23.500> said<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:24.010> would

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
bit overly shiny I said I would

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.860 
bit overly shiny I said I would
seriously<00:02:24.340> suggest<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.180> for<00:02:25.390> somebody<00:02:25.690> who

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
seriously suggest this for somebody who

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.440 
seriously suggest this for somebody who
has<00:02:26.200> normal<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.950> dry<00:02:27.160> skin<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.700> lot<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.209> people

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
has normal to dry skin a lot of people

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.180 
has normal to dry skin a lot of people
said<00:02:28.599> that<00:02:28.840> with<00:02:29.049> their<00:02:29.230> dry<00:02:29.530> patches<00:02:29.830> on

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
said that with their dry patches on

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.979 
said that with their dry patches on
their<00:02:30.340> skin<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.790> emphasizes<00:02:31.510> them<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.690> little

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
their skin it emphasizes them a little

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.199 
their skin it emphasizes them a little
bit<00:02:32.080> more<00:02:32.110> didn't<00:02:33.069> quite<00:02:33.250> find<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.700> myself

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
bit more didn't quite find that myself

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.240 
bit more didn't quite find that myself
however<00:02:34.629> I<00:02:34.900> used<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.319> damp<00:02:35.530> sponge<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:36.160> apply

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
however I used a damp sponge to apply

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.070 
however I used a damp sponge to apply
this<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:36.879> I<00:02:36.910> might<00:02:37.269> be<00:02:37.299> getting<00:02:37.629> a<00:02:37.690> little<00:02:37.810> bit

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
this so I might be getting a little bit

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.170 
this so I might be getting a little bit
better<00:02:38.560> coverage<00:02:39.129> now<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.400> have<00:02:39.610> combination

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
better coverage now I have combination

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.880 
better coverage now I have combination
skin<00:02:40.209> which<00:02:40.569> means<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.959> have<00:02:41.080> dry<00:02:41.319> patches<00:02:41.560> and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
skin which means I have dry patches and

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.460 
skin which means I have dry patches and
oily<00:02:42.190> patches<00:02:42.580> so<00:02:43.239> on<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.569> dry<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:44.110> seems<00:02:44.349> to

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
oily patches so on the dry it seems to

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.229 
oily patches so on the dry it seems to
work<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.709> little<00:02:44.950> bit<00:02:45.220> better<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:46.060> why

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
work a little bit better so that is why

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.539 
work a little bit better so that is why
we<00:02:46.390> suggest<00:02:46.540> this<00:02:46.810> for<00:02:46.870> normal<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.440> dry<00:02:48.069> skin

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
we suggest this for normal to dry skin

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.670 
we suggest this for normal to dry skin
it<00:02:48.970> also<00:02:49.120> has<00:02:49.480> kind<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.900> medium<00:02:50.349> coverage

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
it also has kind of medium coverage

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.830 
it also has kind of medium coverage
that's<00:02:51.010> not<00:02:51.280> very<00:02:51.610> buildable<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.630> if<00:02:52.720> you're

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
that's not very buildable so if you're

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
between 4 to 5 euro it's a little bit

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.220 
between 4 to 5 euro it's a little bit
extra

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
extra

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.560 
extra
depending<00:04:24.530> on<00:04:24.620> how<00:04:24.770> much<00:04:24.920> you<00:04:25.100> actually<00:04:25.570> you

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570

only ever done that but once I think

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.380 
only ever done that but once I think

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
I'm like so sad about because for a

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.620

while<00:05:09.140> there<00:05:09.290> elf<00:05:09.770> had<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:10.190> fantastic<00:05:10.790> 50%

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
while there elf had the fantastic 50%

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.720 
while there elf had the fantastic 50%
off<00:05:11.750> sales<00:05:11.990> but<00:05:12.740> getting<00:05:13.280> back<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.610> foundation

off sales but getting back to foundation

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.880 
off sales but getting back to foundation
I<00:05:14.300> think<00:05:14.870> it's<00:05:15.020> pretty<00:05:15.140> good<00:05:15.380> foundation<00:05:15.500> I

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
I think it's pretty good foundation I

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.680 
I think it's pretty good foundation I
would<00:05:15.920> recommend<00:05:16.580> it<00:05:16.700> I<00:05:16.850> will<00:05:16.970> put<00:05:17.180> some<00:05:17.450> more

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.390 
would recommend it I will put some more

have<00:05:19.580> a<00:05:19.670> look<00:05:19.790> at<00:05:19.970> I<00:05:20.000> have<00:05:20.300> a<00:05:20.540> few<00:05:21.110> other

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
have a look at I have a few other

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.400

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
foundation reviews on there as well but

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.080 
foundation reviews on there as well but
I<00:05:24.440> think<00:05:24.710> this<00:05:24.830> is<00:05:24.980> a<00:05:25.010> pretty<00:05:25.310> decent<00:05:25.760> one<00:05:25.790> I

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
I think this is a pretty decent one I

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.670 
I think this is a pretty decent one I
definitely<00:05:26.480> find<00:05:26.600> myself<00:05:26.840> reaching<00:05:27.170> for<00:05:27.560> it

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
not just because I wanted to test it but

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.210 
not just because I wanted to test it but
because<00:05:29.750> I<00:05:29.900> do<00:05:30.020> actually<00:05:30.290> like<00:05:30.500> it<00:05:30.860> and<00:05:30.920> I<00:05:30.980> find
