4i<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:10.019> an<00:00:10.519> incredible<00:00:11.519> piece<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.759> engineering

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
4i is an incredible piece of engineering

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.759 
4i is an incredible piece of engineering
and<00:00:12.509> we<00:00:12.599> can<00:00:12.750> say<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:12.960> after<00:00:13.200> watching<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
and we can say that after watching the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.919 
and we can say that after watching the
device<00:00:14.340> being<00:00:14.549> toned<00:00:14.880> down<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.809> can

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
device being toned down you can

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.689 
device being toned down you can
obviously<00:00:16.139> sit<00:00:16.830> down<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.130> compare<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.520> with

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
obviously sit down and compare this with

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.519 
obviously sit down and compare this with
the<00:00:17.760> phones<00:00:18.119> like<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.600> ones<00:00:18.750> made<00:00:18.960> by<00:00:18.990> virtue

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the phones like the ones made by virtue

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.320 
the phones like the ones made by virtue
yes<00:00:20.039> strictly<00:00:20.400> talking<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.910> mid-range

phone that has been made very well back
with<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.000> much<00:00:24.240> internally<00:00:25.199> under<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.769> thin

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
with so much internally under that thin

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.580 
with so much internally under that thin
and<00:00:26.220> compact<00:00:26.580> say<00:00:26.730> she's<00:00:27.170> at<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.230> private

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590

meeting with Hugo Barra he explained a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.229 
meeting with Hugo Barra he explained a
few<00:00:30.300> reasons<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:31.199> sets<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.070> mi<00:00:32.399> 4i<00:00:32.430> apart

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
few reasons on what sets the mi 4i apart

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.850 
few reasons on what sets the mi 4i apart
from<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.960> other<00:00:34.140> phones<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> mid-range

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
from the other phones in the mid-range

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.780 
from the other phones in the mid-range
by<00:00:35.340> segments<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.110> this<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.530> see

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
by segments and this is what you can see

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.880 
by segments and this is what you can see
that<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.940> could<00:00:39.180> ever<00:00:39.360> fall<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.649> might

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that you could ever fall that might

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.569 
that you could ever fall that might
actually<00:00:41.780> look<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.989> paper<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:44.160> something

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
actually look on paper like something

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.529 
actually look on paper like something
that's<00:00:44.760> very<00:00:44.850> similar<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.390> not<00:00:45.450> identical

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
that's very similar if not identical

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.810 
that's very similar if not identical
with<00:00:45.960> their<00:00:46.140> similar<00:00:46.440> specs<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.640> would<00:00:47.789> be

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
with their similar specs but it would be

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.119 
with their similar specs but it would be
thicker<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.809> would<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.050> larger<00:00:49.620> they<00:00:49.980> would

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
thicker it would be larger they would

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.450 
thicker it would be larger they would
have<00:00:50.309> far<00:00:51.170> you<00:00:52.170> know<00:00:52.289> less<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.890> less<00:00:53.100> quality

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
have far you know less have less quality

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.520 
have far you know less have less quality
lesser<00:00:53.820> quality<00:00:54.000> components<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:55.170> probably

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
lesser quality components you probably

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.660 
lesser quality components you probably
wouldn't<00:00:55.860> want<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.129> talk<00:00:56.280> about<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
wouldn't want to talk about the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.709 
wouldn't want to talk about the
suppliers<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.120> some<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.390> these<00:00:57.449> components

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
suppliers that some of these components

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.819 
suppliers that some of these components
came<00:00:58.050> from<00:00:58.170> because<00:00:58.350> nobody<00:00:58.649> would<00:00:58.739> ever

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
came from because nobody would ever

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.279 
came from because nobody would ever
heard<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.899> want<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.170> into

nice that's how all the components

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.039 
nice that's how all the components
attached<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> motherboard<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> dough

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
attached to the motherboard so the dough

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.640 
attached to the motherboard so the dough
and<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.380> without<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:15.470> that's<00:01:16.470> God<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
few things that you know is so first of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.050 
few things that you know is so first of
all<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.900> basically<00:01:22.680> built<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.950> smallest

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
all we basically built the smallest

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.999 
all we basically built the smallest
motherboard<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.180> we've<00:01:27.299> ever<00:01:27.420> built<00:01:28.009> which

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
motherboard that we've ever built which

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.520 
motherboard that we've ever built which
I'm<00:01:29.250> about<00:01:29.400> taking<00:01:30.150> out

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
I'm about taking out

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.630 
I'm about taking out
when<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.340> it's<00:01:31.909> obviously<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:32.720> dual<00:01:33.110> side

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
when so it's obviously a dual side

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.820 
when so it's obviously a dual side
motherboard<00:01:35.080> and<00:01:36.080> it's<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.380> dances

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
motherboard and it's the dances

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.859 
motherboard and it's the dances
motherboard<00:01:37.280> with<00:01:37.430> built<00:01:37.670> with<00:01:38.570> more

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
motherboard with built with more

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.660 
motherboard with built with more
components<00:01:39.500> on<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.950> right<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:40.430> we<00:01:40.520> have<00:01:40.549> a

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
components on it right so we have a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.210 
components on it right so we have a
larger<00:01:41.240> RF<00:01:41.630> area<00:01:42.020> because<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:42.470> support<00:01:42.799> 16

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
larger RF area because we support 16

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.940 
larger RF area because we support 16
bands<00:01:43.460> 16<00:01:44.060> 16<00:01:44.210> different<00:01:44.509> RF<00:01:44.780> bands<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.799> this

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
bands 16 16 different RF bands on this

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.080 
bands 16 16 different RF bands on this
device<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:47.020> obviously<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.320> micro<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.670> micro

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
device and obviously is micro to micro

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.289 
device and obviously is micro to micro
sim<00:01:50.270> cards<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.750> see<00:01:51.110> how<00:01:51.320> large<00:01:51.890> an<00:01:52.250> area<00:01:52.909> on

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
sim cards and see how large an area on

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.469 
sim cards and see how large an area on
the<00:01:53.720> motherboard<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.590> actual<00:01:55.040> SD<00:01:55.880> card<00:01:56.119> stake

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
the motherboard the actual SD card stake

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.630 
the motherboard the actual SD card stake
right<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.020> designing<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.979> motherboard<00:01:58.460> like

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
right so designing a motherboard like

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.820 
right so designing a motherboard like
this<00:01:58.909> is<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.479> work<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.840> art<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.259> can<00:02:00.500> look

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
this is a work of art and you can look

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.170 
this is a work of art and you can look
at<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.009> in<00:02:01.190> comparison<00:02:01.670> with<00:02:01.700> some<00:02:02.000> of<00:02:02.090> our

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
other born than me note so basically

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.850 
other born than me note so basically
what<00:02:14.180> we're<00:02:14.360> trying<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:14.810> with<00:02:15.050> me<00:02:15.200> for<00:02:15.410> I<00:02:15.440> is

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
what we're trying to do with me for I is

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.180 
what we're trying to do with me for I is
design<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.970> phone<00:02:17.450> where<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.440> components<00:02:19.100> the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
design a phone where the components the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.120 
design a phone where the components the
electronic<00:02:19.700> components<00:02:20.209> were<00:02:20.330> tucked<00:02:21.110> as<00:02:21.410> far

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
electronic components were tucked as far

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.640 
electronic components were tucked as far
out<00:02:22.370> as<00:02:22.459> possible<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.510> can<00:02:23.630> see<00:02:23.900> how<00:02:24.080> insanely

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
out as possible you can see how insanely

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.790 
out as possible you can see how insanely
detailed<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.459> dense<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.930> components<00:02:27.440> are<00:02:27.560> as

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
detailed and dense the components are as

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.500 
detailed and dense the components are as
they're<00:02:28.010> laid<00:02:28.160> out<00:02:28.190> here<00:02:28.670> such<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.420> you

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
they're laid out here such that you

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.259 
they're laid out here such that you
could<00:02:29.630> then<00:02:29.840> have<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.470> large<00:02:31.310> area<00:02:31.910> for<00:02:32.239> the

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
could then have a large area for the

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.990 
could then have a large area for the
battery<00:02:32.750> which<00:02:33.650> then<00:02:33.890> allows<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.579> battery

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
battery which then allows the battery

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.170 
battery which then allows the battery
itself<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.900> be<00:02:35.989> pretty<00:02:36.200> thin<00:02:36.440> right<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:38.030> you

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
itself to be pretty thin right if you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.699 
itself to be pretty thin right if you
didn't<00:02:38.420> have<00:02:38.540> as<00:02:38.660> much<00:02:38.690> space<00:02:39.140> here<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.650> you

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
didn't have as much space here and you

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.710 
didn't have as much space here and you
still<00:02:39.920> wanted<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.220> have<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.640> battery<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.630> know

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
still wanted to have a battery you know

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.110 
still wanted to have a battery you know
3,000<00:02:42.440> 120<00:02:42.980> they<00:02:43.519> would<00:02:43.670> end<00:02:43.790> up<00:02:43.880> being

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
3,000 120 they would end up being

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.520 
3,000 120 they would end up being
thicker<00:02:44.390> which<00:02:44.810> would<00:02:45.019> make<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.320> whole

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
thicker which would make the whole

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.620 
thicker which would make the whole
device<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.250> figure<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:46.700> here's<00:02:47.510> another

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
device and figure I here's another

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.289 
device and figure I here's another
interesting<00:02:47.870> thing<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.790> what<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:49.940> have<00:02:50.120> right

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
interesting thing so what I have right

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.580 
interesting thing so what I have right
here<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:52.070> display<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:53.959> what<00:02:54.079> I'm<00:02:54.170> holding

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
here is the display so what I'm holding

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.920 
here is the display so what I'm holding
is<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.920> entire<00:02:55.310> display<00:02:55.790> assembly<00:02:56.000> this

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
is the entire display assembly this

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.190 
is the entire display assembly this
includes<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.530> LCD<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.329> it<00:02:59.329> includes<00:02:59.750> the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
includes the LCD and it includes the

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.900 
includes the LCD and it includes the
touch<00:03:00.440> panel<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.040> glass<00:03:01.280> in<00:03:01.730> one

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
touch panel and the glass in one

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.390 
touch panel and the glass in one
solution<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.600> when<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.620> look<00:03:03.799> at<00:03:03.950> this<00:03:04.100> this

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
solution and when you look at this this

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.670 
solution and when you look at this this
is<00:03:04.549> like<00:03:04.730> maybe<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.840> little<00:03:06.079> bit<00:03:06.290> thicker<00:03:06.470> than

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
is like maybe a little bit thicker than

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.039 
is like maybe a little bit thicker than
a<00:03:06.739> credit<00:03:07.070> card<00:03:07.250> right<00:03:08.150> it's<00:03:08.299> an<00:03:08.420> incredibly

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
a credit card right it's an incredibly

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:09.930 
a credit card right it's an incredibly
incredibly

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
incredibly

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.840 
incredibly
in<00:03:10.110> part<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.800> actually<00:03:12.100> a<00:03:12.160> custom<00:03:12.700> glass

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
in part this is actually a custom glass

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.810 
in part this is actually a custom glass
solution<00:03:13.270> that<00:03:13.960> Corning<00:03:14.410> made<00:03:14.560> for<00:03:14.950> us<00:03:15.130> with

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
solution that Corning made for us with

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.430 
solution that Corning made for us with
the<00:03:15.940> same<00:03:16.150> base<00:03:16.480> composition<00:03:16.930> as<00:03:17.200> going<00:03:17.380> to

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
the same base composition as going to

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.770 
the same base composition as going to
the<00:03:17.470> glass<00:03:17.620> 3<00:03:18.070> so<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.790> offers<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.570> same

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
the glass 3 so it offers that the same

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.150 
the glass 3 so it offers that the same
level<00:03:19.990> of<00:03:20.200> scratch<00:03:20.470> resistance<00:03:20.980> and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
level of scratch resistance and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.910 
level of scratch resistance and
basically<00:03:22.030> when<00:03:22.240> you<00:03:22.300> put<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.630> battery<00:03:23.020> the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
basically when you put the battery the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.770 
basically when you put the battery the
display<00:03:24.280> on<00:03:24.310> top<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.760> value<00:03:25.060> that's

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
display on top of the value that's

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.710 
display on top of the value that's
essentially<00:03:26.380> what<00:03:26.800> defines<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:28.210> thickness

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
essentially what defines the thickness

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.900 
essentially what defines the thickness
of<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.960> device<00:03:29.490> it's<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.670> exact<00:03:30.880> same

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
of the device it's the exact same

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.580 
of the device it's the exact same
technology<00:03:31.570> in<00:03:31.630> fact<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:31.990> we<00:03:32.080> use<00:03:32.230> for<00:03:32.260> me

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
technology in fact that we use for me

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.740 
technology in fact that we use for me
notes<00:03:32.800> right<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.460> can<00:03:33.580> see<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:33.790> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
notes right so you can see that the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.290 
notes right so you can see that the
camera<00:03:35.080> on<00:03:35.260> me<00:03:35.380> for<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.460> flush<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:37.270> the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
camera on me for I is a flush to the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.540 
camera on me for I is a flush to the
surface<00:03:37.570> flat<00:03:37.990> on<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.230> surface<00:03:38.260> like<00:03:38.830> for<00:03:39.430> me

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
surface flat on the surface like for me

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.980 
surface flat on the surface like for me
know<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:39.940> we're<00:03:40.060> actually<00:03:40.210> using<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.630> exact

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
know so we're actually using the exact

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.550 
know so we're actually using the exact
same<00:03:41.740> camera<00:03:42.670> assembly<00:03:43.030> as<00:03:43.840> we<00:03:44.080> used<00:03:44.230> on<00:03:44.410> me

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
same camera assembly as we used on me

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.080 
same camera assembly as we used on me
know<00:03:44.710> which<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:44.950> course<00:03:45.100> is<00:03:45.310> our<00:03:45.550> highest<00:03:45.730> end

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
know which of course is our highest end

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.830 
know which of course is our highest end
device<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:47.140> it's<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.590> same<00:03:47.830> sensor<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.360> what

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
device and it's the same sensor so what

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.630 
device and it's the same sensor so what
we<00:03:49.930> do<00:03:50.080> is<00:03:50.110> I'm<00:03:50.530> going<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.740> simulate<00:03:50.950> basically

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
we do is I'm going to simulate basically

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.880 
we do is I'm going to simulate basically
bright<00:03:51.820> sunlight<00:03:52.270> here<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:52.870> you<00:03:53.650> know<00:03:53.740> watch

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
bright sunlight here and you know watch

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.250 
bright sunlight here and you know watch
what<00:03:54.130> happens<00:03:54.520> when<00:03:55.330> we<00:03:55.600> basically<00:03:55.810> take<00:03:56.080> this

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
what happens when we basically take this

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.020 
what happens when we basically take this
device<00:03:56.530> into<00:03:56.800> a<00:03:56.830> very<00:03:57.070> brightly<00:03:57.730> lit

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
device into a very brightly lit

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.550 
device into a very brightly lit
environment<00:03:58.510> here<00:03:58.660> even<00:03:58.930> in<00:03:59.020> the<00:03:59.140> dark<00:03:59.350> you

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
environment here even in the dark you

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.980 
environment here even in the dark you
can't<00:03:59.830> see<00:03:59.890> things<00:04:00.220> well<00:04:00.460> this<00:04:01.420> is<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.570> very

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
can't see things well this is a very

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.960 
can't see things well this is a very
kind<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.620> extreme<00:04:02.950> image<00:04:03.250> but<00:04:03.460> imagine

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
kind of extreme image but imagine

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.280 
kind of extreme image but imagine
looking<00:04:04.180> at<00:04:04.240> this<00:04:04.360> in<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.600> Sun<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:05.020> basically

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
looking at this in the Sun you basically

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.700 
looking at this in the Sun you basically
wouldn't<00:04:05.620> go<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.740> see<00:04:05.920> anything<00:04:07.650> see<00:04:08.650> you

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
wouldn't go to see anything see you

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:16.979 
wouldn't go to see anything see you
tremendous<00:04:12.390> alright<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:13.660> can

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.129 

so<00:04:17.989> basically<00:04:18.380> what<00:04:18.530> this<00:04:18.650> allows<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:20.750> happen

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
so basically what this allows to happen

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.260 
so basically what this allows to happen
is<00:04:21.259> you<00:04:21.410> can<00:04:21.560> go<00:04:21.709> into<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:22.130> Sun<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.910> no<00:04:23.060> longer

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
is you can go into the Sun you no longer

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.270 
is you can go into the Sun you no longer
have<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.720> crank<00:04:24.169> up<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.590> brightness<00:04:24.800> of<00:04:25.220> the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
have to crank up the brightness of the

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.969 
have to crank up the brightness of the
display<00:04:25.370> which<00:04:26.360> obviously<00:04:26.690> is<00:04:26.870> a<00:04:26.900> very<00:04:27.169> very

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
display which obviously is a very very

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.730 
display which obviously is a very very
consuming<00:04:28.789> task<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.479> you<00:04:29.509> can<00:04:30.139> still<00:04:30.380> bring

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
consuming task and you can still bring

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.290 
consuming task and you can still bring
out<00:04:30.979> a<00:04:31.160> lot<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.520> detail<00:04:31.910> that<00:04:31.940> you

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
out a lot of the detail that you

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.050 
out a lot of the detail that you
absolutely<00:04:32.750> would<00:04:33.289> not<00:04:33.320> be<00:04:33.650> able<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.949> see<00:04:34.160> in

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
absolutely would not be able to see in

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.540 
absolutely would not be able to see in
bright<00:04:35.300> sunlight<00:04:35.539> so<00:04:36.050> far<00:04:36.199> from<00:04:36.440> what<00:04:36.680> all<00:04:36.800> he

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
bright sunlight so far from what all he

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.700 
bright sunlight so far from what all he
showed<00:04:38.000> in<00:04:38.150> this<00:04:38.330> way<00:04:39.259> ask<00:04:39.440> them<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.680> few

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
showed in this way ask them a few

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.710 
showed in this way ask them a few
questions<00:04:39.949> one<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.520> them<00:04:40.669> is<00:04:40.820> about<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.300> size

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
questions one of them is about the size

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.300 
questions one of them is about the size
of<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:41.990> sim<00:04:42.139> card<00:04:42.169> slots<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.919> micro<00:04:43.160> SD

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
of the sim card slots and the micro SD

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.999 
of the sim card slots and the micro SD
card<00:04:43.490> slot<00:04:43.660> availability<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:45.590> size<00:04:45.800> of<00:04:45.949> the

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
card slot availability the size of the

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.710 
card slot availability the size of the
sim<00:04:46.220> slot<00:04:46.520> already<00:04:46.940> take<00:04:47.090> up<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.300> lot<00:04:47.479> and

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
sim slot already take up a lot and

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.939 
sim slot already take up a lot and
that's<00:04:47.810> what<00:04:48.080> Xiaomi<00:04:48.320> claims<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:48.830> be<00:04:48.860> the

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
that's what Xiaomi claims to be the

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.439 
that's what Xiaomi claims to be the
reason<00:04:49.340> why<00:04:49.460> there<00:04:49.639> is<00:04:49.699> no<00:04:49.729> microSD<00:04:50.240> card<00:04:50.419> slot

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
reason why there is no microSD card slot

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.749 
reason why there is no microSD card slot
and<00:04:50.870> though<00:04:51.440> we<00:04:51.470> would<00:04:51.740> have<00:04:51.949> loved<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.580> see

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
and though we would have loved to see

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.969 
and though we would have loved to see
one<00:04:53.660> of<00:04:53.750> them<00:04:53.930> being<00:04:54.169> a<00:04:54.349> nano<00:04:54.530> SIM<00:04:54.770> card<00:04:54.949> slot

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
one of them being a nano SIM card slot

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.189 
one of them being a nano SIM card slot
doubling<00:04:55.460> as<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.639> microSD<00:04:56.120> one<00:04:56.270> there<00:04:56.930> are<00:04:57.050> some

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
doubling as a microSD one there are some

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.930 
doubling as a microSD one there are some
device<00:04:57.440> already<00:04:57.620> doing<00:04:58.039> that<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:58.460> xiaomi

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
device already doing that and xiaomi

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.339 
device already doing that and xiaomi
should<00:04:59.120> try<00:04:59.419> and<00:04:59.630> do<00:04:59.810> that<00:04:59.990> in<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.229> next

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
should try and do that in the next

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.980 
should try and do that in the next
flagship<00:05:00.830> at<00:05:00.979> least<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:02.060> far<00:05:02.090> though<00:05:02.840> the

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
flagship at least so far though the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.719 
flagship at least so far though the
device<00:05:03.259> looks<00:05:03.620> brilliant<00:05:04.009> and<00:05:04.400> whatever<00:05:04.699> you

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
device looks brilliant and whatever you

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.580 
device looks brilliant and whatever you
are<00:05:04.880> paying<00:05:05.090> for<00:05:05.210> it<00:05:05.479> it's<00:05:05.720> totally<00:05:06.380> worth<00:05:06.560> the

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
are paying for it it's totally worth the

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.580 
are paying for it it's totally worth the
money<00:05:07.000> so<00:05:08.000> this<00:05:08.210> is<00:05:08.330> what<00:05:08.509> we<00:05:08.930> feel<00:05:09.139> about<00:05:09.259> the

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
money so this is what we feel about the

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.370 
money so this is what we feel about the
