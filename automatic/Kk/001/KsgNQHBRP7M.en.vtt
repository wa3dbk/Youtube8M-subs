 well to start in this third 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.960
 character battle episode 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.840
 we have the strider protagonist of the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.090
 saga of arcade strider the trailers are 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.100
 a group of ninjas of the future agents 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.539
 secrets that are specialized in 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.549
 very specific tasks normally 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.780
 related to the demolition the 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.490
 murder and others 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.039
 the protagonist of these serious games 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.710
 belongs to a specific class of 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.000
 strikers called super classes that 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.130
 means that she is a specialist 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.979
 of the highest level usually carries a 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.289
 blue suit and a kind of red scarf 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.270
 that covers part of the face and this 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.460
 Also , a manga was made in 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.050
 Japan in a weekly magazine that 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.390
 true that he became quite famous in the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.850
 era as curiosity just say 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.250
 that this protagonist is strider here 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.920
 you have rights distributed between 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.080
 capcom and moto that is a very study 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.610
 famous manga in japan that has 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.799
 rights of the character for having 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.990
 collaborated in an initial moment of 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.780
 development so you already know extracted from 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.610
 I turn a ninja of the future who fights for 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.580
 prevent evil and corruption from 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.410
 impose around the world 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.150
 well then second in this 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.700
 character battle episode 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.990
 we have expired one of the most dragons 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.180
 famous in the history of the 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.340
 video games one of the great pets 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.520
 of the consoles of sony and good spyros 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.370
 a dragon as a young man presumed sometimes 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.660
 even a little disrespectful is the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.040
 protagonist of the spirit saga of 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.050
 dragon that has had different then 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.060
 deliveries over the years and good 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.530
 what defines spiro the most because it is its color 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.330
 especially that it is a purple color a 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.040
 violet color has some horns 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.990
 little ones wings too very 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.400
 small still does not know how to fly but 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.010
 Well, he's practicing as he's been 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.360
 advancing the saga I hope so he has gone 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.090
 developing their skills almost 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.230
 always next to his colleague sparks and 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.120
 good in the first game that appears 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.130
 I hope that as I said is the spirou of 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.110
 dragon of playstation one then it's the 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.080
 only dragon that has escaped from a 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.640
 evil spell and good your goal in 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.950
 the fire is to save other dragons 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.080
 fight with the evil one on duty and in 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.090
 definitive then try to return the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.560
 world to normal one of the things 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.180
 what I like about this character is 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.890
 that despite being a little bit we have 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.739
 said boastful sometimes even a little 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.850
 Macarra and respectful, always looking for 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.440
 protect others 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.180
 and return things to normal 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.130
 so that good triumphs so a 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.000
 very nice character very nice this style 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.670
 dragon 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.740
 well third in this episode the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.870
 thing starts to get difficult because 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.270
 now we have neither more nor less than 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.580
 chrono the protagonist of one of the 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.470
 greatest adventures ever told in the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.840
 world of video games as it is a chrono 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.900
 tiger and good chrono is its protagonist 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.850
 principal is a character designed by 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.160
 a legend of animation as it is 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.680
 Akira Toriyama may sound like a dragon 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.480
 ball and good as I comment chrono a 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.150
 hero at the height of the circumstances 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.580
 of this great adventure that leads to 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.739
 main character traveling along 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.959
 of different stages of the history of the 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.209
 humanity to defeat the bad bad 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.400
 in turn that is the vos and well then a 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.860
 fantastic super charismatic hero 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.989
 I remember by the way that we will have inside 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.360
 of a few months the complete series in the 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.489
 channel here of chrono trailer so 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.530
 crowned a great character let's see 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.110
 who votes 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.360
 Well, dear ones, if you already have it 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.280
 difficult now I put you in an authentic 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.410
 brown because we have as last 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.840
 character in this episode no more nor 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.630
 less than the inc the protagonist 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.900
 main legendary protagonist of the 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.490
 saga legend of zelda we know of all 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.470
 ways by now that the link does not 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.510
 is a unique hero but a series of 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.740
 heroes because not in all of the 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.050
 redress over the years 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.760
 we have always had this same link 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.710
 as a protagonist but good we 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.720
 we take as such and good as their 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.490
 first appearances very remembered the 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.380
 first zelda legend of zelda of danish 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.169
 we also remember his first appearance 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.750
 in 16 bits the link to the past the super 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.700
 nintendo in 64 attempts he made the leap to 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.740
 the three dimensions with ocarina of time 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.050
 in short great games with this character 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.419
 and good link because it is the chosen hero not 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.890
 the other chosen of jairo is the land in 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.030
 which most of the 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.890
 games of the zelda saga 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.900
 well, always with that crusade 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.850
 against the villains on duty to save 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.160

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.470
 again against canon and always for

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.130
 protect the tri force the trifuerza well 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.260
 what good girls guys super episode 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.690
 difficult I think animes would be very 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.430
 complicated to decide who to vote but 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.410
 good luckily that's not my ticket 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.600

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.250
