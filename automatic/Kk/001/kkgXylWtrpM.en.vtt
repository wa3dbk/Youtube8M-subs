00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.740 
edition on spider-man now in the 1960s
when<00:00:31.590> Stan<00:00:31.920> Lee<00:00:32.130> created<00:00:32.369> spider-man<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.329> was

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
when Stan Lee created spider-man it was

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.080 
when Stan Lee created spider-man it was
all<00:00:33.930> science<00:00:34.320> fiction<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:35.370> now<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
all science fiction but now it is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.720 
all science fiction but now it is
science<00:00:36.450> fact<00:00:36.770> we're<00:00:37.770> starting<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.190> learn<00:00:38.340> how

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
science fact we're starting to learn how

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.299 
science fact we're starting to learn how
to<00:00:38.760> make<00:00:39.090> spider<00:00:39.629> webs<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.350> lab<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.800> we

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to make spider webs in the lab and we

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.470 
to make spider webs in the lab and we
can<00:00:41.460> also<00:00:41.700> figure<00:00:42.360> out<00:00:42.480> how<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> walk<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.680> walls

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
can also figure out how to walk on walls

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.660 
can also figure out how to walk on walls
so<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.629> exactly<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:46.050> spider<00:00:46.410> webs<00:00:46.670> spider

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
so what exactly are spider webs spider

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.360 
so what exactly are spider webs spider
webs<00:00:47.940> are<00:00:48.149> made<00:00:48.420> out<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> polymers<00:00:49.370> polymers

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
webs are made out of polymers polymers

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.310 
webs are made out of polymers polymers
are<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.700> over<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> place<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.079> them<00:00:52.230> in

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
are all over the place we have them in

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.490 
are all over the place we have them in
backpacks<00:00:52.890> seat<00:00:53.610> belts<00:00:54.000> carpets<00:00:54.719> they're

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
backpacks seat belts carpets they're

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.060 
backpacks seat belts carpets they're
actually<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:55.980> rubber<00:00:56.190> bands<00:00:56.460> as<00:00:56.730> well

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
actually in rubber bands as well

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.849 
actually in rubber bands as well
polymers<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.219> long-chain<00:01:00.180> molecules<00:01:00.859> you

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
polymers are long-chain molecules you

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.200 
polymers are long-chain molecules you
can<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.730> plate<00:01:03.090> of

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
can think of them as a plate of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.010 
can think of them as a plate of
spaghetti<00:01:03.329> or<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:04.409> bunch<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.010> strings<00:01:05.570> now<00:01:06.570> when

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
spaghetti or a bunch of strings now when

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.530 
spaghetti or a bunch of strings now when
you<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> polymer<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:08.820> very<00:01:09.119> strong

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you have a polymer it's very very strong

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.080 
you have a polymer it's very very strong
along<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.320> length<00:01:10.500> there's<00:01:11.100> strong<00:01:11.549> bonds

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
along the length there's strong bonds

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.969 
along the length there's strong bonds
within<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> polymer<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.530> there's<00:01:13.740> weak

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
within the polymer but there's weak

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.280 
within the polymer but there's weak
bonds<00:01:14.430> between<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.150> polymers<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.110> can

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
bonds between the polymers so they can

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.530 
bonds between the polymers so they can
easily<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.860> broken

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
easily be broken

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.109 
easily be broken
that's<00:01:18.540> why<00:01:18.780> spiderwebs<00:01:19.530> are<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:20.460> strong<00:01:21.060> as

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
that's why spiderwebs are as strong as

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
that's why spiderwebs are as strong as
steel<00:01:21.439> pound-for-pound

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
steel pound-for-pound

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.070 
steel pound-for-pound
in<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.250> direction<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.450> easily<00:01:24.689> be

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
in one direction but can easily be

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.070 
in one direction but can easily be
broken<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.650> another<00:01:26.220> direction<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.840> where<00:01:27.960> can

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
broken in another direction so where can

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.499 
broken in another direction so where can
we<00:01:28.200> use<00:01:28.380> these<00:01:28.560> spiderweb<00:01:29.070> materials<00:01:29.520> well<00:01:30.390> we

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
we use these spiderweb materials well we

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.670 
we use these spiderweb materials well we
can<00:01:30.659> use<00:01:30.689> them<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> make<00:01:31.200> bulletproof

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
can use them to make bulletproof

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.999 
can use them to make bulletproof
clothing<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.430> also<00:01:32.790> parachutes<00:01:33.770> spider<00:01:34.770> webs

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
clothing and also parachutes spider webs

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.730 
clothing and also parachutes spider webs
really<00:01:35.610> Rock<00:01:35.900> now<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.229> else<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.619> learn

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
really Rock now what else can we learn

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.069 
really Rock now what else can we learn
from<00:01:37.799> spider-man<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.700> don't<00:01:39.630> know<00:01:39.720> how<00:01:39.990> about

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
from spider-man I don't know how about

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.580 
from spider-man I don't know how about
to<00:01:40.439> walk<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:40.920> walls<00:01:41.630> spiders<00:01:42.630> walk<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.380> walls

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to walk on walls spiders walk on walls

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.920 
to walk on walls spiders walk on walls
how<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.159> they<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.610> they<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.689> with

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
how do they do this they do this with

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.990 
how do they do this they do this with
Van<00:01:46.140> der<00:01:46.290> Waals<00:01:46.439> force<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:47.670> at<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
Van der Waals force you see at the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760 
Van der Waals force you see at the
bottom<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.450> their<00:01:48.570> feet<00:01:48.780> are<00:01:48.960> small<00:01:49.380> hairs

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
bottom of their feet are small hairs

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.870 
bottom of their feet are small hairs
that<00:01:50.369> attract<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.180> molecules<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.320> wall

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
that attract the molecules of the wall

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.510 
that attract the molecules of the wall
more<00:01:53.880> surface<00:01:54.659> more<00:01:55.409> opportunities<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.430> that

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
more surface more opportunities for that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.179 
more surface more opportunities for that
attraction<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.119> occur<00:01:57.649> geckos<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> same

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
attraction to occur geckos do the same

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.270 
attraction to occur geckos do the same
thing<00:01:59.460> so<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.450> see<00:02:00.689> spiders<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.590> not<00:02:01.649> scary

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
thing so you see spiders are not scary

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.359 
thing so you see spiders are not scary
they're<00:02:02.820> our<00:02:03.000> friends<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.829> by<00:02:04.829> learning<00:02:05.040> what

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
they're our friends and by learning what

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.510 
they're our friends and by learning what
they<00:02:05.520> do<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.750> superhuman<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.340> have

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
they do we can be superhuman but we have

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.639 
they do we can be superhuman but we have
to<00:02:08.700> follow<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.119> advice<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.390> Stanley<00:02:09.989> with
