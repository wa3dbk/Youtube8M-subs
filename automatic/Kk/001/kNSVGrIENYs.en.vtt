00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
your mob boss's head which I thought was

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.890 
your mob boss's head which I thought was
insane<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.230> issue<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.060> artwork<00:02:33.480> was

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
insane in that issue so the artwork was

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.470 
insane in that issue so the artwork was
was<00:02:34.410> really<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.370> know<00:02:35.400> for<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.790> most<00:02:35.970> part<00:02:36.150> it

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
was really you know for the most part it

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.050 
was really you know for the most part it
was<00:02:36.569> really<00:02:36.989> well<00:02:37.170> done<00:02:37.640> so<00:02:38.640> what<00:02:38.819> did<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.000> think

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
was really well done so what did I think

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.290 
was really well done so what did I think
about<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.720> conclusion<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.819> particular

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
about this conclusion to this particular

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.890 
about this conclusion to this particular
story<00:02:43.940> pretty<00:02:44.940> good<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.180> think<00:02:45.510> if<00:02:45.780> you

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
story pretty good I think if you

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.860 
story pretty good I think if you
remember<00:02:46.050> correctly<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:48.390> got<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.690> see

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
remember correctly that you got to see

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.110 
remember correctly that you got to see
her<00:02:49.080> hit<00:02:49.440> girl<00:02:49.739> she<00:02:50.130> took<00:02:50.310> off<00:02:50.519> with<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.790> bow

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
her hit girl she took off with a bow

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.250 
her hit girl she took off with a bow
because<00:02:51.420> they<00:02:51.570> were<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:51.750> their<00:02:51.870> secret

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
because they were in their secret

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.140 
because they were in their secret
headquarters<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.340> think<00:02:53.519> Dave<00:02:53.730> took<00:02:53.970> off

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150

thing that happens in this actual issue

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.650 
thing that happens in this actual issue

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
is that it makes up for the loss that

I thought the you know the overall story

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.769 
I thought the you know the overall story
was<00:05:52.949> fun<00:05:53.219> and<00:05:53.789> when<00:05:54.029> you<00:05:54.120> get<00:05:54.240> to<00:05:54.389> the<00:05:54.509> end<00:05:54.659> of

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
was fun and when you get to the end of

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.570 
was fun and when you get to the end of
the<00:05:54.900> book<00:05:55.110> you'll<00:05:55.259> see<00:05:55.469> a<00:05:55.500> little<00:05:55.740> conclusion

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
the book you'll see a little conclusion

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.029 
the book you'll see a little conclusion
to<00:05:57.090> where<00:05:57.300> maybe<00:05:57.629> they<00:05:57.930> could<00:05:58.110> leave<00:05:58.379> this<00:05:58.680> in

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
to where maybe they could leave this in

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.580 
to where maybe they could leave this in
a<00:05:59.490> future<00:05:59.789> of<00:06:00.240> another<00:06:00.810> story

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
a future of another story

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.219 
a future of another story
I<00:06:01.949> don't<00:06:02.460> think<00:06:02.669> they<00:06:02.849> will<00:06:03.150> but<00:06:03.539> they<00:06:03.960> left

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
I don't think they will but they left

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.769 
I don't think they will but they left
you<00:06:04.409> hang<00:06:04.620> in<00:06:04.800> there<00:06:04.979> for<00:06:05.190> a<00:06:05.250> little<00:06:05.430> bit<00:06:05.779> but

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:06.779 
you hang in there for a little bit but

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:10.219 
you hang in there for a little bit but
in<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:07.020> end<00:06:07.229> I<00:06:07.529> thought<00:06:07.830> this<00:06:08.129> book<00:06:08.190> was<00:06:09.229> it

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
in the end I thought this book was it

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.589 
in the end I thought this book was it
worth<00:06:10.500> a<00:06:10.770> four-month<00:06:11.370> wait<00:06:11.729> I<00:06:12.000> don't<00:06:12.270> think

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
worth a four-month wait I don't think

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.689 
worth a four-month wait I don't think
any<00:06:12.960> book<00:06:13.199> is<00:06:13.379> worth<00:06:13.590> four<00:06:13.949> month<00:06:14.250> weight

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 
any book is worth four month weight

this<00:06:45.379> was<00:06:45.620> a<00:06:45.650> very<00:06:45.949> lackluster<00:06:46.400> series<00:06:47.300> it<00:06:48.289> was

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
this was a very lackluster series it was

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.240 
this was a very lackluster series it was
bogged<00:06:49.069> down<00:06:49.280> by<00:06:49.639> delays<00:06:50.259> it<00:06:51.259> was<00:06:51.500> very<00:06:51.800> slow

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
bogged down by delays it was very slow

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.499 
bogged down by delays it was very slow
very<00:06:52.550> boring

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:53.509 
very boring

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:55.779 
very boring
one<00:06:53.960> of<00:06:54.110> the<00:06:54.289> worst<00:06:54.530> series<00:06:55.129> I<00:06:55.310> thought<00:06:55.520> in

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
one of the worst series I thought in

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:58.800 
one of the worst series I thought in
general<00:06:56.449> out<00:06:56.690> of<00:06:57.050> all<00:06:57.319> the<00:06:57.470> kick-ass<00:06:57.860> series

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
general out of all the kick-ass series

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.520 
general out of all the kick-ass series
this<00:06:59.810> was<00:07:00.020> a<00:07:00.050> great<00:07:00.440> finale<00:07:01.069> to<00:07:01.789> this<00:07:02.090> issue

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
this was a great finale to this issue

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.930 
this was a great finale to this issue
but<00:07:03.530> with<00:07:03.680> that<00:07:03.860> being<00:07:04.039> said<00:07:04.340> this<00:07:04.550> was<00:07:04.909> the

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 
but with that being said this was the

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.040 
but with that being said this was the
best<00:07:05.389> issue<00:07:06.520> so<00:07:07.520> even<00:07:08.150> though<00:07:08.270> I<00:07:08.300> enjoyed<00:07:08.870> this

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
best issue so even though I enjoyed this

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.330 
best issue so even though I enjoyed this
issue<00:07:09.440> that<00:07:09.919> you<00:07:10.460> know<00:07:10.550> a<00:07:10.819> lot<00:07:11.560> this<00:07:12.560> actual

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
issue that you know a lot this actual

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.270 
issue that you know a lot this actual
series<00:07:13.879> was<00:07:14.330> kind<00:07:14.719> of<00:07:14.810> just<00:07:14.990> averaged<00:07:15.620> for<00:07:15.949> me

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
series was kind of just averaged for me

so<00:07:16.699> as<00:07:16.849> an<00:07:16.969> individual<00:07:17.690> issue<00:07:18.250> I'm<00:07:19.250> gonna<00:07:19.430> give
