even high quality velcro if you look at
this<00:00:22.350> particular<00:00:22.619> strap<00:00:23.160> here<00:00:23.400> which<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.850> cut

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
this particular strap here which I cut

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.900 
this particular strap here which I cut
off<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.539> bag<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> can't<00:00:26.010> focus<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.699> this

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
off of a bag so I can't focus with this

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.099 
off of a bag so I can't focus with this
camera<00:00:27.410> if<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.590> listen<00:00:28.980> here<00:00:29.960> it's<00:00:30.960> not

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
camera if you listen here it's not

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.840 
camera if you listen here it's not
grabbing<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.619> at<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.099> that's<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.759> an

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
grabbing on at all and that's just an

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.780 
grabbing on at all and that's just an
inevitable<00:00:33.390> part<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:34.280> repeated<00:00:35.280> openings<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
inevitable part of repeated openings and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.580 
inevitable part of repeated openings and
closings<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.300> mean<00:00:36.450> eventually<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.870> fuzzy

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
closings I mean eventually the fuzzy

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.440 
closings I mean eventually the fuzzy
part<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.890> going<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.070> stretch<00:00:38.910> out<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
part is going to stretch out and the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.700 
part is going to stretch out and the
hooks<00:00:39.660> eventually<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.350> either<00:00:40.469> going<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
hooks eventually are either going to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.080 
hooks eventually are either going to
come<00:00:40.920> out<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.309> they're<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> straighten

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
come out or they're going to straighten

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.340 
come out or they're going to straighten
them<00:00:42.270> they're<00:00:42.420> not<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> latch<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
them they're not going to latch on to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.270 
them they're not going to latch on to
the<00:00:43.680> fuzzy<00:00:44.040> part<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.430> well<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:46.200> my<00:00:46.829> answer<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the fuzzy part as well so my answer to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.160 
the fuzzy part as well so my answer to
that<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> replace<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:48.660> these<00:00:48.870> metal

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that is to replace it with these metal

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.229 
that is to replace it with these metal
snaps<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:50.160> two<00:00:50.399> examples<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
snaps and I got two examples here to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.319 
snaps and I got two examples here to
show<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:53.070> cold<00:00:53.430> steel<00:00:53.760> Roche

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329

without it being too tight or having too
much<00:01:33.479> room<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.720> shift<00:01:33.990> about<00:01:34.229> once<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.650> was

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
much room to shift about once that was

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.980 
much room to shift about once that was
that<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> link<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.880> i<00:01:36.000> wanted<00:01:36.360> took<00:01:36.900> a

that the link that i wanted took a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.300 
that the link that i wanted took a
permanent<00:01:37.350> marker<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.740> Mark<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> place<00:01:38.130> wire

permanent marker and Mark the place wire
without<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.759> snaps<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.509> added<00:01:39.780> them

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
without the snaps then just added them

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.460 
without the snaps then just added them
on<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.210> stick<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.320> on

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
on and now I can just like stick this on

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.679 
on and now I can just like stick this on
my<00:01:43.560> belt<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.950> unsnap<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:45.509> easily

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
my belt and unsnap it just as easily

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.990 
my belt and unsnap it just as easily
makes<00:01:46.170> me<00:01:46.350> more<00:01:47.130> likely<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.549> carry<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> nice

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
makes me more likely to carry the nice

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.670 
makes me more likely to carry the nice
since<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.600> convenient<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.170> attach

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
since it is so convenient to just attach

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.260 
since it is so convenient to just attach
onto<00:01:49.920> my<00:01:50.159> belt<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.520> that's<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> nice<00:01:51.090> little

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
onto my belt so that's a nice little

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.460 
onto my belt so that's a nice little
modification<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.110> might<00:01:52.229> want<00:01:52.409> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
modification that you might want to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.249 
modification that you might want to
think<00:01:52.560> about<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.790> sheet<00:01:54.630> where

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
think about if you have a sheet where

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.580 
think about if you have a sheet where
the<00:01:55.439> loop<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.799> just<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:57.390> where<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.380> have

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the loop is just is just where you have

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.709 
the loop is just is just where you have
to<00:01:58.770> attach<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.090> way<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.509> like

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
to attach it this way you can just like

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.929 
to attach it this way you can just like
cut<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.530> quick<00:02:02.159> place<00:02:02.820> it

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
cut it up and then it quick place it

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.940 
cut it up and then it quick place it
onto<00:02:03.060> your<00:02:03.180> belt<00:02:03.420> another<00:02:04.259> example<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.799> have

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
onto your belt another example I have

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.740 
onto your belt another example I have
right<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> wallet<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.630> is

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
right here is a wallet and this is

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.839 
right here is a wallet and this is
probably<00:02:06.990> more<00:02:07.140> prevalent<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.009> relevant<00:02:08.670> to

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
probably more prevalent and relevant to

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.559 
probably more prevalent and relevant to
more<00:02:09.840> people<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.970> probably<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.060> lot<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.390> buy

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
more people is probably a lot of you buy

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.700 
more people is probably a lot of you buy
like<00:02:12.900> these<00:02:13.080> cheap<00:02:13.290> little

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
like these cheap little

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.020 
like these cheap little
wallets<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.280> they<00:02:14.340> have<00:02:14.460> like<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.640> Velcro

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
wallets and they have like a Velcro

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.400 
wallets and they have like a Velcro
closure<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:15.660> after<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> while<00:02:16.200> of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
closure and then after a while of

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.810 
closure and then after a while of
opening<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:16.980> closing<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.640> velcro

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
opening and closing it the velcro

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.520 
opening and closing it the velcro
doesn't<00:02:18.270> work<00:02:18.360> anymore<00:02:18.600> but<00:02:19.200> that's<00:02:19.350> easy

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
doesn't work anymore but that's easy

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.740 
doesn't work anymore but that's easy
enough<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.800> fix<00:02:20.040> as<00:02:20.190> well<00:02:20.540> basically<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.690> just

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
enough to fix as well basically you just

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.970 
enough to fix as well basically you just
take<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.140> little<00:02:22.320> thread<00:02:22.590> cutter<00:02:22.830> right

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
take this little thread cutter right

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.190 
take this little thread cutter right
here<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.820> cut<00:02:24.150> all<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.600> little<00:02:24.840> threads

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
here and you cut all the little threads

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.130 
here and you cut all the little threads
that<00:02:25.410> hold<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.770> velcro<00:02:26.420> in<00:02:27.420> place<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.050> then

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
that hold the velcro in place and then

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.450 
that hold the velcro in place and then
you<00:02:28.320> just<00:02:28.440> pull<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.710> out<00:02:28.830> then<00:02:29.160> once<00:02:29.400> that

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
you just pull it out then once that

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.490 
you just pull it out then once that
happens<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.510> have<00:02:30.600> these<00:02:30.750> snaps<00:02:31.050> now

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
happens you can have these snaps now

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.810 
happens you can have these snaps now
there's<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.740> saying<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.220> sewing<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.580> measure

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820

there's a saying and sewing you measure
twice<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.210> then<00:02:33.480> cut<00:02:33.690> once<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.200> that's

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
twice and then cut once and that's

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.110 
twice and then cut once and that's
really<00:02:34.620> true<00:02:34.950> especially<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.730> something

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
really true especially for something

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.670 
really true especially for something
like<00:02:36.210> this<00:02:36.390> just<00:02:36.870> because<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.230> want<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
you don't stick the pans on both sides

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.630 
you don't stick the pans on both sides
here<00:02:41.850> if<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.060> look<00:02:43.250> it's<00:02:44.250> from<00:02:44.640> one<00:02:44.910> side<00:02:45.180> of

here if you look it's from one side of
the<00:02:47.640> wallet<00:02:48.000> right<00:02:48.750> here<00:02:49.760> or<00:02:50.760> actually<00:02:51.060> within

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
the wallet right here or actually within

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.140 
the wallet right here or actually within
this<00:02:51.480> section<00:02:52.430> if<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.580> pinned<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.880> from<00:02:54.030> this

this section if you pinned it from this

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.190 
this section if you pinned it from this
side<00:02:54.210> you<00:02:54.510> wouldn't<00:02:54.690> be<00:02:54.750> able<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.930> open<00:02:55.140> your

in from here so that's something to look
out<00:03:00.630> for<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:01.230> by<00:03:01.710> adding<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.100> snap<00:03:02.340> here<00:03:02.580> if

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
out for but by adding a snap here if

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.170 
out for but by adding a snap here if
you'll<00:03:02.820> notice<00:03:04.250> can<00:03:05.250> clopin<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.820> close<00:03:06.000> as

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
you'll notice can clopin and close as

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.430 
you'll notice can clopin and close as
many<00:03:06.420> times<00:03:06.630> as<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.810> want<00:03:07.020> it's<00:03:07.140> never<00:03:07.290> going

I'm<00:03:34.710> going<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:34.920> explain<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.310> in<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:35.460> second

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
I'm going to explain that in a second

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.090 
I'm going to explain that in a second
you<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.840> four<00:03:37.290> pieces<00:03:38.180> right<00:03:39.180> here<00:03:39.240> so<00:03:40.230> first

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
you have four pieces right here so first

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.550 
you have four pieces right here so first
part<00:03:41.430> these<00:03:42.360> are<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.720> main<00:03:42.930> parts<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.530> you

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
part these are the main parts that you

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.050 
part these are the main parts that you
would<00:03:43.830> see<00:03:44.070> when<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.430> actually<00:03:44.610> have<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:45.000> in

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
would see when you actually have it in

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.720 
would see when you actually have it in
place<00:03:45.300> this<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.590> male<00:03:47.100> part<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.520> this<00:03:47.580> is

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
place this is the male part and this is

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.490 
place this is the male part and this is
the<00:03:47.820> female<00:03:48.150> part<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.600> then<00:03:48.780> they<00:03:48.960> snap<00:03:49.260> into

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
the female part and then they snap into

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.600 
the female part and then they snap into
each<00:03:49.710> other<00:03:49.860> I'm<00:03:49.980> not<00:03:50.100> going<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.280> snap<00:03:50.430> it

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
each other I'm not going to snap it

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.740 
each other I'm not going to snap it
because<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.880> don't<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.180> way<00:03:51.330> to<00:03:51.390> pull<00:03:51.600> them

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
because I don't have a way to pull them

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.190 
because I don't have a way to pull them
apart<00:03:51.810> just<00:03:52.170> because<00:03:52.290> there's<00:03:53.100> no<00:03:53.220> handle<00:03:53.580> and

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
apart just because there's no handle and

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.480 
apart just because there's no handle and
then<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.320> have<00:03:55.500> these<00:03:55.650> little<00:03:56.070> backing

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
then you have these little backing

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.700 
then you have these little backing
nipples<00:03:57.120> right<00:03:57.330> here<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.630> fit<00:03:57.930> through<00:03:58.290> the

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
nipples right here that fit through the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.160 
nipples right here that fit through the
hole<00:03:58.740> and<00:04:00.560> so<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:03.000> idea<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.420> I'm<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:03.990> going

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
hole and so the idea is I'm just going

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.690 
hole and so the idea is I'm just going
to<00:04:04.200> use<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.590> little<00:04:04.800> strap<00:04:05.070> as<00:04:05.250> an<00:04:05.400> example

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
to use this little strap as an example

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.670 
to use this little strap as an example
what<00:04:06.360> you<00:04:06.450> would<00:04:06.600> do<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.960> you<00:04:06.990> take<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.380> marker

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
what you would do is you take a marker

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.100 
what you would do is you take a marker
and<00:04:08.040> Mark<00:04:09.000> where<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.570> want<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.810> drive<00:04:09.960> the

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
and Mark where you want to drive the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.340 
and Mark where you want to drive the
holes<00:04:10.320> in<00:04:10.560> be<00:04:11.520> very<00:04:11.940> careful<00:04:12.390> about<00:04:12.510> where<00:04:13.050> the

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
holes in be very careful about where the

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.740 
holes in be very careful about where the
placement<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.010> take<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.000> lot<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.210> time<00:04:15.390> for<00:04:15.660> an

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
placement is take a lot of time for an

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.390 
placement is take a lot of time for an
example<00:04:16.020> here<00:04:16.350> if<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.560> look<00:04:16.739> at<00:04:16.890> this<00:04:17.010> wallet

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
example here if you look at this wallet

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.820 
example here if you look at this wallet
I<00:04:17.580> was<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.210> little<00:04:18.420> too<00:04:18.540> eager<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:18.900> if<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.320> let

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
I was a little too eager and if I let

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.350 
I was a little too eager and if I let
this<00:04:19.980> down<00:04:20.960> close<00:04:21.960> down<00:04:22.109> naturally<00:04:23.360> this

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
this down close down naturally this

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.180 
this down close down naturally this
little<00:04:24.660> snap<00:04:24.900> is<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.140> little<00:04:25.470> bit<00:04:25.560> too<00:04:25.740> far<00:04:25.950> to

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
little snap is a little bit too far to

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.870 
little snap is a little bit too far to
the<00:04:26.280> right

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
the right

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.630 
the right
but<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:27.990> works<00:04:28.200> just<00:04:28.290> fine<00:04:28.590> so<00:04:28.920> measure<00:04:29.370> very

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
but it works just fine so measure very

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.970 
but it works just fine so measure very
carefully<00:04:30.060> because<00:04:30.320> once<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.410> do<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:31.710> you<00:04:31.800> can

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
carefully because once you do it you can

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.730 
carefully because once you do it you can
undo<00:04:32.280> it<00:04:32.510> so<00:04:33.510> mark<00:04:34.350> where<00:04:34.470> you're<00:04:34.560> going<00:04:34.680> to

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
undo it so mark where you're going to

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.680 
undo it so mark where you're going to
put<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.920> holes<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.490> then<00:04:35.640> basically<00:04:35.850> I'm

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
put the holes and then basically I'm

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.880 
put the holes and then basically I'm
going<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:36.930> start<00:04:37.050> off<00:04:37.170> one<00:04:37.590> section<00:04:38.720> say<00:04:39.720> you

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
going to start off one section say you

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.250 
going to start off one section say you
wanted<00:04:40.890> this<00:04:41.450> to<00:04:42.450> be<00:04:42.480> on<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.720> outside<00:04:42.780> because

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
wanted this to be on the outside because

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.450 
wanted this to be on the outside because
this<00:04:43.470> is<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.650> brass<00:04:43.860> side<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.280> you're<00:04:44.370> going

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
this is the brass side that you're going

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.640 
this is the brass side that you're going
to<00:04:44.520> see<00:04:44.730> like<00:04:45.120> here<00:04:45.360> on<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:45.540> sheath<00:04:45.780> see<00:04:46.620> a

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
to see like here on the sheath see a

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.160 
to see like here on the sheath see a
little<00:04:46.890> silver<00:04:47.100> side<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.720> put<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:48.990> on

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
little silver side so you put this on

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.720 
little silver side so you put this on
the<00:04:49.200> outside<00:04:49.800> of<00:04:50.010> wherever<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.400> want<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.610> to

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
the outside of wherever you want it to

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.830 
the outside of wherever you want it to
be<00:04:51.080> drive<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.200> through<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.500> hole<00:04:52.710> like<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:53.840> now

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
be drive it through the hole like so now

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.270 
be drive it through the hole like so now
this<00:04:54.930> might<00:04:55.110> take<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.350> few<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.800> little<00:04:56.100> bit<00:04:56.190> of

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
this might take a few a little bit of

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.200 
this might take a few a little bit of
time<00:04:56.400> just<00:04:56.460> because<00:04:56.760> you're<00:04:56.940> going<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.090> have

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
time just because you're going to have

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.590 
time just because you're going to have
it<00:04:57.330> threads<00:04:57.660> to<00:04:57.930> go<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.650> cut<00:04:58.860> through<00:04:59.270> so<00:05:00.270> once

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
it threads to go to cut through so once

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.790 
it threads to go to cut through so once
you<00:05:00.690> make<00:05:00.840> that<00:05:00.870> mark<00:05:01.140> you<00:05:01.350> can<00:05:01.470> take<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.620> knife

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
you make that mark you can take a knife

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.800 
you make that mark you can take a knife
or<00:05:01.830> whatever<00:05:02.190> or<00:05:02.430> even<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.150> ballpoint<00:05:03.450> pen<00:05:03.570> and

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
or whatever or even a ballpoint pen and

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.910 
or whatever or even a ballpoint pen and
jam<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.020> through<00:05:04.230> and<00:05:04.350> make<00:05:04.440> a<00:05:04.470> hole<00:05:04.680> so<00:05:04.890> you

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
jam it through and make a hole so you

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.320 
jam it through and make a hole so you
put<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.370> little<00:05:05.550> nipple<00:05:05.850> through<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.180> hole

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
put the little nipple through the hole

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.960 
put the little nipple through the hole
like<00:05:06.510> so<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:07.860> then<00:05:07.890> this<00:05:08.760> is<00:05:08.820> the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
like so and then this is the

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.000 
like so and then this is the
corresponding<00:05:09.330> piece<00:05:09.810> this<00:05:10.080> is<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:10.500> female

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
corresponding piece this is the female

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.690 
corresponding piece this is the female
section<00:05:11.430> of<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.610> thing<00:05:11.790> put<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.720> through<00:05:12.870> here

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
section of the thing put it through here

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.910 
section of the thing put it through here
like<00:05:14.700> so<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.210> then<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:16.320> can<00:05:16.440> take<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.710> base

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
like so and then you can take the base

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.070 
like so and then you can take the base
it'll<00:05:17.820> sit<00:05:18.060> nicely<00:05:18.270> in<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.570> base<00:05:18.720> like<00:05:18.930> this

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
it'll sit nicely in the base like this

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.210 
it'll sit nicely in the base like this
that<00:05:22.080> fits<00:05:22.920> in<00:05:23.100> here<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:25.620> then<00:05:25.800> you<00:05:25.890> hold<00:05:26.070> it

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220
