hello<00:00:01.140> guys<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.399> tutorial<00:00:02.700> on<00:00:03.419> how<00:00:03.750> to

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.190 
hello guys this is a tutorial on how to

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.839 
hello guys this is a tutorial on how to
mirror<00:00:05.190> objects<00:00:06.060> on<00:00:06.240> Maya<00:00:06.480> 2012<00:00:07.460> so<00:00:08.460> what

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
mirror objects on Maya 2012 so what

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.200 
mirror objects on Maya 2012 so what
we're<00:00:09.000> going<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.179> do<00:00:09.360> first<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:10.790> go<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.969> raise

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
we're going to do first is go to raise

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.830 
we're going to do first is go to raise
this<00:00:12.450> side<00:00:14.660> this<00:00:15.660> case<00:00:16.279> will<00:00:17.279> just<00:00:17.600> turn<00:00:18.600> on

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
this side this case will just turn on

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.460 
this side this case will just turn on
our<00:00:19.350> keys<00:00:19.680> left<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.420> raced<00:00:21.720> delete<00:00:22.230> those

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
our keys left so I raced delete those

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.240 
our keys left so I raced delete those
okay<00:00:24.769> so<00:00:25.970> to<00:00:26.970> mirror<00:00:27.680> make<00:00:28.680> sure<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.070> go<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
okay so to mirror make sure you go to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.659 
okay so to mirror make sure you go to
object<00:00:29.519> mode<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.300> set<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.900> object<00:00:31.460> so<00:00:32.460> go<00:00:32.610> to

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
object mode and set the object so go to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.840 
object mode and set the object so go to
edit<00:00:33.920> duplicate<00:00:34.920> special<00:00:34.980> click<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
edit duplicate special click on the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.350 
edit duplicate special click on the
options<00:00:36.180> box<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> here<00:00:37.950> make<00:00:38.430> sure<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:39.120> set

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
options box so here make sure it's set

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.410 
options box so here make sure it's set
to<00:00:39.390> instant<00:00:40.079> instead<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.190> copy<00:00:41.460> make<00:00:42.270> sure

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
to instant instead of copy make sure

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.119 
to instant instead of copy make sure
this<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.809> set<00:00:43.379> up<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.710> way<00:00:43.980> 0<00:00:44.309> here<00:00:45.120> minus<00:00:45.390> 1

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
this are set up this way 0 here minus 1

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.479 
this are set up this way 0 here minus 1
the<00:00:47.129> x-axis<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> go

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
the x-axis there you go

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.900 
the x-axis there you go
so<00:00:50.489> these<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:51.030> two<00:00:51.270> separate<00:00:51.660> objects

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
so these are two separate objects

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.400 
so these are two separate objects
whatever<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.180> do<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.480> side<00:00:54.660> will<00:00:55.140> happen

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
whatever you do to one side will happen

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.889 
whatever you do to one side will happen
to<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> author<00:00:56.690> see<00:00:59.570> even<00:01:00.570> though<00:01:00.690> they're

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
to be the author see even though they're

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.750 
to be the author see even though they're
separate<00:01:01.260> objects<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> other<00:01:02.340> side<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
separate objects or the other side and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
separate objects or the other side and
don't<00:01:02.820> forget<00:01:03.059> up<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.359> side<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:04.739> will

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
don't forget up this side that will

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.609 
don't forget up this side that will
select<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.250> instance<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.330> why<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:07.320> do

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
select the instance so that's why we do

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.250 
select the instance so that's why we do
-<00:01:07.740> once<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.130> happens<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
- once I happens but with you to this

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.870 
- once I happens but with you to this
well<00:01:10.310> what<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.670> e<00:01:12.260> open<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> middle

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
well what is that e open in the middle

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.640 
well what is that e open in the middle
so<00:01:14.880> within<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.900> don't<00:01:16.080> want<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
so within that we don't want that to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.740 
so within that we don't want that to
happen<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.340> how<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.030> fix<00:01:18.240> that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
happen so how do you fix that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
happen so how do you fix that
so<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.650> need<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> use<00:01:20.130> reflection<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
so we need to use reflection like the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.719 
so we need to use reflection like the
turn<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.540> reflection<00:01:22.189> to<00:01:23.189> make<00:01:23.220> sure<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
turn on reflection to make sure the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.190 
turn on reflection to make sure the
preserve<00:01:24.710> seeing<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.979> checked<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> do

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
preserve seeing is checked so if you do

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.020 
preserve seeing is checked so if you do
that<00:01:28.320> again<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.770> doesn't<00:01:29.520> happen<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.000> doesn't

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that again it doesn't happen it doesn't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.859 
that again it doesn't happen it doesn't
do<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.409> protects<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> scene<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.720> as

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
do that so it protects the scene so as

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.340 
do that so it protects the scene so as
you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.170> see<00:01:34.320> there<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:36.110> that's<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.259> only

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you can see there so that's the only

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.859 
you can see there so that's the only
reason<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.950> use<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.689> reflection<00:01:39.689> on

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
reason you want to use a reflection on

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.499 
reason you want to use a reflection on
what<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.430> want<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> placate<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.000> special

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
what you want you to placate it special

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.570 
what you want you to placate it special
so<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.710> preserve<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> scene

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.890 

so<00:01:49.480> see<00:01:49.690> if<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.900> have<00:01:49.990> two<00:01:50.170> different<00:01:50.500> objects

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
so see if you have two different objects

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.390 
so see if you have two different objects
so<00:01:52.900> really<00:01:53.410> it's<00:01:53.680> one<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.010> what<00:01:54.160> do<00:01:54.220> you<00:01:54.310> do

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
so really it's one so what do you do

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.820 
so really it's one so what do you do
when<00:01:54.550> you're<00:01:54.700> done<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.590> have<00:01:56.710> two

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
when you're done because you have two

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.950 
when you're done because you have two
separate<00:01:57.250> objects<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.790> want<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.300> be<00:01:58.420> one<00:01:58.630> so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
separate objects you want to be one so

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.260 
separate objects you want to be one so
go<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.140> your<00:01:59.410> geometry<00:01:59.860> put<00:02:00.790> in<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:00.940> options

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
go to your geometry put in the options

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.810 
go to your geometry put in the options
box<00:02:01.740> X<00:02:02.740> arch<00:02:03.280> just<00:02:04.210> match<00:02:04.440> vertices

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.510 

just<00:02:09.820> your<00:02:10.210> that<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.869> there<00:02:11.740> you<00:02:11.860> go<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.460> now

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
just your that and there you go and now

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.030 
just your that and there you go and now
it's<00:02:12.880> one<00:02:13.210> whole<00:02:13.660> object<00:02:14.260> instead<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.860> two

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
it's one whole object instead of two

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.700 
it's one whole object instead of two
pieces<00:02:17.640> that's<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:19.480> was<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.690> preview<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.470> how

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
pieces that's that was a preview of how

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.480 
pieces that's that was a preview of how
