part the delts the medial and the front
the<00:00:09.299> anterior<00:00:09.750> get<00:00:10.260> work<00:00:10.440> typically<00:00:10.920> with<00:00:11.129> a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
the anterior get work typically with a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.609 
the anterior get work typically with a
lot<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.400> arm<00:00:11.670> chest<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.930> main<00:00:13.320> short

lot of arm chest and main short

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.010 
lot of arm chest and main short
exercises<00:00:14.279> so<00:00:14.459> the<00:00:14.580> rear<00:00:14.789> delt<00:00:15.059> often<00:00:15.809> gets

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
exercises so the rear delt often gets

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.240 
exercises so the rear delt often gets
left<00:00:16.710> behind

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
left behind

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.820 
left behind
a<00:00:17.310> little<00:00:17.609> bit<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.570> what<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.650> is

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
a little bit so what I like to do is

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.880 
a little bit so what I like to do is
either<00:00:20.009> a<00:00:20.130> rear<00:00:21.119> delt<00:00:21.359> fly<00:00:21.449> with<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> cables

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
either a rear delt fly with the cables

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.009 
either a rear delt fly with the cables
or<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:23.789> dumbbells<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.480> again<00:00:24.689> only<00:00:24.900> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
or with dumbbells but again only a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.269 
or with dumbbells but again only a
couple<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.320> weeks<00:00:25.470> out<00:00:25.710> from<00:00:25.740> getting<00:00:26.130> input

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
couple of weeks out from getting input

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.210 
couple of weeks out from getting input
shape<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.970> start<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.660> transfer<00:00:28.109> more<00:00:28.349> onto<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
shape I start to transfer more onto the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.909 
shape I start to transfer more onto the
machine<00:00:29.839> basically<00:00:30.839> it's<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.079> chest<00:00:31.409> fly

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
machine basically it's a chest fly

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.340 
machine basically it's a chest fly
exercise<00:00:32.579> some<00:00:33.060> of<00:00:33.090> them<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.629> advance

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
exercise some of them you can advance

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.500 
exercise some of them you can advance
and<00:00:34.739> do<00:00:34.920> more<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> rear<00:00:35.489> delt<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:36.360> make

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and do more of the rear delt just make

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.630 
and do more of the rear delt just make
sure<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:36.989> you've<00:00:37.110> sat<00:00:37.320> down<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.460> arm

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
sure that when you've sat down the arm

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.819 
sure that when you've sat down the arm
is<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.420> line<00:00:39.600> with<00:00:40.289> the<00:00:40.410> shoulder

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
is in line with the shoulder

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.850 
is in line with the shoulder
that's<00:00:42.460> right<00:00:42.960> not<00:00:43.960> leaning<00:00:44.379> back<00:00:44.410> including

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
that's right not leaning back including

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.680 
that's right not leaning back including
our<00:00:45.360> behind<00:00:46.360> it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
our behind it

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.550 
our behind it
anything<00:00:47.470> my<00:00:48.309> Clips<00:00:48.610> back<00:00:48.850> I'm<00:00:49.719> leaning

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
anything my Clips back I'm leaning

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.880 
anything my Clips back I'm leaning
and<00:00:50.710> more<00:00:50.950> of<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.330> seated<00:00:52.330> tripod<00:00:52.990> position<00:00:53.080> and

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
and more of a seated tripod position and

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.670 
and more of a seated tripod position and
that<00:00:54.130> way<00:00:54.250> I<00:00:54.280> can<00:00:54.550> focus<00:00:54.790> or<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.750> energy<00:00:56.140> and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
that way I can focus or the energy and

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
that way I can focus or the energy and
the<00:00:56.770> weight<00:00:56.920> if<00:00:57.100> therefore<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.760> down

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
the weight if therefore it down

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:29.239 
the weight if therefore it down
you

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:31.010 

one<00:01:29.759> thing<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.969> really<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.479> about<00:01:30.509> using

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
one thing I really like about using

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.010 
one thing I really like about using
machines<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:32.039> element<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.579> precision<00:01:33.240> we

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
machines is the element of precision we

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.389 
machines is the element of precision we
really<00:01:34.259> can't<00:01:34.469> cheat<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.829> these<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.219> if<00:01:35.280> you

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
really can't cheat on these and if you

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.219 
really can't cheat on these and if you
are<00:01:35.549> certainly<00:01:36.420> doing<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.719> movement<00:01:37.079> wrong

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
are certainly doing the movement wrong

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.899 
are certainly doing the movement wrong
think<00:01:38.100> about<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.399> with<00:01:38.520> free<00:01:38.759> weights

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
think about it with free weights

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.330 
think about it with free weights
typically<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:40.049> aim<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.409> game<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.950> just

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
typically the aim of the game is to just

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.429 
typically the aim of the game is to just
get<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.729> weight<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.209> so<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.840> use<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> lot<00:01:43.409> of

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
get that weight up so you use a lot of

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.959 
get that weight up so you use a lot of
your<00:01:43.679> own<00:01:43.770> body<00:01:43.920> weight<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.340> stabilizer

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
your own body weight or stabilizer

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.480 
your own body weight or stabilizer
muscles<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.840> assist<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.890> bring<00:01:47.219> it<00:01:47.399> up

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
muscles to assist you and bring it up

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.510 
muscles to assist you and bring it up
you<00:01:48.179> can<00:01:48.359> take<00:01:48.569> that<00:01:48.719> away<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.039> can

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
you can take that away so that you can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.770 
you can take that away so that you can
only<00:01:50.640> go<00:01:50.819> through<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.119> single<00:01:51.359> range<00:01:51.630> of

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
only go through that single range of

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
only go through that single range of
movement<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.799> only<00:01:52.979> way<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.789> do

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
movement the only way you can really do

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.179 
movement the only way you can really do
it<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.539> by<00:01:54.780> engaging<00:01:54.929> and<00:01:55.469> using<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.039> muscle

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it is by engaging and using that muscle

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.120 
it is by engaging and using that muscle
group<00:01:56.369> properly<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.929> breathing<00:01:58.409> form

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
group properly so breathing form

group properly so breathing form
technique<00:01:59.819> and<00:02:00.780> they<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.049> be<00:02:01.109> sure<00:02:01.289> you're

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
technique and they can be sure you're

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.190
