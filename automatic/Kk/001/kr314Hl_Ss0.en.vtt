 i 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.270
 Hello everyone, today I bring you a 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.150
 summary of the readings I did in 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.570
 March what I'm sure I'll read in 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.670
 April and some news in March I just 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.740
 I've read three books but I'm pretty 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.510
 happy because I thought I was not going to 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.060
 reach that figure since the first 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:29.020
 week I did not read anything was a kind 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.559
 of literary zliten and I did not feel like 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.510
 nothing read until I picked up nine rules 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.600
 to break to conquer a rogue 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 from jarama the link that I made 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.720
 review and it was my first reading is a 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:49.810
 book a pretty light story is from 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:52.030
 historical roman of the 19th century and was going to 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.480
 be a little more fun a little more 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.300
 entertaining and something more spicy but 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.390
 fell on all the topics that you can 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.170
 imagine in a romance story 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.430
 historic where he 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.890
 He is a libertine and she is a prude 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.830
 27 year old spinster and wants 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.710
 experience a little Christmas of all 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.060
 ways so it made me smile pretty 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.940
 and sometimes I let out some laughter and such 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.830
 that if you like this kind of novels 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.689
 I guess maybe ye can 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.970
 enjoy the second book that I 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.240
 it ended was death in the clouds of 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.250
 agatha christie I'm doing a challenge 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.710
 participating in a challenge on the blog 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.229
 because I really like to read books 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.450
 mystery but last year I did not read cast 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.429
 and that because I look a bit so 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.020
 I said with the quality of books that have 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.240
 arrival of agatha christie we are going to 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.049
 get to it and I'm already noticing the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.360
 addiction to this author this book is 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.860
 as the title says died in the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.070
 clouds 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.700
 it is a murder on a plane in 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.640
 who is able but how he feels very 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.760
 It's wrong to travel by plane because it's a lot 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.390
 of the things that happen 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.750
 and despite having registered the novel 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.690
 in 1935 from the feeling that it was a 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.200
 novel of the 70s because there was 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.100
 with those who snort cocaine 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.950
 hairdressers in the same department and 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.110
 planes and I do not know I do not know 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.440
 but I liked it anyway 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.269
 I enjoyed of course the review of this 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.000
 I did on the block so you also 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.940
 I'll leave it in the information box 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.640
 the review the third and last book that 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.250
 I read it was the beat clair and the city 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.540
 of the dead of Sara great this also 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.940
 is the review on the blog and look super 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.040
 ultra mega enchanted if you have it in 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.930
 your stack of books by reading by reading 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.810
 if you have the library slow if not 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.530
 have a friend who lends it to you 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.920
 it is quite entertaining at least the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.920
 truth is that I did not expect much 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.530
 simply because I wanted to continue 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.349
 reading books like this from murders and 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.140
 mysteries and this one was about it because 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:24.269
 claire de bits is the best detective in the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.480
 world according to herself and from why 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.879
 do not 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.780
 I was very surprised, I really liked the 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.640
 author 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:38.890
 this book conjugates the classic souls 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:44.860
 tortured old and dark of the 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:48.520
 classic black novels with 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.280
 the news and new orleans that is the 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.940
 city ​​of the dead after 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.060

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.010
