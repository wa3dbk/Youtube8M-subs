00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:10.930
 We won the 7th block final and were successfully entered the main tournament 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:13.269

 It was a hot battle at 142 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:24.050
 The other party is Takahama Aiko girls style third grade 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.270

 That's right Cho board 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.410
 Wow I thought it was a little difficult 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:41.649
 It is easy to stab so it can lead 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.649
 I feel like it's gone 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:52.200
 Iino-san will be the first tournament in five years 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:56.010
 Last time I was a hot spring as an amateur player and I was giving up 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.660
 In this place where licked the outlet as a residence jockey 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.829
 Psychologically 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.890
 I wonder if there is a place to say underground ? 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.890
 I agree 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.890

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.369
 Well yes reaction is interesting and 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.369
 is 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:25.570
 Affect the lottery to decide the match 1 head of the main draw tournament after this is done 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:30.070
 Even though just at the moment I'm conditions that do not know the state in which the opponents do not know 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.369
 I also want to show what kind of victory to the fans in the main draw tournament 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.369

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:48.030

 Some probably Well edition towards such of than Tteyuu myself for the Iino Mr. 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.670
 I am not good at the end of the game 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.880
 In such a way that outrun and well in the early stages 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.690
