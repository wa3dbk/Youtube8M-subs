00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 good day welcome to another video of 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.930
 hobby world today we are going to be 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.990
 teaching what is the new t max 3.3 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.480
 this already comes with the new radio control 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.570
 of 2.4 and a hertz which will give us 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.049
 lower interference greater range and more 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.049
 fun 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.650
 all right 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.270
 you 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:40.050
 as we already know there is a max 2.5 and a 3.3 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.880
 this is the version with the 3.3 engine is 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.490
 more powerful has traction at four 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.250
 wheels 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.900
 because it is a truck is enough 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.900
 good if you want to start in the world of 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.060
 radio control with pickup trucks 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.130
 gasoline is one of the best and most 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.130
 recommendable that are commercial 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.039
 in the package will already include everything 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.260
 what do you need to start running what 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.420
 only that does not include gasoline and 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.709
 double batteries for control without 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.080
 But it comes with what is the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.030
 electronic starter comes with the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.459
 bottle to fill the tank 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.860
 fuel comes now like this with everything 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.290
 what do you need that is a pretty package 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.299
 complete and as I mentioned a while ago 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.280
 has a new wii control that in 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.830
 If you want, you can put 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.170
 then there is a there is an accessory that 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.360
 you can connect the ipad to put it 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.000
 sensors to the truck and they tell you 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.739
 the speed the engine temperature and 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.340
 other data that are also 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.340
 important 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.219
 do not 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.660
 good as we can see this truck 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.160
 4x4 has four-wheel drive 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.660
 it has a pretty powerful engine that 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.920
 it's going to be arriving about 60 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.490
 kilometers per hour that's pretty 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.200
 decent and by the same power has what 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.750
 which is a willy bar for when 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.880
 you accelerate fast that he will not flip 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.370
 the truck has a bar carburetor 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.710
 pretty stable then you when 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.990
 the carbure well you do not have to move 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.210
 as much as in competition engines 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.310
 also the digital servel then is 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.290
 very good very good to be good we 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.330
 had problems with our servos without 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.040
 But there are people who prefer to put 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.840
 a more powerful zero 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.370
 the truck has what is a 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.680
 automatic transmission of two 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.000
 Adjustable speeds the post adjust 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.489
 to make the change first 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.439
 second quicker you do not have to 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.239
 do on the radio but alone is going to 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.819
 do you also can put 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.310
 option to reverse this charge not 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.959
 brings original reverse then you can 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.579
 also use with this option and the 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.780
 shock absorbers bring what is oil to 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.140
 base of 5 for 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.080
 to be cushioning everything that they are 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.480
 the mouths the falls the brincos is 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.700
 important after a certain time of 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.050
 use give it your maintenance here in the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.950
 hobby world we can give you maintenance 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.690
 to these vans or all of you what 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.370
 can investigate and that's something 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.370
 entertaining that you can do as a family 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.890
 the advantage of gasoline cars is 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.330
 that when gasoline is determined 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.880
 you can put it more immediately 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.130
 while you have separate in the 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.110
 electric you do not have that option 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.150
 you need to change the battery and when 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.430
 you're running out you have to recharge it and that 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.530
 lasted a while this truck is walking 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.230
 lasting about nine minutes more or 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:56.070
 less in depending on your habit of 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.840
 driving with a gas tank what 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.030
 We recommend you take the gallon 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.740
 also to be putting him and giving him a 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.230
 rest after about two or three 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.650
 Cumshot so that it does not get so hot 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.710
 the engine as I have told the 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.280
 gasoline cars if they need more 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.920
 keeping one east 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.600
 well this has been all for today 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.490
