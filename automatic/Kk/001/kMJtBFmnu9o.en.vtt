00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.790
 recipe that was also from my house very 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.470

 pear with plums with whatever you want 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.279
 important is that we learn to do 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.110
 this mass as we have flour here that 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.050
 let's put a pinch of salt 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.790
 it is always so far from the yeast or 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.940
 of the leavening powders that's why I'm going to 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.210
 mix with the flour now if I can 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.870

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.350

 I actually have the gems because with 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.710
 the whites I made beat them to the point of 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.079
 snow that I have here and you have to 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.950
 put in the end and I have here laws I will 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.950
 incorporate milk 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.150
 We will always integrate when you go 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.130
 making these preparations from inside 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.619
 outward and you're grabbing a little bit 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.040
 little the dry ones that are around you see 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.780
 how am I doing 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.780

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.480
 we will incorporate clear that the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.130
 clear because they will integrate air and 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.320
 that will leave me much more aired 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.140
 thicker and because the baking powder 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.010
 for the same function because I want that 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.230
