00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.080 
rotation at El Lido elbow and the pinch
and<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.290> pulling<00:00:52.740> the<00:00:53.040> pinch<00:00:53.340> back<00:00:53.610> together

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and then pulling the pinch back together

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.360 
and then pulling the pinch back together
again<00:00:54.240> because<00:00:54.990> what's<00:00:55.170> very<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.860> what's

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
again because what's very was what's

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.470 
again because what's very was what's
important<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.360> understand<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:59.480> when

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
important to understand is that when

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.720 
important to understand is that when
this<00:01:00.690> when<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.500> shoulders<00:01:02.220> pulling<00:01:02.579> around

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
this when this shoulders pulling around

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.260 
this when this shoulders pulling around
when<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.120> gap<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.420> being<00:01:04.460> pulled<00:01:05.460> over<00:01:05.759> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
when this gap is being pulled over the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.330 
when this gap is being pulled over the
around<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.689> ribcage<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.530> finish<00:01:07.829> that<00:01:08.009> throw

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
around the ribcage to finish that throw

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.850 
around the ribcage to finish that throw
it's<00:01:08.970> working<00:01:09.509> against<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:09.990> opposites<00:01:10.590> cap

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it's working against this opposites cap

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.770 
it's working against this opposites cap
so<00:01:11.399> you're<00:01:11.549> trying<00:01:11.759> to<00:01:11.880> pull<00:01:12.329> them<00:01:12.569> back

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
so you're trying to pull them back

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.989 
so you're trying to pull them back
together<00:01:12.990> again<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:14.069> don't<00:01:14.249> hang<00:01:14.429> around<00:01:14.609> out

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:14.999 
together again you don't hang around out

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:19.039 
together again you don't hang around out
here<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.659> want<00:01:17.359> because<00:01:18.359> i<00:01:18.479> covered<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.840> key

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
here you want because i covered the key

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.559 
here you want because i covered the key
points<00:01:19.469> that<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.249> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.579> make<00:01:20.789> okay

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
points that I want to make okay

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.899 
points that I want to make okay
developing<00:01:22.409> good<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:22.799> action<00:01:23.219> is<00:01:23.460> simply<00:01:23.880> a

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709
