really don't like is they've added an

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.690 
really don't like is they've added an
ingredient<00:01:03.090> called<00:01:03.680> ethyl<00:01:04.680> hexyl<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.309> Hetzel

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
ingredient called ethyl hexyl or Hetzel

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.070 
ingredient called ethyl hexyl or Hetzel
hex<00:01:05.880> though<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.210> don't<00:01:06.270> know<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.540> exactly<00:01:06.840> you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
hex though I don't know how exactly you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.190 
hex though I don't know how exactly you
say<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.820> palmitate<00:01:09.750> or

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
say it but it is a palmitate or

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.170 
say it but it is a palmitate or
palmitate<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.189> will<00:01:11.490> Google<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.850> thing<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
palmitate I will Google this thing and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.250 
palmitate I will Google this thing and
told<00:01:12.299> me<00:01:12.360> how<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> say<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:12.960> give<00:01:13.140> us

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
told me how to say it and it's give us

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.289 
told me how to say it and it's give us
both<00:01:13.470> ways<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.979> either<00:01:14.549> way<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.850> assume<00:01:15.150> is

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
both ways so either way I assume is

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.460 
both ways so either way I assume is
correct<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.840> think<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.140> depends<00:01:16.380> on

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
correct I do think it just depends on

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.899 
correct I do think it just depends on
how<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.710> pronounce<00:01:16.890> things<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
how you pronounce things and then the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.020 
how you pronounce things and then the
other<00:01:18.090> ingredient<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.689> Laurel<00:01:19.820> lysine<00:01:20.820> or

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
other ingredient is Laurel lysine or

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.450 
other ingredient is Laurel lysine or
life-sign<00:01:21.689> I'm<00:01:21.930> not<00:01:22.140> sure<00:01:22.409> I'm<00:01:23.009> gonna<00:01:23.189> hold<00:01:23.369> it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
life-sign I'm not sure I'm gonna hold it

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.469 
life-sign I'm not sure I'm gonna hold it
up<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.670> point<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.970> ingredients<00:01:24.180> really

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
up and point to the ingredients really

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.030

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
feeling it though I tried this for a

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.560 
feeling it though I tried this for a
couple<00:03:09.690> days<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.820> within<00:03:11.820> two<00:03:12.210> or<00:03:12.330> three<00:03:12.420> days

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
couple days and within two or three days

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.030
