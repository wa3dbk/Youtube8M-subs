welcome to learn about tech and today

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.849 
welcome to learn about tech and today
we're<00:00:02.429> gonna<00:00:02.520> be<00:00:02.639> looking<00:00:02.850> at<00:00:03.149> how<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.859> get

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
we're gonna be looking at how to get

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.020 
we're gonna be looking at how to get
dual<00:00:05.250> screen<00:00:05.700> on<00:00:05.970> your<00:00:06.210> laptop<00:00:06.660> or<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.899> computer

dual screen capability is very easy is
very<00:00:11.400> handful<00:00:12.120> if<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.870> like<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.620> multitask

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
very handful if you like to multitask

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.340 
very handful if you like to multitask
for<00:00:14.880> example<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.299> one<00:00:15.360> screen<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.960> could<00:00:16.139> be

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
for example on one screen you could be

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.590

looking<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.460> watch<00:00:17.699> videos<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
looking you can watch videos on the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.900 
looking you can watch videos on the
second<00:00:18.930> screen<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.560> could<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:20.100> typing<00:00:20.640> up<00:00:20.789> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
second screen you could be typing up a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.150 
second screen you could be typing up a
research<00:00:21.150> paper<00:00:21.359> or<00:00:21.650> anything<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.890> want<00:00:23.070> to

to<00:00:44.780> look<00:00:44.930> for<00:00:45.199> a<00:00:45.530> output<00:00:46.570> such<00:00:47.570> as<00:00:47.809> this<00:00:48.110> this

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
to look for a output such as this this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.340 
to look for a output such as this this
is<00:00:48.530> a<00:00:48.559> VGA<00:00:49.010> output<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:50.149> most<00:00:50.329> laptops<00:00:50.540> fpga

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
is a VGA output the most laptops fpga

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.630 
is a VGA output the most laptops fpga
some<00:00:52.280> newer<00:00:52.519> computers<00:00:53.030> have<00:00:53.239> a<00:00:53.269> DVI<00:00:53.870> output

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
some newer computers have a DVI output

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.740 
some newer computers have a DVI output
now<00:00:55.640> basically<00:00:55.850> what<00:00:56.329> you're<00:00:56.449> going<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.600> do

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
now basically what you're going to do

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.780 
now basically what you're going to do
with<00:00:56.870> this<00:00:57.110> output<00:00:57.649> is<00:00:57.829> that<00:00:58.129> you're<00:00:58.370> going<00:00:58.579> to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
with this output is that you're going to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.750 
with this output is that you're going to
find<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.180> cable<00:00:59.659> from<00:01:00.050> your<00:01:00.649> second<00:01:01.280> monitor

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
find a cable from your second monitor

find a cable from your second monitor
and<00:01:01.940> you're<00:01:02.269> going<00:01:02.449> to<00:01:02.510> plug<00:01:02.719> it<00:01:02.870> in<00:01:02.989> here

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.970 

over<00:01:07.720> here<00:01:07.840> you<00:01:07.930> can<00:01:08.080> see<00:01:08.230> I<00:01:08.260> have<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:08.650> VGA

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
over here you can see I have to VGA

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.400 
over here you can see I have to VGA
outputs<00:01:09.460> now<00:01:09.550> DVI<00:01:10.120> outputs<00:01:10.270> are<00:01:10.930> usually

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
outputs now DVI outputs are usually

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.620 
outputs now DVI outputs are usually
white<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:11.950> instead<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.060> pointy<00:01:13.420> things

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
white and instead of the pointy things

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.040 
white and instead of the pointy things
they<00:01:13.840> have<00:01:13.990> bars<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.830> if<00:01:15.820> your<00:01:16.180> computer<00:01:16.840> or

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
they have bars and if your computer or

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.740 
they have bars and if your computer or
laptop<00:01:17.230> comes<00:01:17.800> with<00:01:18.040> only<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:18.340> DVI<00:01:18.790> output<00:01:19.570> you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
laptop comes with only a DVI output you

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.590 
laptop comes with only a DVI output you
would<00:01:19.900> have<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.140> buy<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.560> VGA<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.640> DVI<00:01:21.940> converter

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
would have to buy a VGA to DVI converter

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.800 
would have to buy a VGA to DVI converter
converter<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.590> it'll<00:01:24.340> cost<00:01:24.490> a<00:01:24.670> few<00:01:24.880> dollars

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
cord and the VGA output now you're gonna

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.850 
cord and the VGA output now you're gonna
want<00:01:43.230> to<00:01:43.320> put<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:43.950> cords<00:01:44.280> inside<00:01:45.590> make<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.740> so

then after you're going to want to put

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:03.920 
then after you're going to want to put
the<00:01:54.990> power<00:01:55.200> cord<00:01:55.530> inside<00:02:02.270> now<00:02:03.270> after<00:02:03.570> all<00:02:03.690> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the power cord inside now after all that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.020 
the power cord inside now after all that
you're<00:02:04.500> going<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.920> want<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.370> connect<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you're going to want to connect the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.230 
you're going to want to connect the
power<00:02:06.180> cord<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.990> other<00:02:07.110> end<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.920> a

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
power cord the other end of it to a

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
power cord the other end of it to a
output<00:02:09.240> an<00:02:09.750> outlet

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.899 

now<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.349> next<00:02:14.620> step<00:02:14.799> is<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.159> connect<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.700> VGA

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
now the next step is to connect the VGA

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.360 
now the next step is to connect the VGA
to<00:02:16.150> output<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:17.140> other<00:02:17.349> one<00:02:17.560> onto<00:02:18.010> your<00:02:18.159> laptop

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
to output the other one onto your laptop

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.270 
to output the other one onto your laptop
into<00:02:19.000> your<00:02:19.150> laptop<00:02:19.409> like<00:02:20.409> so<00:02:20.650> now<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.069> have<00:02:21.190> to

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
into your laptop like so now you have to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.460 
into your laptop like so now you have to
notice<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.760> most<00:02:22.480> laptops<00:02:22.750> do<00:02:23.080> not<00:02:23.230> come

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
notice that most laptops do not come

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.320 
notice that most laptops do not come
with<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.860> extra<00:02:24.459> bars<00:02:24.670> on<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> side<00:02:25.299> that

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
with the extra bars on the side that

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.839 
with the extra bars on the side that
securely<00:02:26.110> fastens<00:02:26.769> it<00:02:27.010> all<00:02:27.159> into<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.489> laptop

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
securely fastens it all into the laptop

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.309 
securely fastens it all into the laptop
so<00:02:28.510> you're<00:02:28.629> just<00:02:28.720> gonna<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.080> make<00:02:29.260> do

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
so you're just gonna have to make do

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.220 
so you're just gonna have to make do
make<00:02:32.319> sure<00:02:32.349> it's<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.680> there<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:34.049> after<00:02:35.049> that

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
make sure it's in there and after that

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.750 
make sure it's in there and after that
we're<00:02:35.530> gonna<00:02:35.620> go<00:02:35.860> into<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.129> computer

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.240 

now<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.599> final<00:02:41.140> step<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.709> make<00:02:41.830> sure<00:02:41.890> that

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
now the final step is to make sure that

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.580 
now the final step is to make sure that
your<00:02:42.400> computer<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.879> displayed<00:02:43.390> is<00:02:43.629> optimized

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
your computer is displayed is optimized

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.970 
your computer is displayed is optimized
for<00:02:44.860> dual<00:02:45.670> screen<00:02:46.120> capability<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:47.230> you're<00:02:47.890> on

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
for dual screen capability if you're on

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.649 
for dual screen capability if you're on
Windows<00:02:48.250> 7<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.640> want<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.879> right-click<00:02:49.060> and

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
Windows 7 you want to right-click and

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.309 
Windows 7 you want to right-click and
then<00:02:50.230> find<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.739> screen<00:02:51.069> resolution<00:02:52.110> over<00:02:53.110> here

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
then find a screen resolution over here

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.140 
then find a screen resolution over here
basically<00:02:53.530> shows<00:02:53.830> you<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.310> number<00:02:54.730> displays

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
basically shows you the number displays

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.140 
basically shows you the number displays
you<00:02:55.330> have<00:02:55.540> now<00:02:56.349> if<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.980> second<00:02:57.700> monitor<00:02:57.940> is

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
you have now if the second monitor is
