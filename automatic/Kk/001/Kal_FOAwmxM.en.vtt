00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
movement sometimes I'll put this there's

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.870 
movement sometimes I'll put this there's
plenty<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.860> other<00:04:23.070> moves<00:04:23.400> out<00:04:23.520> there<00:04:23.700> that's

plenty of other moves out there that's

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.220 
plenty of other moves out there that's
probably<00:04:24.000> better<00:04:24.330> than<00:04:24.570> this<00:04:24.720> but<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:25.080> one

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
probably better than this but this one

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.220 
probably better than this but this one
was<00:04:25.410> kind<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.650> cheap<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.910> don't<00:04:27.780> really<00:04:27.990> use

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
was kind of cheap and I don't really use

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.570 
it often anyways I mean I don't even
need<00:04:30.480> to<00:04:30.540> really<00:04:30.870> use<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.200> now<00:04:31.440> because<00:04:31.770> I

dry<00:06:05.340> nicely<00:06:05.910> and<00:06:06.440> like<00:06:07.440> I<00:06:07.470> said<00:06:07.770> sometimes

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
dry nicely and like I said sometimes

dry nicely and like I said sometimes
it's<00:06:08.430> not<00:06:08.550> all<00:06:08.700> the<00:06:08.760> time<00:06:08.910> that<00:06:09.030> I<00:06:09.060> used

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
it's not all the time that I used

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.500 
it's not all the time that I used
like<00:06:10.160> sometimes<00:06:10.639> the<00:06:10.880> next<00:06:11.060> thing<00:06:11.270> I<00:06:11.389> would

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
like sometimes the next thing I would

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.480 
like sometimes the next thing I would
probably<00:06:11.660> do<00:06:12.169> if<00:06:12.770> I'm<00:06:12.889> going<00:06:12.919> outside

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
probably do if I'm going outside

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.490 
probably do if I'm going outside
if<00:06:13.610> i'm<00:06:13.730> going<00:06:13.880> outside<00:06:14.060> and<00:06:14.330> it's<00:06:14.480> cold<00:06:15.020> then

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
if i'm going outside and it's cold then

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.050 
if i'm going outside and it's cold then
i'm<00:06:15.650> gonna<00:06:15.800> probably<00:06:15.980> blow<00:06:16.250> dry<00:06:16.550> it<00:06:16.580> put<00:06:17.000> a

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
i'm gonna probably blow dry it put a

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.490 
i'm gonna probably blow dry it put a
little<00:06:17.120> heat<00:06:17.360> on<00:06:17.419> it<00:06:17.630> just<00:06:17.780> to<00:06:17.840> dry<00:06:18.290> up<00:06:18.410> a

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500
