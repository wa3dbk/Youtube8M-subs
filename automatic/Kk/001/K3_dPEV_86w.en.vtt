00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello everyone you see yourself in a new video 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.750
 finally I did it I did it to 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.000
 sign another video diy i like them 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.639
 you know very well to tell the truth 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.679
 who likes alpha bank to you but unfortunately 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.260
 for reasons of time it is difficult 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.890
 record one each week as 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.300
 I would like to 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.300
 maybe a video immediately of air one on 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.820
 mobile sounded good but I have it 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.650
 I made it and I like it 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.980
 I have a lot of this video 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.030
 above all ideas and there are three thousand in 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.040
 trouble for let's say better organize the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.739
 your room your things like i 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.320
 enamels also arrange themselves then I 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.899
 mentally make a list for you will see 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.809
 all in the video I really hope that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.969
 you like it and if you do them something since 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.629
 diy of those I showed you in 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.730
 video 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.520
 I recommend or nicked on instagram 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.170
 ovi mentioned on instagram retirees 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 on twitter however you do to get 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.579
 I do not know this photo or by e-mail 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.379
 there is also my email below if if you 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.090
 it can therefore affect the juice of the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.700
 speech is the others your photos 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.549
 because I am very curious to see how 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.350
 let's say recreate the lines that you 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.619
 I propose I leave you with the video he has 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.330
 better blasi he gave too much and for 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.030
 this bracelets holder you will need 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.070
 of a paper towel roll a candle holder 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.950
 cost of hot glue and paint 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.100
 spray spray the spray paint onto mine 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.500
 paper towel roll and then I go to that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.720
 hot glue to put it on every time 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.630
 cinnamon and attack your disagreement xa 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.790
 really easy as diy but like 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.270
 you can see it turned out very much 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.270
 cute 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.890
 this display for enamels you will have 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.620
 need polystyrene a knife 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.140
 of the very thin paper beginning 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.420
 drawing a line on polystyrene e 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.580
 then that knife going to note 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.680
 cut out the polystyrene and state 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.600
 beware of these passives with whom my father 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.130
 I also had fun but then I am 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.040
 difficult to clean 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.530
 and since enough glazes I'm going to do 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.900
 also another level where however 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.760
 you can make it cover the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.130
 polystyrene with my card that can 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.890
 also very well to be wrapping paper 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.780
 just like a gift and then 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.880
 I'm going to overlap the two levels one 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.610
 over the other place also paste them 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.890
 as you can see it is the exhibitor for 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.780
 very nice enamels but above all very 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.780
 economic is very easy to do 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.099
 to achieve this very simple to 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.870
 the least you will need a rinco world vi 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.959
 I leave the link below in the info box a 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.580
 marker for glass and a frame 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.160
 start by cutting my clint a wall and 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.040
 simply by inserting it into the frame 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.110
 and then of course with my marker for 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.000
 the veto I can go to write how many 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.459
 times will want all the common things that 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.989
 I have to do and then obviously check areva 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.989
 when I did them 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.650
 it finally went finally after so much 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.660
 time that could not be seen 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.250
 ok i'm doing the nice go to them 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.690
 that's enough 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.180
 I hope so much for video there is 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.640
 liked that you found these useful 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.290
 to reorganize your stuff a little 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.510
 because I have to say that it happens often 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.450
 I also had so many things I don't know where 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.280
 also put them in order to make them 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.860
 to be nice because if you are ugly 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.270
 so they really suck 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.730
 so let's say these in my opinion 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.130
 they are simple but really very nice 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.930
 and nothing splits I liked myself 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.630
 I recommend and leave them a thumbs up 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:17.470
