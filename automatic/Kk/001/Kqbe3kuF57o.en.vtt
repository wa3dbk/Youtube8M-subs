this ball matte lipstick in vivid coral

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.680 
this ball matte lipstick in vivid coral
and<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.459> think<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:17.090> actually<00:02:17.269> looks

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
and I think this actually looks

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.160 
and I think this actually looks
quite<00:02:17.840> alike<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.380> hers<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:20.540> I'm<00:02:20.690> down<00:02:20.930> with<00:02:20.959> a

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
quite alike to hers so I'm down with a

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.050 
quite alike to hers so I'm down with a
look<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:21.590> it's<00:02:21.799> really<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.220> my<00:02:22.430> usual<00:02:22.640> look

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
look and it's really not my usual look

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.729 
look and it's really not my usual look
but<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.450> think<00:02:23.720> it's<00:02:23.810> something<00:02:23.989> interesting

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
but I think it's something interesting

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.210 
but I think it's something interesting
definitely<00:02:25.370> more<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:26.150> sharp<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.230> more<00:02:27.709> classy

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
definitely more a sharp and more classy

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.130 
definitely more a sharp and more classy
than<00:02:28.250> my<00:02:28.489> usual<00:02:28.670> Maktoob<00:02:29.299> see<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.930> think

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
than my usual Maktoob see I think

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.660 
than my usual Maktoob see I think
burnished<00:02:30.470> look<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.130> next<00:02:34.310> look<00:02:34.519> I'm

so I'm using the thin side and when I

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.580 
so I'm using the thin side and when I
reach<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.760> end<00:03:01.970> all<00:03:02.480> I'm<00:03:02.690> reducing<00:03:03.230> is<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
reach the end all I'm reducing is the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.240 
reach the end all I'm reducing is the
flat<00:03:03.829> side<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.340> finish<00:03:05.090> out<00:03:05.650> slightly<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:07.069> go

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
well and I think you just need a lot a

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.400 
well and I think you just need a lot a
lot<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.150> practice<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.780> tried<00:03:35.050> to<00:03:35.140> keep<00:03:35.260> my

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
lot of practice and tried to keep my

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.559 
lot of practice and tried to keep my
steady<00:03:35.680> hand<00:03:35.800> and<00:03:36.370> some<00:03:36.550> people<00:03:36.849> say<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.450> know

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
steady hand and some people say you know

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.059 
steady hand and some people say you know
start<00:03:37.870> from<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.140> middle<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.500> goal<00:03:38.800> but<00:03:39.010> I

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
start from the middle and goal but I

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.620 
start from the middle and goal but I
always<00:03:39.250> typically<00:03:39.880> go<00:03:40.060> from<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.390> inner

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
always typically go from the inner

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.729 
always typically go from the inner
corner<00:03:40.989> of<00:03:41.080> my<00:03:41.200> eyes

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
corner of my eyes

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.710 
corner of my eyes
of<00:03:41.920> course<00:03:42.220> I'm<00:03:42.310> good<00:03:42.489> eyeliner<00:03:42.790> helps<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.510> lot

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
of course I'm good eyeliner helps a lot

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.930 
of course I'm good eyeliner helps a lot
so<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.410> think<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:45.040> lot<00:03:45.160> of<00:03:45.220> people<00:03:45.520> give<00:03:45.790> up

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
so I think a lot of people give up

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.699 
so I think a lot of people give up
because<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.480> eyeliners<00:03:46.930> not<00:03:47.110> good<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.590> this

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
because the eyeliners not good and this

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.890 
because the eyeliners not good and this
module<00:03:48.250> it's<00:03:49.090> good<00:03:49.330> if<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.480> start<00:03:49.810> out<00:03:49.870> with

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
module it's good if you start out with

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.809 
module it's good if you start out with
good<00:03:50.230> eyeliner<00:03:50.680> that's<00:03:51.160> really<00:03:51.550> really<00:03:51.730> easy

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
good eyeliner that's really really easy

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.330 
good eyeliner that's really really easy
to<00:03:52.150> use<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.080> is<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.380> final<00:03:53.739> look<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.099> as

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
to use so this is the final look and as

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.490 
to use so this is the final look and as
you<00:03:54.459> can<00:03:54.640> see<00:03:54.849> the<00:03:55.060> lips<00:03:55.300> are<00:03:55.569> very<00:03:55.989> very

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
you can see the lips are very very

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.259 
you can see the lips are very very
distinctive<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.250> kept<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:57.640> eye<00:03:57.670> makeup

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
need to have it very very fine cuz it

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.440 
need to have it very very fine cuz it
needs<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.710> be<00:04:41.830> finer<00:04:42.100> than<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.580> other<00:04:42.760> tip<00:04:43.090> so

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
needs to be finer than the other tip so

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.110 
needs to be finer than the other tip so
I'm<00:04:43.570> gonna<00:04:43.720> be<00:04:43.900> using<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.380> 0.01<00:04:45.340> side<00:04:45.580> so<00:04:46.000> the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
I'm gonna be using the 0.01 side so the

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.850 
I'm gonna be using the 0.01 side so the
hypershade<00:04:46.419> weak<00:04:46.750> eyeliner<00:04:47.169> is<00:04:47.320> really<00:04:47.650> good

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
hypershade weak eyeliner is really good

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.470 
hypershade weak eyeliner is really good
because<00:04:48.220> it<00:04:48.430> has<00:04:48.580> both<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:49.120> thick<00:04:49.360> side<00:04:49.660> and

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
because it has both the thick side and

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.930 
because it has both the thick side and
