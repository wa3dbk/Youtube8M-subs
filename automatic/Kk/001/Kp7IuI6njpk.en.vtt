00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
here there we go and just a lot for my

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.969 
here there we go and just a lot for my
extended<00:01:39.509> mags<00:01:39.750> which<00:01:39.930> i<00:01:40.049> actually<00:01:40.290> might<00:01:40.740> put

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
extended mags which i actually might put

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.039 
extended mags which i actually might put
on<00:01:41.100> because<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.610> clip<00:01:41.820> size<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.299> isn't

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.830 
on because the clip size with this isn't
the<00:01:43.259> greatest<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:44.070> decent<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.509> could<00:01:45.750> be

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the greatest it's decent but it could be

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.460 
the greatest it's decent but it could be
better<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.979> i<00:01:47.009> might<00:01:47.399> put<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.409> there's<00:01:49.409> a

well with this tend to work really well
with<00:02:29.990> everything<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:31.190> got<00:02:31.220> lightweight<00:02:32.090> and

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
with everything I got lightweight and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.350 
with everything I got lightweight and
cool<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.110> ghost<00:02:33.890> says<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.790> then<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:35.030> can<00:02:35.210> move

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
cool and ghost says so then I can move

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.540

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
quickly and stay off the map when

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.840 
quickly and stay off the map when
somebody<00:02:37.940> gets<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.420> UAV<00:02:38.870> then<00:02:39.500> i<00:02:39.530> also<00:02:39.620> have<00:02:40.160> a

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
somebody gets a UAV then i also have a

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.360 
somebody gets a UAV then i also have a
toughness<00:02:41.690> so<00:02:42.230> then<00:02:42.410> there's<00:02:42.590> less<00:02:42.830> flinch

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
toughness so then there's less flinch

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.360 
toughness so then there's less flinch
when<00:02:43.490> i<00:02:43.700> shoot<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.650> dexterity<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:46.010> i<00:02:46.070> can<00:02:46.250> get

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
when i shoot and dexterity so i can get

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.520 
when i shoot and dexterity so i can get
my<00:02:46.459> gun<00:02:46.670> up<00:02:46.820> that<00:02:47.270> much<00:02:47.510> quicker<00:02:47.870> don't<00:02:48.350> shoot

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530

seem<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:55.970> remember<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.959> name<00:02:56.990> KSG<00:02:57.740> that's<00:02:57.980> it

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
seem to remember the name KSG that's it

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.140

that's<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.780> KSG<00:02:59.780> all<00:03:00.230> right<00:03:00.730> now<00:03:01.730> hopefully<00:03:01.910> I

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
that's it KSG all right now hopefully I

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.930 
that's it KSG all right now hopefully I
can<00:03:02.420> work<00:03:02.959> these<00:03:03.170> spawns<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.190> then<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.580> works

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
can work these spawns so then it works

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.720 
can work these spawns so then it works
for<00:03:05.090> my<00:03:05.180> benefit<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.990> might<00:03:06.920> take<00:03:07.220> your<00:03:07.550> gun

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.670 
instead because i don't like shotguns
shotguns<00:03:10.730> never<00:03:10.970> seemed<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.330> work<00:03:11.540> for<00:03:11.780> me<00:03:11.930> so

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
shotguns never seemed to work for me so

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.850 
shotguns never seemed to work for me so
getting<00:03:13.040> them<00:03:13.250> diamond<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.820> going<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.180> suck

getting them diamond is going to suck
but<00:03:15.860> i<00:03:15.890> do<00:03:16.010> plan<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:17.470> scavenger<00:03:18.470> definitely

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
but i do plan to scavenger definitely

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.430 
but i do plan to scavenger definitely
might<00:03:19.190> help<00:03:19.340> too<00:03:19.519> since<00:03:19.850> i<00:03:19.970> did<00:03:20.239> just<00:03:20.510> run<00:03:21.140> out

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
might help too since i did just run out

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.280 
might help too since i did just run out
of<00:03:21.500> ammo<00:03:21.950> not<00:03:22.220> too<00:03:22.519> long<00:03:22.730> ago<00:03:22.840> man<00:03:23.840> there's<00:03:24.080> so

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
of ammo not too long ago man there's so

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.110 
of ammo not too long ago man there's so
many<00:03:24.380> things<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:24.800> works<00:03:25.130> so<00:03:25.459> well<00:03:25.489> unlike

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
many things that works so well unlike

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.210 
many things that works so well unlike
everything<00:03:26.570> in<00:03:27.170> this<00:03:27.410> game<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.769> it's<00:03:27.950> such<00:03:28.190> a

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
everything in this game that it's such a

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.590 
everything in this game that it's such a
good<00:03:28.430> job<00:03:29.019> but<00:03:30.250> definitely<00:03:31.250> what<00:03:31.430> works<00:03:31.640> best

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
good job but definitely what works best

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.340 
good job but definitely what works best
grip<00:03:33.320> definitely<00:03:34.250> because<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:35.690> recoil<00:03:36.110> on

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
grip definitely because the recoil on

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.090 
grip definitely because the recoil on
this<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.680> insane<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.519> then<00:03:38.769> silencer<00:03:39.769> cuz

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
this is insane and then silencer cuz

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.310 
this is insane and then silencer cuz
sounds<00:03:40.760> around<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.180> on<00:03:41.510> everything<00:03:42.200> is

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
sounds around and on everything is

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.370 
sounds around and on everything is
really<00:03:42.530> good<00:03:43.120> but<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.360> then<00:03:44.600> stock<00:03:45.140> is<00:03:45.350> a

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
really good but and then stock is a

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.930 
really good but and then stock is a
personal<00:03:45.769> preference<00:03:46.070> you<00:03:46.340> don't<00:03:46.519> need<00:03:46.790> it

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
personal preference you don't need it

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.330 
personal preference you don't need it
but<00:03:47.600> I<00:03:47.660> find<00:03:48.019> it<00:03:48.140> helps<00:03:48.260> just<00:03:48.470> cuz<00:03:48.799> i<00:03:48.830> really

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
but I find it helps just cuz i really

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.810 
but I find it helps just cuz i really
like<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:49.580> strafe<00:03:50.739> just<00:03:51.739> because<00:03:51.890> it's<00:03:52.070> kind<00:03:52.489> of

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
like to strafe just because it's kind of

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.780 
like to strafe just because it's kind of
a<00:03:55.120> reflex<00:03:56.120> now<00:03:56.330> because<00:03:56.660> i<00:03:56.690> do<00:03:56.810> it<00:03:57.049> that<00:03:57.410> much
