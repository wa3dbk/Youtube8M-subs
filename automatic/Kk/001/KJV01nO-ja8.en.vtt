but<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.340> put<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> bag<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.600> there<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
but I put the bag in there because the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.180 
but I put the bag in there because the
material<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.430> suede<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:52.050> attracts<00:00:52.590> dust<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
material is suede and it attracts dust a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.740 
material is suede and it attracts dust a
lot<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.680> that's<00:00:55.680> why<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.219> put<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> bag<00:00:56.969> day<00:00:57.180> to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
lot so that's why I put the bag day to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.580 
lot so that's why I put the bag day to
minimize<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.780> basically<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.289> all
