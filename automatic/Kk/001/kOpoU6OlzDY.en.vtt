00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 tact is obvious that the team of man 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.410
 ant was the white the helmet the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.809
 disguise the belt everything is dangerous in 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.090
 wrong hands but the greatest danger 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.040
 it's for the robber 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.320
 if the thief activates the pin particles 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.369
 of the belt will be found in what 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.369
 it will look like another world 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:30.770
 creating everything changes when you measure 2 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.300
 centimeters but the most important thing with 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.160
 that size while at another level of the 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.050
 food chain 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.050
 and the ants are very territorial 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.890
 but even of that size the objects 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.180
 exposed to pink particles 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.880
 maintain levels of strength and speed 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.500
 relative to the normal size 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.630
 the ant man has the strength to 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.950
 defeat normal humans and the 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.950
 speed to keep pace 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.680
 said all that 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.850
 the insect population has many 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.670
 advantages over an intruder 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.670
 poison and a variety of secretions 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.550
 two 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.540
 that's why communication is vital 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.370
 helmet of man ant allows 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.210
 communicate with insects and influence 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.210
 allowing them to control them 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.210
 to land 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.570
 but what matters most are the discs 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.520
 ping 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.610
 they were in development when the throne 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.680
 when 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.159
 I designed them to apply and then be 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.109
 activated shrinking the target in theory 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.370
 I thought it would be a non-violent way of 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:03.760
 control super villains 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:07.390
 the discs were not stable yet if they are 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:11.230
 Used white no longer shrink is 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.640
 it turns subatomic in other words it 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.640
 shrinks to cease to exist 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.650
 it is vital that the thief be found and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.940
 stopped before someone leaves 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.870
 hurt the damage that can cause 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:30.069
 beyond imagination please 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.849
 accept the clear case but we charge the 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.849
 half in advance
