another<00:00:53.940> thing<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.020> cool

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
another thing is that I think it's cool

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.439 
another thing is that I think it's cool
as<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.710> 20<00:00:56.309> bucks<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.629> 12<00:00:57.899> T<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:59.449> 26

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
as this is 20 bucks and the 12 T is 26

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.270 
as this is 20 bucks and the 12 T is 26
and<00:01:01.010> this<00:01:02.010> actually<00:01:02.430> comes<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:05.010> can

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and this actually comes with as you can

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.219 
and this actually comes with as you can
see<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.670> pinion<00:01:06.450> gear<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.560> grub<00:01:08.100> screw<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.760> I

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
see a pinion gear and a grub screw so I

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.580 
see a pinion gear and a grub screw so I
thought<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.710> pretty<00:01:11.280> dang<00:01:11.580> cool<00:01:11.909> so

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
thought that was pretty dang cool so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.469 
thought that was pretty dang cool so
because<00:01:13.590> Inc<00:01:14.310> track<00:01:14.670> tracks<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.240> ain't

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
because Inc track tracks this ain't

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.780 
because Inc track tracks this ain't
never<00:01:15.600> given<00:01:15.960> me<00:01:16.110> no<00:01:16.350> pinion<00:01:16.890> gear<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.670> know

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
never given me no pinion gear you know

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.140 
never given me no pinion gear you know
along<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.720> motor<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.729> it's<00:01:20.729> something<00:01:21.119> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
along with the motor so it's something I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.810 
along with the motor so it's something I
think<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.479> really<00:01:21.540> cool<00:01:22.310> oh<00:01:24.350> yes<00:01:25.350> that's<00:01:25.979> about
