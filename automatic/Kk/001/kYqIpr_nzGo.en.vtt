00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
I use the wallpaper pretty much all the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.760 
I use the wallpaper pretty much all the
time<00:00:48.450> at<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> far<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.289> tell<00:00:49.500> there's

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
time at the far as I can tell there's

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.110 
time at the far as I can tell there's
pretty<00:00:49.950> much<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.100> negligible<00:00:50.550> battery<00:00:50.910> drain

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
pretty much a negligible battery drain

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.459 
pretty much a negligible battery drain
which<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.480> big<00:00:51.780> plus<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.230> live<00:00:52.350> wallpaper

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469

depending<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.829> how<00:02:01.950> much<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.219> need<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.430> finger

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
depending on how much you need to finger

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.889 
depending on how much you need to finger
so<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> kind<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.090> throw<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.360> we're<00:02:03.869> just

my full review of this and my garden how

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.880 
my full review of this and my garden how
to<00:02:24.240> customize<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.810> what<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.380> does<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.770> it

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
to customize it what this does is it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.350 
to customize it what this does is it
brings<00:02:25.920> an<00:02:26.220> image<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:26.880> paper<00:02:27.120> like

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
brings an image to your paper like

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.200 
brings an image to your paper like
acetaminophen<00:02:27.840> when<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.890> double<00:02:29.190> tap<00:02:29.340> it

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
acetaminophen when you double tap it

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.790 
acetaminophen when you double tap it
sharpens<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:30.960> so<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.320> can<00:02:31.380> see<00:02:31.650> that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
sharpens it up so you can see that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.430 
sharpens it up so you can see that
normally<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:33.030> dimmed<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.170> colors
