00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.130 

ah

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.140 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.260 

this<00:00:13.770> year<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.130> my<00:00:14.280> driving<00:00:14.550> position<00:00:15.060> in<00:00:15.150> my

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.270 
this year is my driving position in my

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.080 
this year is my driving position in my
racecar<00:00:15.680> it's<00:00:16.680> very<00:00:17.040> much<00:00:17.220> lying<00:00:17.640> down<00:00:17.850> you

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
racecar it's very much lying down you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.370 
racecar it's very much lying down you
know<00:00:18.210> which<00:00:18.360> you<00:00:18.480> can't<00:00:18.690> really<00:00:18.810> imagine<00:00:19.050> from

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
know which you can't really imagine from

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.560 
know which you can't really imagine from
outside<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:19.980> that's<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.280> way<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.640> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
outside but that's the way it is the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.390 
outside but that's the way it is the
feet<00:00:21.779> even<00:00:22.140> go<00:00:22.260> upwards<00:00:22.770> as<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.040> can<00:00:23.190> see

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
feet even go upwards as you can see

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.890 
feet even go upwards as you can see
because<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.880> cockpit<00:00:24.240> goes<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
because the cockpit goes up so the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.109 
because the cockpit goes up so the
pedals<00:00:25.170> are<00:00:25.320> up<00:00:25.440> there<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:26.400> looks<00:00:26.550> strange<00:00:26.820> but

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
pedals are up there it looks strange but

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.910 
pedals are up there it looks strange but
feels<00:00:27.540> quite<00:00:27.840> normal<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.290> it's<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.890> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
feels quite normal and it's not a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.440 
feels quite normal and it's not a
problem<00:00:29.100> it<00:00:29.340> really<00:00:29.580> feels<00:00:29.790> dynamic

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
problem it really feels dynamic

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.670 
problem it really feels dynamic
aggressive<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.050> know<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.290> not<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.500> you're

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
aggressive you know it's not like you're

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.050 
aggressive you know it's not like you're
sleeping<00:00:31.860> in<00:00:32.130> there<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.369> fine<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:38.610> compromise

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
sleeping in there is fine the compromise

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.700 
sleeping in there is fine the compromise
is<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.300> little<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.630> that<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.260> need<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.500> be<00:00:40.590> as

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
is a little bit that you need to be as

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.140 
is a little bit that you need to be as
low<00:00:40.950> as<00:00:41.100> possible<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.670> know<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:42.060> the

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
low as possible you know to get the

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.510 
low as possible you know to get the
center<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.540> gravity<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> car<00:00:43.320> down<00:00:43.520> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
center of gravity in the car down and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
center of gravity in the car down and
then<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.180> always<00:00:45.300> difficult<00:00:45.629> sometimes<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
then it's always difficult sometimes to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.479 
then it's always difficult sometimes to
see<00:00:46.649> where<00:00:46.800> you're<00:00:46.949> going<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.340> you're

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
see where you're going because you're

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.639 
see where you're going because you're
sitting<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:47.969> low<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.300> car<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.109> very<00:00:49.320> often

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
sitting so low in the car so very often

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.110 
sitting so low in the car so very often
I<00:00:49.710> even<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> lean<00:00:50.309> upwards<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:51.030> bit

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
I even have to lean upwards a little bit

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
I even have to lean upwards a little bit
with<00:00:51.239> my<00:00:51.359> head<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:52.109> see<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> corner<00:00:52.800> or

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
with my head to see the corner or

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.979 
with my head to see the corner or
something<00:00:53.190> depending<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.030> where<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.539> am<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
something depending on where I am on the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.880 
something depending on where I am on the
track<00:00:56.000> then<00:00:57.000> also<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.449> making<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> seats

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
track then also the making of the seats

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.950 
track then also the making of the seats
is<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.429> really<00:00:59.910> difficult<00:01:00.329> process<00:01:00.510> because

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
is a really difficult process because

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.549 
is a really difficult process because
the<00:01:01.590> carbon<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.269> is<00:01:03.269> really<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> shape<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the carbon is is really in the shape of

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.000 
the carbon is is really in the shape of
your<00:01:04.620> body<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.290> then<00:01:07.290> obviously<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.860> you're

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
your body and then obviously if you're

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.470 
your body and then obviously if you're
sitting<00:01:08.190> in<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.430> garage<00:01:08.760> or<00:01:08.940> making<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.300> seat

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
sitting in the garage or making the seat

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.760 
sitting in the garage or making the seat
or<00:01:09.600> driving<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:10.050> on<00:01:10.080> track<00:01:10.440> where<00:01:10.650> you're

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
or driving out on track where you're

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.170 
or driving out on track where you're
dynamically<00:01:11.310> driving<00:01:11.700> change<00:01:11.910> in<00:01:12.030> position

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
dynamically driving change in position

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.880 
dynamically driving change in position
it's<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.840> completely<00:01:13.140> different<00:01:13.260> feeling<00:01:13.590> so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
it's a completely different feeling so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.830 
it's a completely different feeling so
all<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> sudden<00:01:14.940> things<00:01:15.120> will<00:01:15.300> be<00:01:15.420> hurting

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
all of a sudden things will be hurting

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.410 
all of a sudden things will be hurting
and<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.950> say<00:01:17.310> okay<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.579> need<00:01:17.700> more<00:01:18.000> support

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and and I say okay I need more support

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.050 
and and I say okay I need more support
here<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.920> more<00:01:20.159> support<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.579> ribs<00:01:20.820> but

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
here and more support on the ribs but

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.399 
here and more support on the ribs but
it's<00:01:21.210> difficult<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.630> do<00:01:21.810> more<00:01:22.049> support

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
it's difficult to do more support

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.590 
it's difficult to do more support
because<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> carbon<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.369> hard<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.360> very

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
because the carbon is so hard so very

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.850 
because the carbon is so hard so very
often<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.259> put<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> little<00:01:25.650> bit<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
often you have to put a little bit of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.190 
often you have to put a little bit of
bits<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.220> foam<00:01:26.430> everywhere<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.810> at<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> same

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
bits of foam everywhere but at the same

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.600 
bits of foam everywhere but at the same
time<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.560> don't<00:01:28.680> want<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> put<00:01:29.009> too<00:01:29.159> much<00:01:29.310> foam

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
time you don't want to put too much foam

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
time you don't want to put too much foam
because<00:01:29.850> foam<00:01:30.149> is<00:01:30.299> very<00:01:30.360> heavy<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.380> want

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
because foam is very heavy and you want

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
because foam is very heavy and you want
to<00:01:31.590> keep<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> seat<00:01:32.009> as<00:01:32.130> light<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.520> possible<00:01:32.549> so

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
to keep the seat as light as possible so

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
to keep the seat as light as possible so
that's<00:01:33.750> an<00:01:33.869> ongoing<00:01:34.229> process<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.220> it's

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that's an ongoing process you know it's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.020 
that's an ongoing process you know it's
very<00:01:35.549> difficult<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.270> find<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.740> optimum<00:01:38.030> now

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
very difficult to find the optimum now

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.460 
very difficult to find the optimum now
I'm<00:01:39.119> gonna<00:01:39.270> take<00:01:39.479> my<00:01:39.540> steering<00:01:40.020> wheel<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.290> well

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
I'm gonna take my steering wheel as well

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.230 
I'm gonna take my steering wheel as well
just<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> show<00:01:41.399> you<00:01:41.460> how<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.670> position<00:01:41.880> is

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
just so you show you how the position is

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.999 
just so you show you how the position is
with<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> steering<00:01:42.780> wheel<00:01:42.810> it's<00:01:43.380> about<00:01:43.560> here

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
with a steering wheel it's about here

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.249 
with a steering wheel it's about here
and<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.060> also<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.329> very<00:01:45.570> very<00:01:45.659> small<00:01:46.200> area
