there
let's<00:01:12.440> do<00:01:12.650> is<00:01:12.770> take<00:01:12.950> your<00:01:13.040> bottle<00:01:13.310> cat<00:01:13.659> put<00:01:14.659> it

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
over and there we go

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.730 
over and there we go
so<00:01:17.450> if<00:01:17.510> also<00:01:17.660> do<00:01:17.870> this<00:01:18.020> again<00:01:18.290> I<00:01:18.500> would<00:01:18.620> have

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
so if also do this again I would have

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.260 
so if also do this again I would have
put<00:01:19.190> this<00:01:19.250> water<00:01:19.460> tape<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.729> little<00:01:19.880> bit<00:01:20.090> lower

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
just so the symbol doesn't sit on the

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.330 
just so the symbol doesn't sit on the
threads<00:01:22.760> but<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.320> put<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.560> on<00:01:24.740> put<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.310> little

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
threads but you put that on put a little

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.469 
threads but you put that on put a little
bit<00:01:25.550> tape<00:01:25.760> on<00:01:25.970> now<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.660> tape<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:27.110> fill<00:01:27.410> and<00:01:28.479> and

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
bit tape on now you tape a fill and and

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.350 
bit tape on now you tape a fill and and
your<00:01:29.600> symbol<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:31.460> you're<00:01:31.610> good<00:01:31.729> to<00:01:31.820> go

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.969 

all<00:01:35.360> right<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:35.810> they<00:01:35.930> show<00:01:36.140> up<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.380> show<00:01:36.650> and

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
all right so they show up to a show and

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.999 
all right so they show up to a show and
you<00:01:37.610> forget<00:01:37.910> your<00:01:38.060> floor<00:01:38.330> tom<00:01:38.570> legs<00:01:38.900> what<00:01:39.800> do

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
you forget your floor tom legs what do

you do
so<00:01:41.090> apparently<00:01:41.330> is<00:01:41.690> really<00:01:42.080> easy<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.410> forget

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
so apparently is really easy to forget

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.350 
so apparently is really easy to forget

user's room stinks now I'll - this is

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.210 
user's room stinks now I'll - this is
super<00:01:51.560> ghetto<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:53.680> really<00:01:54.680> really<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:55.190> know

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
super ghetto and really really you know

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.870 
super ghetto and really really you know
janky<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.030> kind<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.539> stupid<00:01:57.410> looking<00:01:57.950> but

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
janky and kind of stupid looking but

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.359 
janky and kind of stupid looking but
honestly<00:01:59.300> you<00:02:00.200> know<00:02:00.350> it's<00:02:01.009> better<00:02:01.190> than

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
honestly you know it's better than

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.460 
honestly you know it's better than
though<00:02:01.520> for<00:02:01.759> fun<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.509> second<00:02:03.050> option<00:02:03.350> is

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
though for fun so a second option is

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.130 
though for fun so a second option is
actually<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.039> use<00:02:04.070> a<00:02:04.580> boom<00:02:05.240> arm<00:02:05.479> from<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:05.810> cymbal

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
actually to use a boom arm from a cymbal

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.770 
actually to use a boom arm from a cymbal
stand<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.190> let's<00:02:07.369> say<00:02:07.580> you<00:02:07.640> use<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.390> lot<00:02:08.660> of

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
stand so let's say you use a lot of

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.540 
stand so let's say you use a lot of
symbols<00:02:09.140> or<00:02:09.440> let's<00:02:09.649> say<00:02:09.769> there's<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.250> symbol

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
symbols or let's say there's a symbol

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.880 
symbols or let's say there's a symbol
that<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.820> don't<00:02:11.000> use<00:02:11.180> as<00:02:11.450> much<00:02:11.780> let's<00:02:12.680> say<00:02:12.830> you

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
that you don't use as much let's say you

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.009 
that you don't use as much let's say you
can<00:02:13.040> do<00:02:13.130> without<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.430> certain<00:02:13.850> symbol<00:02:14.090> if<00:02:14.750> it's

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
can do without a certain symbol if it's

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.410 
can do without a certain symbol if it's
on<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> boom<00:02:15.470> stand<00:02:15.769> you<00:02:16.459> can<00:02:16.610> take<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.180> arm

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
on a boom stand you can take the arm

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.440 
on a boom stand you can take the arm
from<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.750> boom<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.400> use<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.580> as<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.790> leg<00:02:22.450> so

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
from the boom and use that as a leg so

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.940 
from the boom and use that as a leg so
again<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.959> isn't<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.320> most<00:02:24.530> pleasant

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
again this isn't the most pleasant

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.310 
again this isn't the most pleasant
looking<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.880> not<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.450> best<00:02:26.660> option<00:02:26.989> but

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
looking and not the best option but

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.569 
looking and not the best option but
compared<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.130> stick

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
compared to a stick

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.039 
compared to a stick
it's<00:02:28.940> definitely<00:02:29.150> longer<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.870> it's

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
it's definitely longer and it's

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.310 
it's definitely longer and it's
definitely<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.350> hold<00:02:30.590> better<00:02:30.739> than<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.850> stick

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
definitely a hold better than the stick

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.810 
definitely a hold better than the stick
okay<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:33.410> this<00:02:33.590> one<00:02:33.799> isn't<00:02:34.130> as<00:02:34.250> common<00:02:34.549> and

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
okay so this one isn't as common and

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.759 
okay so this one isn't as common and
it's<00:02:35.030> very<00:02:35.209> unlikely<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.840> happen<00:02:35.989> but

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
it's very unlikely to happen but

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.860 
it's very unlikely to happen but
anything<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.190> possible<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.060> it's<00:02:38.390> best<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.690> be

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
anything is possible so it's best to be

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.020 
anything is possible so it's best to be
prepared<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.799> if<00:02:40.160> one<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.459> your<00:02:40.549> snare<00:02:40.730> straps

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
prepared so if one of your snare straps

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.150 
prepared so if one of your snare straps
breaks<00:02:41.420> really<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.590> don't<00:02:42.709> have<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:42.920> snare

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
breaks really you don't have a snare

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.590 
breaks really you don't have a snare
anymore<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.549> just<00:02:43.700> have<00:02:43.790> really<00:02:44.090> poorly

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
anymore you just have really poorly

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.440 
anymore you just have really poorly
tuned<00:02:44.930> tom<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:46.100> all<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.579> need<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.760> fix<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.120> is

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
tuned tom so all you need to fix this is

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.660 
tuned tom so all you need to fix this is
a<00:02:47.480> piece<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.900> string<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:49.220> know<00:02:49.340> let's<00:02:49.519> say

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
a piece of string and you know let's say

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.759 
a piece of string and you know let's say
you<00:02:49.700> can't<00:02:50.000> find<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.299> piece<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.510> string<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.140> can

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
you can't find a piece of string you can

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.479 
you can't find a piece of string you can
always<00:02:52.100> use<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.280> crusty<00:02:52.790> old<00:02:52.820> shoelace<00:02:54.430> okay<00:02:55.430> so

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
always use a crusty old shoelace okay so

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.640 
always use a crusty old shoelace okay so
this<00:02:55.700> one's<00:02:55.940> also<00:02:56.510> very<00:02:56.870> unlikely<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.500> happen

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
this one's also very unlikely to happen

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.680 
this one's also very unlikely to happen
but<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.610> happened<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:58.940> my<00:02:59.090> friend

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
but it happened to my friend

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.930 
but it happened to my friend
so<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.049> could<00:03:00.170> happen<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.680> also<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.340> what

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
so it could happen to you also so what

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.160 
so it could happen to you also so what
happened<00:03:02.299> was<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.630> interim<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.049> know

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
happened was the interim you know

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.800 
happened was the interim you know
mechanism<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.860> inner<00:03:04.010> spring<00:03:04.519> in<00:03:05.180> his<00:03:05.570> Hyatt

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
mechanism the inner spring in his Hyatt

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.220 
mechanism the inner spring in his Hyatt
stand<00:03:06.170> like<00:03:06.549> broke<00:03:07.549> or<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:07.910> lost<00:03:08.510> tension<00:03:08.989> or

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
stand like broke or a lost tension or

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.930 
stand like broke or a lost tension or
something<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:09.980> pretty<00:03:10.220> much<00:03:10.370> whenever<00:03:10.610> he

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
something so pretty much whenever he

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.300 
something so pretty much whenever he
pressed<00:03:11.540> on<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.780> hi-hat<00:03:11.950> nothing<00:03:12.950> happened

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
pressed on the hi-hat nothing happened

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.060 
pressed on the hi-hat nothing happened
so<00:03:13.540> if<00:03:14.540> your<00:03:14.690> Hyatt<00:03:14.900> does<00:03:15.290> decide<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.650> crap<00:03:15.920> out

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
so if your Hyatt does decide to crap out

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.659 
so if your Hyatt does decide to crap out
on<00:03:16.130> you

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
on you

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.509 
on you
all<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.299> need<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> bungee<00:03:18.079> cord<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:19.400> it's

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
all you need is a bungee cord so it's

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.949 
all you need is a bungee cord so it's
pretty<00:03:19.639> simple<00:03:20.060> or<00:03:20.269> ideals<00:03:20.600> hook<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:20.900> around

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
pretty simple or ideals hook it around

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:21.990 
pretty simple or ideals hook it around
something

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
something

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.480 
something
like<00:03:22.270> that<00:03:22.720> wingnut<00:03:22.960> and<00:03:23.500> then<00:03:24.070> around<00:03:24.340> the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
like that wingnut and then around the

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:32.040 
like that wingnut and then around the
bottom<00:03:24.850> of<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.330> petal<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:31.480> it's<00:03:31.630> kind<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.840> hard

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
bottom of the petal so it's kind of hard

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.110
