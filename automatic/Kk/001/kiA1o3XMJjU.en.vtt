00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 4k a term that is already known by 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:10.410
 some, however, was only popularized now 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.269
 recently in 2014 but what is 4k 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.070
 this video guys I'll talk all 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:23.039
 that you need to know about 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:26.369
 4k and then the crowd beauty and well - cade 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.910
 but the 4k video is a new standard of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.759
 The resolution in turn is the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.270
 amount of pixels that have an image 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.510
 or a monitor and pixels are the points 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.840
 that image on the monitor 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.090
 so the more pixels ie how much 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.640
 the better the resolution because the image 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.640
 can be sharper and clearer with 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.160
 more details the tube tvs that he 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.850
 had a thousand-square- scale scale in its 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.500
 used a resolution of 480p 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.270
 or 640 by 480 or greater and this 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.930
 resolution is nowadays 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.880
 considered sd standard definition 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.710
 already the current 19-inch monitors 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:18.390
 widescreen usually 720p ie 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.810
 its resolution of 1280 by 720 or greater and 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.439
 this resolution is already considered hd 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.170
 that is the definition already larger monitors 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.600
 and bigger TVs of poor quality have the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.180
 resolution that we call today full 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.880
 hd 1920 by 1080 Also Known As 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.320
 1080p full HD is today the high standard 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.939
 quality movies or music clips 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.000
 series of high-definition videos on 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.549
 youtube all are distributed in full 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.829
 hd or 1080p 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.159
 then this resolution is currently 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.530
 on time the high quality standard however 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.439
 this pattern is to be replaced 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.450
 4k color we can then realize that 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.350
 current resolution standards are 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.690
 appointed by their smallest 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.640
 1920 per 1080 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.920
 1080p 1280 by 720 is called 720p 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.739
 however, these new standards of 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.650
 resolution are named by the largest measure 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.890
 and that's why this is called 4k a 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:31.200
 resolution of 4k ultra high hdd 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.270
 definition is 3.840 per 2.160 a 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.880
 vertical resolution is not exactly 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.170
 four thousand but it is very close and it is 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.209
 this is called 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.630
 this resolution also coincidentally 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:46.019
 has exactly four times more pixels 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.299
 than full hd or four times as much 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.760
 information four times more size 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.610
 literally it's like I get four 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.980
 full hd images and make a cube with 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.049
 they are a square that is the size of the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.130
 resolution that has four here I go 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.260
 leave a picture with the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.060
 Real resolutions right underneath the hotel 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.130
 the light in the description so that you 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.120
 can open the image and see in size 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.580
 real 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.799
 what are these definitions and how are they 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.340
 if we compare each other of course we still 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.590
 we are far from 4k dominate and replace 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.570
 the full hd the tvs currently with this 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.720
 very high resolution cost at least 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.260
 three thousand dollars and go at very 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.980
 top going to the 10 000 to 15 000 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.930
 dollars 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.700
 also remembering that just like HD 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.760
 before him and 3d 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.280
 the 4k content is extremely scarce 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.959
 so I feel like buying a 4k tv today in 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.390
 day will have extremely content 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.600
 limited because little content today in 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.579
 day is filmed and distributed in 4k 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.579
 though it was a funny fact it is 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:51.120
 that the first film is distributed in 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.730
 cinemas with 4k resolution was already in 2007 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.069
 then it is if you can see how this 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.630
 technology is late to get to the 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.190
 Our houses in the galley 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.930
 Good guys, now comes the better part. 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.900
 subjective part of the information 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.519
 It's already been now, I want to talk a little bit if 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.620
 I think four cars one thing 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.079
 needed if 4k one thing we are going 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.010
 bring some benefit if it is necessary and 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.239
 this visual is visibly superior to the 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.669
 full hd 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.250
 the truth is that it depends a lot on the 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.470
 situation i think for example 4k 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.810
 It will be a beauty for you. 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.730
 gamers because usually the gamers themselves 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.680
 come closer to TV because they 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.690
 have to pay more attention to 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.820
 details of the game then for example is 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.040
 playing on the computer is usually 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.350
 almost glued to the monitor then the entire 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.960
 image is full hd 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.310
 it occupies the whole field of vision and the same 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.680
 thing with the consoles actually 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.780
 usually this is a player who plays in the 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.060
 console do you have a tendency to reach 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.920
 closest to the TV for her to occupy 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.600
 more space of your vision so that I 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.060
 see more details in the game as per 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.420
 example the head of the guy there far a 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.400
 Beautiful end of 4 is a good example 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.230
 then in these cases 4k will make the 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.860
 difference the crowd because when it is 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.140
 close enough to the 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.260
 image completely occupy your field 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.870
 view you're at a distance that is 4k 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.780
 noticeable in your eyes that is if 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.020
 put 1080p on one side and 4k on the other 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.120
 everything will realize the difference you're going 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.130
 notice that 4k has more 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.419
 details if this will 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.580
 example see in more detail a 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.160
 person in the distance a game or something 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.200
 of the genre but now for movies 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.390
 serials and stuff 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.669
 a tv that will stay in the room generally 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.350
 in my opinion it's not interesting 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:41.300
 People, I'll tell you guys because I 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:44.210
 I would say 95% of the rooms have a 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.210
 small tv too much for your distance the 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.030
 people they use tvs that are small 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.220
 too much for their wings so that the 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.180
 sometimes does not occupy half of what 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.620
 the field of vision 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.750
 from the moment you are so 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.970
 distant from the screen it does not occupy 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.250
 half of your field of vision you can by 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.020
 14 cadu side of a stove and you will not 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.300
 able to keep the difference is the same 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.850
 thing that you move 10 meters away from a 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.919
 tv tube and voted side a tv full hd 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.020
 people will not be able to notice difference 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.630
 between the two because the further 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.270
 of the father - details does not perceive the image and 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.460
 the two will look alike though 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:22.580
 obviously full hd is much better than 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.710
 a tv with 480p an old tube tv I 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.080
 So guys, it depends a lot on yours. 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.479
 The situation I have in the room is 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.910
 very long distance from the TV will not 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:34.610
 to notice the difference of voting a resolution 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.379
 4k you the stove and why you are very 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.330
 today you will not notice that detail more 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:40.849
 generally gamers are at a 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.099
 the screen away and has one and has a 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:45.620
 need for extra information 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:47.750
 need for details to play 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.030
 better, for example, that they will end 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.009
 taking advantage of this new 4k resolution 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.930
 thing that is not necessarily going to be 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:56.030
 made in the rooms when someone sees a 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.039
 film a series when the whole family 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.199
 gather to see a cartoon by 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.340
 example and that's it guys the video ends 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.439
 here I hope you have 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.699
 something has been learned in this video if 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:06.560
 Learned, please do not forget to 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:08.150
 let lilic and share this 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.949
 video with your friends guys do not 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.539
 Forget me on social networks 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:13.969
 to keep in touch with me was 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:16.479
 Thank you for watching. 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:16.479
 went
