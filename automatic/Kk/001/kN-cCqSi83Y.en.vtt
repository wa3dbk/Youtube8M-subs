00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the whole body like so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.890 
the whole body like so
and<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:15.210> peg<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.820> peg<00:02:18.060> here<00:02:18.090> will<00:02:18.360> peg<00:02:18.720> it

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and the peg in this peg here will peg it

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.370 
and the peg in this peg here will peg it
this<00:02:19.320> peg<00:02:19.560> here<00:02:19.830> will<00:02:20.840> peg<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.340> right<00:02:23.340> here<00:02:24.380> so

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
this peg here will peg in right here so

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.670 
this peg here will peg in right here so
you<00:02:25.470> go<00:02:25.740> ahead<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.280> peg<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:28.530> you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
you go ahead and you peg that in and you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:38.000 
you go ahead and you peg that in and you
get<00:02:32.510> drill<00:02:33.510> bit<00:02:34.040> now<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.400> B<00:02:36.210> stores<00:02:36.600> neo<00:02:37.020> drill

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
get drill bit now in B stores neo drill

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.920 
get drill bit now in B stores neo drill
bit<00:02:38.250> was<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:39.350> maximum<00:02:40.940> our<00:02:41.940> drill<00:02:42.510> nuts<00:02:42.690> was<00:02:42.900> a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
bit was a maximum our drill nuts was a

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.310 
bit was a maximum our drill nuts was a
maximum<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:44.450> Beast<00:02:45.450> Wars<00:02:45.690> when<00:02:46.080> he<00:02:46.200> is

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
maximum and Beast Wars when he is

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.460 
maximum and Beast Wars when he is
released<00:02:46.620> he<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:47.100> Predacon<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.660> he's<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
released he is a Predacon so he's the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.340 
released he is a Predacon so he's the
exact<00:02:49.890> same<00:02:50.130> figure<00:02:50.540> think<00:02:51.540> coloration<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.260> a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
exact same figure think coloration is a

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.530 
exact same figure think coloration is a
little<00:02:52.560> different

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
little different

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.430 
little different
maximal<00:02:54.540> predator<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.959> he's<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:57.990> really<00:02:58.290> nice

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
maximal predator so he's a really nice

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.740 
maximal predator so he's a really nice
figure<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:59.070> mean<00:02:59.310> some<00:02:59.490> really<00:02:59.730> nice<00:02:59.910> simple

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
figure I mean some really nice simple

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.440 
figure I mean some really nice simple
articulation<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:04.080> he's<00:03:04.290> got<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> drill<00:03:04.800> hand

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
articulation and he's got the drill hand

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.780 
articulation and he's got the drill hand
so<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:07.410> know<00:03:07.560> he's<00:03:08.010> one<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.220> these<00:03:08.400> if<00:03:08.640> you

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
so you know he's one of these if you

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.850 
so you know he's one of these if you
want<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.240> get<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.510> Beast<00:03:09.840> Wars<00:03:10.050> line<00:03:10.350> go<00:03:10.620> ahead

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
want to get the Beast Wars line go ahead

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.280 
want to get the Beast Wars line go ahead
and<00:03:10.950> get<00:03:11.130> them<00:03:11.250> if<00:03:11.400> not<00:03:11.580> he's<00:03:12.480> worth<00:03:13.020> skipping

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
and get them if not he's worth skipping

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.790 
and get them if not he's worth skipping
so<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.400> cybertron<00:03:14.880> axe<00:03:15.320> with<00:03:16.320> drill<00:03:16.620> bit

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
so this is cybertron axe with drill bit

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.750 
so this is cybertron axe with drill bit
until<00:03:17.430> all<00:03:17.610> are<00:03:17.730> one<00:03:17.880> very<00:03:18.630> well
