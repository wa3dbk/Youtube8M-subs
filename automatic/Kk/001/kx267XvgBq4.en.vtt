my fascination about Bogner music I

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.330 
my fascination about Bogner music I
think<00:01:08.380> with<00:01:08.920> Wagner<00:01:09.160> it's<00:01:09.550> really<00:01:09.940> in<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.390> DNA

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
think with Wagner it's really in the DNA

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.750 
think with Wagner it's really in the DNA
it<00:01:12.340> seems<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:13.020> divide<00:01:14.020> people<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:15.100> really<00:01:15.340> are

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
it seems to divide people you really are
