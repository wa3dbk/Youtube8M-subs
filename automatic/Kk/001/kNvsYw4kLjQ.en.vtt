00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
it's not the first time that they

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.650 
it's not the first time that they
release<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.310> mascara<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.509> I'm<00:02:09.599> not

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
release a mascara like this so I'm not

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.570 
release a mascara like this so I'm not
too<00:02:09.959> sure<00:02:10.140> why<00:02:10.319> they<00:02:10.500> say<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.550> first

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
too sure why they say it's the first

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.280 
too sure why they say it's the first
time<00:02:12.120> our<00:02:12.540> first

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
time our first

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.830 
time our first
scare<00:02:13.530> blah<00:02:14.219> blah<00:02:14.430> blah<00:02:14.670> now<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> have<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.629> say

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
scare blah blah blah now I have to say

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.929 
scare blah blah blah now I have to say
I'm<00:02:15.989> not<00:02:16.319> very<00:02:16.769> impressed<00:02:17.189> with<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.459> mascara

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
I'm not very impressed with this mascara

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.449 
I'm not very impressed with this mascara
because<00:02:18.439> first<00:02:19.439> of<00:02:19.590> all<00:02:19.739> it's<00:02:19.920> not<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.219> first

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
because first of all it's not the first

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.920 
because first of all it's not the first
time<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:20.879> try<00:02:21.150> something<00:02:21.510> like<00:02:21.629> this<00:02:21.780> from

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
time that I try something like this from

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.649 
time that I try something like this from
L'Oreal<00:02:22.409> so<00:02:22.620> it's<00:02:22.769> not<00:02:22.920> new<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:23.849> I<00:02:23.909> still<00:02:24.329> got

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
L'Oreal so it's not new but I still got

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.449 
L'Oreal so it's not new but I still got
sucked<00:02:24.989> into<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.469> and<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.709> wanted<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.159> try<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
sucked into it and I wanted to try it

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.089 
sucked into it and I wanted to try it
because<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:27.060> really<00:02:27.329> like<00:02:27.629> L'Oreal<00:02:28.500> mascaras

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
because I really like L'Oreal mascaras

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.839 
because I really like L'Oreal mascaras
when<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.790> comes<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.359> the<00:02:30.540> primer<00:02:31.250> very<00:02:32.250> easy<00:02:32.549> to

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
when it comes to the primer very easy to

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.929 
when it comes to the primer very easy to
apply<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.599> does<00:02:34.010> look<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.430> going<00:02:35.609> to<00:02:35.790> do

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
apply it does look like it's going to do

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.089 
apply it does look like it's going to do
something<00:02:36.329> for<00:02:36.480> my<00:02:36.659> lashes<00:02:37.140> but<00:02:37.319> once<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.890> get

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
something for my lashes but once I get

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.089 
something for my lashes but once I get
to<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> mascara<00:02:38.879> it<00:02:39.599> just<00:02:40.019> takes<00:02:40.290> forever<00:02:40.530> to

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
to the mascara it just takes forever to

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.729 
to the mascara it just takes forever to
coat<00:02:41.400> them<00:02:42.019> sometimes<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.109> have<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.409> apply<00:02:43.680> it

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
coat them sometimes I have to apply it

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.039 
coat them sometimes I have to apply it
at<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.040> bottom<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.579> at<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.879> top<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.569> it<00:02:45.840> just

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
at the bottom and at the top and it just

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.170 
at the bottom and at the top and it just
takes<00:02:46.439> a<00:02:46.680> really<00:02:46.709> long<00:02:47.220> time<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.579> find<00:02:47.939> that<00:02:48.060> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
takes a really long time I find that the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.809 
takes a really long time I find that the
formulas<00:02:48.659> way<00:02:48.959> too<00:02:49.019> drying<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:50.250> should<00:02:50.519> be<00:02:50.790> a

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
formulas way too drying it should be a

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.050 
formulas way too drying it should be a
little<00:02:51.269> bit<00:02:51.419> more<00:02:51.599> wet<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.829> can<00:02:53.040> coat<00:02:53.430> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
little bit more wet so it can coat the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.479 
little bit more wet so it can coat the
lashes<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.540> lot<00:02:54.810> better<00:02:55.109> I<00:02:55.439> also<00:02:56.099> feel<00:02:56.459> that

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
lashes a lot better I also feel that

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.089 
lashes a lot better I also feel that
this<00:02:56.790> mascara<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.329> quite<00:02:57.569> heavy<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.200> feel<00:02:58.980> it

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
this mascara is quite heavy I feel it

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.679 
this mascara is quite heavy I feel it
throughout<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.549> day<00:02:59.579> that<00:02:59.879> I<00:02:59.909> actually<00:03:00.150> have

throughout the day that I actually have

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:01.970 
throughout the day that I actually have
it<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.989> don't<00:03:01.019> know<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:01.349> it's<00:03:01.500> because<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.829> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
it I don't know if it's because of the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.479 
it I don't know if it's because of the
two-step<00:03:02.609> system<00:03:03.230> but<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.470> does<00:03:04.739> feel<00:03:05.159> heavy

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
two-step system but it does feel heavy

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.970

I know that waterproof mascara has had

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.750 
I know that waterproof mascara has had
no<00:03:16.109> non<00:03:16.470> waterproof<00:03:16.739> mascaras<00:03:17.489> have<00:03:17.639> the

no non waterproof mascaras have the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.250 
no non waterproof mascaras have the
tendency<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:19.609> smudge<00:03:20.609> but<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.510> one<00:03:21.750> smudges

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
tendency to smudge but this one smudges

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.949 
tendency to smudge but this one smudges
a<00:03:22.409> lot<00:03:22.799> like<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.310> inner<00:03:23.549> corners<00:03:24.449> of<00:03:24.599> my<00:03:24.629> eyes

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
a lot like the inner corners of my eyes

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.339 
a lot like the inner corners of my eyes
are<00:03:25.459> pretty<00:03:26.459> dark<00:03:26.849> three<00:03:27.389> hours<00:03:27.750> into<00:03:27.959> my<00:03:28.290> day

so I have to go and apply concealer

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.770 
so I have to go and apply concealer
maybe<00:03:31.769> retouch<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.549> mascara<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.479> this

mascara<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.409> not<00:03:34.470> label<00:03:35.190> because<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.389> will

mascara is not label because it will

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.890 
mascara is not label because it will
clump<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.829> will<00:03:38.040> clump<00:03:38.370> by<00:03:38.699> the<00:03:38.760> second<00:03:39.299> layer
