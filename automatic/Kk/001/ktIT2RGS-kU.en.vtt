00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 hey I have this look here today 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.810
 you prepared 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.510
 the same suitable if your brown eyes 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.790
 have as you can see is the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.549
 actually very discreet with in the gold and 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.839
 I would like to tell you purple and ride 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.730
 if you have brown eyes you can 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.539
 actually really use all colors 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.449
 green blue pink purple silver gold 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.519
 really everything and most beautiful ways 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.880
 Contrast is actually a very suitable 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.980
 nice green or blue or like in 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.410
 In this case a purple where I now you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.590
 also show how you do that best 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.239
 can use process and this 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.800
 look is really going really fast 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.989
 you can wear in everyday life but also 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.280
 evening if you want 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.100
 and I would say we fall once 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.579
 right on so first of all it is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.899
 important that she applies such a base 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.440
 that eye shadow also throughout the day 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.440
 keeps 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.510
 a bit down here and then 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.740
 let's start with one first 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.470
 golden color 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.570
 this is best suited for a gold 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.040
 which is a bit more yellow 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.160
 For example, this is something and the whole thing 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.300
 comes with a large brush 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.410
 then applied the complete 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.410
 movable lid 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:49.740
 I too in the angle and a bit 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:50.790
 Fade a little so it can 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.770
 here again a little bit too 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.380
 example, put more on it than he added 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.510
 and then we come to the purple ones 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.250
 there is always something going on 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.490
 I have a color of l'oreal here 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.520
 but very dark purple and there 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.310
 I take a squeeze industry so 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.010
 A blender brush is very cheap 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.480
 which is why I'm a bit in 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.930
 the purple raimund goes into the 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:27.990
 lid fold and dazzle what also quiet 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.610
 a bit higher so it will give 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:37.350
 I then again this color 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:38.940
 that's the color 90 of adecco's 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.590
 I wear it too because I still have one 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.709
 a little more shimmers a bit 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.030
 More purple is because he, of course, one 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.310
 hard beams we did not have 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:56.100
 we would like to have the whole thing with us 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:59.870
 a big beat dazzle brush that 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.870
 we have no more edges in there 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.170
 but as you can see then go 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.240
 unfortunately a bit lost 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.340
 That's why I'll just take it again 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:20.950
 this purple of cover is still missing 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:23.850
 nice times in the offenders with it and 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.990
 associations are still very easy 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.890
 All right then that's what you do 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:35.590
 have of the color then we take yet 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.860
 times our nice money gold the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:47.110
 smart brush and wearing as 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:55.170
 highlight under the eyebrow on then 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:55.170
 but down here so to speak halfway 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.140
 then again this inferno real this 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.890
 purple and wear that from the back to the 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.890
 half off 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.650
 so i can do this big again 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.680
 handy volumes brÃ¤ndle blurs that 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.840
 whole and thus since transition almost 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.510
 finished now only one channel comes 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.860
 for use 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.860
 Here I give to the bottom waterline 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:43.409
 so always here in the upper water 

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:43.409
 Offer 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.290
 a bit strong already the no 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:09.650
 so now one of the companies pantos me 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.650
 just take my mascara of essence 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.180
 So you are already done with this 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.159
