melt<00:00:37.500> my<00:00:37.649> g2<00:00:38.040> model<00:00:38.489> with<00:00:38.670> my<00:00:39.210> original

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
melt my g2 model with my original

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
melt my g2 model with my original
version<00:00:40.350> 1<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.800> model<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.850> think<00:00:42.059> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
version 1 of this model and I think it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.420 
version 1 of this model and I think it
came<00:00:42.239> out<00:00:42.360> pretty<00:00:42.420> well<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.070> legs<00:00:44.280> are

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
came out pretty well so the legs are

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.889 
came out pretty well so the legs are
pretty<00:00:44.550> much<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> same<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.780> have

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
pretty much the same you can see I have

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.560 
pretty much the same you can see I have
the<00:00:46.829> cabin<00:00:47.250> nested<00:00:47.610> pretty<00:00:47.910> well<00:00:48.149> into<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the cabin nested pretty well into the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.540 
the cabin nested pretty well into the
turret<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.070> sticking<00:00:50.340> out

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
turret here it was kind of sticking out

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.090 
turret here it was kind of sticking out
on<00:00:50.579> top<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.300> some<00:00:51.930> extra<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.739> cannons

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
on top of for some extra kind of cannons

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.220 
on top of for some extra kind of cannons
lasers<00:00:53.399> there<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.629> little<00:00:54.899> extra

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
lasers there and a little extra

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.779 
lasers there and a little extra
accessories<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> legs<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.340> basically<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
accessories the legs are basically the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.420 
accessories the legs are basically the
same<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.300> first<00:00:57.449> model<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.620> let<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.309> get

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
same as the first model so let me get

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.510 
same as the first model so let me get
the<00:00:59.520> canines<00:01:00.030> back<00:01:00.210> here<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.250> can

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the canines back here so we can

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.670 
the canines back here so we can
transform<00:01:03.090> him<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:05.189> again<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.680> you

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
transform him and just again you can you

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
transform him and just again you can you
can<00:01:07.860> fire<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> laser<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:09.390> before<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
can fire the laser like before so the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.160 
can fire the laser like before so the
first<00:01:11.909> thing<00:01:12.000> i<00:01:12.150> want<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.960> guy

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
first thing i want to do to get this guy

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.640 
first thing i want to do to get this guy
into<00:01:13.860> your<00:01:14.130> robot<00:01:14.460> mode<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.470> these

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
into your robot mode is to get these

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.429 
into your robot mode is to get these
side<00:01:16.950> panels<00:01:17.189> out<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.600> around<00:01:18.840> which<00:01:19.290> of

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
side panels out and around which of

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.670 
side panels out and around which of
course<00:01:19.470> they<00:01:19.830> become<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.189> legs<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.439> want

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
course they become the legs so you want

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.870 
course they become the legs so you want
to<00:01:22.740> bring<00:01:22.860> them<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:25.009> then<00:01:27.409> turn<00:01:28.880> these

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
to bring them out and then turn these

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.460 
to bring them out and then turn these
pounds<00:01:30.270> which<00:01:30.360> will<00:01:30.479> become<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> feet<00:01:31.130> up

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
pounds which will become the feet up

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.100 
pounds which will become the feet up
same<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> other<00:01:34.680> side

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.780 

so<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.409> probably<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:41.070> into<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> standing

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
so we can probably get into a standing

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.550 
so we can probably get into a standing
position<00:01:42.259> for<00:01:43.259> everyone<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:45.560> before

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
position for everyone to see here before

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.160 
position for everyone to see here before
we<00:01:47.040> complete<00:01:47.460> transformation<00:01:47.940> so<00:01:48.780> yeah<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.990> can

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
we complete transformation so yeah I can

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.930 
we complete transformation so yeah I can
see<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.560> kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.860> standing<00:01:50.190> up<00:01:50.310> next<00:01:50.820> thing

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
see it's kind of standing up next thing

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.249 
see it's kind of standing up next thing
we<00:01:51.000> want<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.210> do<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:52.590> want<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.830> rotate<00:01:54.259> this

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
we want to do is we want to rotate this

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.779 
we want to do is we want to rotate this
tops<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.159> arms<00:01:56.460> out<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.710> want<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.070> make

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
legs so you see them here you need to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.710 
legs so you see them here you need to
push<00:02:16.680> these<00:02:16.830> all<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> way<00:02:17.250> back<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.540> can

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
push these all the way back so you can

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.020 
push these all the way back so you can
get<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.870> arms<00:02:19.200> back<00:02:19.350> into<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> nice<00:02:19.920> swing<00:02:20.790> dope

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.949 
get the arms back into a nice swing dope
position<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.680> want<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.920> do<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.750> yeah

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
position so we want to do that and yeah

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
now we can get the arms we out of the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.059 
now we can get the arms we out of the
way<00:02:29.000> okay<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:34.019> course<00:02:34.049> we<00:02:34.410> have<00:02:34.560> lots<00:02:34.920> of

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
little spark in there i think the other

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.550 
little spark in there i think the other
one<00:02:45.030> we<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:45.329> that<00:02:45.480> out<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.870> Decepticon

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
one we have that out the Decepticon

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.350 
one we have that out the Decepticon
symbol<00:02:46.769> in<00:02:46.980> there<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> next<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.060> want<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.239> do

symbol in there so the next I want to do
I'm<00:02:48.750> going<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.019> rotate<00:02:49.530> down<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:50.040> whole

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
I'm going to rotate down this whole

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
panel which then becomes a chest okay

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.860 
panel which then becomes a chest okay
and<00:02:54.950> then<00:02:55.950> we<00:02:56.160> want<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.400> turn<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.730> around<00:02:56.870> the

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
cybertron version to kind of a meld of

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.560 
cybertron version to kind of a meld of
my<00:03:10.140> g2<00:03:10.670> model<00:03:12.019> each<00:03:13.019> Megatron<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.400> course

my g2 model each Megatron and of course

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.520 
my g2 model each Megatron and of course
we've<00:03:15.570> got<00:03:17.030> lots<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.209> aspects<00:03:18.660> from<00:03:19.290> the
