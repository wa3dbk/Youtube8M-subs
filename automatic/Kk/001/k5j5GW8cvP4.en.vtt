it's easier to paint the Shelby off the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.779 
it's easier to paint the Shelby off the
windowsill<00:02:08.080> before<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.200> goes<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.769> and<00:02:10.759> then

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
windowsill before it goes in and then

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.600 
windowsill before it goes in and then
you<00:02:11.570> can<00:02:11.750> get<00:02:11.900> all<00:02:12.140> sides<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:15.459> give<00:02:16.459> it

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
you can get all sides of it and give it

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.540 
you can get all sides of it and give it
to<00:02:16.640> waterproofed<00:02:17.480> even<00:02:17.840> on<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.080> bottom<00:02:18.590> where

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
to waterproofed even on the bottom where

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.540 
to waterproofed even on the bottom where
we<00:02:19.880> won't<00:02:20.150> have<00:02:20.450> access<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.290> once<00:02:22.190> we<00:02:22.340> mount

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
we won't have access to it once we mount

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.520 
we won't have access to it once we mount
our<00:02:22.670> windowsill<00:02:23.180> let<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.110> start<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.290> take

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
our windowsill let it start to take

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.190 
our windowsill let it start to take
shape<00:02:24.560> here<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.280> it's<00:02:25.580> starting<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:25.910> look

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
shape here and it's starting to look

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.130 
shape here and it's starting to look
like<00:02:27.200> an<00:02:27.319> actual<00:02:27.500> windowsill<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:29.090> when<00:02:30.019> we're

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140

off<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:15.970> painting<00:03:16.390> while<00:03:16.540> it's<00:03:16.690> installed<00:03:17.140> I

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
off and painting while it's installed I

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.440 
off and painting while it's installed I
will<00:03:18.130> have<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.370> do<00:03:18.460> some<00:03:18.610> touch-up<00:03:19.030> once<00:03:19.270> it<00:03:19.420> is

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450

installed<00:03:20.040> but<00:03:21.040> it's<00:03:21.490> easier<00:03:21.850> than<00:03:22.030> just

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
installed but it's easier than just

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.310 
installed but it's easier than just
trying<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.570> paint<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> whole<00:03:23.020> thing<00:03:24.900> okay
