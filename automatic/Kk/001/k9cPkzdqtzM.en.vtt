00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
and things like that so let's get

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.980 
and things like that so let's get
started<00:00:19.880> okay<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:20.939> when<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.510> go<00:00:21.630> into<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> app

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
started okay so when you go into the app

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.870 
started okay so when you go into the app
you<00:00:22.170> presented<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.740> Home<00:00:23.010> tab<00:00:23.039> history

once you've done runs they come up here
as<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:17.930> as<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> run<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> main<00:01:21.690> ideas

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
as a as a run so one of the main ideas

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.789 
as a as a run so one of the main ideas
of<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.590> app<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.820> look<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
of this app is that you can look and

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.050 
of this app is that you can look and
your<00:01:25.799> previous<00:01:26.159> runs<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:26.850> where

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
your previous runs and you can see where

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
your previous runs and you can see where
you've<00:01:27.180> run<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.630> because<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.560> uses<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.950> gps

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
you've run and because it uses the gps

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.859 
you've run and because it uses the gps
you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:29.789> sort<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.119> how<00:01:30.330> fast<00:01:30.630> you've

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
wherever and how fast I've run an edge

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.940 
wherever and how fast I've run an edge
various<00:03:06.550> bit<00:03:06.730> sort<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.150> like<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.300> map<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.950> it's

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
various bit sort of like a map and it's

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.890 
various bit sort of like a map and it's
got<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.100> line<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.430> we've<00:03:09.700> ran<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.690> line

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
got a line of we've ran and the line

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.750 
got a line of we've ran and the line
changes<00:03:11.440> color<00:03:11.680> depending<00:03:11.770> on<00:03:12.220> how<00:03:12.340> fast<00:03:12.550> your

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
changes color depending on how fast your

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.040 
changes color depending on how fast your
ground<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:14.250> yeah<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.660> it's<00:03:16.660> interesting<00:03:16.780> to

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.760 
not first like the fastest you've read a
kilometer<00:03:25.930> um<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:28.209> you<00:03:28.870> can<00:03:29.020> go<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.230> try<00:03:29.650> and

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
kilometer um and you can go to try and

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.490 
kilometer um and you can go to try and
beat<00:03:29.890> those<00:03:30.070> records<00:03:30.670> if<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:31.209> want<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:32.380> also

how<00:03:38.260> many<00:03:38.440> calories<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.890> bet<00:03:39.250> if<00:03:39.700> you're

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
how many calories you bet if you're

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.410 
how many calories you bet if you're
interested<00:03:40.600> in<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.750> type<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:40.989> thing<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.790> it's

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
interested in that type of thing so it's

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.900 
interested in that type of thing so it's
apt<00:03:43.630> looks<00:03:43.870> good<00:03:44.140> it's<00:03:44.800> got<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.950> it's<00:03:45.820> very

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
apt looks good it's got a it's very

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.160 
apt looks good it's got a it's very
simple<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.540> easy<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.900> use<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.730> um<00:03:49.080> however<00:03:50.080> it

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
simple and easy to use and um however it

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.800 
simple and easy to use and um however it
does<00:03:50.320> cost<00:03:50.560> about<00:03:51.430> three<00:03:51.970> dollars<00:03:52.150> i<00:03:52.540> think

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
does cost about three dollars i think
