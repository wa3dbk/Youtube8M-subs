00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
technology here the probe is going

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.749 
technology here the probe is going
inside<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.979> gland<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.369> modified

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
inside the gland it's a modified

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.999 
inside the gland it's a modified
flashlight<00:01:51.420> Wow<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.140> you'll<00:01:52.439> see<00:01:52.680> carefully

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
flashlight Wow and you'll see carefully

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.660 
flashlight Wow and you'll see carefully
the<00:01:53.899> egress<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.140> oil<00:01:55.530> actually<00:01:56.219> coming

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the egress of oil actually coming

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.499 
the egress of oil actually coming
through<00:01:56.850> along<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.350> probe<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.070> little

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
through along the the probe that little

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.270 
through along the the probe that little
bit<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.540> oil<00:02:00.869> was<00:02:01.110> trapped<00:02:01.439> inside<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.040> gland

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
bit of oil was trapped inside the gland

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.819 
bit of oil was trapped inside the gland
causing<00:02:02.610> tenderness<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.509> indeed<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.710> would

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
causing tenderness and indeed that would

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.670 
causing tenderness and indeed that would
cause<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> sty<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:06.060> left<00:02:06.450> untreated<00:02:06.810> huh<00:02:07.380> so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
cause a sty if left untreated huh so

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.010 
cause a sty if left untreated huh so
it's<00:02:07.829> an<00:02:08.009> oil<00:02:08.360> blockage<00:02:09.390> correct<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:09.989> a

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
it's an oil blockage correct it's a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.540 
it's an oil blockage correct it's a
blockage<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.649> oftentimes<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.280> think<00:02:11.459> of

blockage and oftentimes you can think of

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.520 
blockage and oftentimes you can think of
it<00:02:12.000> as<00:02:12.090> an<00:02:12.209> impacted<00:02:12.810> gland

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
it increases intraductal pressure inside

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.770 
it increases intraductal pressure inside
the<00:02:16.410> gland<00:02:16.650> leading<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.459> lid<00:02:18.150> tenderness<00:02:18.510> as

stinging sensitivity to light and a host
of<00:02:22.860> other<00:02:23.040> symptoms<00:02:23.940> could<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.270> be<00:02:24.390> looking<00:02:24.750> to

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
of other symptoms could it be looking to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.280 
of other symptoms could it be looking to
saying<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.680> pimple<00:02:26.459> in<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.060> skin<00:02:27.390> correct<00:02:27.900> it's

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
saying a pimple in the skin correct it's

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.840 
saying a pimple in the skin correct it's
very<00:02:28.470> similar<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.130> these<00:02:29.370> glands<00:02:29.640> are

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
very similar to that these glands are

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.270 
very similar to that these glands are
sebaceous<00:02:30.540> like<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.050> skin<00:02:31.500> sebaceous<00:02:32.010> glands
