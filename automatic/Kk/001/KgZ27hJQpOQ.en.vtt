00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.150

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.890

 It looks like you can do two catapult modes 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.390
 It is such a feeling if it is a single body even in Ayumi talks 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.730

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.870

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.160
 But I do not go to see 7 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.580
 Well, there is no episode of this sound 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.880
 It seems that the right begging nagane will be completed 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.650

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.390

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.989

 I also like modeling, so I'm also painting 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.080
 I think that Unicon is a basic white but I think 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.750
 I know modeling sounds good 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.470
 Up to the color 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.440

 It is cool. There are many organs. There are 4 forms of darkness. 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:58.020
