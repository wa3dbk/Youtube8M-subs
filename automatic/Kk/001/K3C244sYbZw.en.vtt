00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 cabin completing laminate one now i 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.719
 rewrite one more 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.590
 video and tobacco in gta wai city a hundred times as 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.949
 get inside the saviano 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:21.170
 we can only get into one thing and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:25.590
 the plot using this basic can 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.550
 put your rap about teeth difficult even 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.980
 I get 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.829
 first try but the main thing 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.770
 to train and then the rebels are taught well 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.129
 so did not start going to the stadium here and 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.129
 in front 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.770
 friends here under the stairs 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:54.000
 so that will sustain the space there 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.430
 Yes, we need to jump if you so 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.239
 high car as I mean jump 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.149
 from the hood 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.149
 if the passenger then jump from the roof 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.800
 enlighten they even spend 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.770
 it turns out again not the most difficult part 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.530
 how jumped try to run forward 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.190
 if I can't do it, then 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.190
 need to look 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.170
 given you can run forward 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.680
 maybe after the first jump you are still 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.320
 you could not have been like that in a minute somewhere 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:40.310
 jumped anyway could not run forward 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:45.410
 moving forward as we see ahead 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.290
 us the wall here is the platform we need 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.050
 jump as close to the wall as possible 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.530
 as close as possible to the platform on which 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.320
 now we stand but so to bear now 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.730
 platform we did not touch 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.730
 Naturally everything needs to be done with overclocking 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.180
 here lies the whole complexity and 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.880
 so as likely 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:24.840
 don't know will get stronger ok no to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.450
 Unfortunately, I literally flew a couple 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.680
 millimeters 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.540
 if you happen to come back 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.230
 the car remained happy wrc and left 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.230
 open 2 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:55.680
 try again many people 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:59.910
 wrote on my site before and video that it 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:05.340
 impossible but I could still do 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:08.940
 This video also knows how to do it 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.870
 so I still flew even hitting 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:17.910
 a little platform edge i do n't care again 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:22.220
 fall now we choose custom we will run away 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:27.180
 I will run to the left all the time and I know why 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.959
 I would love to even run there before 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.959
 the very end 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.930
 and here all summer even want to say I do not 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.650
 I will post new videos and articles on 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.150
 the site 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:52.060
 well because i'm leaving for it but 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.520
 I will shoot in the summer so when I 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.540
 I will come gradually start to spread 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.370
 filmed videos of the park when we run here 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:07.720
 here we get stuck fast jumper 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:09.990
 I got a lot of ideas there one 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.959
 the man told me 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:17.769
 more precisely asked to make the passage 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.380
 on any of the gta I of course 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.470
 not very beautiful at first but then 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.840
 I thought to do it all the same 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.580
 passing on gta liberty city a hundred times 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.890
 because somehow I like more 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:37.810
 so when we light ran we needed 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:39.480
 jump over there closer to the wall here 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.630
 here it is 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.590
 invisible place to go far 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:52.780
 from the wall do not run away because you 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:55.200
 fail then under run this corner 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.169
 we can come in from here 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.560
 principle, we already vionne but we still 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:06.550
 I want to get there further so here 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.310
 the angle between the wall and behind the fence run 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.270
 we are trying to escape into it 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:16.120
 side of the stadium. and we want to run 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.910
 it often happens that you are just through the wall 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.660
 come on here look I went through 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.660
 the wall 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.620
 And by the way, the camera is not very convenient 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:31.390
 it was at first you could easily dump 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.490
 so repeat many plowed 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.340
 still not getting a thick fence 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:40.630
 it is impossible to jump well, that's me 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:44.020
 everything turned out now we can 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:48.340
 then run, in principle, really 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:53.310
 there is nothing she fell in the clinch as 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:06:02.280
 do here here here is an example of what 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:02.280
 big ones like to smell 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:13.500
 eat bad let's go find normal 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:16.920
 place of the type we are behind the drums are flat 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:23.670
 the folders were hands could be removed by 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:27.240
 nato turn off everything in the menu 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:31.560
 there will be so beautiful some beautiful 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:35.850
 text picture on the side and figachit in all 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.610
 turned out to be a masterpiece as from here 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:43.250
 get out sooner or later this place 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.250
 you ds maybe you want 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:52.790
 don't reboot come back us 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.790
 run on 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:02.400
 so here is the place we have look at 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:07.720
 map about here 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:10.290
 here by shifting run through this 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.970
 invisible wall 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:18.730
 run on and fail 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:21.720
 instant teleport another 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:27.640
 side of the stadium 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:31.930
 as you remember we drove from where and all 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:35.440
 you can run with you affairs floated 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:37.840
 the stadium learned how to do it therefore 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.690
 Immediately I can not even write that 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.910
 it is impossible to agree it folded 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.900
 as you can see it can 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:49.350
 Well, itâ€™s okay with you 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.350
 well, like this
