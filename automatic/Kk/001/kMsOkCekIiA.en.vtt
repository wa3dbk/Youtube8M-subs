00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
spikes and so pretty much you just pop

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.600 
spikes and so pretty much you just pop
it<00:03:04.990> right<00:03:05.110> off<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.410> rip<00:03:05.620> off<00:03:05.800> their<00:03:05.950> hands<00:03:06.250> and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
it right off you rip off their hands and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.710 
it right off you rip off their hands and
you<00:03:07.120> get<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:08.760> shoe<00:03:09.760> co<00:03:09.940> spike<00:03:10.209> hand<00:03:10.480> on<00:03:10.690> it

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
you get the shoe co spike hand on it

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.380 
you get the shoe co spike hand on it
fits<00:03:11.110> really<00:03:11.560> nicely<00:03:12.570> now<00:03:13.570> they<00:03:13.959> look<00:03:14.310> like

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390
