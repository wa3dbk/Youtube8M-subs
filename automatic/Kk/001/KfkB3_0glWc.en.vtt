 the roma by federico coppitelli beats 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.620
 also the catania ringing the 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.270
 fifteenth championship win 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.219
 literally dominated by the Giallorossi 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.949
 which maintain the 10-point advantage

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.770
 ringtone of the hosts already arrives 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.300
 at the fifth when bordin and tries from 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.720
 outside but blond blocks without adults 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.730
 problems 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.740
 at the tenth second attempt leads to the 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.150
 benefit with pearls clinic fund a 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.949
 left and serves at the center tumminello 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.050
 good at anticipating your marker 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.370
 and puts the number 9 on the net at zero 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.290
 it could already be doubling up to 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.730
 sixteenth kick on the bottom from good 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.800
 position after descent by roads 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.150
 power plants of antonucci but to assist 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.130
 at 2 to 0 you just have to wait for the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.450
 our turn of hands with gulf that 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.000
 finalizes communication at its best 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.620
 of walnut bordin the road to Rome 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.730
 seems to be downhill but to 21st la 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.830
 defense of capitals is to be found 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.020
 discovery on the launch from the rear of the 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.150
 which makes good use all that under the door 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.710
 does not make mistakes and reopens match the result 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.570
 however, it remains under discussion for very little 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.190
 because at the twenty-second tumminello jumps 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.660
 with a long number appearing 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.250
 in front of rigging and putting back the Rome 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.799
 with two goals ahead of the Rossazzurri 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.450
 the race continues to live on high paces 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.189
 at the 32nd of nolfo it comes close to poker 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.530
 while on the opposite side and rossini a 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.090
 to put the thrill of Rome at the 35th 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.159
 the nth escape of antonucci to serve 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.329
 good balloon for the 4 gulf one that 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.649
 refers to the action the best does 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.090
 to extend the Giallorossi further 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.649
 in the final could reopen the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.780
 graziiano question whose left-handed center 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.310
 but only the crossbar the shot 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.990
 start again with a graziano to make us 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.670
 see with the deviation on the cross of 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.799
 all that is lost high on the crossbar 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.600
 the rome bus and instead as a reconvening 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.249
 of the eighteenth and nine minutes more pole 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.479
 late a big mess of his own 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:36.280
 goalkeeper is exploited by a pole 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.710
 floor that manages to score 4 to 2 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.999
 bring back under the catania in the final one 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.340
 there is still room for opportunity 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.990
 for part for roma we try tumminello 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.310
 who finds blonde ready while from 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.490
 the opposite side is all to be seen

 repel the right from barton moaning
