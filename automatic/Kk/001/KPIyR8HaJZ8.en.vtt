00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
a really interesting setup he has made

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.120 
a really interesting setup he has made
their<00:04:40.360> jets<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:40.810> helicopters<00:04:40.950> appear<00:04:41.950> and

and<00:04:45.370> since<00:04:45.670> Steve<00:04:45.880> is<00:04:46.030> really<00:04:46.360> into<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.750> idea

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
and since Steve is really into the idea

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.660 
and since Steve is really into the idea
making<00:04:47.290> part<00:04:47.590> of<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.740> bike<00:04:47.890> invisible<00:04:48.520> I

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
making part of a bike invisible I

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.280 
making part of a bike invisible I
thought<00:04:49.030> it<00:04:49.180> might<00:04:49.300> be<00:04:49.450> cool<00:04:49.600> to<00:04:49.810> make<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:50.050> look

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
thought it might be cool to make it look

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.810 
thought it might be cool to make it look
like<00:04:50.470> he<00:04:50.620> made<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.860> tank<00:04:51.100> disappear

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
like he made the tank disappear

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.520 
like he made the tank disappear
and<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.510> all<00:04:52.660> that<00:04:52.780> was<00:04:52.900> left<00:04:53.080> of<00:04:53.290> it<00:04:53.350> was

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
and that all that was left of it was

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.920 
and that all that was left of it was
flames<00:04:53.830> you<00:04:54.400> want<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.640> make<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:54.910> look<00:04:55.030> like<00:04:55.240> the

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
flames you want to make it look like the

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.980 
flames you want to make it look like the
gas<00:04:56.620> tanks<00:04:57.040> go<00:04:57.280> on<00:04:57.430> but<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.420> flames<00:04:58.720> are<00:04:58.960> still

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
gas tanks go on but the flames are still

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.810 
gas tanks go on but the flames are still
there<00:04:59.410> I<00:04:59.530> mean<00:04:59.710> I<00:04:59.830> think<00:05:00.070> it's<00:05:00.190> pretty<00:05:00.400> cool<00:05:00.700> if

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
there I mean I think it's pretty cool if

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.810 
there I mean I think it's pretty cool if
we<00:05:00.910> could<00:05:01.000> pull<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.390> off<00:05:02.430> fortunately<00:05:03.430> Jason

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
we could pull it off fortunately Jason

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.610 
we could pull it off fortunately Jason
already<00:05:03.970> had<00:05:04.240> some<00:05:04.510> flames<00:05:04.780> pattern<00:05:05.320> on<00:05:05.530> the

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
already had some flames pattern on the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.410 
already had some flames pattern on the
tanks<00:05:05.950> from<00:05:06.070> other<00:05:06.220> bikes<00:05:06.490> we've<00:05:06.700> built<00:05:06.910> which

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
tanks from other bikes we've built which

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.240 
tanks from other bikes we've built which
we<00:05:07.570> could<00:05:07.690> use<00:05:07.720> is<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.020> basic<00:05:08.410> idea<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.860> go<00:05:09.040> by

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
we could use is a basic idea to go by

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.220 
we could use is a basic idea to go by
we're<00:05:09.880> gonna<00:05:09.970> have<00:05:10.150> to<00:05:10.270> tie<00:05:10.420> all<00:05:10.720> them<00:05:10.900> flames

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
we're gonna have to tie all them flames

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.720 
we're gonna have to tie all them flames
into<00:05:11.500> each<00:05:11.650> other<00:05:11.890> that<00:05:12.070> way<00:05:12.340> they<00:05:12.490> make<00:05:12.700> a

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
into each other that way they make a

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.060 
into each other that way they make a
good<00:05:12.940> strong<00:05:13.240> structure<00:05:13.780> this<00:05:14.500> flame<00:05:14.830> is

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
good strong structure this flame is

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.740 
good strong structure this flame is
gonna<00:05:15.280> have<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.460> tie<00:05:15.700> into<00:05:16.000> this<00:05:16.120> flame<00:05:16.420> and

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
gonna have to tie into this flame and

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.180 
gonna have to tie into this flame and
this<00:05:17.110> flame<00:05:17.350> is<00:05:17.470> gonna<00:05:17.620> have<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:17.740> tie<00:05:17.950> into

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
this flame is gonna have to tie into

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.710 
this flame is gonna have to tie into
that<00:05:18.220> flame<00:05:18.610> we're<00:05:19.090> also<00:05:19.210> gonna<00:05:19.450> make<00:05:19.660> some

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
that flame we're also gonna make some

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.690 
that flame we're also gonna make some
modifications<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.980> program

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
modifications to the program

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.490 
modifications to the program
so<00:05:22.090> we've<00:05:22.270> waterjet<00:05:22.690> it<00:05:22.780> out<00:05:22.870> it<00:05:23.050> kind<00:05:23.230> of<00:05:23.290> ties

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
so we've waterjet it out it kind of ties

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.900 
so we've waterjet it out it kind of ties
the<00:05:23.710> flames<00:05:23.950> into<00:05:24.190> each<00:05:24.340> other<00:05:24.520> cuz<00:05:24.730> you<00:05:24.820> don't

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.030 
the flames into each other cuz you don't
want<00:05:25.120> it<00:05:25.180> all<00:05:25.300> flimsy<00:05:25.780> and<00:05:25.840> ridiculous<00:05:26.440> put

wyrick slow go in the tank it's gonna be

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.960 
wyrick slow go in the tank it's gonna be
pretty<00:05:33.340> tricky

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
pretty tricky

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.310 
pretty tricky
cuz<00:05:34.270> there's<00:05:34.419> not<00:05:34.540> really<00:05:34.690> gonna<00:05:34.900> be<00:05:35.080> a<00:05:35.110> lot<00:05:35.290> of

cuz there's not really gonna be a lot of

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.220 
cuz there's not really gonna be a lot of
surface<00:05:35.770> area<00:05:35.890> left<00:05:36.310> you<00:05:36.490> after<00:05:36.850> JQ<00:05:37.840> gets<00:05:38.080> a

surface area left you after JQ gets a

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.590 
surface area left you after JQ gets a
flame<00:05:38.560> pattern<00:05:38.740> cut<00:05:39.100> out<00:05:39.250> Wow<00:05:39.790> it's<00:05:40.300> like

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
flame pattern cut out Wow it's like

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
flame pattern cut out Wow it's like
perfect<00:05:40.870> no<00:05:41.410> kind<00:05:42.220> of<00:05:42.310> creepy<00:05:42.790> okay<00:05:43.470> so<00:05:44.470> right

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
perfect no kind of creepy okay so right

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.800 
perfect no kind of creepy okay so right
now<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:44.919> fits<00:05:45.070> and<00:05:45.340> designed<00:05:45.760> pretty<00:05:46.030> good<00:05:46.210> but

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
now it fits and designed pretty good but

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.300 
now it fits and designed pretty good but
ultimately<00:05:47.229> it's<00:05:47.440> gonna<00:05:47.500> be<00:05:47.710> up<00:05:47.830> to<00:05:47.860> Rick<00:05:48.160> and

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
ultimately it's gonna be up to Rick and

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.860 
ultimately it's gonna be up to Rick and
the<00:05:48.370> other<00:05:48.400> guys<00:05:48.760> to<00:05:49.180> figure<00:05:49.419> out<00:05:49.540> how<00:05:49.630> to<00:05:49.660> get

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
the other guys to figure out how to get

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.810 
the other guys to figure out how to get
it<00:05:50.020> mounted<00:05:50.140> and<00:05:50.560> make<00:05:51.040> it<00:05:51.160> work<00:05:51.310> an<00:05:51.460> actual

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
it mounted and make it work an actual

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.870 
it mounted and make it work an actual
bike<00:05:52.030> I<00:05:52.360> want<00:05:52.750> to<00:05:52.840> take<00:05:52.990> this<00:05:53.140> logo<00:05:53.440> and<00:05:54.430> I<00:05:54.640> want

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
bike I want to take this logo and I want

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.520 
bike I want to take this logo and I want
to<00:05:54.970> shrink<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.390> down<00:05:55.540> so<00:05:55.750> you<00:05:55.810> can<00:05:55.900> barely<00:05:56.350> read

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
to shrink it down so you can barely read

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.560 
to shrink it down so you can barely read
what<00:05:56.740> it<00:05:56.830> says<00:05:57.070> it<00:05:57.760> hold<00:05:57.970> it<00:05:58.120> on<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.360> wheels

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
what it says it hold it on the wheels

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.350 
what it says it hold it on the wheels
okay<00:05:59.260> that's<00:05:59.530> fine<00:05:59.860> you<00:06:00.760> know<00:06:00.790> once<00:06:01.150> we<00:06:01.240> have

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
okay that's fine you know once we have

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.150 
okay that's fine you know once we have
the<00:06:01.419> basic<00:06:01.810> concept<00:06:02.350> and<00:06:02.440> the<00:06:02.560> invisible<00:06:02.950> tank

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
the basic concept and the invisible tank

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.250 
the basic concept and the invisible tank
worked<00:06:03.400> out<00:06:03.610> Jason<00:06:04.270> started<00:06:04.600> on<00:06:04.720> rounding<00:06:05.169> out

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
worked out Jason started on rounding out

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.930 
worked out Jason started on rounding out
the<00:06:05.410> flame<00:06:05.650> theme<00:06:05.950> by<00:06:06.340> designing<00:06:06.760> some

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
the flame theme by designing some

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.360 
the flame theme by designing some
fenders<00:06:07.300> that<00:06:07.330> look<00:06:07.600> like<00:06:07.750> claims<00:06:08.050> to<00:06:08.320> which<00:06:09.250> i

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
fenders that look like claims to which i

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.490 
fenders that look like claims to which i
think<00:06:09.430> is<00:06:09.729> pretty<00:06:09.880> cool<00:06:10.180> because<00:06:10.479> it's<00:06:11.290> easy

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
think is pretty cool because it's easy

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.500 
think is pretty cool because it's easy
to<00:06:11.710> get<00:06:11.860> hokey<00:06:12.280> with<00:06:12.430> rabbits<00:06:12.880> and<00:06:13.000> hats<00:06:13.240> and

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
to get hokey with rabbits and hats and

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.940 
to get hokey with rabbits and hats and
magic<00:06:13.900> wands<00:06:14.140> and<00:06:14.530> things<00:06:14.710> of<00:06:14.800> that<00:06:14.830> nature

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
magic wands and things of that nature

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.680 
magic wands and things of that nature
but<00:06:15.580> the<00:06:15.669> one<00:06:15.820> other<00:06:16.000> thing<00:06:16.270> that<00:06:16.300> Steve

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
but the one other thing that Steve

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.450 
but the one other thing that Steve
wanted<00:06:17.169> was<00:06:17.410> his<00:06:17.560> fingerprints<00:06:18.070> on<00:06:18.160> the<00:06:18.280> bike

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
wanted was his fingerprints on the bike

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.490 
wanted was his fingerprints on the bike
so<00:06:18.970> I<00:06:19.030> think<00:06:19.090> Jason's<00:06:19.660> gonna<00:06:19.840> design<00:06:20.200> it<00:06:20.260> to<00:06:20.410> be

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
so I think Jason's gonna design it to be

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.140 
so I think Jason's gonna design it to be
used<00:06:20.740> on<00:06:20.890> the<00:06:20.979> seat<00:06:21.190> cover<00:06:21.400> and<00:06:21.669> then<00:06:22.000> we'll

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
used on the seat cover and then we'll

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.969 
used on the seat cover and then we'll
have<00:06:22.270> it<00:06:22.360> sent<00:06:22.600> out<00:06:22.690> for<00:06:22.930> Danny<00:06:23.140> gray<00:06:23.350> shop<00:06:23.680> to

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
have it sent out for Danny gray shop to

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.680 
have it sent out for Danny gray shop to
work<00:06:24.100> his<00:06:24.280> own<00:06:24.400> magic<00:06:24.910> at<00:06:25.030> stitching<00:06:25.510> it<00:06:25.600> on

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
work his own magic at stitching it on

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.000 
work his own magic at stitching it on
the<00:06:25.810> leather<00:06:25.990> so<00:06:26.410> hopefully<00:06:26.680> we've<00:06:26.860> got

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
the leather so hopefully we've got

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.830 
the leather so hopefully we've got
enough<00:06:27.250> done

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
enough done

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.030 
enough done
that<00:06:28.080> tomorrow<00:06:28.410> we're<00:06:28.590> gonna<00:06:28.680> throw<00:06:28.920> the

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
that tomorrow we're gonna throw the
