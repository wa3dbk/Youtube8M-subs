00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170
 every conversation 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.150
 they also perform at the fair 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.150
 telecom customer 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.359
 open instead of a conversation 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.869
 at this load 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.679
 and the first impression is not the way 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.820
 scored many goals 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.839
 the problem is back 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.109
 sit in it 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.109
 which saved a long time 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.140
 if you leave a good first impression 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.610
 the gate very long 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.800
 is the customer about that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.660
 because the investors would have to give 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 have agreed 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.870
 Therefore, a thieves pair of needs analysis should be second phase with it 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.190
 the seller the good man and I have 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.070
 the Oldenburger AG provides 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.900
 Madiba information collection 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.260
 14 days were sounded 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.400
 Experiencing them in the city are really moving 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 What could I possibly say and held his hand 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.490
 it does not matter what products there 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.220
 because the producer 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.220
 although this search and more and faster 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.930
 Today, the products are also short-term means to an end 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.530
 but when they get into the product, they do not learn about their products 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.130
 Be hoppers 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.130
 he rated 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.030
 if you like it 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.000
 Wiedeking Porsche the problems are statements 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.320
 what they are 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.320
 who was really spoken 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.670
 now she is weighing his word 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.670
 Haasis calculates 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.390
 it is not quite 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.259
 it is the federal city occupied 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.259
 Of course, it's a 41-year old Passenheim and Daniel 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:14.389
 the stage show Bruttowerbedruck in the south 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.289
 Roland Garros joked 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.289
 but at 7 o'clock Red 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.539
 and in importance 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.179
 since then, be the food 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.179
 why one 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:34.259
 if you prefer over the JahnstraÃŸe 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:38.159
 to bring the wrong arguments also calls with the so-called arguments 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.999
 we advise 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.639
 the sex will be back with his wife 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.549

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.379
 from taxes too 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.669
 that the final phase 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.669
 because most sellers AXA 4 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.999
 and with luck growth 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:09.219
 something more interesting 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.219
 question 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.369
 that of her browser 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.119
 he brings himself up 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:23.119
 but if kept 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.569
 what's best for us to do so 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.929
 Background RWE is lonely 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.649
 he closes the bag 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:37.649
 because of this Schumacher 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:39.769
 the life imprisonment 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.619
 make use 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:43.609
 we also have to go for it 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.609
 was tired 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.060
 Dobos torpedo
