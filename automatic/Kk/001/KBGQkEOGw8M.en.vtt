like<00:00:38.940> most<00:00:39.300> people<00:00:39.570> say<00:00:39.750> go<00:00:40.020> up<00:00:40.170> half<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> size

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
like most people say go up half the size

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.220 
like most people say go up half the size
but<00:00:41.430> when<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.550> tried<00:00:41.850> these<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.450> store<00:00:42.809> they

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
but when I tried these on in store they

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.500 
but when I tried these on in store they
really<00:00:43.590> did<00:00:43.829> feel<00:00:44.250> good<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.850> my<00:00:44.940> natural<00:00:45.120> size

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
really did feel good in my natural size

behind<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.820> netting<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.420> can't<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.439> be

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
behind this netting that can't really be

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.330 
behind this netting that can't really be
seen<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.100> camera<00:01:41.520> it'll<00:01:42.030> say<00:01:42.299> gel<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.130> these

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
