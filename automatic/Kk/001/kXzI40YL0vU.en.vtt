the time solid red lights indicate the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.899 
the time solid red lights indicate the
hour<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:05.509> three<00:02:05.929> red<00:02:06.259> LEDs<00:02:06.890> while<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.670> rest

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
hour so three red LEDs while the rest

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.509 
hour so three red LEDs while the rest
are<00:02:08.179> green<00:02:08.509> means<00:02:09.140> it's<00:02:09.440> currently<00:02:09.890> three

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
are green means it's currently three

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.570 
are green means it's currently three
o'clock<00:02:11.200> once<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.410> time<00:02:12.650> is<00:02:12.680> past<00:02:13.130> six

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
o'clock once the time is past six

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.610 
o'clock once the time is past six
o'clock<00:02:13.940> it's<00:02:14.299> faster<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.110> count<00:02:15.410> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
o'clock it's faster to count the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.690 
o'clock it's faster to count the
remaining<00:02:16.130> green<00:02:16.459> LEDs<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.330> deduct<00:02:18.110> from<00:02:18.290> 12

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
remaining green LEDs and deduct from 12

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.430 
remaining green LEDs and deduct from 12
so<00:02:19.700> if<00:02:19.940> there<00:02:20.150> are<00:02:20.299> four<00:02:20.569> green<00:02:20.900> LEDs

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
so if there are four green LEDs

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.710 
so if there are four green LEDs
remaining<00:02:22.099> it's<00:02:22.430> currently<00:02:22.970> eight<00:02:23.269> o'clock

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
remaining it's currently eight o'clock
