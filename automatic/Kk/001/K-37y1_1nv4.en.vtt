very cool it's the exposed humbuckers
which<00:00:29.970> gives<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> really<00:00:30.630> great<00:00:30.930> sound<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
which gives you a really great sound and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.590 
which gives you a really great sound and
of<00:00:31.949> course<00:00:32.219> you've<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.759> two<00:00:33.180> volume

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
of course you've got the two volume

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.139 
of course you've got the two volume
controls<00:00:33.989> each<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.770> independently<00:00:35.149> runs

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
controls each one independently runs

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.150 
controls each one independently runs
this<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.989> two<00:00:37.170> tone<00:00:37.440> control<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:37.980> each

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
this and the two tone control so each

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.680 
this and the two tone control so each
one<00:00:38.190> independently<00:00:38.609> works<00:00:39.089> on<00:00:39.269> that<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.539> well

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
one independently works on that as well

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.329 
one independently works on that as well
and<00:00:39.960> then<00:00:40.409> you've<00:00:40.530> got<00:00:40.679> the<00:00:40.800> toggle<00:00:41.159> switch

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
and then you've got the toggle switch

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.559 
and then you've got the toggle switch
and<00:00:41.519> what<00:00:41.609> I<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.239> toggle

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:42.569 
and what I like is that the toggle

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:44.119 
and what I like is that the toggle
switches<00:00:42.749> up<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.019> because<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.739> allows<00:00:43.949> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
switches up here because that allows you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.639 
switches up here because that allows you
to<00:00:44.219> do<00:00:44.339> more<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.639> the<00:00:44.760> guitar<00:00:45.260> this<00:00:46.260> has<00:00:46.469> got

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
to do more with the guitar this has got

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.860 
to do more with the guitar this has got
the<00:00:46.920> Indonesian<00:00:47.789> rosewood<00:00:47.969> fingerboard<00:00:48.359> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
