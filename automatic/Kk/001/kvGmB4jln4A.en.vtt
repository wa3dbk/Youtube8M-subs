00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.130
 they say what list is needed 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.290

 card get a card and how to bring 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.770
 Well, at least such a procedure from here conclusion 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.620
 how much hair is 100 about some such 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.200
 here 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.690
 branching do not know how some 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.430
 options are we tell all that 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.500
 we know from krakÃ³w my soon him in 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.459
 Katowice I called in Katowice found out

 the word you need is just going through everything 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.709
 it turned out you do not want questions cosine 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.910
