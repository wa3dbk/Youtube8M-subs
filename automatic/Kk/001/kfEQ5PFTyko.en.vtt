00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
have done from carbon fiber the original

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.190 
have done from carbon fiber the original
was<00:00:35.969> actually<00:00:37.940> that<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.420> blue<00:00:39.690> aluminum

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
was actually that one in blue aluminum

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
if now carbon and titanium screws but

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.140 
if now carbon and titanium screws but
these<00:01:01.780> are<00:01:02.080> actually<00:01:02.950> very<00:01:03.490> long<00:01:03.790> I<00:01:03.820> don't

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
to hold this actual part here they go

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.040 
to hold this actual part here they go
straight<00:01:16.720> through<00:01:17.410> here<00:01:18.400> and<00:01:19.270> start<00:01:19.630> here<00:01:19.900> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
attach to to the gear housing yep

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.900 
attach to to the gear housing yep
controlling<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:34.150> of<00:01:34.270> course<00:01:34.509> on<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.869> front

there's the small one yep actually you

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.130 
there's the small one yep actually you
can<00:01:42.910> see<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.210> right<00:01:43.360> now<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.810> good<00:01:44.020> because

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
can see it right now that good because

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.950 
can see it right now that good because
there<00:01:44.590> is<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.770> cover<00:01:45.400> on<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:48.630> also<00:01:49.630> replace

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
there is a cover on it I also replace

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.219 
there is a cover on it I also replace
this<00:01:50.410> one<00:01:50.619> with<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.890> carbon<00:01:51.700> fiber<00:01:51.970> can<00:01:52.900> you<00:01:53.020> see

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
this one with a carbon fiber can you see

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.800 
this one with a carbon fiber can you see
that<00:01:54.929> really<00:01:55.929> and<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.729> found<00:01:57.910> out<00:01:58.119> that<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.539> the

pizzas<00:02:45.130> 80<00:02:45.600> millimeter<00:02:46.860> actually<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.890> little

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
pizzas 80 millimeter actually a little

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.340 
pizzas 80 millimeter actually a little
shorter<00:02:48.580> than<00:02:48.819> the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
shorter than the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.530 
shorter than the
digital<00:02:49.620> ones<00:02:49.830> especially<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.120> back<00:02:51.300> but

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
digital ones especially in the back but

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.710 
digital ones especially in the back but
that<00:02:51.840> doesn't<00:02:52.230> matter<00:02:52.320> because<00:02:56.330> yeah<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.360> will

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
that doesn't matter because yeah I will

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.670 
that doesn't matter because yeah I will
replace<00:02:58.380> as<00:02:58.770> i<00:02:59.070> already<00:02:59.280> said<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.780> shock

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
replace as i already said the the shock

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.780 
replace as i already said the the shock
towers<00:03:02.130> with<00:03:03.410> carbon<00:03:04.410> fiber<00:03:04.650> one<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.310> i<00:03:05.550> will

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
towers with carbon fiber one and i will

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.020 
towers with carbon fiber one and i will
make<00:03:07.520> them<00:03:08.520> more<00:03:09.270> together<00:03:10.670> with<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.700> lower

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
make them more together with a lower

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.680 
make them more together with a lower
point<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.630> gravity<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.760> here<00:03:14.760> i<00:03:14.970> have<00:03:15.360> those

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
point of gravity and here i have those

meter I don't know if you can see this

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.290 
meter I don't know if you can see this
and<00:04:02.840> they're<00:04:03.740> full<00:04:04.010> aluminum<00:04:04.610> of<00:04:04.790> course<00:04:05.030> and

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
and they're full aluminum of course and

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:13.430 
and they're full aluminum of course and
also<00:04:05.870> this<00:04:06.290> this<00:04:06.650> cap<00:04:06.980> here<00:04:08.620> this

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.200 

I<00:04:13.500> mean<00:04:14.160> not<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.520> one<00:04:14.670> where<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.030> hole<00:04:15.180> is

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
I mean not the one where the hole is

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.390 
I mean not the one where the hole is
inside<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:16.350> sting<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.790> it's<00:04:17.790> also<00:04:18.030> aluminum

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
inside to sting you it's also aluminum

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.350 
inside to sting you it's also aluminum
yep<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:21.560> also<00:04:22.560> saw<00:04:22.890> someone<00:04:23.310> with<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.460> back<00:04:24.000> tre

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
yep I also saw someone with a back tre

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.590 
yep I also saw someone with a back tre
but<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:25.500> don't<00:04:26.100> know<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> main<00:04:26.820> day<00:04:27.060> they<00:04:27.360> look

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
but I don't know a main day they look

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.300 
but I don't know a main day they look
pretty<00:04:27.900> cool<00:04:28.200> with<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.530> back<00:04:28.830> tre<00:04:29.130> but<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:31.310> don't

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
pretty cool with a back tre but I don't

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.150 
pretty cool with a back tre but I don't
know<00:04:32.430> what<00:04:32.640> what<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.300> good<00:04:33.780> for<00:04:34.020> or<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.440> mean

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
know what what is good for or I mean

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.300 
know what what is good for or I mean
it's<00:04:35.640> also<00:04:35.850> kind<00:04:36.540> of<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:37.590> was<00:04:37.890> complicated

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
it's also kind of it was complicated

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.630 
it's also kind of it was complicated
when<00:04:39.230> you<00:04:40.230> actually<00:04:40.440> want<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:40.920> build<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.400> car

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
when you actually want to build a car

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.240 
when you actually want to build a car
with<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.030> very<00:04:42.810> less<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.820> white<00:04:45.950> where<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.100> need

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
with a very less of white where you need

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.920 
with a very less of white where you need
back<00:04:47.490> traits<00:04:47.760> for<00:04:48.030> then<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.450> guess<00:04:48.630> they're

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
back traits for then I guess they're

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.230 
back traits for then I guess they're
good<00:04:49.170> for<00:04:49.380> rock<00:04:50.190> crawler<00:04:50.490> tracks<00:04:51.030> or

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
good for rock crawler tracks or

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.450 
good for rock crawler tracks or
something<00:04:51.600> I<00:04:51.840> didn't<00:04:52.770> figure<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:53.100> out<00:04:53.190> that

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
something I didn't figure it out that

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:01.160 
something I didn't figure it out that
much<00:04:53.700> but<00:04:56.000> they're<00:04:57.080> sharks<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:59.300> will<00:05:00.300> replace<00:05:00.810> I

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
much but they're sharks I will replace I

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
much but they're sharks I will replace I
already<00:05:02.010> replace<00:05:02.730> this<00:05:03.440> with<00:05:04.440> carbon<00:05:04.950> fiber

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
already replace this with carbon fiber

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:13.400 
already replace this with carbon fiber
parts<00:05:07.250> added<00:05:08.250> two<00:05:08.520> new<00:05:08.960> screws<00:05:12.410> titanium

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410
