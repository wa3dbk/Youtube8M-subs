took<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> her<00:00:52.079> very<00:00:52.860> quickly<00:00:56.210> now<00:00:57.210> one<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
took to her very quickly now one of the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.240 
took to her very quickly now one of the
things<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.870> enjoyed<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.410> my<00:00:58.530> bird<00:00:58.800> was<00:00:58.829> that

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
things I enjoyed about my bird was that

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220 
things I enjoyed about my bird was that
he<00:00:59.340> would<00:00:59.460> sit<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.670> my<00:00:59.850> arm<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.300> eat<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.780> in

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
he would sit on my arm and eat and in

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
he would sit on my arm and eat and in
fact<00:01:01.500> most<00:01:02.100> people<00:01:02.219> who<00:01:02.609> handle<00:01:02.789> birds<00:01:03.120> get

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
fact most people who handle birds get

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.609 
fact most people who handle birds get
them<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.899> sit<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.110> their<00:01:04.320> arm<00:01:04.820> like<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.500> but<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
them to sit on their arm like so but it

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.320 
them to sit on their arm like so but it
seems<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.890> because<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> Goliath's<00:01:08.760> injury

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
seems that because of Goliath's injury

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.750 
seems that because of Goliath's injury
he<00:01:10.080> wasn't<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.500> into<00:01:10.920> sitting<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.580> your

bit and tried to get him to jump up
knowing<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.260> if<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.710> was<00:02:18.950> bad<00:02:19.190> he'd<00:02:19.490> come

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
knowing that if it was bad he'd come

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.190 
knowing that if it was bad he'd come
down<00:02:19.730> on<00:02:20.030> his<00:02:20.150> leg<00:02:20.330> kind<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.660> hard<00:02:20.930> and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
down on his leg kind of hard and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.680 
down on his leg kind of hard and
wouldn't<00:02:21.560> be<00:02:21.620> able<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.830> get<00:02:21.950> away<00:02:22.190> quickly

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
wouldn't be able to get away quickly

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.580 
wouldn't be able to get away quickly
that<00:02:23.690> means<00:02:23.900> he<00:02:24.020> wouldn't<00:02:24.230> be<00:02:24.290> able<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.470> get

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
that means he wouldn't be able to get

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.780 
that means he wouldn't be able to get
away<00:02:24.770> from<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:25.070> predator<00:02:25.630> under<00:02:26.630> an<00:02:26.750> attack<00:02:27.790> not

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
away from a predator under an attack not

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.470 
away from a predator under an attack not
a<00:02:28.820> good<00:02:29.030> sign

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
a good sign

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.440 
a good sign
I<00:02:30.460> certainly<00:02:31.460> wouldn't<00:02:31.850> feel<00:02:32.030> comfortable

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.210 
I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable
releasing<00:02:32.690> this<00:02:33.050> bird<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.500> wild<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:39.220> so

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
releasing this bird to the wild and so

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.070 
releasing this bird to the wild and so
now<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.460> real<00:02:40.790> fun<00:02:41.030> begins<00:02:41.060> for<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.780> owners

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
now the real fun begins for the owners

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.920 
now the real fun begins for the owners
and<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:43.040> can't<00:02:43.340> wait<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:44.120> hear<00:02:44.270> their<00:02:44.480> stories

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
and I can't wait to hear their stories

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.780 
and I can't wait to hear their stories
ESCA<00:02:45.710> life<00:02:45.890> grows<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:48.160> matures<00:02:51.520> we<00:02:52.520> hope<00:02:52.670> to
