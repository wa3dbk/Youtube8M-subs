of<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:10.280> newer<00:00:11.300> book<00:00:12.950> design<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.460> i<00:00:14.490> am<00:00:14.759> trying

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
of a newer book design that i am trying

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.169 
of a newer book design that i am trying
out

this<00:00:18.179> is<00:00:18.419> a<00:00:19.789> adaptation<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:22.279> valve<00:00:23.279> design

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
this is a adaptation of a valve design

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.549 
this is a adaptation of a valve design
that<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.179> use<00:00:24.539> already<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:25.439> there<00:00:25.910> trapani<00:00:26.910> /

community<00:00:28.559> I<00:00:28.829> just<00:00:29.789> nearly<00:00:30.059> make<00:00:30.660> it

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
community I just nearly make it

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.530 
community I just nearly make it
different

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.450 

this<00:00:36.540> function<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.560> that<00:00:37.980> auto<00:00:38.730> siphon

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
this function just like that auto siphon

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.500 
this function just like that auto siphon
to<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> tube<00:00:43.130> the<00:00:44.130> reason<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.700> need<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> use

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
to the tube the reason I need to use

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.670 
to the tube the reason I need to use
this<00:00:45.780> part<00:00:46.290> mr.<00:00:47.030> because<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.270> need<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:51.470> hook<00:00:52.470> up

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
this part mr. because I need to hook up

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.950 
this part mr. because I need to hook up
a<00:00:53.580> lot<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> prop<00:00:54.660> bit<00:00:55.489> smaller<00:00:56.489> droopy<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
a lot of prop bit smaller droopy and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.820 
a lot of prop bit smaller droopy and
then<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.080> can<00:01:01.290> only<00:01:01.650> use<00:01:01.980> one<00:01:02.280> arm<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:04.160> 11<00:01:06.830> let

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
then I can only use one arm and 11 let

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.980 
then I can only use one arm and 11 let
me<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.160> through<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.670> system<00:01:09.509> I<00:01:10.729> have<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:12.810> this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
me go through the system I have in this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.720 
me go through the system I have in this
particular<00:01:13.820> example<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:17.360> for<00:01:18.360> growth<00:01:18.540> be

or a bottom or two crooked and bring
them<00:01:41.680> up<00:01:41.800> together<00:01:42.420> don't<00:01:43.420> mind<00:01:43.600> that<00:01:43.750> will

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
them up together don't mind that will

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.560 
them up together don't mind that will
the<00:01:44.050> leak<00:01:44.230> because<00:01:44.620> I<00:01:44.650> do<00:01:44.830> not<00:01:45.010> put<00:01:45.220> any<00:01:45.400> glue

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the leak because I do not put any glue

the leak because I do not put any glue
on<00:01:46.570> this<00:01:47.520> system<00:01:48.520> is<00:01:48.730> just<00:01:49.600> I'm<00:01:49.960> just<00:01:49.990> testing

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
on this system is just I'm just testing

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.410 
on this system is just I'm just testing
it<00:01:50.770> out<00:01:51.330> okay<00:01:52.410> this<00:01:53.410> common<00:01:54.130> manifold<00:01:54.730> at<00:01:55.000> the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
it out okay this common manifold at the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.520 
it out okay this common manifold at the
bottom<00:01:55.870> of<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.200> clock<00:01:56.410> Bill<00:01:56.620> is<00:01:57.490> where<00:01:57.760> you

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
bottom of the clock Bill is where you

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.200 
bottom of the clock Bill is where you
root<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.710> water<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.030> fish<00:02:01.840> tank<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:03.210> you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
root the water to the fish tank and you

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.090 
root the water to the fish tank and you
have<00:02:06.060> swivel<00:02:07.060> point<00:02:07.420> appeared<00:02:08.290> after<00:02:08.440> here<00:02:08.860> to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
have swivel point appeared after here to

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.790 
have swivel point appeared after here to
make<00:02:09.310> at<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.700> swivel<00:02:10.180> point<00:02:10.500> where<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.620> water

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
make at the swivel point where the water

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.770 
make at the swivel point where the water
will<00:02:12.070> go<00:02:12.220> up<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:13.920> then<00:02:14.920> back<00:02:15.310> down<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:16.750> the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
will go up and then back down to the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.320 
will go up and then back down to the
outlet

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.800 

this<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.780> where<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.890> cyclin<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.550> created<00:02:25.640> okay

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
this is where the cyclin is created okay

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.970 
this is where the cyclin is created okay
with<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.960> arrangement<00:02:28.940> one<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:31.080> buff<00:02:31.530> can

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
with this arrangement one this buff can

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.390 
with this arrangement one this buff can
be<00:02:32.220> swivel<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> different<00:02:36.090> position<00:02:37.400> so

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
be swivel to a different position so

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.740 
be swivel to a different position so
that<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.650> adjust<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:41.520> water<00:02:41.730> level<00:02:42.210> in

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
that you can adjust the water level in

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.020 
that you can adjust the water level in
your<00:02:42.990> group<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.470> if<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.280> want<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.760> have<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
your group it if you want to have a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.450 
your group it if you want to have a
higher<00:02:45.330> water<00:02:45.630> level<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.230> can<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.620> put<00:02:46.920> it

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
higher water level you can just put it

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.020 
higher water level you can just put it
back<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:48.780> vertical<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.520> reach<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
back to vertical and reach it to the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.300 
back to vertical and reach it to the
beach<00:02:51.180> oh<00:02:51.330> ok<00:02:52.550> right<00:02:54.020> also<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:55.230> think<00:02:55.350> operated

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
beach oh ok right also I think operated

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.490 
beach oh ok right also I think operated
trick<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:58.920> particular<00:02:59.720> team<00:03:00.720> at<00:03:01.320> the
