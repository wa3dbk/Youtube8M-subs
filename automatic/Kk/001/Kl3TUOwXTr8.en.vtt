00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.700
 so dear friends let's see 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.340
 how are our wonderful coleus 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.049
 Here is a huge variety of leafy 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.510
 plates so beautiful charming 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.720
 there was a pass of fear these plants 2 4 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.449
 January directly to the ground without 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.099
 naturally no prior 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.859
 soaking should not be because 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.250
 these are very small seeds and what we have 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.420
 here rented parnichok 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.120
 and we are watching the seeds literally 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.110
 by 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:46.710
 I do not know 7 10 stuff was on I mean them 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.110
 I divided it like this into 4 parts and we are with you 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.260
 we have an idea where that grows 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.699
 thanks to these girls that's good 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.670
 it is clear that this corner went well d 1 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.329
 grade 2 is another grade and here is the third grade 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.820
 so the fourth is but very very small 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.850
 if you can if i can like here 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.260
 take off this little corner you will see 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.150
 and so quietly rises in this 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.880
 container for you see that is 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.740
 worse with as is the case that very very 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.450
 pleases 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:28.710
 here m green cap but will reveal a secret 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:34.680
 this cap did not look for wsof this is cineraria i 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.170
 in one container I try not to do that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.880
 but again made in one container 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.439
 planted 20 silver cineraria 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.409
 the pool and here in this in this side 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.979
 very well ascended her enough 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.420
 a large number I would no longer need 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.000
 this material will go in order 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.200
 diversify so to speak plant through 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.360
 once with these poles yes that is 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.570
 if I can grow them all the same 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.369
 I want to believe it between them 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.890
 you can alternate cineraria be very 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.520
 very pretty and here is literally 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.400
 there were only 5 seeds of this variety 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.190
 velvet night wheels 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.980
 also the 24th was all 7 out of five 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.310
 I see 3d now and you are not 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.580
 one-two-three shoots maybe two more 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:34.010
 will rise until I take the greenhouse for now 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:38.650
 leave here next to these containers 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.019
 on these containers and wait until the end 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.319
 all varieties will appear 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.660
 I want it to somehow take place 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:52.010
 tenderness called sort of here it turned out 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.540
 most most the outcome here it similar such 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.640
 the motive is swollen and here it is 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.150
 hops up for a weak wait for that 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:07.700
 It turns out that's such a beauty 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:11.359
 I hope we grow up so dear friends 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.850
 look peppers March 3, my planted 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.850
 its February 1 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.859
 Here is a seedling just a little bit for you 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.170
 probably centimeter podtseplyu more 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:24.320
 just can't 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.769
 two true leaves in it don't have 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.579
 Seat 7 thinkers are generally gorgeous beautiful 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:35.859
 yes, but we continue to grow this miracle 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:41.420
 california so today i sprayed 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:44.340
 sheet plate and 4 101 1 drop on the floor 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.480
 liters for 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.890
 that the bow was better and so 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.800
 February 23 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.700
 we sat down with you tomatoes here torch I 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.640
 ascended as a very sunny window is not 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.480
 even took a little leaves appear 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.670
 This leaflet is the first one 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.250
 nick say sprinkle need to do 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.590
 You can make tomato and tomato 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.840
 so I leave the edge along the length and 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.180
 here's the pepper is still not desirable here 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.329
 a root system will be formed 23 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.690
 February sowed tomatoes here today 3 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.800
 March is now as if a little bit 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.540
 only the first real one hops 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.820
 leaf we actually rush 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.750
 nowhere ahead 2 quotes to 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.930
 retard growth 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.840
 so that the plant does not outgrow here 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.220
 and it's time too long 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.130
 pulled out shkolke 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.950
 but everyone prepares for a picking as soon as 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.169
 there will be one two true leaflets you can 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.270
 start to pick now need 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.710
 hold back growth for this i open slightly 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.880
 window window is sunny enough and therefore 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.690
 lunchtime 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.139
 rises but not desirable for tomatoes 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.710
 so high for peppers good a tomato 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:06.030
 I ought to be cool 20-23 degrees and I 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.490
 all 2527 so here's a little bit such 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.860
 imbalance and tomatoes are drawn out but 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.060
 nothing i think they will stand and 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.460
 ahead without fail 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:24.030
 treat phytosporin here are black legs 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:26.150
 and tomatoes and tomatoes it as soon as will 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.450
 dry up the ground I will immediately spill 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.570
 it's paired here's what vegetable 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.570
 cultures
