00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
you got to that folder you have to

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.229 
you got to that folder you have to
search<00:00:47.920> spotlight<00:00:48.400> every<00:00:48.610> time<00:00:48.790> so<00:00:49.030> in<00:00:49.120> that

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
search spotlight every time so in that

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.060 
search spotlight every time so in that
scenario<00:00:49.449> you<00:00:50.260> would<00:00:50.350> want<00:00:50.559> to<00:00:50.619> know<00:00:50.650> the<00:00:50.830> full

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
scenario you would want to know the full

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.149 
scenario you would want to know the full
path<00:00:51.369> of<00:00:51.580> a<00:00:51.699> file<00:00:52.080> so<00:00:53.080> that<00:00:53.290> you<00:00:53.559> can<00:00:53.710> access<00:00:53.890> it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
path of a file so that you can access it

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.950 
path of a file so that you can access it
easier<00:00:54.489> next<00:00:54.820> time<00:00:54.970> you<00:00:55.479> also<00:00:55.659> might<00:00:55.930> be

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
easier next time you also might be

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.630 
easier next time you also might be
connecting<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:56.619> a<00:00:56.650> server<00:00:56.979> uploading

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
connecting to a server uploading

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.219 
connecting to a server uploading
downloading<00:00:57.760> files<00:00:58.269> and<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:58.869> need<00:00:59.019> to<00:00:59.110> know

00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.229 
downloading files and you need to know

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:00.570 
downloading files and you need to know
the<00:00:59.379> full<00:00:59.619> path<00:00:59.860> of<00:01:00.100> where<00:01:00.190> something<00:01:00.549> is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
the full path of where something is

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.189 
the full path of where something is
located<00:01:00.970> so<00:01:01.089> again<00:01:01.690> there's<00:01:01.900> many<00:01:01.989> different

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
located so again there's many different

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.810 
located so again there's many different
situations<00:01:03.010> why<00:01:03.190> you<00:01:03.250> might<00:01:03.519> need<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.790> know

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
situations why you might need to know

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.429 
situations why you might need to know
this<00:01:04.180> but<00:01:04.420> this<00:01:04.540> is<00:01:04.689> how<00:01:04.780> you<00:01:04.809> can<00:01:05.049> find<00:01:05.290> it<00:01:05.379> and

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
this but this is how you can find it and

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.480 
this but this is how you can find it and
there's<00:01:05.590> two<00:01:05.740> different<00:01:05.860> ways<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.250> do<00:01:06.340> this

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
there's two different ways to do this

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.640 
there's two different ways to do this
first<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:07.240> all<00:01:07.360> just<00:01:07.630> for<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.869> real<00:01:08.080> quick<00:01:08.439> I

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
first of all just for the real quick I

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.110 
first of all just for the real quick I
want<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:09.130> know<00:01:09.220> where<00:01:09.369> this<00:01:09.460> file<00:01:09.729> is<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:10.000> don't

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
want to know where this file is I don't

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.700 
want to know where this file is I don't
really<00:01:10.300> care<00:01:10.600> about<00:01:10.720> always<00:01:11.230> seeing<00:01:11.500> where

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
really care about always seeing where

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.160 
really care about always seeing where
files<00:01:11.950> are<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.730> can<00:01:13.000> right-click<00:01:13.720> on<00:01:14.020> your

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
files are you can right-click on your

document and hit get info and in this
box<00:01:17.260> that<00:01:17.380> pops<00:01:17.680> up<00:01:17.920> there's<00:01:18.850> going<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.210> be<00:01:19.330> an

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
box that pops up there's going to be an

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.080 
box that pops up there's going to be an
area<00:01:20.620> where<00:01:20.770> under<00:01:21.310> general<00:01:21.700> where<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:21.910> says

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
area where under general where it says

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.490 
area where under general where it says
where<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.660> it<00:01:22.780> will<00:01:22.870> tell<00:01:23.080> you<00:01:23.170> that<00:01:23.260> it's<00:01:23.410> in

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
where and it will tell you that it's in

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.440 
where and it will tell you that it's in
the<00:01:23.590> users<00:01:23.920> folders<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.910> users<00:01:25.240> folder

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
the users folders the users folder

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.870 
the users folders the users folder
tutorial<00:01:26.200> documents<00:01:26.860> tests<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.550> then<00:01:27.760> the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
tutorial documents tests and then the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.180 
tutorial documents tests and then the
images<00:01:28.240> folder<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:28.990> I<00:01:29.020> can<00:01:29.170> see<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.560> path<00:01:30.010> of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
images folder so I can see the path of

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.060 
images folder so I can see the path of
