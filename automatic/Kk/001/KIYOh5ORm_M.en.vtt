just in case you wanted to know how big
the<00:01:44.229> Xbox<00:01:44.619> one<00:01:44.860> is<00:01:45.010> here<00:01:45.280> it<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.460> with<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.850> Xbox

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
the Xbox one is here it is with the Xbox

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.710 
the Xbox one is here it is with the Xbox
360<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:47.290> just<00:01:48.070> for<00:01:48.310> comparison's<00:01:49.090> sake<00:01:49.299> let's

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
360 and just for comparison's sake let's

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.630 
360 and just for comparison's sake let's
go<00:01:49.869> ahead<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.229> throw<00:01:50.350> in<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.710> PlayStation<00:01:51.369> 4

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
go ahead and throw in the PlayStation 4

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.700 
go ahead and throw in the PlayStation 4
so<00:01:52.000> as<00:01:52.330> you<00:01:52.510> can<00:01:52.630> see<00:01:52.690> this<00:01:52.930> thing<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.290> pretty

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
so as you can see this thing is pretty

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.280 
so as you can see this thing is pretty
massive<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:54.760> it's<00:01:55.180> even<00:01:55.540> bigger<00:01:55.810> than<00:01:56.049> the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
massive and it's even bigger than the

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.070 
massive and it's even bigger than the
ps4<00:01:56.979> with<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.520> camera<00:01:57.939> stacked<00:01:58.240> on<00:01:58.479> top<00:01:58.510> of<00:01:58.810> it

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
ps4 with the camera stacked on top of it

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.660 
ps4 with the camera stacked on top of it
so<00:01:59.290> if<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.770> tells<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.100> anything<00:02:00.159> make<00:02:00.640> sure

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
so if that tells you anything make sure

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.219 
so if that tells you anything make sure
you<00:02:00.820> have<00:02:00.909> room<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:01.270> this<00:02:01.360> thing<00:02:01.630> on<00:02:01.840> your

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
you have room for this thing on your

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.750 
you have room for this thing on your
entertainment<00:02:02.740> center<00:02:02.979> but<00:02:03.369> enough<00:02:03.610> with

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
entertainment center but enough with

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.460 
entertainment center but enough with
comparisons<00:02:04.450> let's<00:02:04.689> go<00:02:04.780> ahead<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.110> check<00:02:05.290> out

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
comparisons let's go ahead and check out

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.980 
comparisons let's go ahead and check out
all<00:02:05.680> of<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.920> included<00:02:06.700> accessories<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.900> as

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
all of the included accessories and as

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.260 
all of the included accessories and as
you<00:02:08.170> can<00:02:08.259> see<00:02:08.410> here<00:02:08.619> we<00:02:08.740> have<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:09.280> Xbox<00:02:09.819> one

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
you can see here we have the Xbox one

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.120 
you can see here we have the Xbox one
Kinect<00:02:10.690> sensor<00:02:11.080> which<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.380> much<00:02:11.560> larger<00:02:11.830> than

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
Kinect sensor which is much larger than

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.670 
Kinect sensor which is much larger than
it<00:02:12.280> spread

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
it spread

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.160 
it spread
and<00:02:13.220> actually<00:02:13.549> has<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.970> fan<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.689> the<00:02:14.780> back<00:02:14.959> so<00:02:15.140> I

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
and actually has a fan on the back so I

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.750 
and actually has a fan on the back so I
guess<00:02:15.379> Microsoft<00:02:15.920> expects<00:02:16.310> this<00:02:16.430> thing<00:02:16.640> to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
guess Microsoft expects this thing to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.270 
guess Microsoft expects this thing to
get<00:02:16.939> pretty<00:02:17.390> warm<00:02:17.629> during<00:02:18.079> usage<00:02:18.290> now<00:02:18.980> coming

this controller is all you get for the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.349 
this controller is all you get for the
day<00:02:57.439> one<00:02:57.739> package<00:02:58.129> and<00:02:58.310> as<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.549> can<00:02:58.639> see<00:02:58.700> it's

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
day one package and as you can see it's

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:00.819 
day one package and as you can see it's
really<00:02:59.689> no<00:02:59.959> different<00:02:59.989> than<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.680> regular

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
really no different than the regular

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.349 
really no different than the regular
controller<00:03:01.430> just<00:03:01.609> kind<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.090> little

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
controller just kind of a little

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.539 
controller just kind of a little
keepsake<00:03:02.599> I<00:03:03.019> guess<00:03:03.290> with<00:03:03.859> the<00:03:04.069> metallic

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
keepsake I guess with the metallic

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.789 
keepsake I guess with the metallic
keypad<00:03:04.879> in<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> day<00:03:05.329> one<00:03:05.599> portion<00:03:06.109> now<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.500> had

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
keypad in the day one portion now I had

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.349 
keypad in the day one portion now I had
a<00:03:06.829> little<00:03:07.040> chance<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.609> go<00:03:07.849> through<00:03:08.090> some<00:03:08.329> of

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
a little chance to go through some of

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.210 
a little chance to go through some of
the<00:03:08.480> menus<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:08.989> stuff<00:03:09.109> on<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.590> Xbox<00:03:09.980> one

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
and as you can see it's definitely

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.229

looking<00:03:12.590> different<00:03:13.129> than<00:03:13.189> the<00:03:13.459> 360<00:03:14.000> we<00:03:14.090> have<00:03:14.209> a

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
looking different than the 360 we have a

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.319
