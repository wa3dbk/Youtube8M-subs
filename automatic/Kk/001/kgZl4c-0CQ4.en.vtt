00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
ultimately collapsed I mean it a lot of

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.380 
ultimately collapsed I mean it a lot of
it<00:06:26.690> just<00:06:26.870> didn't<00:06:27.140> make<00:06:27.260> sense<00:06:27.470> to<00:06:27.620> me<00:06:28.150> why<00:06:29.150> it's

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
it just didn't make sense to me why it's

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.020 
it just didn't make sense to me why it's
occurring<00:06:29.810> but<00:06:30.050> at<00:06:30.229> the<00:06:30.380> same<00:06:30.590> time<00:06:30.950> here<00:06:31.850> you
