00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.120
 in the early 60's the monoculture of 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.340
 sugar cane dominate the landscape 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.290
 agricultural and social life of the island 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.790
 it's a world stuck in 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.590
 archaic structures and whose 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.130
 economic performance declines 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.130
 worrying way 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.550
 to halt the aging of 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.410
 plantations an ambitious program of 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.440
 modernization is born and the 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.640
 researchers they are immediately associated 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.010
 one of the central issues is 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.800
 then the mechanization of the harvest 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.930
 currently observes a trend 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.460
 to some disaffection of the hand 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.550
 concerning the work of the 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.140
 fields therefore it will be absolutely 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.839
 indispensable in the near future of 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.460
 mechanize almost all 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.460
 operations in culture of cowes 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.220
 and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.630
 in a constant dialogue with 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.159
 planters and technicians the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.689
 researchers in machinery develops 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.939
 tools adapted to the conditions 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.189
 Reunionese a step of listening 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.299
 innovation that has never stopped since 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.950
 it corresponds to needs 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.560
 matched demand of agriculture 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.490
 Reunionese with for seimat a 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.780
 work an important goal was 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.039
 adapted to local conditions that are 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.840
 very hard and that are very different 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.640
 to find elsewhere the different 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.079
 materials for modern agriculture of 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.090
 tomorrow in terms of fertilization the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.159
 practices of the 70s are still very 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.170
 summary setting up the laboratory 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.880
 analyzed soil will allow 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.000
 to significantly refine the strategy 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.959
 manure with an immediate impact on the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.490
 yield 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.740
 we must pass the gardens first 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.170
 stage tried to personalize the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.030
 manure per plot define needs 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.009
 of a plot and then maybe by the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.530
 Following split the following contributions 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.780
 the needs to follow the needs of the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.569
 can by foliar diagnoses for at 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.130
 each time improve the quality of the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.130
 nutrition to the needs of the plant 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.950
 in the field of genetics 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.900
 Cirad is the privileged interlocutor 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.850
 of the Center for Variety Creation of the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.709
 union of sugar manufacturers who 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.569
 has been working for a long time 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.940
 point of the varieties Reunion each 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.290
 100 degrees to create creating varieties that 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.360
 adapts to their own conditions 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.590
 ecological 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.660
 We are thus led to create 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.760
 varieties that adapted to our conditions 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.860
 of own production and the criterion 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.480
 number one well in the EU remains the 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.180
 productivity ie the yield 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.130
 maximum income to the state for the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.470
 planter throughout this 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.150
 collaboration with the circle the cirad has 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.340
 could benefit the sugar sector 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.350
 most scientific breakthroughs 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.600
 promising we started to care 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.150
 of in vitro culture in the 80s 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.980
 82 for a research program 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.690
 fundamental about sugar cane on 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.459
 wanted to study the possibilities 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.480
 of obtaining variants, that is to say of 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.769
 different plants from mother plants 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.950
 by treatments of these plants in 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.480
 in vitro culture in the laboratory as 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.340
 in the fields the researchers have 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.900
 always privileged the partnership with 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.320
 other actors in the cane industry 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.150
 sugar 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.549
 all together they managed to 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.130
 transform the sector and can more 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.940
 that never remains a central element of 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.940
 Reunion agriculture
