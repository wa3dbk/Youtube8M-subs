00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 today extra with tutorials from Oman is very 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.910
 simple can be used for the 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.910
 New Year's Eve and Christmas party I hope 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.800
 that you like it and let's go to the papacy 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.500
 Always remember to place a test 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.109
 for the shade to use this tone 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.529
 show that with vanity gray palette 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.630
 lose prestige and with this brush I will 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.260
 apply all the shadow around the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.359
 eyelid rising a little bit over the 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:32.340
 basin and then I will use 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.250
 the brush estimated 45 using the tone 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.160
 top night of the same palette and I'm going to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.950
 place it in the basin to make a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.020
 Transition from one color to another this bag 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.170
 is very good to blur take your 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.170
 weather 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.000
 next I will use a brush 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.300
 much bigger to blur both 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.810
 colors so that the edges are not so 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.480
 abrupt 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.050
 then use the brulee tone and 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.050
 the brush 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.300
 and then use this tone as 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.300
 highlight remember always blur 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.729
 so that the edges are not so sharp 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.280
 and use the palette paris and the tone and 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.530
 fer who is a black man at home and I'm going to 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.040
 place with an angled brush 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.360
 only in the corner of the eye 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.330
 connecting with the line of the tabs 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.509
 superior and with the previous brush 10a 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.110
 I'm going to blur the corners still 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:39.110
 applying as much black shadow as 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.210
 want to give it depth and 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.670
 dimension to the eye only remember that 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.660
 you should blur very well you can use 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.630
 the same gray color show on the part 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:54.080
 lower eye connect those colors 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.159
 I 'll leave you a third without the shadow 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.700
 to place then a highlighter 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:05.259
 this is a tone it's like vanilla is 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.509
 golden very nice excellent to open 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.539
 the eye that looks cooler 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.500
 having contrast with a look 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.959
 relatively smoked and remember 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.849
 always always blur depending on 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.069
 the intensity you want is placing 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.989
 the shadow and at the end they have to touch up 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.450
 a little bit with the main shadow what 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.910
 can do with a black line this 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.080
 of prestige I will delineate my eyelashes 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.080
 superior and inferior 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.590
 to give a 1 or a smoky finish 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.170
 now with this brush he stretched the pencil 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.890
 I'm going to blur so it does not look so 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.890
 abrupt 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.700
 and to seal I use an eyeliner 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.740
 liquid so that it is much more intense 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.740
 the color and connect fine 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.390
 remember to make your tabs 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.330
 I'm going to use a mask first to 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.090
 comb the upper lashes e 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.420
 inferiors and then I'm going to 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.020
 use the prestige mask the 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.349
 beams effect mask and I'm going to apply 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.750
 again it would be two full layers 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.090
 for the eyes outside says a lashes 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.550
 happen if you want 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.040
 now I'm going to delineate the water line 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.720
 superior and inferior this makes what 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.720
 be a little more dramatic 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.430
 then I have the base 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.300
 I have everything but I'm going to place 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.300
 corrector 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.110
 I'm going to put translucent powder of 22 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.590
 thousand face to seal the base and the 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.329
 corrector 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.820
 I'm going to use a definition process 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.340
 formula to give a little warmth 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.520
 to the face first and then on top I'll 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.560
 place a darker bronzer for 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.770
 give outline to the face is that I'm 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.100
 using this on white and taking everything 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.100
 link 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.840
 if with the same brush I will give 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.430
 depth to my nose because it 's more 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.370
 used below I will use 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.800
 a blush decisions' color this tone is 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.640
 beautiful is good pink lasts for several 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.640
 hours during the day 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.510
 you feel that you applied is much used 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.270
 the brush with which you put the base 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.470
 the dust and you're ready now only 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.470
 to define the eyebrows 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.780
 I will use this shade of lipstick 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.780
 I saw 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.600
 this purple anise shine for 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.440
 darken the lips a bit, do not look 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.440
