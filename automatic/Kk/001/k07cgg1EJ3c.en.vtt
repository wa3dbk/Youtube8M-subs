00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
kind of weird I guess what is the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.010 
kind of weird I guess what is the
progression<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.340> started<00:00:35.790> out<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.149> well<00:00:36.960> I

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
progression you started out as well I

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.389 
progression you started out as well I
wasn't<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> team<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> whole<00:00:37.980> time<00:00:38.160> but

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
wasn't on the team the whole time but

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.369 
wasn't on the team the whole time but
originally<00:00:38.940> they<00:00:39.059> were<00:00:39.090> orbit<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:40.320> they

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
originally they were orbit and then they

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.229 
originally they were orbit and then they
went<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.590> Quantic<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:41.520> they<00:00:42.120> got

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
went to Quantic and then they got

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.720 
went to Quantic and then they got
Quantic<00:00:42.809> disbanded<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:43.469> were<00:00:43.530> like

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
Quantic disbanded so they were like

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
Quantic disbanded so they were like
reddit<00:00:44.730> nation<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.480> team<00:00:45.660> nom<00:00:45.899> nom<00:00:46.170> and

aren't<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.430> good<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:32.700> could<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.299> we

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
aren't as good as they could be if we

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.850 
aren't as good as they could be if we
were<00:01:33.450> losing<00:01:33.720> because<00:01:34.079> people<00:01:34.500> aren't<00:01:34.710> taking

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
were losing because people aren't taking

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.490 
were losing because people aren't taking
it<00:01:35.100> seriously<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.299> obvious<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.259> came

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it seriously so obvious that that came

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.780 
it seriously so obvious that that came
back<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:37.950> bite<00:01:38.159> us<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> ass<00:01:38.460> today

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
back to like bite us in the ass today

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
back to like bite us in the ass today
but<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.509> every<00:01:40.140> time<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:40.380> lose<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.860> practice

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
but I every time we lose we practice

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.550 
but I every time we lose we practice
really<00:01:41.340> well<00:01:41.520> after<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.210> hopefully<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.350> can

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
really well after so hopefully we can

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.020 
really well after so hopefully we can
cut<00:01:43.950> down<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> losses<00:01:44.670> while<00:01:44.820> still

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
cut down on the losses while still

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.060 
cut down on the losses while still
maintaining<00:01:45.149> good<00:01:45.600> practice<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.770> MLG

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
maintaining good practice so this MLG

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.249 
maintaining good practice so this MLG
LCS<00:01:47.970> thing<00:01:48.180> might<00:01:48.329> actually<00:01:48.360> help<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.020> this

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
LCS thing might actually help you this

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.660 
LCS thing might actually help you this
one<00:01:49.409> loss<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.280> spur<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.610> on

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670

towards<00:01:51.060> victory<00:01:51.210> yeah<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.409> well<00:01:53.100> there

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
towards victory yeah I think well there

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.649 
towards victory yeah I think well there
are<00:01:53.399> some<00:01:53.520> problems<00:01:53.790> internally<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
are some problems internally with the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.230 
are some problems internally with the
team<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:56.100> hard<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.490> work<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.119> those

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
team and it's hard to work on those

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.249 
team and it's hard to work on those
problems<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:57.689> you're<00:01:57.810> winning<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
problems when you're winning all the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.539 
problems when you're winning all the
time<00:01:58.409> because<00:01:58.560> they<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.829> overlooked<00:01:59.250> but

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
time because they get overlooked but

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.639 
time because they get overlooked but
we'll<00:02:00.299> definitely<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:01.079> going<00:02:01.229> into<00:02:01.439> those

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
we'll definitely be going into those

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.350 
we'll definitely be going into those
this<00:02:01.979> next<00:02:02.280> these<00:02:02.520> next<00:02:02.759> few<00:02:02.880> weeks<00:02:03.090> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
this next these next few weeks and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.060 
this next these next few weeks and
hopefully<00:02:03.509> get<00:02:03.899> them<00:02:04.049> solved<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.560> we'll<00:02:04.950> be

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
hopefully get them solved and we'll be

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.040 
hopefully get them solved and we'll be
good<00:02:05.670> again

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
good again

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.840 
good again
I<00:02:06.110> thought<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:06.980> was<00:02:07.040> funny<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.340> Alex<00:02:07.700> Penn

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
I thought it was funny that Alex Penn

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.460 
I thought it was funny that Alex Penn
ended<00:02:08.090> up<00:02:08.210> kind<00:02:08.510> of<00:02:08.600> managing<00:02:08.960> a<00:02:09.050> team<00:02:09.080> because

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
ended up kind of managing a team because

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.990 
ended up kind of managing a team because
he<00:02:09.680> has<00:02:09.860> within<00:02:10.250> him<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:10.550> collective

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
he has within him the collective

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.970 
he has within him the collective

changes to the meta changes to the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.480 
changes to the meta changes to the
middling<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.080> idea<00:02:48.380> of<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.710> you<00:02:49.010> know<00:02:49.100> an<00:02:49.190> AP

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
middling and idea of a you know an AP

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.060 
middling and idea of a you know an AP
major<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.330> think<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.260> big<00:02:51.440> biggest<00:02:51.890> thing<00:02:51.980> we

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
major I think the big biggest thing we

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.580 
major I think the big biggest thing we
learned<00:02:52.220> from<00:02:52.250> Korea<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.300> which<00:02:54.170> picks<00:02:54.470> a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
learned from Korea is which picks a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.170 
learned from Korea is which picks a
really<00:02:54.830> good<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.250> they're<00:02:55.760> good<00:02:55.940> at<00:02:56.030> knowing

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
really good like they're good at knowing

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.580 
really good like they're good at knowing
which<00:02:56.390> champions<00:02:56.750> are<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.900> strongest<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.530> we

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
which champions are the strongest and we

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.590 
which champions are the strongest and we
learn<00:02:57.740> from<00:02:57.770> that<00:02:58.100> also<00:02:58.970> they're<00:02:59.300> like

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600
