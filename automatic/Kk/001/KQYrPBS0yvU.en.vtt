00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
closely and you see that there are some

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.740 
closely and you see that there are some
elements<00:01:42.370> of<00:01:42.700> cost-cutting<00:01:43.000> trying<00:01:43.659> to

elements of cost-cutting trying to

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.870 
elements of cost-cutting trying to

Harley Davidson also look at the meter

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.030 
Harley Davidson also look at the meter
console<00:02:01.780> here<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.500> doesn't<00:02:02.710> give<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.010> too

much<00:02:03.280> information<00:02:03.340> there's<00:02:03.970> only<00:02:04.090> it's<00:02:04.330> a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
much information there's only it's a

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.210

so<00:02:09.399> there's<00:02:09.580> no<00:02:09.700> taco<00:02:10.030> here<00:02:10.239> there's<00:02:10.479> no<00:02:10.659> fuel

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
so there's no taco here there's no fuel

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.960 
so there's no taco here there's no fuel
indication<00:02:12.129> it's<00:02:12.400> only<00:02:12.549> there's<00:02:12.730> only<00:02:12.849> a

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
warning signal it doesn't tell you

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.289 
warning signal it doesn't tell you
information<00:02:14.680> like<00:02:15.099> distance<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.549> MP<00:02:15.849> or<00:02:16.090> maybe

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
information like distance to MP or maybe

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.420 
information like distance to MP or maybe
the<00:02:16.450> current<00:02:16.689> deficiency<00:02:17.200> but<00:02:18.129> those<00:02:18.310> are

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the current deficiency but those are

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.860 
the current deficiency but those are
some<00:02:18.519> of<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.670> negative<00:02:18.790> edge<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.239> let's<00:02:19.750> talk

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
some of the negative edge so let's talk

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.210 
some of the negative edge so let's talk
about<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.140> positive<00:02:20.530> bits<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.950> way<00:02:21.069> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
about the positive bits and the way the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.670 
about the positive bits and the way the
bike<00:02:21.370> looks<00:02:21.670> is<00:02:21.879> really<00:02:22.599> working<00:02:22.780> for<00:02:22.900> me<00:02:23.110> when

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
bike looks is really working for me when

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.170 
bike looks is really working for me when
I<00:02:23.709> saw<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.040> bike<00:02:24.250> first<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.730> pictures<00:02:25.030> it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
I saw the bike first and pictures it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.509 
I saw the bike first and pictures it
wasn't<00:02:25.450> looking<00:02:25.540> as<00:02:25.900> white<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.680> me<00:02:26.950> but<00:02:27.400> now

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
wasn't looking as white to me but now

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.769 
wasn't looking as white to me but now
editing<00:02:27.969> when<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.120> look<00:02:28.269> at<00:02:28.359> the<00:02:28.450> bike<00:02:28.599> this

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:28.779 
editing when I look at the bike this

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:30.989 
editing when I look at the bike this
tank<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.169> pretty<00:02:29.349> wide<00:02:29.590> has<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.639> muscle<00:02:30.819> to

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:30.999 
tank is pretty wide has the muscle to

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:32.240 
tank is pretty wide has the muscle to
look<00:02:31.209> like<00:02:31.359> a<00:02:31.389> Holley

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
look like a Holley

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.040 
look like a Holley
of<00:02:32.700> course<00:02:32.940> not<00:02:33.030> as<00:02:33.180> big<00:02:33.360> as<00:02:33.480> other<00:02:33.510> Hollies<00:02:33.960> on

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
of course not as big as other Hollies on

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.450 
of course not as big as other Hollies on
the<00:02:34.140> road<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.530> one<00:02:34.710> surely<00:02:34.950> will<00:02:35.250> stand

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
the road but this one surely will stand

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.130 
the road but this one surely will stand
out<00:02:35.550> on<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.730> road<00:02:35.940> also<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.990> color

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
out on the road also the color

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.300 
out on the road also the color
combination<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.860> one<00:02:38.010> particularly

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
combination on this one particularly

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.610 
combination on this one particularly
this<00:02:39.300> combination<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.900> red<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.140> black<00:02:40.320> looks

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
this combination of red and black looks

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.680 
this combination of red and black looks
very<00:02:40.860> nice<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.370> maybe<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.670> little<00:02:41.850> more<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.210> red

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
very nice so maybe a little more of red

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.270 
very nice so maybe a little more of red
and<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.900> little<00:02:43.020> less<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.320> black<00:02:43.650> would<00:02:44.190> have

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
and a little less of black would have

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.370 
and a little less of black would have
been<00:02:44.370> an<00:02:44.490> ideal<00:02:44.670> combination<00:02:45.030> for<00:02:45.870> example<00:02:46.200> on

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
been an ideal combination for example on

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.290 
been an ideal combination for example on
the<00:02:46.530> front<00:02:46.770> visor<00:02:46.890> here<00:02:47.280> could<00:02:48.000> have<00:02:48.120> been<00:02:48.270> a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
the front visor here could have been a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.510 
the front visor here could have been a
red<00:02:48.540> color<00:02:48.750> instead<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.590> black<00:02:49.740> color<00:02:49.890> but

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
red color instead of the black color but

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.790 
red color instead of the black color but
still<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.300> works<00:02:51.510> well<00:02:51.780> with<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.260> bit<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.470> chrome

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
still it works well with a bit of chrome

right<00:03:23.340> position<00:03:23.820> 2<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.000> fantastic<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.780> even

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
right position 2 is fantastic and even

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.630 
right position 2 is fantastic and even
though<00:03:25.290> it's<00:03:25.440> probably<00:03:25.620> better<00:03:26.100> suited<00:03:26.370> for

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
though it's probably better suited for
