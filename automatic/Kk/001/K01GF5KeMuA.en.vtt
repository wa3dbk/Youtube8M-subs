00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
and walk and move differently in a skirt

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.160 
and walk and move differently in a skirt
so<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.140> way<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.519> flick<00:03:06.519> your<00:03:06.549> skirt<00:03:07.180> then

so the way you flick your skirt then

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.380 
so the way you flick your skirt then
when<00:03:08.319> you<00:03:08.440> walk<00:03:08.769> in<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.310> might<00:03:09.970> be<00:03:10.150> different

when you walk in it might be different
and<00:03:10.630> that's<00:03:10.870> why<00:03:11.049> it's<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.290> good<00:03:11.620> idea<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.880> wear

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720
