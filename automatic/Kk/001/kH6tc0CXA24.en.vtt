our guitars on this map one here which

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.810 
is the closest point between the two and
one<00:02:03.500> over<00:02:03.710> here<00:02:04.040> which<00:02:04.280> guards<00:02:04.760> the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
one over here which guards the

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.610 
one over here which guards the
high-yield<00:02:05.540> minerals<00:02:06.110> which<00:02:06.260> are<00:02:06.380> now<00:02:06.560> the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
high-yield minerals which are now the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.550 
high-yield minerals which are now the
rich<00:02:06.950> mineral<00:02:07.790> fields<00:02:08.270> over<00:02:09.170> where<00:02:09.320> you<00:02:09.350> get

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
rich mineral fields over where you get

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.220 
rich mineral fields over where you get
more<00:02:09.800> minerals<00:02:10.340> from<00:02:11.240> them<00:02:11.510> than<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.050> do<00:02:12.200> from

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
more minerals from them than you do from

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.260 
more minerals from them than you do from
your<00:02:12.560> normal<00:02:12.800> blue<00:02:13.010> ones<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> good

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
your normal blue ones so it's a good

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.270 
your normal blue ones so it's a good
idea<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.690> split<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.140> couple<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.590> segments<00:02:16.100> not

that<00:02:16.430> many<00:02:16.640> people<00:02:16.730> or<00:02:17.360> Terran<00:02:17.870> players

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
that many people or Terran players

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.360 
that many people or Terran players
especially<00:02:18.530> you're<00:02:18.830> going<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.010> come<00:02:19.160> all<00:02:19.190> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
especially you're going to come all the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.340 
especially you're going to come all the
way<00:02:19.430> down<00:02:19.520> here<00:02:19.760> it's<00:02:20.330> too<00:02:20.510> far<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.750> fly<00:02:21.140> at<00:02:21.320> the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
way down here it's too far to fly at the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.449 
way down here it's too far to fly at the
start<00:02:21.710> of<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.830> game<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:24.010> yeah<00:02:25.010> you're<00:02:25.370> not

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
start of the game and yeah you're not

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.070 
start of the game and yeah you're not
really<00:02:25.700> gonna<00:02:25.850> build<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.240> command<00:02:26.540> center<00:02:26.600> here

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
really gonna build a command center here

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.990 
really gonna build a command center here
it's<00:02:27.230> not<00:02:27.380> very<00:02:27.620> common<00:02:28.040> at<00:02:28.580> least<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.940> don't

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
it's not very common at least I don't

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.690 
it's not very common at least I don't
think<00:02:29.209> many<00:02:29.540> Terran<00:02:29.900> players<00:02:30.110> do<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.700> anyway

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
think many Terran players do it anyway

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.310 
think many Terran players do it anyway
here<00:02:31.970> we<00:02:32.000> can<00:02:32.150> see<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> baneling<00:02:32.600> nest<00:02:32.959> coming

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
here we can see a baneling nest coming

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.670 
here we can see a baneling nest coming
up<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.250> I'm<00:02:34.459> in<00:02:35.060> his<00:02:35.390> mind<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:36.050> guess<00:02:36.500> he

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
up so I'm in his mind I guess he

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.980 
up so I'm in his mind I guess he
realizes<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.310> he<00:02:37.700> hasn't<00:02:37.820> scoured<00:02:38.510> here<00:02:38.810> so

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
realizes that he hasn't scoured here so

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.630 
realizes that he hasn't scoured here so
we<00:02:39.050> didn't<00:02:39.290> know<00:02:39.440> I've<00:02:39.709> got<00:02:39.890> command<00:02:40.220> center

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
we didn't know I've got command center

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.199 
we didn't know I've got command center
still<00:02:41.020> like<00:02:42.020> an<00:02:42.140> expansion<00:02:42.709> but<00:02:42.920> I'm<00:02:43.670> guessing

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
still like an expansion but I'm guessing

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.199 
still like an expansion but I'm guessing
from<00:02:44.600> this<00:02:45.320> like<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.220> think<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.580> had<00:02:46.760> asked<00:02:47.030> out

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
from this like I think I had asked out

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.960 
from this like I think I had asked out
if<00:02:47.420> not<00:02:47.450> i<00:02:47.930> might<00:02:48.260> have<00:02:48.380> fun<00:02:48.560> with<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.970> scanner

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
if not i might have fun with the scanner

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.020 
if not i might have fun with the scanner

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
little hellion around here heavens are

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.790 
little hellion around here heavens are
very<00:02:56.660> good<00:02:56.810> against<00:02:57.200> certain<00:02:57.410> limbs<00:02:57.680> they'd

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
very good against certain limbs they'd

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.229 
very good against certain limbs they'd
be<00:02:57.920> lots<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.459> damage<00:02:58.640> against<00:02:59.120> them

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
be lots of damage against them

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.280 
be lots of damage against them
especially<00:02:59.420> when<00:02:59.750> they're<00:02:59.870> all<00:02:59.989> grouped

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
especially when they're all grouped

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.270 
especially when they're all grouped
together<00:03:00.380> because<00:03:00.800> they<00:03:00.860> have<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:00.980> line<00:03:01.250> of

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
together because they have a line of

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.550 
together because they have a line of
fire<00:03:01.700> or<00:03:01.730> damage<00:03:02.269> but<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.110> was<00:03:03.230> gonna<00:03:03.350> do<00:03:03.530> a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
fire or damage but I was gonna do a

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.090 
fire or damage but I was gonna do a
little<00:03:03.739> scary<00:03:04.190> space<00:03:04.370> see<00:03:04.700> what<00:03:04.850> it<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:04.970> as<00:03:05.180> God

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
little scary space see what it is as God

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.190 
little scary space see what it is as God

because I got myself to star wars and

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.520

but from what I've seen so far I would

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.430 
but from what I've seen so far I would
say<00:04:01.269> that<00:04:01.299> Ravens<00:04:01.810> are<00:04:01.959> definitely<00:04:02.409> very

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
say that Ravens are definitely very

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.289 
say that Ravens are definitely very
effective<00:04:03.220> against<00:04:03.459> zerg<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:03.879> you'll<00:04:04.030> find

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
effective against zerg and you'll find

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.550 
effective against zerg and you'll find
out<00:04:04.480> later<00:04:04.659> why<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:07.200> he<00:04:08.200> wouldn't<00:04:08.409> paint

out later why that is he wouldn't paint

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.110 
out later why that is he wouldn't paint
enough<00:04:08.829> attention<00:04:09.069> and<00:04:09.400> he<00:04:09.579> never<00:04:09.819> brought

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
cocoon doing down here I guess he's

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.119 
cocoon doing down here I guess he's
thinking<00:04:51.960> that<00:04:52.080> I<00:04:52.110> go<00:04:52.319> she's<00:04:52.530> gonna<00:04:52.680> be<00:04:52.860> coming

change things which he can be but I got

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.070 
change things which he can be but I got
the<00:05:08.009> cell<00:05:08.190> market<00:05:08.550> our<00:05:08.729> look<00:05:09.599> at<00:05:09.720> him<00:05:09.840> he's

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
the cell market our look at him he's

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.029 
the cell market our look at him he's
controlling<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:11.330> Maria<00:05:12.379> dedicated<00:05:13.379> but<00:05:13.560> SCV

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
controlling it Maria dedicated but SCV

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.920 
controlling it Maria dedicated but SCV
to<00:05:14.219> control<00:05:14.610> in<00:05:14.729> that<00:05:14.849> so<00:05:15.060> no<00:05:15.240> guitar<00:05:15.360> the

to control in that so no guitar the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.390 
to control in that so no guitar the
reason<00:05:16.229> why<00:05:16.349> I've<00:05:16.440> spammed<00:05:16.770> him<00:05:16.949> on<00:05:17.039> patrol

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
reason why I've spammed him on patrol

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.600 
reason why I've spammed him on patrol
there<00:05:17.639> is<00:05:17.729> because<00:05:17.879> if<00:05:18.210> you<00:05:18.330> put<00:05:18.539> patrol<00:05:19.020> on<00:05:19.289> a

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
there is because if you put patrol on a

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.029 
there is because if you put patrol on a
SCV<00:05:20.719> it'll<00:05:21.719> make<00:05:21.930> it<00:05:22.139> all<00:05:22.289> to<00:05:22.500> attack<00:05:22.800> an<00:05:22.979> enemy

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
SCV it'll make it all to attack an enemy

SCV it'll make it all to attack an enemy
