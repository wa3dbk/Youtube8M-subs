00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
missile so now it won't just be the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
missile so now it won't just be the
choppers<00:01:15.600> with<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.810> TV<00:01:16.020> missiles<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:17.040> these

are<00:01:17.369> tack<00:01:17.640> boats<00:01:17.909> are<00:01:18.060> going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
are tack boats are going to have the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.359 
are tack boats are going to have the
power<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.930> well<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.009> does<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
power as well what this does is it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.710 
power as well what this does is it
really<00:01:20.729> makes<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> boat<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> valid

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
really makes the boat to have a valid

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.380 
really makes the boat to have a valid
and<00:01:22.110> powerful<00:01:22.830> attack<00:01:23.100> option<00:01:23.520> rather<00:01:24.180> than

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and powerful attack option rather than

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
and powerful attack option rather than
just<00:01:24.570> being<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.869> transport<00:01:25.439> from<00:01:25.680> A<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> B<00:01:26.220> like

that but I've got half a brain so that's

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.680 
that but I've got half a brain so that's
what<00:03:37.079> I've<00:03:37.169> put<00:03:37.349> together<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.760> DLC<00:03:39.239> names<00:03:39.510> for

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
of those DLCs now the name itself

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.729 
of those DLCs now the name itself
suggests<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:47.099> heavy<00:03:47.340> focus<00:03:47.669> on<00:03:48.030> naval<00:03:48.299> combat

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739

even<00:03:49.739> more<00:03:50.010> perhaps<00:03:50.250> than<00:03:50.579> we've<00:03:50.699> already

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
even more perhaps than we've already

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.789 
even more perhaps than we've already
seen<00:03:51.180> going<00:03:51.480> into<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.930> vanilla<00:03:52.260> game<00:03:52.500> it

seen going into the vanilla game it

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.000 
seen going into the vanilla game it
stands<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:54.000> reason<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.720> in<00:03:55.079> this<00:03:55.290> dlc<00:03:55.829> we're

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
stands to reason that in this dlc we're

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.309 
stands to reason that in this dlc we're
going<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.220> see<00:03:56.340> some<00:03:56.370> extra<00:03:56.970> vehicles<00:03:57.449> and<00:03:57.900> one

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
going to see some extra vehicles and one

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.650 
going to see some extra vehicles and one
of<00:03:58.470> those<00:03:58.650> may<00:03:59.280> very<00:03:59.549> well<00:03:59.730> be<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.000> submarine

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
of those may very well be a submarine

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.720 
of those may very well be a submarine
the<00:04:01.230> question<00:04:01.650> remains<00:04:01.919> to<00:04:02.099> be<00:04:02.129> seen<00:04:02.400> if<00:04:02.609> it

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
the question remains to be seen if it

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.000 
the question remains to be seen if it
will<00:04:02.849> be<00:04:02.879> a<00:04:03.000> player<00:04:03.389> driven<00:04:03.780> vehicle<00:04:04.260> or<00:04:04.470> are

battle<00:05:10.000> for<00:05:10.180> you<00:05:10.360> will<00:05:10.630> have<00:05:10.870> that<00:05:11.080> concern

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
battle for you will have that concern

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.740 
battle for you will have that concern
but<00:05:12.160> more<00:05:12.430> than<00:05:12.610> that<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.820> way<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.419> map<00:05:13.600> is

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
but more than that the way the map is

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.110 
but more than that the way the map is
laid<00:05:14.020> out<00:05:14.050> is<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.950> massive<00:05:15.520> power<00:05:15.700> of<00:05:15.910> how<00:05:16.060> that

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
laid out is a massive power of how that

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.290 
laid out is a massive power of how that
dynamic<00:05:16.419> will<00:05:16.930> work<00:05:17.140> in<00:05:17.790> paracel<00:05:18.790> storm<00:05:18.820> there

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.300 
dynamic will work in paracel storm there
are<00:05:19.360> a<00:05:19.419> lot<00:05:19.570> of<00:05:19.600> different<00:05:20.110> islands<00:05:20.590> smaller

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
are a lot of different islands smaller

parts of the map that has different

attack points are all over the little
islands<00:05:28.890> meaning<00:05:29.890> you<00:05:30.010> have<00:05:30.250> to<00:05:30.460> travel

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
islands meaning you have to travel

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.420 
islands meaning you have to travel
across<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.060> water<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.660> get<00:05:31.840> to<00:05:31.990> them<00:05:32.110> I

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
across the water to get to them I

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.040 
across the water to get to them I
imagine<00:05:33.430> on<00:05:33.550> conquest<00:05:34.000> many<00:05:34.540> of<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.780> flags

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
imagine on conquest many of the flags

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.690 
imagine on conquest many of the flags
will<00:05:35.320> also<00:05:35.590> be<00:05:35.770> spread<00:05:36.160> out<00:05:36.190> across<00:05:36.460> the

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
will also be spread out across the

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.940 
will also be spread out across the
different<00:05:37.000> small<00:05:37.479> islands<00:05:38.470> meaning<00:05:38.800> you've

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
different small islands meaning you've

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.640 
different small islands meaning you've
got<00:05:39.190> to<00:05:39.370> go<00:05:39.520> across<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:39.970> water<00:05:40.320> it<00:05:41.320> means<00:05:41.560> that

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
got to go across the water it means that

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.980 
got to go across the water it means that
water<00:05:41.979> travel<00:05:42.550> and<00:05:42.729> naval<00:05:43.390> combat<00:05:43.630> is<00:05:43.960> a

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
water travel and naval combat is a

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.050 
water travel and naval combat is a
required<00:05:44.500> element<00:05:44.770> for<00:05:45.250> success<00:05:45.430> on<00:05:45.880> these

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
required element for success on these

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.960 
required element for success on these
naval<00:05:46.479> maps<00:05:46.750> and<00:05:47.620> I<00:05:47.680> myself<00:05:47.890> cannot<00:05:48.580> wait<00:05:48.820> to

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
naval maps and I myself cannot wait to

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.450 
naval maps and I myself cannot wait to
give<00:05:49.090> these<00:05:49.210> boats<00:05:49.479> a<00:05:49.600> try<00:05:49.890> not<00:05:50.890> to<00:05:51.040> mention

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
give these boats a try not to mention

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.340 
give these boats a try not to mention
the<00:05:51.550> dynamic<00:05:52.090> waves<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.660> dice<00:05:52.840> have<00:05:53.050> managed

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
the dynamic waves the dice have managed

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.620 
the dynamic waves the dice have managed
to<00:05:53.440> do<00:05:53.620> and<00:05:53.860> nothing<00:05:54.340> short<00:05:54.790> of<00:05:54.940> epic<00:05:55.180> they
