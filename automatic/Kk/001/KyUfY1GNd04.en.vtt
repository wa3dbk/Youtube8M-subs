there<00:00:27.750> are<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.880> lot

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.010 

I've<00:00:32.520> been<00:00:32.790> taming<00:00:33.180> them<00:00:33.360> since<00:00:33.660> probably

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
I've been taming them since probably

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.180 
I've been taming them since probably
about<00:00:34.500> level<00:00:34.920> three<00:00:35.719> not<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> time<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.800> I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
about level three not all the time but I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.100 
about level three not all the time but I
focused<00:00:38.730> quite<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> lot<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.420> early<00:00:39.600> game<00:00:39.960> on

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
focused quite a lot of my early game on

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.040 
focused quite a lot of my early game on
it<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.770> able<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.010> get<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.340> many<00:00:41.550> I

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
it just to be able to get this many I

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
it just to be able to get this many I
think<00:00:43.050> including<00:00:43.469> Norman<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.399> now<00:00:44.610> 18

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
think including Norman there are now 18

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.910 
think including Norman there are now 18
so<00:00:46.140> there's<00:00:46.320> quite<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.500> few<00:00:46.559> minute<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.700> think<00:00:48.539> I

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
so there's quite a few minute I think I

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.299 
so there's quite a few minute I think I
kept<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.160> majority<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.730> them<00:00:51.149> as<00:00:51.559> females<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
kept the majority of them as females so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.119 
kept the majority of them as females so
we<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.180> more<00:00:54.449> eggs<00:00:54.899> which<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.770> shall<00:00:55.949> show<00:00:56.100> you

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
we get more eggs which I shall show you

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.279 
we get more eggs which I shall show you
in<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> minute<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> if<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> look<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:01.199> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
in a minute so if you have a look one of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.979 
in a minute so if you have a look one of
our<00:01:01.440> friends<00:01:01.980> frosted<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:03.359> built<00:01:03.780> this

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
our friends frosted actually built this

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.800 
our friends frosted actually built this
recently<00:01:04.650> which<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.760> genius<00:01:06.240> contraption

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
recently which is a genius contraption

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.899 
recently which is a genius contraption
because<00:01:07.200> before<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.950> get<00:01:08.520> around

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
because before we have to get around

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
because before we have to get around
them<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.299> when<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:09.720> were<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.500> ground

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
them all when they were on the ground

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
them all when they were on the ground
and<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.159> quite<00:01:11.310> difficult<00:01:11.490> pickup<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
and it's quite difficult pickup but the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.000 
and it's quite difficult pickup but the
idea<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.140> round<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.680> put<00:01:13.890> them

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
idea of this round because you put them

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.550 
idea of this round because you put them
at<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> top<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:15.240> either<00:01:15.479> are<00:01:16.170> supposed

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
at the top and they either are supposed

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200 
at the top and they either are supposed
to<00:01:16.590> roll<00:01:16.799> down<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.250> occasionally<00:01:17.850> they<00:01:18.030> click

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
to roll down or occasionally they click

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.760 
to roll down or occasionally they click
through<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.570> fall<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.960> bottom<00:01:19.049> either

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
through and fall to the bottom either

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.130 
through and fall to the bottom either
way<00:01:20.100> they're<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> lot<00:01:20.909> easier<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.450> harvest<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
way they're a lot easier to harvest and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.120 
way they're a lot easier to harvest and
you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.280> see<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.180> are<00:01:24.210> quite<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> few

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
you can see that there are quite a few

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.510 
you can see that there are quite a few
eggs<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.549> piles<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.689> poo<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:28.200> got<00:01:28.350> around<00:01:28.560> so

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
eggs and piles of poo just got around so

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.730 
eggs and piles of poo just got around so
you<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.729> harvest<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.210> eggs<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.659> eat<00:01:31.500> them

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
you can harvest the eggs and eat them

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.399 
you can harvest the eggs and eat them
and<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.640> harvest<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.270> poo<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.720> put<00:01:34.320> it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and you can harvest the poo and put it

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.380 
and you can harvest the poo and put it
in<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.619> fertilizer<00:01:35.130> bin<00:01:35.430> which<00:01:35.820> there<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
in a fertilizer bin which there are a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.819 
in a fertilizer bin which there are a
few<00:01:36.810> behind<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.130> little<00:01:38.430> cut<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:40.710> can

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
few behind in this little cut you can

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.160 
few behind in this little cut you can
see<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.340> quite<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:42.170> hunger

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
see that you get quite a good hunger

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.410 
see that you get quite a good hunger
increase<00:01:43.619> from<00:01:44.040> or<00:01:44.399> decrease<00:01:44.970> from

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
increase from or decrease from

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.389 
increase from or decrease from
meat-eating<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.290> s<00:01:46.380> which<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.950> really<00:01:47.220> good

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
meat-eating the s which is really good

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.700 
meat-eating the s which is really good
and<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.720> also<00:01:48.869> find<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.530> you're

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and you also find that if you're

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.499 
and you also find that if you're
constantly<00:01:50.009> babysitting<00:01:50.939> them<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.299> can

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
constantly babysitting them you can

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.140 
constantly babysitting them you can
probably<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:52.320> about

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
probably get about

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.420 
probably get about
maybe<00:01:55.400> one<00:01:56.400> a<00:01:56.430> minute<00:01:56.820> before<00:01:57.300> we<00:01:57.450> get<00:01:57.690> 10

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.130 
maybe one a minute before we get 10
pretty<00:01:59.430> easily<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.300> was<00:02:00.420> pretty<00:02:00.600> quick<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.990> was

sat around for about 15 minutes my ended
up<00:02:03.660> getting<00:02:04.020> about<00:02:04.320> 20<00:02:04.970> I'm<00:02:05.970> pretty<00:02:06.360> sure<00:02:06.540> it's

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
up getting about 20 I'm pretty sure it's

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.930 
up getting about 20 I'm pretty sure it's
random<00:02:07.170> I've<00:02:07.890> been<00:02:08.040> doing<00:02:08.220> some<00:02:08.369> tests<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.700> see

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
random I've been doing some tests to see

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.510 
random I've been doing some tests to see
them<00:02:09.630> eating<00:02:09.900> berries<00:02:10.140> increases<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.280> chance

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
them eating berries increases the chance

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.210 
them eating berries increases the chance
but<00:02:11.970> I'm<00:02:12.150> pretty<00:02:12.420> sure<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.780> random<00:02:13.220> but

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
but I'm pretty sure it's random but

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.800 
but I'm pretty sure it's random but
they're<00:02:14.730> they're<00:02:15.120> very<00:02:15.150> good<00:02:15.480> for<00:02:15.660> making

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
they're they're very good for making

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.810 
they're they're very good for making
fertilizer<00:02:16.500> which<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.100> can<00:02:17.280> then<00:02:17.400> use<00:02:17.580> for

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
fertilizer which you can then use for

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.020 
fertilizer which you can then use for
your<00:02:18.420> bum<00:02:19.020> which<00:02:19.560> we've<00:02:20.100> got<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.490> over<00:02:20.910> there

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
your bum which we've got one over there

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.390 
your bum which we've got one over there
which<00:02:21.240> is<00:02:21.450> growing<00:02:21.690> quite<00:02:22.080> nicely<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.770> all<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
which is growing quite nicely on all the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:36.640 
which is growing quite nicely on all the
dodo<00:02:23.700> food<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.650> idea<00:02:34.950> guys<00:02:35.160> behind<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
dodo food and the idea guys behind the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.380 
dodo food and the idea guys behind the
little<00:02:37.650> fort<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:38.730> have<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.180> dodo

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
little fort here that we have the dodo

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.900 
little fort here that we have the dodo
shed<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.620> we<00:02:40.710> keep<00:02:40.890> our<00:02:41.160> fertilizer<00:02:41.430> bin

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
shed is that we keep our fertilizer bin

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.030 
shed is that we keep our fertilizer bin
so<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.120> don't<00:02:42.270> have<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.480> walk<00:02:42.690> too<00:02:42.930> far<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.920> can

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
so we don't have to walk too far you can

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.240 
so we don't have to walk too far you can
see<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.340> filled<00:02:44.610> up<00:02:44.700> pretty<00:02:44.940> much<00:02:45.030> all<00:02:46.250> poop

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
see it's filled up pretty much all poop

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.810 
see it's filled up pretty much all poop
and<00:02:47.520> thatch<00:02:47.970> which<00:02:48.570> gives<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.990> fertilizer

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
and thatch which gives you fertilizer

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.630 
and thatch which gives you fertilizer
which<00:02:50.820> then<00:02:51.450> I'll<00:02:51.960> go<00:02:52.710> use<00:02:52.980> some<00:02:53.190> fertilizer

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
which then I'll go use some fertilizer

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.420 
which then I'll go use some fertilizer
over<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.570> farm<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.320> show<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.040> what<00:02:56.250> kind

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
over on the farm and show you what kind

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.540 
over on the farm and show you what kind
of<00:02:56.490> increase<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.000> get<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.680> one<00:02:58.890> let's

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
of increase you get so this one let's

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.600 
of increase you get so this one let's
see<00:02:59.730> this<00:03:00.390> one's<00:03:00.600> about<00:03:00.720> 50,000<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.459> we'll

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
see this one's about 50,000 so we'll

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.240 
see this one's about 50,000 so we'll
drop<00:03:02.880> another<00:03:03.330> fertilizer<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.260> here<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.770> that

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
drop another fertilizer in here and that

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.910 
drop another fertilizer in here and that
gives<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:06.290> two<00:03:07.290> one<00:03:07.410> hundred<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.709> four

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
gives you two one hundred and four

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.010 
gives you two one hundred and four
thousand<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.610> about<00:03:09.150> five<00:03:09.420> hundred<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.780> four

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
thousand so about five hundred and four

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.460 
thousand so about five hundred and four
thousand<00:03:10.670> fertilizer<00:03:11.670> per<00:03:12.180> bag<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.230> get

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
thousand fertilizer per bag that you get

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.070 
thousand fertilizer per bag that you get
that<00:03:13.770> comes<00:03:14.010> out<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.370> compost<00:03:14.700> bin<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
that comes out of the compost bin so the

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.780 
that comes out of the compost bin so the
idea<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:16.890> you'll<00:03:17.190> just<00:03:17.370> pick<00:03:17.550> up<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
idea is that you'll just pick up the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.979 
idea is that you'll just pick up the
poop<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:19.590> will<00:03:19.739> walk<00:03:20.040> over<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.520> bin<00:03:20.700> and

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
poop you will walk over to the bin and

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.170 
poop you will walk over to the bin and
drop<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.170> in<00:03:22.290> when<00:03:22.560> there's<00:03:22.739> an<00:03:22.880> empty<00:03:23.880> slot

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
drop it in when there's an empty slot

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.870 
drop it in when there's an empty slot
and<00:03:24.650> that's<00:03:25.650> what<00:03:25.800> we<00:03:25.890> keep<00:03:26.040> all<00:03:26.310> these<00:03:26.550> right

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
and that's what we keep all these right

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.509 
and that's what we keep all these right
here<00:03:27.300> making<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.560> little<00:03:28.769> bit<00:03:28.950> easier<00:03:29.459> for

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
here making it a little bit easier for

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.560 
here making it a little bit easier for
us<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.440> manage<00:03:31.440> fertilizer<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.390> see

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
us to manage fertilizer so you can see

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.000 
us to manage fertilizer so you can see
some<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.900> poop<00:03:34.080> fallen<00:03:34.440> through<00:03:34.590> here<00:03:34.860> and

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
some of the poop fallen through here and

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.290 
some of the poop fallen through here and
down<00:03:35.930> just<00:03:36.930> like<00:03:37.050> is<00:03:37.290> he<00:03:37.500> explained<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:39.060> the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
down just like is he explained and the

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.880 
down just like is he explained and the
fertilizer<00:03:39.780> lost<00:03:40.050> quite<00:03:40.260> long<00:03:40.470> on<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.709> crop

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
fertilizer lost quite long on the crop

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.650 
fertilizer lost quite long on the crop
plants<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.400> mean<00:03:41.550> I<00:03:41.640> found<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.180> last<00:03:42.390> at

you don't have the compost bin yet you
can<00:04:03.130> just<00:04:03.520> put<00:04:03.760> who<00:04:04.090> on<00:04:04.240> there<00:04:04.420> other<00:04:04.720> than

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
can just put who on there other than

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.900 
can just put who on there other than
fertilizer<00:04:05.350> which<00:04:05.770> does<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.190> job<00:04:06.400> but<00:04:06.790> it

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
fertilizer which does the job but it

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.380 
fertilizer which does the job but it
doesn't<00:04:07.540> take<00:04:07.720> last<00:04:08.560> as<00:04:08.770> long

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
doesn't take last as long

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.630 
doesn't take last as long
the<00:04:10.390> comparison<00:04:11.170> if<00:04:11.319> we<00:04:11.500> say<00:04:11.770> we<00:04:11.950> have<00:04:11.980> 69

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
the comparison if we say we have 69

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.780 
the comparison if we say we have 69
thousand<00:04:13.180> on<00:04:13.270> this<00:04:13.450> one<00:04:13.660> we<00:04:13.870> put<00:04:14.110> small

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
thousand on this one we put small

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.460 
thousand on this one we put small
dinosaur<00:04:15.790> feces<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.540> gives<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:16.900> maybe<00:04:17.140> three

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
dinosaur feces it gives you maybe three

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.980 
dinosaur feces it gives you maybe three
thousand<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:19.650> medium<00:04:20.650> dinosaur<00:04:21.250> feces<00:04:21.990> gives

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
thousand and medium dinosaur feces gives

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.430 
thousand and medium dinosaur feces gives
you<00:04:23.169> about<00:04:23.380> eight<00:04:23.650> thousand<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:24.669> that<00:04:25.540> gives

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
you about eight thousand so that gives

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.590 
you about eight thousand so that gives
you<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.590> comparison<00:04:26.980> or<00:04:27.820> you<00:04:28.090> can<00:04:28.240> put<00:04:28.419> in<00:04:28.510> the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
you a comparison or you can put in the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.300 
you a comparison or you can put in the
fertilizer<00:04:28.960> which<00:04:29.290> gives<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:29.590> 50<00:04:29.890> thousand

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
fertilizer which gives you 50 thousand

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.740 
fertilizer which gives you 50 thousand
so<00:04:30.430> it's<00:04:30.460> much<00:04:30.730> more<00:04:30.940> efficient<00:04:31.390> to<00:04:31.450> actually

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
so it's much more efficient to actually

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.420 
so it's much more efficient to actually
take<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.110> time<00:04:32.260> make<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.680> compost<00:04:33.040> bin<00:04:33.190> and

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
take the time make the compost bin and

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.360 
take the time make the compost bin and
make<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.700> fertilizer<00:04:34.150> just<00:04:35.160> as<00:04:36.160> an<00:04:36.250> aside

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
make the fertilizer just as an aside

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.030 
make the fertilizer just as an aside
getting<00:04:37.360> seeds<00:04:37.690> all<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.169> need<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.440> do<00:04:38.560> is<00:04:38.800> it's

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
getting seeds all you need to do is it's

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.500 
getting seeds all you need to do is it's
a<00:04:39.130> random<00:04:39.490> drop<00:04:39.730> when<00:04:40.000> you're<00:04:40.120> picking<00:04:40.270> up

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
a random drop when you're picking up

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.659 
a random drop when you're picking up
berries<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.080> harvesting<00:04:41.530> them<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:42.040> there's<00:04:42.520> a

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
berries and harvesting them so there's a

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.240 
berries and harvesting them so there's a
slim<00:04:43.090> chance<00:04:43.120> you'll<00:04:43.630> get<00:04:43.750> some<00:04:43.990> seeds<00:04:44.800> so

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
slim chance you'll get some seeds so

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.670 
slim chance you'll get some seeds so
just<00:04:45.669> harvest<00:04:46.390> all<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.690> pods<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.440> you<00:04:47.500> should

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
just harvest all the pods and you should

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.990 
just harvest all the pods and you should
find<00:04:47.860> some<00:04:48.100> oh<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.680> your<00:04:51.280> hands<00:04:51.669> are<00:04:51.730> really
