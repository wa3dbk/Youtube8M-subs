00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.390 
going to do that then what you need to
do<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.850> consider<00:01:03.390> again<00:01:04.290> light<00:01:04.589> requirement

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
do is consider again light requirement

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.990 
do is consider again light requirement
maybe<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.939> eastern<00:01:06.420> exposure<00:01:07.350> or<00:01:07.680> setback<00:01:08.670> so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
maybe the eastern exposure or setback so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.530 
maybe the eastern exposure or setback so
it<00:01:09.479> doesn't<00:01:09.900> come<00:01:10.049> through<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.530> hot<00:01:11.540> another

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
it doesn't come through so hot another

over water it so a lot of times what

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.800 
over water it so a lot of times what
we'll<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.310> we'll<00:01:32.400> actually<00:01:32.700> use<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> plastic

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
we'll do is we'll actually use a plastic

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.569

container that would fit inside here as

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.960 
container that would fit inside here as
our<00:01:36.150> liner<00:01:36.560> plant<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> garden<00:01:37.920> inside<00:01:38.490> this

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
our liner plant the garden inside this

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.600 
our liner plant the garden inside this
and<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.960> able<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.439> water<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and then be able to water it in the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.999 
and then be able to water it in the
kitchen<00:01:41.790> sink<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.110> move<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.439> outside<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
kitchen sink you know move it outside to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.800 
kitchen sink you know move it outside to
water<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.460> let<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> drain<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> little<00:01:45.420> bit<00:01:45.659> and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
water it let it drain a little bit and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.130 
water it let it drain a little bit and
put<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.259> back<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:47.000> reason<00:01:48.000> why<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.509> ceramics

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
put it back in reason why is ceramics

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.719 
put it back in reason why is ceramics
hold<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.500> lot<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.710> water<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.159> there's<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.549> lot<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
hold a lot of water so there's a lot of

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.700 
hold a lot of water so there's a lot of
times<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.149> over<00:01:51.450> water<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:52.409> your

using a clay pot you're going to have to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.010 
using a clay pot you're going to have to
have<00:02:05.729> some<00:02:05.939> sort<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.240> saucer

preferably plastic or ceramic something
that<00:02:10.920> would<00:02:11.009> look<00:02:11.129> good

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
that would look good

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.520 
that would look good
that<00:02:12.099> will<00:02:12.640> not<00:02:12.790> ruin<00:02:13.030> your<00:02:13.150> antique<00:02:13.599> table<00:02:13.840> or

on clays have a tendency of breathing

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.440 
on clays have a tendency of breathing
better

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
better

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.509 
better
another<00:02:22.500> feature<00:02:23.500> what<00:02:23.800> people<00:02:24.129> will<00:02:24.280> do<00:02:24.459> is

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
another feature what people will do is

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.970 
another feature what people will do is
they<00:02:24.790> will<00:02:24.940> use<00:02:25.180> baskets<00:02:25.959> for<00:02:26.530> their<00:02:26.650> indoor

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
they will use baskets for their indoor

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.339 
they will use baskets for their indoor
garden<00:02:27.489> and<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.390> could<00:02:28.599> do<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> basket

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
garden and so you could do a basket

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.860 
garden and so you could do a basket
again<00:02:30.069> using<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.550> plastic<00:02:30.880> container<00:02:31.300> set

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
again using a plastic container set

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.050 
again using a plastic container set
inside<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:33.130> what<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.370> can<00:02:33.519> do<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.819> you<00:02:33.940> can

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
inside and what you can do is you can

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.180 
inside and what you can do is you can
use<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.209> plastic<00:02:34.840> saucer<00:02:35.470> that's<00:02:35.590> fairly<00:02:35.950> deep

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
use a plastic saucer that's fairly deep

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.670 
use a plastic saucer that's fairly deep
so<00:02:36.610> if<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.819> do<00:02:36.970> have<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.269> water<00:02:37.480> inside<00:02:37.930> it

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
so if you do have to water inside it

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.960 
so if you do have to water inside it
will<00:02:38.799> be<00:02:38.950> able<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.130> click<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.459> water<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.849> not

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
will be able to click the water and not

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.050 
will be able to click the water and not
ruin<00:02:40.390> your<00:02:40.420> basket<00:02:41.049> your<00:02:41.230> furniture<00:02:42.060> another

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
ruin your basket your furniture another

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.750 
ruin your basket your furniture another
thing<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.510> want<00:02:43.629> to<00:02:43.840> consider<00:02:44.230> would<00:02:44.560> be<00:02:44.760> like

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
thing you want to consider would be like

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.600 
thing you want to consider would be like
the<00:02:46.150> different<00:02:46.480> potting<00:02:47.260> soils<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.860> lot<00:02:48.340> of<00:02:48.459> us

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
the different potting soils a lot of us

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.330 
the different potting soils a lot of us
will<00:02:48.849> use<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.209> organic<00:02:49.599> potting<00:02:50.019> soils<00:02:50.590> which

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
will use the organic potting soils which

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.979 
will use the organic potting soils which
they're<00:02:51.579> kind<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.819> what<00:02:52.299> we<00:02:52.390> do<00:02:52.510> almost<00:02:52.690> say

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
they're kind of what we do almost say

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.900 
they're kind of what we do almost say
fluffy<00:02:53.349> you'll<00:02:54.130> see<00:02:54.310> they're<00:02:54.459> very<00:02:55.380> soft<00:02:56.910> it's

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
fluffy you'll see they're very soft it's

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.960 
fluffy you'll see they're very soft it's
easy<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.450> drain<00:02:58.780> easier<00:02:59.709> to<00:02:59.829> dry<00:03:00.099> out<00:03:00.370> but

got sponge rock you've got probably leaf
mold<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:08.140> have<00:03:08.519> probably<00:03:09.519> some<00:03:09.700> little<00:03:09.970> bit

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
mold you have probably some little bit

mold you have probably some little bit
of<00:03:10.180> redwood<00:03:10.450> compost<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.440> it's<00:03:11.560> very<00:03:11.980> easy<00:03:12.280> to

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
of redwood compost but it's very easy to

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.970 
of redwood compost but it's very easy to
aerate<00:03:14.700> then<00:03:15.840> what<00:03:16.840> you'll<00:03:16.989> also<00:03:17.200> like<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.799> do

aerate then what you'll also like to do

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.460 
aerate then what you'll also like to do
is<00:03:19.859> if<00:03:20.859> you're<00:03:21.069> not<00:03:21.190> very<00:03:21.400> good<00:03:21.760> with<00:03:22.470> checking

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
is if you're not very good with checking

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.319 
is if you're not very good with checking
the<00:03:23.560> watering<00:03:24.069> that's<00:03:24.489> where<00:03:24.700> we<00:03:24.850> have<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.030> lot

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
the watering that's where we have a lot

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.740 
the watering that's where we have a lot
of<00:03:25.480> people<00:03:26.079> that<00:03:26.230> will<00:03:26.319> ask<00:03:26.590> about<00:03:27.569> how<00:03:28.569> often

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
of people that will ask about how often

do I want this well every locations a
little<00:03:31.389> bit<00:03:31.540> different<00:03:32.019> so<00:03:32.590> when<00:03:32.829> you're

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
little bit different so when you're

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.150 
little bit different so when you're
checking<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.459> watering<00:03:33.989> my<00:03:34.989> method<00:03:35.470> is<00:03:35.620> use

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
checking the watering my method is use

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.520 
checking the watering my method is use
your<00:03:36.340> finger<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:37.239> stick<00:03:37.510> your<00:03:37.630> finger<00:03:38.019> in<00:03:38.170> and

your finger you stick your finger in and
it<00:03:38.920> feels<00:03:39.250> like<00:03:39.609> moist<00:03:40.030> you're<00:03:40.600> gonna<00:03:40.720> let<00:03:40.900> it

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
it feels like moist you're gonna let it

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.309 
it feels like moist you're gonna let it
go<00:03:41.109> dry<00:03:41.380> if<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:42.280> feels<00:03:42.609> dry<00:03:43.180> stick<00:03:44.019> it<00:03:44.139> a<00:03:44.170> little

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
go dry if it feels dry stick it a little

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.250 
go dry if it feels dry stick it a little
farther<00:03:44.590> in<00:03:44.739> now<00:03:45.459> it's<00:03:45.670> time<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.060> water<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.630> lot

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
farther in now it's time to water a lot

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.470 
farther in now it's time to water a lot
of<00:03:47.410> people<00:03:47.680> will<00:03:47.799> love<00:03:48.010> these<00:03:48.220> little

you know these are probably made in
