00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 when johan cruyff speak their opinions 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.460
 about football and the club do not usually leave 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.960
 indifferent to anyone but this time the one 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.269
 out player coach and even 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.429
 president of azulgrana honor has gone more 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.230
 far that never in his last 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.330
 statements made to the brand newspaper 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.760
 cruyff raises that after the signing of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.039
 neymar the barça should sell to messi 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.840
 the considered for some gurus of 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.580
 Barcelona has been questioning for days 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.529
 Without Messi and Neymar can live together 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.109
 together and if the arrival of the Brazilian 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.750
 will end up forcing the departure of the Argentine 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.729
 and the truth is that this theory days ago 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.219
 that certain environments of the 

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:40.409
 barcelonismo to this day seems something 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.239
 crazy to ask in the street to the 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:45.229
 culés and would sell to messi receives a 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.229
 unanimous answer 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.200
 because you have the seer equal or better 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 face 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.690
 but the truth is that what is now 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.850
 it seems an impossible could make sense 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.740
 taking into account the following 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.300
 constraints to begin will have to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.010
 see the sports performance of both 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.020
 players next season and if 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.670
 they really are compatible both in the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.250
 style of play as in coexistence 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.930
 internal costumes if it were not like that 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.760
 would have to do without any of the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.560
 two and within the club are 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.290
 convinced that Messi is still the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.780
 present but the future passes through neymar 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.400
 the signing of Brazilian also has 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.660
 justified because there is confidence in that 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.520
 who is the champion of the change 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.100
 generation of the current staff and 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.500
 lead the barca of the next years more 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.180
 the interests of the brands that wear 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.010
 both cracks could be seen in a 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.350
 competition nothing beneficial for the 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.119
 neymar club is the big bet of nike and 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.860
 the brand that dresses the club and that 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.170
 maintains excellent relations with the 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.270
 president sandro rosell while 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.979
 messi dress adidas the great rival who has 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.050
 managed to place its great emblem on 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.270
 a club dominated by the competition 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.800
 besides the barca could justify the 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.230
 sale of messi comparing with what 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.880
 happened with ronaldinho an example that 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.250
 Rosell often explains in 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.410
 Barca kept private Ronaldinho 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.450
 despite receiving succulent offers 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.490
 the player settled into the barça after 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.980
 win everything and ended up being more sold 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.810
 Rosen often says he is not a supporter 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.400
 of long cycles of the players in a 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.870
 same club messi 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.630
 unlike neymar is already 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.610
 amply amortized lastly the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.560
 selling a player like messi would suppose 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.690
 a sufficient economic injection for 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.000
 face the coming years with capacity 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.500
 to make the best signings renew 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.300
 to the staff and especially to the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.880
 construction of the great goal of the 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.220
 current board of directors the new camp nou 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.320
 are some of the reasons that could 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.810
 pose a scenario in which to sell to 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.760
 Messi was still justified the 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.980
 culés just wait and wish that messi and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.110
 neymar suit perfectly and 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.110
 take the barça back to the top
