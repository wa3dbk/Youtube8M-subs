all end with a dance party I think it's

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.410 
all end with a dance party I think it's
because<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.100> felt<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.149> getting

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
because I felt like if it was getting

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.029 
because I felt like if it was getting
awkward<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.170> audience<00:00:52.469> didn't<00:00:52.800> know<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
awkward and the audience didn't know the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.709 
awkward and the audience didn't know the
skit<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.399> over<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> best<00:00:54.149> way<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.420> let<00:00:54.600> him

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
skit was over the best way to let him

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.900 
skit was over the best way to let him
know<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.590> ease<00:00:55.739> out<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> tension<00:00:56.670> with

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
know was to ease out of the tension with

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.049 
know was to ease out of the tension with
a<00:00:56.969> little<00:00:57.270> bit<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.870> bit<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.550> you
