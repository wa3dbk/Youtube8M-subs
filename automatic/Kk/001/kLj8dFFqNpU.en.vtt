parent<00:01:08.909> process<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.450> simple<00:01:09.960> all<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.080> got<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
parent process is simple all we got to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.140 
parent process is simple all we got to
do<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.860> tap<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.640> hold<00:01:11.700> our<00:01:11.970> phone

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
do is just tap and hold our phone

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090 
do is just tap and hold our phone
towards<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> back<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.320> where<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> NFC

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
towards the back here and where the NFC

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
towards the back here and where the NFC
chips<00:01:14.400> located<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.360> from<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.869> going

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
chips located and from there it's going

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.840 
chips located and from there it's going
to<00:01:16.080> ask<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.770> want<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> pair<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
to ask if you want to pair it with the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.050 
to ask if you want to pair it with the
device

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.210 

so<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> setup<00:01:21.960> process<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.530> pretty<00:01:22.799> simple

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
so the setup process is pretty simple

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
so the setup process is pretty simple
and<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:23.790> Bluetooth<00:01:24.390> connectivity<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.049> were

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
able to get up to 30 feet of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.399 
able to get up to 30 feet of
connectivity<00:01:29.450> all<00:01:30.450> right<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.750> got<00:01:30.900> admit<00:01:31.259> that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
connectivity all right we got admit that

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.200 
connectivity all right we got admit that
we're<00:01:31.619> astounded<00:01:32.190> by<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> audio<00:01:32.729> quality<00:01:32.940> of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
we're astounded by the audio quality of

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
you can gauge its quality first then I'm

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.870 
you can gauge its quality first then I'm
gonna<00:01:40.259> connect<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> speaker<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.820> I

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
gonna connect that to the speaker so I

00:01:41.880 --> 00:02:13.290 
gonna connect that to the speaker so I
could<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> difference<00:01:42.509> here
