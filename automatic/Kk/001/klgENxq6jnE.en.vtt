there we go to an iPhone 5 5 s or 5c you
can't<00:00:48.510> go<00:00:48.600> earlier<00:00:48.930> because<00:00:49.170> they<00:00:49.289> had<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> dock

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
can't go earlier because they had a dock

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.889 
can't go earlier because they had a dock
connector<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> lightning<00:00:50.879> port<00:00:51.090> can

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
connector and not a lightning port can

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.650 
connector and not a lightning port can
you<00:00:52.079> go<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> iPads<00:00:53.030> theoretically<00:00:54.030> yes<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.600> do

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you go to iPads theoretically yes I do

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.360 
you go to iPads theoretically yes I do
not<00:00:54.899> advise<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.590> though<00:00:55.770> because<00:00:56.070> there<00:00:56.219> is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
not advise this though because there is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
not advise this though because there is
no<00:00:56.579> supporting<00:00:57.149> mechanism<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.750> while<00:00:57.899> they

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
no supporting mechanism so while they

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.439 
no supporting mechanism so while they
will<00:00:58.140> plug<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.219> weight<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.699> on<00:01:00.210> this

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
will plug in all that weight is on this

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.889 
will plug in all that weight is on this
tiny<00:01:01.020> little<00:01:01.859> Lightning<00:01:02.430> port<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.570> does

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
tiny little Lightning port and that does

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.899 
tiny little Lightning port and that does
not<00:01:03.930> make<00:01:04.409> me<00:01:04.470> feel<00:01:04.830> confident<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.610> well<00:01:05.790> you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
not make me feel confident so well you

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.010 
not make me feel confident so well you
can<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.360> go<00:01:06.390> all<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.630> way<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
can see I can go all the way up to a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
can see I can go all the way up to a
full<00:01:07.110> sized<00:01:07.560> iPad<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.280> would<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:08.970> leave<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.330> on

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
full sized iPad I would not leave it on

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.380 
full sized iPad I would not leave it on
there<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:10.049> any<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.590> period<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.159> time<00:01:11.400> what<00:01:12.270> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
there for any a period of time what you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.270 
there for any a period of time what you
can<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.960> though<00:01:13.140> with<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.439> dock<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.979> it's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
can do though with this dock is it's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
can do though with this dock is it's
it's<00:01:14.640> fairly<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.030> future-proof<00:01:15.360> because<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it's fairly a future-proof because the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.219 
it's fairly a future-proof because the
width<00:01:16.530> no<00:01:16.920> longer<00:01:17.400> matters<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.600> easily<00:01:18.900> go

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
width no longer matters I can easily go

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.609 
width no longer matters I can easily go
from<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> 6<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> 6<00:01:21.390> plus<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.200> Apple

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
from the 6 to the 6 plus and if Apple

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.770 
from the 6 to the 6 plus and if Apple
changes<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.369> size<00:01:23.610> even<00:01:24.060> slightly<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
changes the size even slightly in the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.679 
changes the size even slightly in the
future<00:01:25.170> I'm<00:01:25.320> no<00:01:25.830> longer<00:01:26.310> bound<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.330> dock

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
future I'm no longer bound to that dock

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.440 
future I'm no longer bound to that dock
on<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.619> back<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.460> actual<00:01:29.939> plug
