 would like to show you are the new 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:17.800
 headsets or earphones from samsung via 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:21.599
 bluetooth so why is this new 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.779

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:29.050
 completely bluetooth so much for 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.649
 calls like to listen to music and 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.260
 Well, I'm not going to do a little review 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.110
 about them so I would like that 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.710
 will accompany me with this review we are going to 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.930
 watch 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.220
 good friends, we have here what 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.210
 is the samsung and see 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.649
 and ready to show you this review 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.320
 because nothing is practically very light 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.840
 very 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:05.460
 I practice this pair of youtube hearing aids 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.770
 that they do not have major complication of 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.719
 use 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:16.880
 They are fully rechargeable 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:19.759
 as you can see well placed back I 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.780
 I will show as paper first 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.130
 what is in this card 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.440
 all accessories 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:36.100
 this time then let's show them no 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.100
 over here I see that they have the charger 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.450
 well here you can see that is the 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.010
 port 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.900
 leave the load 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:55.320
 then, right here, it has its port 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.340
 and everything to load and everything that is the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.270
 bluetooth 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:06.229
 because here practically can not operate 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.709
 from any phone with options 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.870
 bluetooth as the galaxy does not or the 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.670
 samsung phones good can 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.019
 work with any other model but 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.590
 is practically speaking of the 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.599
 those from samsung 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.750
 these are the hearing aids I'm going to put them 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.400
 around here to the side 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.310
 and you know what the package contains 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.610
 As you can see it has several accessories 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.319
 I do not know exactly how good these are 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.270
 what are the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:44.450
 the instructions and all those manuals 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.220
 micro manual can be said comes here 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.940
 what is the charger as you can see 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.040
 is this the charger 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.040
 they come different 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:01.140
 it can be called adapters for the ear 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.320
 and well nothing in these things here 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.320
 come more 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.480
 Y 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.120
 and that 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.400
 that are like diadems I think 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.730
 I do not know exactly why we 're going to 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.980
 to serve 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.710
 because they come in different sizes 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.840
 depending on 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.840
 what is he 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.420
 the width of the hearing aids according to 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.739
 neck to the size of the total neck of that 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:37.310
 suits any type of neck 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:40.129
 so I think it's to put them together 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.290
 our neck these three types of 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.040
 adapters from small to medium to 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.219
 big 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.690
 well that's pretty much what's coming 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:52.770
 the package in the content 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.080
 this 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:01.990
 and well, we're not going to know how 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.990
 how do I know how to configure 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.180
 so this is all in this video 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.510
 Later video to show more about 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.510
 of them 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.760
 It is practically a very 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:22.650
 interesting since it allows so much to 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.650
 get comfortable or dress around the neck 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.090
 and so in that way, they are always 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.090
 of the ideal size 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.070
 so then this is practically what 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.560
 what 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.560
 We are showing again samsung
