trying<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.560> figure<00:02:10.679> out<00:02:10.770> what<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.039> is

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
trying to figure out what it is

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.400 
trying to figure out what it is
personally<00:02:12.210> I'm<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.420> fan<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.600> DLC<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.230> takes

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
personally I'm a fan of DLC that takes

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.530 
personally I'm a fan of DLC that takes
risks<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.070> think<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.670> dlc<00:02:15.000> that's<00:02:15.300> been<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
risks I think that dlc that's been the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.240 
risks I think that dlc that's been the
biggest<00:02:15.660> success<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.530> past<00:02:16.710> has<00:02:17.010> been<00:02:17.160> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
biggest success in the past has been the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.130 
biggest success in the past has been the
ones<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.640> are<00:02:17.790> consistent<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.570> every<00:02:18.900> so

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
ones that are consistent like every so

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.200 
ones that are consistent like every so
many<00:02:19.170> months<00:02:19.620> like<00:02:20.010> borderlands<00:02:20.730> or<00:02:20.820> fall<00:02:21.000> out

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
many months like borderlands or fall out

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.150 
many months like borderlands or fall out
and<00:02:21.630> they<00:02:21.750> also<00:02:21.870> play<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.740> formula<00:02:23.130> a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
and they also play with the formula a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.310 
and they also play with the formula a
little<00:02:23.370> bit<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:23.670> know<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.540> fallout<00:02:24.870> adding

can also play as that as well so this a
lot<00:03:23.230> more<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.440> be<00:03:23.530> revealed<00:03:23.800> there

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.940 

if<00:03:31.390> anything<00:03:31.960> in<00:03:32.050> gears<00:03:32.260> two<00:03:32.470> we<00:03:32.620> got<00:03:32.770> a<00:03:32.800> little

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
if anything in gears two we got a little

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.100 
if anything in gears two we got a little
bit<00:03:33.160> drunk<00:03:33.550> on<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.910> whole<00:03:34.360> idea<00:03:34.690> of<00:03:34.780> set

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
bit drunk on the whole idea of set

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.930 
bit drunk on the whole idea of set
pieces<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.770> I<00:03:35.980> think<00:03:36.190> they're<00:03:36.370> wonderful<00:03:36.550> to

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
pieces and I think they're wonderful to

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.550 
pieces and I think they're wonderful to
have<00:03:37.060> their<00:03:37.270> own<00:03:37.300> place<00:03:37.600> right<00:03:37.959> buildings

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
have their own place right buildings

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.500 
have their own place right buildings
collapsing<00:03:39.160> monsters<00:03:39.640> bursting<00:03:40.060> out<00:03:40.150> we<00:03:40.420> will

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
collapsing monsters bursting out we will

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.510 
collapsing monsters bursting out we will
absolutely<00:03:40.959> have<00:03:41.110> plenty<00:03:41.380> of<00:03:41.440> that<00:03:41.620> but<00:03:42.280> in

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
absolutely have plenty of that but in

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.100 
absolutely have plenty of that but in
one<00:03:43.000> thing<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.300> got<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.480> little<00:03:43.690> bit<00:03:43.840> lost<00:03:43.990> in

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
one thing that got a little bit lost in

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.480 
one thing that got a little bit lost in
the<00:03:44.230> shuffling<00:03:44.590> gears<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:45.010> is<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.220> idea<00:03:45.280> of

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
the shuffling gears to is the idea of

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.090 
the shuffling gears to is the idea of
just<00:03:45.550> nice<00:03:45.850> combat<00:03:46.330> bowls<00:03:46.600> and<00:03:46.959> gears<00:03:47.770> when<00:03:48.070> I

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
just nice combat bowls and gears when I

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.350 
just nice combat bowls and gears when I
went<00:03:48.400> back<00:03:48.520> and<00:03:48.550> looked<00:03:48.790> at<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.000> overhead

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
went back and looked at the overhead

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.670 
went back and looked at the overhead
maps<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.840> strategy<00:03:50.230> guide<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.470> what<00:03:50.500> we

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
maps and the strategy guide of what we

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.440 
maps and the strategy guide of what we
ultimately<00:03:50.800> produce<00:03:51.190> for<00:03:51.490> gears<00:03:51.670> two<00:03:51.880> there's

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
ultimately produce for gears two there's

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
ultimately produce for gears two there's
a<00:03:52.600> lot<00:03:52.780> of<00:03:52.810> this<00:03:54.450> kind<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.570> narrow<00:03:55.900> snake-like

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
then of course they'll correct it inside

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.510 
then of course they'll correct it inside
and<00:04:51.539> say<00:04:51.660> how<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:51.900> actually<00:04:52.050> was<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.710> then<00:04:53.130> let

and say how it actually was and then let

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.670 
and say how it actually was and then let
the<00:04:53.639> flame<00:04:53.880> war<00:04:54.120> ensue<00:04:54.479> in<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.690> comments<00:04:55.139> what

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
the flame war ensue in the comments what

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.750 
the flame war ensue in the comments what
happens<00:04:56.010> is<00:04:56.160> they<00:04:56.280> get<00:04:56.400> all<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.580> click

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
happens is they get all the click

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.040 
happens is they get all the click
throughs<00:04:57.000> in<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.210> foreigner<00:04:57.539> comments<00:04:57.930> they

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
throughs in the foreigner comments they

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.600 
throughs in the foreigner comments they
get<00:04:58.169> all<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.350> advertising<00:04:58.710> revenue<00:04:59.160> and<00:04:59.430> so

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
get all the advertising revenue and so

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.010 
get all the advertising revenue and so
therefore<00:04:59.789> it's<00:05:00.090> a<00:05:00.150> direct<00:05:00.419> line<00:05:00.750> there

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
therefore it's a direct line there

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.450 
therefore it's a direct line there
whereas<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.380> headline<00:05:01.650> means<00:05:01.889> money<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.310> them

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
whereas the headline means money to them

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.640 
probably going to fail and you have to
design<00:06:50.670> for<00:06:50.880> the<00:06:51.330> interface<00:06:51.750> right<00:06:52.140> and<00:06:52.440> who

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
design for the interface right and who

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.960 
design for the interface right and who
knows<00:06:52.800> what<00:06:52.980> the<00:06:53.070> future<00:06:53.100> of<00:06:53.340> consoles<00:06:53.790> could
