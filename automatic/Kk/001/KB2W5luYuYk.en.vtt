necessarily be able to listen to music
so<00:01:50.430> that's<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.790> good<00:01:50.970> feature<00:01:51.270> from<00:01:51.540> that

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
so that's a good feature from that

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.690 
so that's a good feature from that
perspective<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.920> sound<00:01:53.159> quality<00:01:53.310> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
perspective and the sound quality is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.840 
perspective and the sound quality is
really<00:01:53.790> good<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.659> these<00:01:54.930> quiet<00:01:55.619> points<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.729> do

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
really good in these quiet points you do

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.700 
really good in these quiet points you do
get<00:01:57.060> good<00:01:57.270> base<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.990> treble<00:01:58.320> isn't<00:01:58.560> too

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
get good base and the treble isn't too

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.050 
get good base and the treble isn't too
that<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> best<00:01:59.399> treble<00:01:59.759> out<00:01:59.880> there

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that it's not the best treble out there

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.459 
that it's not the best treble out there
but<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.450> pretty<00:02:00.630> good<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.110> go<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.259> keep

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
but it is pretty good and you go to keep

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.690 
but it is pretty good and you go to keep
in<00:02:01.619> mind<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.920> you're<00:02:02.100> getting<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.399> lot<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
in mind that you're getting a lot of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.969 
in mind that you're getting a lot of
value<00:02:03.180> for<00:02:03.509> your<00:02:03.630> money<00:02:03.689> with<00:02:04.170> these<00:02:04.380> because

value for your money with these because

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.670 
value for your money with these because
that's<00:02:05.310> 300<00:02:05.880> bucks<00:02:06.060> or<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.810> below<00:02:07.049> if<00:02:07.500> you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
that's 300 bucks or just below if you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.919 
that's 300 bucks or just below if you
are<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.129> find<00:02:08.399> yourself<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.849> deal<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
are if you find yourself a deal in a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.410 
are if you find yourself a deal in a
store<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.920> are<00:02:11.099> getting<00:02:11.310> noise<00:02:11.640> cancelling

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
store you are getting noise cancelling

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.670 
store you are getting noise cancelling
aspect<00:02:13.020> you're<00:02:13.170> getting<00:02:13.379> a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
aspect you're getting a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.589

quiet<00:02:15.900> points<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:17.400> are<00:02:17.579> getting<00:02:17.939> good

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
quiet points and you are getting good

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.720 
quiet points and you are getting good
quality<00:02:18.569> sound<00:02:19.140> one<00:02:20.040> thing<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.459> did<00:02:20.700> notice

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
quality sound one thing I did notice

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.880 
quality sound one thing I did notice
with<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.329> quiet<00:02:21.599> points<00:02:22.049> is<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.439> does<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:22.859> a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
with the quiet points is it does have a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.610 
with the quiet points is it does have a
bit<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.129> noise<00:02:23.730> leakage<00:02:24.359> so<00:02:24.719> if<00:02:25.109> that's<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.469> big

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
bit of noise leakage so if that's a big

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
bit of noise leakage so if that's a big
factor<00:02:25.859> for<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.340> guys<00:02:26.579> then<00:02:26.879> keep<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.359> in

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
factor for you guys then keep that in

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.479 
factor for you guys then keep that in
mind<00:02:27.750> wasn't<00:02:28.500> really<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.739> huge<00:02:28.890> factor<00:02:29.159> for<00:02:29.459> me

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
mind wasn't really a huge factor for me

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.640 
mind wasn't really a huge factor for me
so<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:29.879> didn't<00:02:30.180> mind<00:02:30.329> but<00:02:30.659> it<00:02:30.989> did<00:02:31.349> leak<00:02:31.620> a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
so I didn't mind but it did leak a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.679 
so I didn't mind but it did leak a
little<00:02:31.769> more<00:02:32.189> than<00:02:32.489> other<00:02:32.760> on-ear<00:02:33.060> headphones

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
little more than other on-ear headphones

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.709 
little more than other on-ear headphones
i<00:02:33.870> have<00:02:34.079> tested<00:02:34.650> no<00:02:35.250> huge<00:02:35.639> deal<00:02:35.879> but<00:02:36.150> there<00:02:36.540> are

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
i have tested no huge deal but there are

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.330 
i have tested no huge deal but there are
consumers<00:02:37.379> out<00:02:37.500> there<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.889> don't<00:02:38.010> really

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
consumers out there that don't really

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.800 
consumers out there that don't really
like<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.700> noise<00:02:38.849> leaking<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:39.629> something

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
like the noise leaking so it's something

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.379 
like the noise leaking so it's something
to<00:02:40.019> keep<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.319> mind<00:02:40.379> but<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.549> in<00:02:41.700> all<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:41.879> really

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
to keep in mind but all in all I really

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.449 
to keep in mind but all in all I really
enjoyed<00:02:42.659> using<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.170> choir<00:02:43.889> points

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
enjoyed using the choir points

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.940 
enjoyed using the choir points
definitely<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> headphone<00:02:45.629> old<00:02:45.930> consider<00:02:46.439> if<00:02:46.709> i

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
definitely a headphone old consider if i

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.830 
definitely a headphone old consider if i
was<00:02:47.099> going<00:02:47.340> for<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.669> noise<00:02:47.939> cancelling

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
was going for a noise cancelling

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.069 
was going for a noise cancelling

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
quality and the noise cancelling aspect

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.470 
quality and the noise cancelling aspect
of<00:02:55.439> them<00:02:55.590> when<00:02:55.769> it's<00:02:55.919> switched<00:02:56.069> on<00:02:56.489> really<00:02:57.269> did

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
of them when it's switched on really did

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.420 
of them when it's switched on really did
work<00:02:57.689> I<00:02:57.959> use<00:02:58.169> them<00:02:58.349> on<00:02:58.439> a<00:02:58.469> couple<00:02:58.859> of<00:02:58.919> lengthy

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
work I use them on a couple of lengthy

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.240 
work I use them on a couple of lengthy
bus<00:02:59.669> trips<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.780> really<00:03:01.079> does<00:03:01.409> cut<00:03:01.829> out<00:03:01.950> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
bus trips and it really does cut out the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.220

ambient<00:03:02.790> more<00:03:03.000> surrounding<00:03:03.599> noise<00:03:03.719> really

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.929

headphones<00:03:21.419> then<00:03:22.079> these<00:03:22.290> are<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.979> real

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370

contender to or real headphones really

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.699 
contender to or real headphones really
think<00:03:26.069> about<00:03:26.159> if<00:03:26.609> you<00:03:26.760> want<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.030> noise

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
think about if you want the noise

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.990 
think about if you want the noise
cancelling<00:03:28.709> aspect<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.430> them<00:03:29.609> and<00:03:29.790> they're

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.640

especially<00:03:30.299> good<00:03:30.540> for<00:03:30.720> long-haul<00:03:31.379> and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
especially good for long-haul and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.099 
especially good for long-haul and
