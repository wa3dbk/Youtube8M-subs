00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 today 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:09.069
 look today 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.950
 and there are still people here the series of 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.380
 videos about him model 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.450
 Let's talk a little bit more about 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.730
 radio l model 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.779
 When you start playing with loud 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.259
 model be it an off-road you imagine 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.800
 that to pilot a child of this 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:37.640
 here is the same thing to fly a 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.290
 cart not personal has nothing to see 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.370
 I'll show you here first. 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.620
 only the size of the helicopter is many 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.910
 times greater 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.780
 I know almost twice the size of a 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.640
 car and difficulty level of stress 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.150
 to master this machine is very 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.400
 higher in the comparison here very simple is 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.100
 only you look at the radio show that the 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.920
 The oldest radio I have is a fly 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.040
 to stay in is that I did not like much radio 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.909
 very simple and in fact not 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.799
 works so well is the channel here to 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.310
 climb the helicopter and lower the plane 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.680
 also here is the helicopter beak is 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.909
 to play cause from one side to the other here is 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.890
 or if I'm not mistaken they call it 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.810
 election and here is another to play the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.280
 Helicopter forward back but 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.080
 that move plays the same for 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.820
 right front left 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:36.290
 here was a good channel here to cut 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.710
 the motor rotation portal 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.760
 my various buttons this radio is simple 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.940
 very simple almost has no function 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.430
 Imagine now with nine-channel radio 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.580
 have the same functions up serve 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:02:01.250
 approved head and several other 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:04.520
 123456 more info 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.189
 so if you compare with high 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.849
 the model will have there only the accelerator 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.989
 brake is direction but some channels 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.239
 fit here 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.580
 my radio with four 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.069
 channels the difference to drive any 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.090
 and riding a helicopter is 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.230
 very big then for who is 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.239
 starting with 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.409
 with him the model wants to get a 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.519
 helicopter 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:34.099
 a good tip is the first guy to train 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.500
 enough on the simulator spend a few hours 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.230
 There playing on the computer is the simulator. 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.970
 it's not so heavy it will kill nobody stay 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.620
 a little more there later 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.840
 experience a beast of this radio 11 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.989
 very low in the market in the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.090
 also proton radio which is not as 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.930
 bad but on top quality radio 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.069
 huh 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.459
 so I advise you to take this radio 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.280
 I want a lot of research, and I know that 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.180
 he was a good intermediate radio and 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:13.459
 one advantage of it is that you can 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:15.799
 include here behind him is the 2nd to 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.510
 you put on the simulator and there 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.000
 difficulty for that other radio that 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.160
 I showed you the fais it does not 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.290
 does not fit the simulator does not 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.900
 works and has the training cable here 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.329
 does not work then why pick up a 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.669
 afternoon radio and then nine channels full of 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.620
 lero-lero and full of freshness that this 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.620
 radio you will be able to train a lot 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.780
 more in the simulator will achieve will have 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.840
 to buy the clear cable, right? 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.269
 but you will be able to train much more 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.840
 before heading straight for the machine 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.099
 understood 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.380
 if you know there imagine that it is difficult gives 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.840
 one lap on the track no matter how you do not 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.970
 is counting time with the car 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.380
 imagine getting off the ground with a helicopter 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.590
 this helicopter has 16 there 1 23 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.629
 million things I know there make it difficult 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.440
 much more when you do not understand 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:14.540
 so if you try to understand how 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.030
 All gears operate at 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.389
 ballerina he calls how the 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.199
 functioning of the servants of this this 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.550
 rotor everything more expensive until you adapt 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:30.979
 how in all this did you know how to know 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.640
 It takes a lot of time so the ideal is to 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.330
 you evolve with your first helicopter 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.849
 I train a lot in the second 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.159
 foot on 9 x radium suit radio 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.439
 low cost radio can get up to 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:46.379
 sometimes import it nothing robby king 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:49.050
 without being taxed or else from other sites 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.340
 but the tip and with regard to radios today 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.300
 and this 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.780
 if it is and part for it model does not handle 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.229
 Old radio pick up radio that has a good 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.289
 that are good radio and not 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.360
 Wow personal beauty so if you 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.129
 liked this video the team liked not 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.719
 liked also comments because it helps 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.580
 improve the quality of our videos 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:15.060
 who makes video to share the 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.729
 experiences with other Internet users in 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.259
 home with other people is that they are 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.840
 starting in the hobby 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:25.259
 our intention our intentions are not 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.300
 It's just one we intend to help. 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.699
 share the knowledge and 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.430
 with who is starting but for who already 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.020
 is in the hobby want to spend some 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.770
 further information can also get in 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.599
 contact we try to disseminate and 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.610
 channel or even comment for 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.319
 help other people to a person 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.319
 So this is it, thanks
