00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.560
 hey people like you might have noticed 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.220
 I have one or the other video 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.220
 deleted 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.000
 No, that was just fun, of course I did 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.340
 she deleted because i was using the videos 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.800
 simply not satisfied, for example 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.600
 had video in an old profile picture 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.930
 I cut a cognac totally wrong 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.460
 That was 20 well done but the tires 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.859
 just totally wrong and I thought oh my 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.029
 god there are hardly any people on it and 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.980
 I'm just like now 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.020
 become more worried about the videos 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.790
 and we might also noticed I 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.809
 meanwhile four or 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.370
 I have only as an editing program 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.690
 I can work much harder 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.620
 because I just have a lot more 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.450
 have options and yes long talk 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.430
 short sense I was just dissatisfied 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.379
 with the videos and it will be but the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.230
 one or the other videos nachgereht 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.360
 Today, then comes the profile picture 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.949
 reloaded I have everything again 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.440
 has also written down things 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.520
 asked 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.500
 instagram again have questions or so and 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.270
 become one or the other question then 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 also in this video with objections like that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.939
 So the first currency once that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.640
 enclose 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.530
 you can go there for more photos 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.570
 put on make-up everyday everyday life 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.659
 I would actually hang up 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.860
 often done 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.310
 the important thing is to eat or should i 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.780
 Nevertheless, you still feel comfortable 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.909
 But then remember the photo is yes 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.320
 No one has to see that, I can see the photos 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.150
 delete and that is general anyway 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.979
 It's always important to keep that in mind 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.960
 retains no one has even the man you 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.790
 simply tried then brother would be synonymous 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.680
 very good for the face then so 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.130
 marks her face is shiny 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.220
 not and in the picture you have then 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.770
 no unattractive shine, too 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.790
 sweat can interpret so I think so 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.800
 always nice if I have any 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.150
 put on clothes 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.950
 I would like to have you 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.550
 naturally, as now the shows 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.790
 pullover 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.630
 there you can also the sweater so 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.210
 just so naturally, I know that way 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.670
 cuddly to awaken the defiant atmosphere 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.530
 I think that's what I am too 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.840
 always very nice if you have something 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.160
 you have narrower lips then you can 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.200
 little lip gloss on the account that 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.580
 makes your lips full as well 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.020
 I puts the finishing gloss also the 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.970
 actually always looks pretty nice 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.340
 which also photos mostly good 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.930
 is looks when wearing lipstick 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.820
 if you have slightly fuller lips 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.040
 that's a bit contrasting in that 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.600
 picture and what makes the picture so 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.310
 bit special in my opinion 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.020
 so we are already at the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.090
 Conditions are always best 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.440
 cloudy weather because that's the way it is 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.920
 Imagine the sun shining through the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:39.290
 clouds and thereby the sun is shining 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.210
 to which the light is scattered and it 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.010
 is a uniform light and it 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.960
 Distribute me because I have 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.460
 not like sunshine 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.350
 because now, for example, you are very stupid 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.140
 have sharp edges in the face because of the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.850
 shades and just in the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.890
 midday sun comes the sun from above 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.870
 you have those ugly shadows as well 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.840
 under the eyes, for example, under the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.520
 nose just does not look so pretty 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.209
 says the weather is always the best when 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.709
 you take pictures in it is always on 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.200
 best if you go to the window 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.550
 turn the hate light comes to you and 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.260
 if you are such from the window away 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.850
 you just turn darker than that 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.350
 background around you do not look that way 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.880
 really maybe, too 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.590
 worth mentioning does not make it that way 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.580
 artificial yellow light that is not 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.989
 beautiful 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.130
 I think this is totally terrible 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.000
 Mostly the alleys turn yellow-red and 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.620
 if it does then already 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.599
 daylight lamps 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.819
 not necessarily as expensive as you can 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.170
 just have a look 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.970
 but it is still best 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.620
 daylight at the backdrops you can 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.230
 For example, take a white wall 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.000
 which ensures that it has models 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.010
 in the foreground is when he does 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.810
 already bright clothes on then have lifted 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.799
 which would not be so off anyway 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.989
 i rather a different background 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.129
 recommend but quiet backgrounds are 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.620
 always best 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.840
 and when you take pictures in your room 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.930
 ensures best to make it before 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.859
 just clean up because otherwise it will stop 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.530
 The picture is also neat and not 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.450
 so that's actually it 's like that 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.250
 nice that on the photos there you have to 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.079
 there you can that this thing already 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.790
 Hiding a bit always fits 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.319
 again beautiful in nature photos too 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.659
 For example, when you turn on 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.840
 the meadow lays or if you are in the 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.419
 background the forest has over in the forest 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.130
 leaning against the tree and find something 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.410
 Whatever it is , it always is 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.750
 So with the recordings it is mostly 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.060
 so they when her with the phone into a 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.300
 foto marc the front camera is always 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.820
 worse than the rear camera best 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.919
 you take the rear camera from acid 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.660
 front camera is good enough that too 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.760
 always good if now played at 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.889
 Have mirror in the background and you see 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.550
 then what she picks up and then you can 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.550
 to take the picture 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.760
 Now it comes to pose I have a very 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.130
 friendly face you can see that already 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.020
 and what for now then for me 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.020
 would not be bad if 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.670
 I want to cover that up a bit 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.510
 if you are so sideways 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.280
 put a bit and then it works 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.670
 face does not move so much anymore 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.520
 narrow and also for the body is the 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.800
 That is actually always good if 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.050
 you now with the poor too 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.640
 if we stand sideways anyway then 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.680
 do not push them against your body 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.510
 Then you have here feel that the 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.460
 is everyone has but it works too 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.900
 photos because it is not so nice to measure 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.810
 it is always when you have the evening again 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.690
 An angled because then it is too much 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.270
 tense and it just works better 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.390
 if he has a problem with your nose 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.370
 then and still a round face 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.170
 then you should not do that too much 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.570
 make it clear and you can get the hair 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.730
 just do it on the face 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.310
 this does not always work 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.590
 narrower and if you want to 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.900
 very unsure what the whole thing is about 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.090
 with big whoever it helps 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.010
 if practiced a bit from the mirror or 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.200
 just take a lot of pictures if you like 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.060
 be alone and watch what is mine 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.120
 chocolate side how do I get the best 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.280
 sometimes photos are posed as well 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.720
 and her photos are really good 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.340
 look stupid 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.169
 you just have to do it a bit 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.419
 try for example what I too 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:23.540
 often did where others thought now 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:26.630
 seriously I sat and then got myself 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.400
 just so bent forward and 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.660
 this affects the other boot and if 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.220
 someone would stand behind me now 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.230
 then mother would wonder what 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.960
 do that but that will stop 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.490
 almost always a good thing did come 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.800
 already to the perspectives 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.050
 once there is the bird's-eye view, the 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.310
 I use it just works 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.740
 My eyes are a bit bigger now 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.140
 and my body we see smaller 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.669
 this is an advantageous perspective 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.310
 People are not so comfortable in their 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.230
 Body feel simple 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.490
 only narrower in my case 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.380
 not so bad right now I have it 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.580
 not so violent with the 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.930
 perspective 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.349
 you can then the camera just like that 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:06.199
 hold and then you take up and 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:08.479
 The body just looks smaller so that 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:10.750
 now the nammer perspective has the 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.580
 is also very good for photos and 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:18.530
 you are acting very normal or 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:21.080
 euro per serving are normal and is 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:24.319
 actually a normal perspective 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.060
 always good for photos here is one 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.370
 perspective that does not necessarily use 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.469
 should because by that now from 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.870
 photographed below you can often see 

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:36.069
 double chin where there is not one and then he can 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.750
 the nose purely look and it stops 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:39.979
 real advantageous pose and man 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:44.449
 should not use that because you 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:46.789
 just a lot cheaper looks like you 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:48.620
