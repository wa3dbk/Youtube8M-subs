circle shape or kind of down and a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.230 
circle shape or kind of down and a
little<00:00:22.710> bit<00:00:22.920> that's<00:00:23.340> probably<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> most

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
little bit that's probably the most

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.000 
little bit that's probably the most
challenging<00:00:24.750> part<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.289> not<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> complete

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
challenging part and it's not a complete

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.070 
challenging part and it's not a complete
circle<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.449> an<00:00:27.539> egg<00:00:27.750> shape

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
circle and it's not like an egg shape

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.870 
circle and it's not like an egg shape
it's<00:00:28.320> kind<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:29.160> if<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.340> take<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> circle

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
it's kind of like if you take a circle

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.550 
it's kind of like if you take a circle
and<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.390> put<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> little<00:00:30.929> pressure<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
and you just put a little pressure on it

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.160 
and you just put a little pressure on it
and<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.830> kind<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.219> squishes<00:00:32.880> out<00:00:33.170> evenly

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and it just kind of squishes out evenly

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.660 
and it just kind of squishes out evenly
on<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.380> top<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.950> bottom<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.550> not

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
on the top and the bottom so it's not

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.910 
on the top and the bottom so it's not
like<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> dough<00:00:36.090> ball<00:00:36.360> shape<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.680> kind

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920

notice<00:00:40.770> when<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.890> draw<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.370> draw<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.640> with

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
notice when I draw it I draw it with

lots of little iins if you draw was just
that<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.710> single<00:00:44.370> line<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.910> around<00:00:45.149> you're

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that one single line going around you're

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.630 
that one single line going around you're
gonna<00:00:45.390> make<00:00:45.570> kind<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.840> wonky<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.980> feel<00:00:47.430> free<00:00:47.460> to

draw really really lightly and you can

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.660 
draw really really lightly and you can
erase<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> lines<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.340> don't<00:00:50.520> need

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
later but get that really good shape

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.470 
later but get that really good shape
this<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.309> where<00:00:53.460> most<00:00:53.730> Hello<00:00:54.030> kitties<00:00:54.329> are

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
this is where most Hello kitties are

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.569 
this is where most Hello kitties are
messed<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> shape<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> head<00:00:55.860> once

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
messed up is the shape of the head once

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.889 
messed up is the shape of the head once
you<00:00:56.670> get<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.940> shape<00:00:57.149> done<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:57.570> go<00:00:57.690> ahead

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you get that shape done then go ahead

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.080 
you get that shape done then go ahead
and<00:00:58.109> divide<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.800> half<00:00:58.829> from<00:00:59.760> top<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
and divide that in half from top to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.720 
and divide that in half from top to
bottom<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.750> from<00:01:01.230> side<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.469> side<00:01:01.620> now<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> see

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
bottom and from side to side now you see

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.670 
bottom and from side to side now you see
that<00:01:02.879> there's<00:01:03.059> divided<00:01:03.780> into<00:01:03.930> four<00:01:04.140> parts<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that there's divided into four parts and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.550 
that there's divided into four parts and
in<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> center<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> two<00:01:06.630> lower<00:01:07.140> part

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
in the center of the two lower part

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.020 
in the center of the two lower part
sections<00:01:08.040> you're<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> put<00:01:08.729> two<00:01:08.939> of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
sections you're going to put two of

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.789 
sections you're going to put two of
those<00:01:09.119> circles<00:01:09.450> right<00:01:10.049> touching<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> line

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
those circles right touching the line

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.800 
those circles right touching the line
there's<00:01:10.979> room<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> eyes<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.729> then<00:01:12.240> right

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
there's room for the eyes and then right

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.899 
there's room for the eyes and then right
between<00:01:12.960> those<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.320> little<00:01:13.560> circle<00:01:14.100> there<00:01:14.460> for

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
between those a little circle there for

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.420 
between those a little circle there for
the<00:01:15.030> nose<00:01:15.210> then<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> top<00:01:16.830> two<00:01:17.070> parts

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the nose then for the top two parts

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
the nose then for the top two parts
you're<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.540> diagonal

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you're going to do these little diagonal

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
you're going to do these little diagonal
lines<00:01:19.290> kind<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.650> going<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:20.009> kind<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> like

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
lines kind of going out kind of like

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
lines kind of going out kind of like
like<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> pie<00:01:21.270> cutting<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.140> that's<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.560> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
like a pie cutting and that's going to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
like a pie cutting and that's going to
tell<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> where<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> ears<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.150> you're

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
tell you where the ears are and you're

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
tell you where the ears are and you're
gonna<00:01:24.479> make<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> ears<00:01:24.960> nice<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.619> soft<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
gonna make the ears nice and soft not a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.390 
gonna make the ears nice and soft not a
really<00:01:26.729> sharp<00:01:27.210> point<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.350> then<00:01:29.159> just

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
really sharp point to that and then just

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.830 
really sharp point to that and then just
go<00:01:29.490> ahead<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.759> finish<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.420> some<00:01:30.540> kind<00:01:30.780> of

go ahead and finish in with some kind of
whiskers<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:31.770> she's<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:31.979> three

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
whiskers I think she's about three

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.700 
whiskers I think she's about three
whiskers<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.820> each<00:01:33.060> side<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> bow<00:01:34.560> is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
whiskers on each side for the bow is

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.929 
whiskers on each side for the bow is
super<00:01:35.009> simple<00:01:35.159> you're<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.400> gonna<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
super simple you're just gonna be with a

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.630 
super simple you're just gonna be with a
really<00:01:36.329> sweet<00:01:36.960> little<00:01:37.140> circle<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:38.610> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
kind of very rounded triangle almost

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.190 
kind of very rounded triangle almost
like<00:01:41.430> circles<00:01:41.820> themselves<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.140> of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
like circles themselves but just kind of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.200 
have a circle and triangle had a child
it<00:01:45.810> would<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:46.049> these<00:01:46.649> shapes<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:48.030> is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it would be these shapes there this is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.260 
it would be these shapes there this is
the<00:01:48.299> basic<00:01:48.720> shape<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.280> fun<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:50.970> easy

it<00:01:51.420> takes<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:51.899> practice<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> get

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
it takes just a little practice to get

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.410 
it takes just a little practice to get
the<00:01:52.950> right<00:01:53.100> proportioning<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.939> all<00:01:54.030> that

eyes nose and ears and whiskers at this
point<00:02:55.900> you'll<00:02:56.019> begin<00:02:56.230> adding<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.919> the<00:02:57.370> body

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
point you'll begin adding in the body

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.119 
point you'll begin adding in the body
shape<00:02:58.239> but<00:02:58.900> you're<00:02:59.079> going<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.469> make<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.859> kind

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
shape but you're going to make it kind

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.379 
shape but you're going to make it kind
of<00:03:00.250> like<00:03:00.489> this<00:03:01.590> rounded<00:03:02.590> square<00:03:03.250> shape<00:03:03.730> so

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
of like this rounded square shape so

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.789 
of like this rounded square shape so
then<00:03:04.569> come<00:03:04.810> down<00:03:04.989> from<00:03:05.169> the<00:03:05.230> sides<00:03:05.469> kind<00:03:05.680> of

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
then come down from the sides kind of

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.709
