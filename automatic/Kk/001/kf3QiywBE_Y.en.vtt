00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.170 
that just kind of I don't know these
little<00:01:52.530> hairs<00:01:52.830> down<00:01:54.620> okay<00:01:56.030> then<00:01:57.030> our<00:01:57.150> next

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
little hairs down okay then our next

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.990 
little hairs down okay then our next
section<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.820> we're<00:01:59.820> going<00:01:59.940> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
section is going to be we're going to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.710 
section is going to be we're going to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.570 

to<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.510> right<00:02:23.780> there<00:02:24.100> now<00:02:25.690> go<00:02:26.690> grab<00:02:26.990> this

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
to this right there now go grab this

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:36.360 
to this right there now go grab this
front<00:02:28.580> section<00:02:28.820> like<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:31.010> like<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.160> see

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.470 

this<00:02:37.370> little<00:02:37.490> Cooper<00:02:37.790> here<00:02:37.970> we<00:02:38.090> want<00:02:38.270> to<00:02:38.330> cover

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
this little Cooper here we want to cover

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.480 
this little Cooper here we want to cover
that<00:02:40.210> just<00:02:41.210> like<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:42.220> make<00:02:43.220> sure<00:02:43.250> it's

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
that just like that make sure it's

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.910 
that just like that make sure it's
nicely<00:02:43.700> even<00:02:44.000> with<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.810> side<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.440> see<00:02:45.650> when<00:02:45.830> we

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
nicely even with the side so see when we

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.670 
nicely even with the side so see when we
pull<00:02:46.100> this<00:02:46.220> back<00:02:46.430> it'll<00:02:46.700> be<00:02:46.850> just<00:02:47.180> perfect

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
pull this back it'll be just perfect

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.050 
pull this back it'll be just perfect
then<00:02:48.680> we're<00:02:48.830> just<00:02:48.860> going<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.250> pull<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:49.970> around

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
then we're just going to pull it around

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.470 
then we're just going to pull it around
like<00:02:50.510> foo<00:02:51.610> we<00:02:52.610> lose<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.030> don't<00:02:53.150> want<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.330> do<00:02:53.420> it

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
like foo we lose you don't want to do it

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.760 
like foo we lose you don't want to do it
too<00:02:53.570> tight<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.190> then<00:02:55.190> if<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.880> have<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.240> lift

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
too tight and then if you have to lift

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:06.640 
too tight and then if you have to lift
tuck<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:59.150> click

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.339 

already<00:03:07.519> pull<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.239> down<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:09.140> should<00:03:09.290> be

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
already pull that down that should be

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.910 
already pull that down that should be
covered<00:03:12.340> just<00:03:13.340> move<00:03:13.610> in<00:03:13.790> flyaways<00:03:14.860> okay<00:03:15.860> so

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
covered just move in flyaways okay so

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.589 
covered just move in flyaways okay so
now<00:03:16.310> we're<00:03:16.489> just<00:03:16.519> left<00:03:16.879> with<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.329> faq
