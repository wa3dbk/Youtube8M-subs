because most of the people at the fair

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.710 
because most of the people at the fair
were<00:06:05.440> in<00:06:05.560> grade<00:06:05.710> 11<00:06:05.740> and<00:06:06.190> 12<00:06:06.430> but<00:06:07.270> it<00:06:07.390> was<00:06:07.510> very

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
surprising to see the numbers who came

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.360 
surprising to see the numbers who came
in<00:06:10.450> very<00:06:11.020> excited<00:06:11.500> to<00:06:11.590> become<00:06:11.710> a<00:06:11.890> teacher<00:06:12.130> and

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
in very excited to become a teacher and

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.680 
in very excited to become a teacher and
wanted<00:06:12.640> to<00:06:12.670> know<00:06:12.820> what<00:06:13.030> they<00:06:13.180> had<00:06:13.360> to<00:06:13.480> do<00:06:13.570> in

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
wanted to know what they had to do in

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.360 
wanted to know what they had to do in
their<00:06:13.810> undergraduate<00:06:14.260> degree<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:14.890> be<00:06:15.340> a

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
their undergraduate degree to be a

their undergraduate degree to be a
teacher<00:06:15.640> and<00:06:16.000> I<00:06:16.960> think<00:06:17.230> it's<00:06:17.350> really<00:06:17.620> neat<00:06:17.770> to

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
teacher and I think it's really neat to

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.550 
teacher and I think it's really neat to
say<00:06:18.040> that<00:06:18.190> passionate<00:06:18.580> enthusiasm<00:06:19.390> and<00:06:20.320> so

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
say that passionate enthusiasm and so

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.020 
say that passionate enthusiasm and so
that's<00:06:20.800> I<00:06:21.010> think<00:06:21.070> what<00:06:21.340> carries<00:06:21.670> a<00:06:21.700> lot<00:06:21.910> of

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
that's I think what carries a lot of

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.060 
that's I think what carries a lot of
people<00:06:22.240> through<00:06:22.480> and<00:06:22.830> carries<00:06:23.830> a<00:06:23.860> lot<00:06:24.040> of
