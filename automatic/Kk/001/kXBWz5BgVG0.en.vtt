00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.700
 the maxwell architecture arrived at the beginning 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.910
 the year with the forces gtx 750 have 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:25.259
 intermediate model is now the turn of the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.880
 giant gtx 980 get into the fray by 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:32.520
 most powerful place of gpu on the market 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.400
 the great differential of this generation is the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.980
 energy efficiency the new 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.680
 Can do more with less 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.780
 also sends it also promises a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.850
 series of powerful features for 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.330
 offer more than just performance 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.330
 gross 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.579
 the design of the gtx 980 is practically the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.519
 the same reference bringing GTX 780 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.220
 only a few small changes 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.560
 one of them is the becky plate that is now 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.780
 present on all models 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.740
 this piece helps to cool the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.800
 components and give the board more 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.899
 transparent polycarbonate window 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.509
 still present she charges the sink 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.399
 next to the blur that pushes the 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.100
 hot air out 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.680
 to complete the metal casing also 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.679
 helps to cool components beyond 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.020
 guarantee the visual 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:36.020
 a detail should be noted on this board 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.960
 it has only two connectors of 6 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.710
 pins for something rare power on boards 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.780
 of video of this size sends her a good 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.149
 I work with maxwell the new 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.149
 architecture can provide more power 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.020
 of fire and new resources spending less 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:57.020
 energy that previous generations 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.360
 one of the novelties is the vx gee a new 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.970
 lighting technique that promises more 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.060
 realism to the scenes 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.550
 Another highlight is the tsr or dynamics 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.649
 super resolution that leaves the images 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.050
 with better quality through a 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.200
 the frames are 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.810
 generated by the card in 4k resolution and 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.450
 this image is then converted to the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.940
 full hd without losing quality 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.379
 so you can play games with 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.879
 quality four drop full hd monitors 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.910
 in addition most of the features 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.530
 present in the nvidia ecosystem 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.280
 continue in the new generation including 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.349
 physical shadowplay and g5 we perform 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.400
 some tests to evaluate the performance 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.400
 geforce gtx 980 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.490
 without a doubt the geforce gtx 980 is a 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.710
 excellent video card it brings together a 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.200
 series of functions and technologies that 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.160
 make players' lives easier 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.070
 no pc 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.900
 however in terms of performance she 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.070
 still does not go much further than 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.690
 geforce gtx 780 tpii could deliver on 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.790
 previous generation 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.520
 This is because the focus of nvidia 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.640
 this time it was in technology and in 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.470
 energy saving features more 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.350
 mark of maxwell 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.960
 this gpu was able to occupy the 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:00.330
 First of overcoming category 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:03.570
 both at 780 t &amp; i and at r 9 290 x at 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.510
 terms of power consumption and 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.180
 noise or better noise 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.330
 new technologies have come in handy 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.120
 especially the dsr that goes 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.310
 enable games running with 4k quality 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.370
 on full hd monitors 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.720
 although it is not a resource 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.090
 completely new to nvidia is 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.230
 facilitating the life of players 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.440
 I introduced it no force g ex-pms out there 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.200
 this model can be found by 550 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.990
 dollars the price is on average for others 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.010
 products of the same 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.960
 it is a good business to invest in gtx 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.270
 980 if you are in search of a board 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.640
 powerful video and full of features 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.230
 cool 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.360
 also check the analysis on the 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.360
 tecund and until our next video
