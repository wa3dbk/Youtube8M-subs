all<00:02:06.180> summers<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.930> wanted<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.350> continue<00:02:07.680> doing

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
so during winter and why not our winter

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.370 
so during winter and why not our winter
is<00:02:11.220> much<00:02:11.550> longer<00:02:11.819> than

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
is much longer than

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.010 
is much longer than
so<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.100> began<00:02:13.400> surfing<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.120> similar<00:02:14.630> homemade

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
back it all seems so funny and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.910 
back it all seems so funny and
amateurish<00:02:19.670> but<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.970> similar<00:02:23.960> sport<00:02:24.410> modified

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
for wintry conditions is kite surfing
