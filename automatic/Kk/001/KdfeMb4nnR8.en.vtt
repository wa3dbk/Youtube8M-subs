00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
now the skimmer itself comes closed the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.300 
now the skimmer itself comes closed the
motor<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.520> everything<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.689> mounts

too much noise so what I did was I used
a<00:01:01.489> small<00:01:02.489> blade<00:01:02.750> got<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.899> between<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.379> little

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
a small blade got in between the little

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.090 
a small blade got in between the little
crack<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.670> nudged<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.210> out<00:01:06.920> after<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
crack and just nudged it out after that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.920 
crack and just nudged it out after that

it<00:01:13.020> right<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.880> just<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> end<00:01:15.479> of

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it right in and just with the end of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.039 
it right in and just with the end of
this<00:01:15.950> lightly<00:01:16.950> snap<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.790> out<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:19.020> just

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
popped right out without cracking

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.719 
popped right out without cracking
anything<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.450> after<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.250> what<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.280> did<00:01:23.400> was

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
anything and after that what I did was

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.570 
anything and after that what I did was
if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.939> could<00:01:24.060> take<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> look<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.750> I

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
if you could take a look here I

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.880 
if you could take a look here I
connected<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> original<00:01:27.119> tube<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.229> piece

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
connected the original tube with a piece

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.380 
connected the original tube with a piece
of<00:01:28.920> airline<00:01:29.220> tubing<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.820> had<00:01:30.000> laying<00:01:30.210> around

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
of airline tubing I had laying around

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.760 
of airline tubing I had laying around
piece<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.200> black<00:01:31.439> airline<00:01:31.890> tubing<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:33.770> it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
piece of black airline tubing and it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
piece of black airline tubing and it
keeps<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.820> water<00:01:36.000> from<00:01:36.150> getting<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.840> mean

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
keeps the water from getting in I mean

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.050 
keeps the water from getting in I mean
this<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> design<00:01:37.650> flaw<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.009> aquatic<00:01:38.909> life

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
this is a design flaw that aquatic life

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.240 
this is a design flaw that aquatic life
should<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.390> looked<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.110> mean<00:01:40.650> water<00:01:41.130> is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
should have looked at I mean water is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.289 
should have looked at I mean water is
definitely<00:01:41.430> gonna<00:01:41.700> get<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.030> there<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
definitely gonna get in there with a
