instance<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.910> basically<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.299> have<00:00:15.509> one

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
instance you basically just have one

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.349 
instance you basically just have one
full<00:00:16.020> screen<00:00:16.320> application<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.310> what<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.180> see

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
full screen application and what you see

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.820 
full screen application and what you see
is<00:00:18.449> what<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.630> get<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.170> can't<00:00:19.710> really

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
is what you get and you can't really

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.310 
is what you get and you can't really
view<00:00:20.699> multiple<00:00:21.060> pages<00:00:21.270> unless<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.900> switch

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
view multiple pages unless you switch

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.109 
view multiple pages unless you switch
between<00:00:22.500> open<00:00:22.890> pages<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.640> different<00:00:23.910> tabs

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
between open pages and different tabs

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.700 
between open pages and different tabs
over<00:00:24.960> screen<00:00:25.170> works<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.470> little<00:00:25.529> bit

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
over screen works a little bit

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.650 
over screen works a little bit
differently<00:00:26.010> by<00:00:26.250> actually<00:00:26.640> coming<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.210> over

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
differently by actually coming up over

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.620 
differently by actually coming up over
your<00:00:27.900> existing<00:00:28.199> screen<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.359> allowing<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
your existing screen and allowing you to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.380 
your existing screen and allowing you to
actually<00:00:31.019> open<00:00:31.199> multiple<00:00:31.830> windows<00:00:32.399> if<00:00:33.300> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
actually open multiple windows if you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.600 
actually open multiple windows if you
like<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.710> resize<00:00:35.040> those<00:00:35.250> windows

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
like and you can resize those windows

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:49.000 
like and you can resize those windows
anyway<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:38.120> then<00:00:39.410> change<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.980> URL

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.889 

now<00:00:49.760> you<00:00:49.850> can<00:00:49.970> see<00:00:50.090> that<00:00:50.210> it's<00:00:50.390> a<00:00:50.480> little<00:00:50.750> bit

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
now you can see that it's a little bit

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.660 
now you can see that it's a little bit
funky<00:00:51.260> here<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:51.829> when<00:00:52.040> you<00:00:52.070> try<00:00:52.340> for<00:00:52.579> instance

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
funky here so when you try for instance

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.930 
funky here so when you try for instance
to<00:00:53.210> pull<00:00:53.840> up<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.260> keyboard<00:00:54.500> it<00:00:54.980> covers<00:00:55.670> part

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
to pull up the keyboard it covers part

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.610 
to pull up the keyboard it covers part
of<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.120> because<00:00:56.300> it<00:00:56.930> doesn't<00:00:57.260> always<00:00:57.350> seem<00:00:57.590> to

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
of it because it doesn't always seem to

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.900 
of it because it doesn't always seem to
know<00:00:57.800> exactly<00:00:58.129> which<00:00:58.370> part<00:00:58.670> of<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.790> screen

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
know exactly which part of the screen

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.189 
know exactly which part of the screen
you<00:00:59.059> wanted<00:00:59.270> to<00:00:59.329> cover<00:00:59.510> but<00:00:59.840> there's<00:01:00.140> a

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
you wanted to cover but there's a

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.130 
you wanted to cover but there's a
minimize<00:01:00.590> button<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.520> we<00:01:01.610> can<00:01:01.699> make<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:02.140> go

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
minimize button so we can make it go

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.310 
minimize button so we can make it go
away<00:01:03.260> there<00:01:04.210> load<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.449> second<00:01:06.229> web<00:01:06.380> page<00:01:06.700> and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
away there load a second web page and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.440 
away there load a second web page and
then<00:01:09.320> go<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.590> our<00:01:10.040> tool<00:01:10.310> bar<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.729> bring<00:01:11.330> it

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
then go to our tool bar and bring it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.920 
then go to our tool bar and bring it
back<00:01:11.479> up<00:01:12.910> so<00:01:13.910> we've<00:01:14.060> actually<00:01:14.180> got<00:01:14.360> here<00:01:14.750> then

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
back up so we've actually got here then

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.810 
back up so we've actually got here then
two<00:01:15.860> side-by-side<00:01:17.200> websites<00:01:18.550> that<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.700> can

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
two side-by-side websites that you can

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.790 
two side-by-side websites that you can
interact<00:01:20.090> with<00:01:20.390> separately<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.200> if<00:01:21.710> you

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
interact with separately and if you

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.320 
interact with separately and if you
really<00:01:21.920> wanted<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.430> could<00:01:22.729> resize<00:01:23.090> them

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
really wanted to you could resize them

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:34.410 
really wanted to you could resize them
even<00:01:24.110> further<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:30.550> open<00:01:31.550> yet<00:01:31.970> another<00:01:32.240> page

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
even further and open yet another page

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.490 
even further and open yet another page
so<00:01:35.420> it's<00:01:35.660> a<00:01:35.750> pretty<00:01:36.020> interesting<00:01:36.259> little

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
so it's a pretty interesting little

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.650 
so it's a pretty interesting little
application<00:01:37.340> here<00:01:37.550> that<00:01:37.850> lets<00:01:38.149> you<00:01:38.390> do

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
application here that lets you do

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.900 
application here that lets you do
multiple<00:01:39.200> windows<00:01:39.410> side-by-side<00:01:40.039> on<00:01:40.460> the

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
multiple windows side-by-side on the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.980 
multiple windows side-by-side on the
same<00:01:41.060> screen

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
same screen

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.900 
same screen
like<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.410> said<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.590> little<00:01:42.770> bit<00:01:42.890> buggy<00:01:43.280> in<00:01:43.610> some

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
like I said a little bit buggy in some

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.880 
like I said a little bit buggy in some
ways<00:01:44.179> you<00:01:45.170> know<00:01:45.259> for<00:01:45.410> instance<00:01:45.679> when<00:01:45.770> you're

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
ways you know for instance when you're

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.609 
ways you know for instance when you're
trying<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.100> open<00:01:46.429> a<00:01:46.640> URL<00:01:47.270> or<00:01:47.899> access<00:01:48.590> the

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
trying to open a URL or access the

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.650 
trying to open a URL or access the
keyboard<00:01:48.920> for<00:01:49.369> some<00:01:49.490> other<00:01:49.670> reason<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.420> might

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
keyboard for some other reason it might

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.060 
keyboard for some other reason it might
cover<00:01:50.960> up<00:01:51.229> parts<00:01:51.500> of<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.649> screen<00:01:51.890> that<00:01:52.009> you

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
cover up parts of the screen that you

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.070 
cover up parts of the screen that you
don't<00:01:52.220> want<00:01:52.369> it<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.550> cover<00:01:52.700> up<00:01:52.940> but<00:01:53.420> it's<00:01:53.599> it's

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
don't want it to cover up but it's it's
