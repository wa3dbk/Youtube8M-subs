00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
reason the city came to a standstill is

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.990 
reason the city came to a standstill is
because<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.960> schools<00:01:37.229> were<00:01:37.439> closed

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
because the schools were closed

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.999 
because the schools were closed
businesses<00:01:39.000> closed<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.869> government<00:01:40.530> offices

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
businesses closed and government offices

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.460 
businesses closed and government offices
closed<00:01:41.310> all<00:01:41.520> at<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> same<00:01:42.150> time<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.780> everybody

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
closed all at the same time so everybody

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.069 
closed all at the same time so everybody
was<00:01:43.740> leaving<00:01:44.189> at<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.820> same<00:01:45.509> time<00:01:45.840> which

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
was leaving at the same time which

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.710 
was leaving at the same time which
caused<00:01:46.350> huge<00:01:46.860> traffic<00:01:47.549> jams<00:01:47.880> which<00:01:48.420> meant

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
caused huge traffic jams which meant

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.780 
caused huge traffic jams which meant
even<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> salt<00:01:49.619> trucks<00:01:49.920> were<00:01:50.100> present<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
even if the salt trucks were present and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.580 
even if the salt trucks were present and
