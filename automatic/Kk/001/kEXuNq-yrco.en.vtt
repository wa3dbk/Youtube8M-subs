 July players goes backwards commands the 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.750
 Shotgun has receiver but the pass 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.639

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.330
 of the set of lions that is going to be 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.730
 until the 45 yard and the 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.690
 return will be removed highlighted and 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.000

 the team goes back some white 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.000
 July sends the shot and goes to 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.420
 connect 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.360
 the kick leads to force leads to 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.030
 distance did not come out on the one hand on the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.100
 first screaming 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.800
 when ground the lion team 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.500
 anahuac and now if you can see that 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.360
 slot to keep going forward and with 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.079
 possibility of having scores of 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:05.780
 excellent pass as you and mentions and 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:11.659
 well the field goal attempt in that 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:15.500
 the thieves are going to fall 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.690
 donkeys and good took out there I do not know if the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.770
 donkeys we can say that that 's what 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.170
 happens or is and good pass there the core back 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.570
 connecting with your receiver and loop towards 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.820
 go ahead and time I think this 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.320
 also and we see again the first 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.940
 opportunity for the lion team 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.340
 Anahuac will drop the pressure to school 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.050

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.940

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.289
 move forward follow the blocks 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.179
 of his classmates and only remain 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.320
 mobs it seems that it is going to get up 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.970
 the diagonals do not make annotation stop 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.150
 in the style of eagles 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.150
 white 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.360
 finds a good receiver and deals with those 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.360
 three points 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.950
