00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
 and then guys had everything good is speaking 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.849
 13 and here in another video of the series that 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.830
 goes on to say that to bring you the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.900
 gameplay design is commented oab 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.439
 part of being able to know better 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.650
 and it's a little of me my name is daniel 14 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.029
 years in the bay in salvador 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.179
 I started playing and I played mw3 with a gun in the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.179
 Bank 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:47.309
 so I decided to create one with friends to 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:52.260
 18 bi and play together and play well and 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:56.370
 It turned out that when he and I ran out 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:03.049
 giving me and a friend of mine that he arrived at 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:18.799
 make some criticism of him to play 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:18.799
 even more the rigor that at the time was not 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:34.880
 play a lot in season and if not 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.009
 stayed playing with him while training 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.880
 the opportunity to enter the corner 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:49.460
 after a time with them that had 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:56.750
 to continue without being able to enter 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:02:02.700
 will do what at the time was very simple 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:13.270
 National x 1 against the strike after 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:17.310
 demolish dominated by getting in 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:21.490
 yes it's next channel plans are 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:25.050
 try to put all typical mode 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.180
 of a member of how much in the fourth and 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.750
 assembly on Sunday but this can 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.670
 to delay the young man did not believe 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.020
 or you can also enter this is just a 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:42.190
 reference, but in one case it will not always 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.860
 is this part of mpx seen had ammo 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.090
 It turned out I was desperate I started to 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.640
 eat if we make a mistake I'm sorry but then 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.230
 I need to be able to get the sea to 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.460
 my happiness and the football team is 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.460
 getting back active right 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.900
 the team was inactive now active and if 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.680
 you want to try to get however only 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:18.850
 there do have this episode and the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:30.850
 people like you, that's it, they end up there 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:41.140
 is that time to be able to ensure 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:51.070
 water very good 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:52.930
 It was like this when I started playing always 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.260
 placed on the grid in the team I have 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.860
 people are going to play with me, it 's so here 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.400
 They were good friends even with those who want to leave. 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:09.010
 from the bedroom and now there I pick up furniture 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:14.950
 Now think now close OAB is new we 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.790

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.790
