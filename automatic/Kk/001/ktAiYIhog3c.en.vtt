00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:56.250
 pinpoint focus on their 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:30.530

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.700
 unusual quality our next was 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:43.220

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:48.150

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.100
 also caught 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:10.050
 the location is quite dotted but 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:12.890
 and here a lot of things are immediately visible on 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.820
 drove the map 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.820
 found this fed

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.050
 Already received 2 alu 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:40.390
 so I think he will drag 1 to 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:43.390
 didn't kill here quite so cute 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.390
 heifers 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.790
 the main thing is new 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:06.030
 we can catch everything now 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:12.510
 really i have everything we didn't kill him 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:14.910
 we caught everything perfectly true usually and 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.630
 quality but I don't know who will come to 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.150
 head to swing new pets 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.750
 first level 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.110
 am wrong 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:31.140
 in order to demonstrate the whole 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:34.860
 idyll katya h here are small these kittens 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:39.840
 but not everyone can be caught, of course, but 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:43.470
 they are here it is of course not everyone wants 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.410
 and which are available on Azeroth 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.150
 but I think two pets are 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.300
 the optimal amount for such 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.820
 release and then I hasten to comment what 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.360
 animals you wanted to get 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:01.669
