00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
indicator and this is a full keyboard so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.760 
indicator and this is a full keyboard so
it's<00:01:31.920> not<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.509> one<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.650> all

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
it's not like one like this it's all

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.319 
it's not like one like this it's all
scrunched<00:01:35.009> together<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:35.640> mom's<00:01:36.000> it's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
scrunched together this is my mom's it's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.030 
scrunched together this is my mom's it's
not<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> Logitech<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.840> CEO

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
not the Logitech one this is like a CEO

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.230 
not the Logitech one this is like a CEO
thing<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.520> how<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> keys<00:01:42.210> are

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
thing you see how all the keys are

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 
thing you see how all the keys are
strings<00:01:42.659> together<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.009> actually<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
strings together so it's actually a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.080 
strings together so it's actually a
little<00:01:45.390> bit<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.640> easier<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
little bit out so it can be easier to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.330 
little bit out so it can be easier to
type<00:01:48.299> that's<00:01:48.810> why<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> picked<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
type that's why I picked it out and it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.760 
type that's why I picked it out and it
has<00:01:50.369> some<00:01:50.640> shortcut<00:01:51.240> features<00:01:51.570> into<00:01:51.869> room<00:01:52.619> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
has some shortcut features into room to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.380 
has some shortcut features into room to
