00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
my head when I bleached it and then I

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.920 
my head when I bleached it and then I
used<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.459> big<00:03:14.760> bowl<00:03:15.209> when<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.480> was<00:03:15.750> just

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
putting all over my hair and it worked

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.259 
putting all over my hair and it worked
really<00:03:18.000> well<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.450> got<00:03:18.660> my<00:03:18.780> hair<00:03:18.989> like<00:03:20.150> from<00:03:21.150> this

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
really well I got my hair like from this

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.330 
really well I got my hair like from this
blonde<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.489> now<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.980> recommend<00:03:25.980> using

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
blonde to this now and I recommend using

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.670 
blonde to this now and I recommend using
on<00:03:26.489> red<00:03:26.730> because<00:03:27.110> it'll<00:03:28.110> make<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.319> process<00:03:28.349> go

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
on red because it'll make the process go

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.550 
on red because it'll make the process go
a<00:03:28.830> lot<00:03:28.980> faster<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:30.660> won't<00:03:30.840> fry<00:03:31.260> here<00:03:31.470> as

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
a lot faster and you won't fry here as

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.130 
a lot faster and you won't fry here as
much<00:03:31.680> as<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:31.920> did<00:03:32.130> because<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.959> bleached<00:03:33.959> my<00:03:34.110> hair

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
way too many times and but also after
