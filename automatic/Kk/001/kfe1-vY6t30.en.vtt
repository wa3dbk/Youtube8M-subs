00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.090
 Today I want to cook with a recipe 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:17.890
 that inspired me as much as I did 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.980
 with someone to yesterday, although a red one 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.810
 pray soup 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.869
 These are the ingredients that you can use 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.929
 needs and I can you ever 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.500
 one betrayed it becomes one 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:39.160
 challenge and it will be right 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:41.710
 really sparkling, we need the 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.690
 red pray that here is the natural 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.609
 red pray not already precooked 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.260
 potatoes a big potato 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:54.690
 I took two here because the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.269
 are quite small and a big onion 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.969
 a little creamy fraiche and a lot 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:04.180
 pepper the beetroot and the 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.800
 Potatoes I'll cook that now 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.180
 Water also boils already we cook the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.689
 first with peel and the potatoes 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.890
 also for 20 minutes or as long until 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.540
 the whole thing is soft and meanwhile thinnest 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:26.409
 we have some onions or 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:28.180
 the one onion we have so the 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.619
 beetroot and potatoes have 20 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.549
 cooked minutes now we play the 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.770
 red prayers 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.530
 This is really a thankless work 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.180
 So I'll show you if you have this 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.200
 Make a good look at this recipe 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.200
 maybe even the red beets through 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.290
 if someone has a better technique 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.290
 that I would like to know 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.180
 important is that the beet beautiful 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.330
 soft is so we continue 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.980
 just love now 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.470
 It's nice to be glassy while we are 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.830
 the cut will make the chosen one 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.810
 potato and beetroot small because 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:22.010
 we do the same mission mountain like that 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.010
 so that then not so big 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.240
 now comes the quote offer 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.560
 tuned 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.480
 Of course you can also if you are after 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:37.260
 the want to have no red finger 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:40.770
 take beautiful gloves cut 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.040
 and that only takes longer until the 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:49.980
 onions are glassy and until the red 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:53.300
 beet small cut is small 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.550
 cut and now she comes to the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.180
 top so that we something from the beautiful 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.180
 closed 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.580
 Now we know that with fresh 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.910
 ground pepper and says a lot 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.910
 pepper 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.600
 Now we have the beetroot 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:53.430
 potatoes and they are steamed 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:55.050
 now the whole is pureed 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.330
 how we do best 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.330
 that would be the right buttocks for it 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.540
 Let's see if this works here 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.830
 We could have it now or if we could do that 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.830
 have to do it again in the pot 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.150
 we are already pouring something 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:39.229
 vegetable broth with that I already have 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.229
 times prepared 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.060
 and now we see it like ours 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.060
 red pray soup arises slowly 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.860
 Of course it is not that easy and that 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.880
 is certainly not a recipe for just 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.930
 between turns you have to 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.790
 focus 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.790
 but I am so happy already 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:00.530
 I have the re-transferred to the pot 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:04.790
 Now there is something to see you 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:07.130
 great color in the like a nice pink 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.550
 soup is that could be for example 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.620
 Serve with a style of mint or with 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.020
 Maybe that's for sure 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.560
 super and of course fresh and pepper 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:22.490
 and under give I show you like that 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.080
 soup on the plate looks wonderful 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.550
 that makes right 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:40.270
 the effort was worthwhile and we ourselves 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:40.270
 if the little ones go through blob 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.850
 delicious
