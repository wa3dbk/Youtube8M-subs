00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
product we see we have three different

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.499 
product we see we have three different
kinds<00:01:05.009> here<00:01:06.009> we<00:01:06.460> are<00:01:06.520> not<00:01:06.640> limited<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.390> that

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
kinds here we are not limited to that

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:08.999 
kinds here we are not limited to that
for<00:01:07.720> all<00:01:07.869> time<00:01:08.140> there<00:01:08.409> might<00:01:08.560> be<00:01:08.590> more<00:01:08.830> in<00:01:08.890> the

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
for all time there might be more in the

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.859 
for all time there might be more in the
future<00:01:09.130> but<00:01:09.549> we<00:01:09.759> start<00:01:10.060> off<00:01:10.150> with<00:01:10.299> this<00:01:10.390> three

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
future but we start off with this three

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.260 
future but we start off with this three
there's<00:01:11.470> three<00:01:11.590> radiator<00:01:12.340> sizes<00:01:12.850> there's<00:01:13.150> at

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
there's three radiator sizes there's at

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.600 
there's three radiator sizes there's at
each<00:01:13.390> roll<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.810> 120<00:01:14.439> centimeters<00:01:14.799> there's<00:01:15.400> to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
each roll to 120 centimeters there's to

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.419 
each roll to 120 centimeters there's to
the<00:01:15.700> s<00:01:15.850> 24<00:01:16.630> 20<00:01:17.320> 40<00:01:17.619> centimeters<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.219> there's

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
the s 24 20 40 centimeters and there's

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.489 
the s 24 20 40 centimeters and there's
the<00:01:18.640> s<00:01:18.929> 36<00:01:19.929> a<00:01:20.170> permanent<00:01:21.270> 360<00:01:22.270> centimeters<00:01:22.780> so

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:23.499 
the s 36 a permanent 360 centimeters so

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:25.200 
the s 36 a permanent 360 centimeters so
the<00:01:23.740> special<00:01:24.130> thing<00:01:24.369> about<00:01:24.399> that<00:01:24.909> Kelvin

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
the special thing about that Kelvin

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.910 
the special thing about that Kelvin
water<00:01:25.539> cooling<00:01:25.840> series<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.289> we<00:01:26.770> actually

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
water cooling series is we actually

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.279 
water cooling series is we actually
designed<00:01:27.310> everything<00:01:27.999> from<00:01:28.450> ground<00:01:28.749> up<00:01:28.929> news

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
designed everything from ground up news

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.459 
designed everything from ground up news
so<00:01:29.530> from<00:01:29.799> scratch<00:01:30.219> there's<00:01:30.609> no<00:01:30.929> OEM<00:01:31.929> radiators

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
so from scratch there's no OEM radiators

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.099 
so from scratch there's no OEM radiators
from<00:01:32.679> shelters<00:01:33.189> level<00:01:33.549> brand<00:01:33.789> on<00:01:33.999> stuff<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:34.810> if

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
from shelters level brand on stuff so if

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.459 
from shelters level brand on stuff so if
we<00:01:35.289> redesign<00:01:36.189> that<00:01:36.429> together<00:01:36.909> with<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.509> very

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
we redesign that together with a very

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:39.959 
we redesign that together with a very
experienced<00:01:38.920> partner<00:01:39.130> from<00:01:39.429> Europe<00:01:39.789> that's

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
experienced partner from Europe that's

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.330 
experienced partner from Europe that's
alphacool<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.259> we<00:01:41.530> actually<00:01:41.710> wanted<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.249> have

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
alphacool so we actually wanted to have

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.279 
alphacool so we actually wanted to have
to<00:01:42.429> go<00:01:42.579> to<00:01:42.639> use<00:01:42.969> very<00:01:43.420> very<00:01:43.719> high-end

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
to go to use very very high-end

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.739 
to go to use very very high-end
components<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:45.490> perfectly<00:01:46.090> match<00:01:46.389> together

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:46.749 
components that perfectly match together

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.410 
components that perfectly match together
for<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.679> high<00:01:47.859> and<00:01:48.039> water<00:01:48.219> cooling<00:01:48.549> serious<00:01:49.030> so

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
for a high and water cooling serious so

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.719 
for a high and water cooling serious so
the<00:01:50.049> thing<00:01:50.319> here<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:50.889> can<00:01:51.100> buy<00:01:51.280> this<00:01:51.340> and

water<00:02:08.830> cooling<00:02:09.160> system<00:02:09.490> my<00:02:09.640> point<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:10.030> view

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
water cooling system my point of view

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.910 
water cooling system my point of view
because<00:02:10.270> those<00:02:11.110> water<00:02:11.380> kills<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:11.860> you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
because those water kills so if you

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.530 
because those water kills so if you
listen<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.280> Biden<00:02:12.610> done<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.240> will<00:02:13.390> never

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
listen you Biden done it will never

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.720 
listen you Biden done it will never
change<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:14.080> or<00:02:14.230> stay<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.560> same<00:02:14.830> we<00:02:15.550> get

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
change it or stay the same we get

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.270 
change it or stay the same we get
something<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.450> expendable<00:02:17.290> has<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.740> very<00:02:18.100> high

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
something is expendable has a very high

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.309 
something is expendable has a very high
performance<00:02:18.880> at<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.120> very<00:02:19.510> low<00:02:19.720> noise<00:02:19.930> level

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
performance at a very low noise level

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.979 
performance at a very low noise level
which<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:21.069> obviously<00:02:22.000> kind<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.599> very<00:02:22.780> cool<00:02:22.959> of
