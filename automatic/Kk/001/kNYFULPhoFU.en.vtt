00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
don't know I'm going to guess 10 years

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.590 
don't know I'm going to guess 10 years
old<00:00:46.320> maybe<00:00:46.559> 15<00:00:47.100> years<00:00:47.129> old<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:48.420> been

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
old maybe 15 years old and it's been

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.369 
old maybe 15 years old and it's been
dripping<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:52.260> know<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.649> some<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.219> them<00:00:53.340> if

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
dripping and you know on some of them if

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.979 
dripping and you know on some of them if
you<00:00:55.379> want<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:56.219> your<00:00:56.820> faucets<00:00:57.300> only<00:00:57.480> five<00:00:57.719> years

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
you want if your faucets only five years

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.229 
you want if your faucets only five years
older<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.649> could<00:00:59.010> take<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.460> handle<00:00:59.969> off

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
older so you could take this handle off

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.810 
older so you could take this handle off
and<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:01.170> there's<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.410> cartridge<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.250> most<00:01:02.550> of

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and then there's a cartridge in most of

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.490 
and then there's a cartridge in most of
them<00:01:02.940> right<00:01:03.449> here<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.230> pull<00:01:04.470> out

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and then you can take to the store match

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.800 
and then you can take to the store match
up<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.620> replace<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.940> maybe<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.480> can<00:01:09.630> get

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
rubber this that and the other thing you

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.289 
rubber this that and the other thing you
know<00:01:36.479> what<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.659> mean<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.399> sometimes<00:01:38.399> if<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.759> if

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
know what I mean and sometimes if you if

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.240 
know what I mean and sometimes if you if
you<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.009> leaking

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
you see that it's it that is leaking

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.490 
you see that it's it that is leaking
down<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:42.000> maybe<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.450> not<00:01:42.570> leaking<00:01:42.899> from<00:01:43.350> up

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
down here maybe it's not leaking from up

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
down here maybe it's not leaking from up
here<00:01:43.680> maybe<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.130> leaking<00:01:44.460> down<00:01:44.490> here<00:01:45.000> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
here maybe it's leaking down here and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.240 
here maybe it's leaking down here and
you<00:01:45.149> think<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.570> all<00:01:45.719> in<00:01:45.899> here<00:01:46.170> before<00:01:46.829> you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you think it's all in here before you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.480 
you think it's all in here before you
think<00:01:47.820> about<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.360> pull<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:50.189> if

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
think about it pull this out and see if

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.859 
think about it pull this out and see if
this<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:52.159> connection<00:01:53.159> right<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.060> tight

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
this a connection right here it's tight

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.690 
this a connection right here it's tight
because<00:01:55.200> sometimes<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.920> could<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.369> dripping

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
because sometimes this could be dripping

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.080 
because sometimes this could be dripping
and<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.530> don't<00:01:59.039> really<00:01:59.219> notice<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.850> when

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and then you don't really notice it when

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.600 
and then you don't really notice it when
you<00:02:00.210> when<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.289> pull<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.920> maybe<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you when you pull this on maybe the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.429 
you when you pull this on maybe the
water<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.969> dripping<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.509> there<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.079> comes<00:02:04.320> out

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
water is dripping in there and comes out

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.200

Ridge but I pull this apart and it looks

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.089 
Ridge but I pull this apart and it looks
pretty<00:02:43.620> stout<00:02:44.129> and<00:02:44.519> see<00:02:45.420> right<00:02:46.079> here<00:02:46.469> it's<00:02:46.709> got

pretty stout and see right here it's got

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.039 
pretty stout and see right here it's got
a<00:02:47.359> soap<00:02:48.359> dispenser<00:02:49.159> attached<00:02:50.180> right<00:02:51.180> here<00:02:51.239> on

a soap dispenser attached right here on
the<00:02:52.590> base<00:02:52.859> and<00:02:53.299> so<00:02:54.299> when<00:02:54.750> we<00:02:54.900> have<00:02:55.109> that<00:02:55.500> we're

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
the base and so when we have that we're

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.860 
the base and so when we have that we're
probably<00:02:56.489> not<00:02:56.730> going<00:02:56.939> to<00:02:57.000> need<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.359> are<00:02:57.689> we

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
probably not going to need this are we

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.690 
probably not going to need this are we
and<00:02:58.019> see<00:02:58.139> how<00:02:58.230> close<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.859> is<00:02:59.569> right<00:03:00.569> here<00:03:00.959> now

going to be a hole here in your sink and

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.679 
going to be a hole here in your sink and
then<00:03:23.129> we're<00:03:23.219> going<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.370> have<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.669> get<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.849> blank

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:24.689 
then we're going to have to get a blank

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.280 
then we're going to have to get a blank
plate<00:03:25.109> there<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.030> for<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.120> right<00:03:27.359> size<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:27.840> I

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
plate there and for the right size and I

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.869
