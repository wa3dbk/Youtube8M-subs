00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
and it feels horrible feels terrible the

most<00:01:51.450> cheapest<00:01:52.200> plastic<00:01:52.770> ever<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.320> feels

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
most cheapest plastic ever so it feels

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.800 
most cheapest plastic ever so it feels
very<00:01:55.799> terrible<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.579> don't<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.880> personally<00:01:57.450> don't

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
very terrible I don't I personally don't

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.550 
very terrible I don't I personally don't
like<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.110> at<00:01:58.229> all

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
like it at all

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.870 
like it at all
so<00:01:59.310> they<00:01:59.490> proved<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.030> lot<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.200> 1200<00:02:01.740> D<00:02:02.219> on

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
so they proved a lot with the 1200 D on

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.480 
so they proved a lot with the 1200 D on
my<00:02:02.939> opinion<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.750> doesn't<00:02:04.049> feel<00:02:04.140> great<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.369> it

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
my opinion it doesn't feel great but it

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.570 
my opinion it doesn't feel great but it
feels<00:02:05.759> way<00:02:06.119> better<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.930> way<00:02:07.680> nicer<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.399> my

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
feels way better and way nicer in my

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.840 
feels way better and way nicer in my
opinion<00:02:09.060> um<00:02:09.349> so<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.800> that

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
opinion um so I like that

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.260 
opinion um so I like that
that<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.270> one<00:02:12.720> point<00:02:12.960> also<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> bit

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
that is one point also it is a bit

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.700 
that is one point also it is a bit
lighter<00:02:15.600> with<00:02:16.220> 480<00:02:17.220> grams<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.700> newer<00:02:17.850> version

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
lighter with 480 grams the newer version

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.630 
lighter with 480 grams the newer version
against<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:21.620> 495<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:23.130> something<00:02:23.520> like

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
against I think 495 or something like

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.860 
against I think 495 or something like
that<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.600> bit<00:02:24.870> lighter<00:02:25.730> overall<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.510> that's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
that but a bit lighter overall so that's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.790 
that but a bit lighter overall so that's
the<00:02:28.140> hardware<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.840> display<00:02:30.840> has<00:02:31.170> also<00:02:31.380> been

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
the hardware the display has also been

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.900 
the hardware the display has also been
improved<00:02:32.100> on<00:02:32.880> it's<00:02:33.150> now<00:02:33.600> 3<00:02:34.160> inches<00:02:35.220> against

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
improved on it's now 3 inches against

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.440 
improved on it's now 3 inches against
2.7<00:02:36.690> inches<00:02:37.020> both<00:02:37.710> fixed<00:02:38.310> screen<00:02:38.640> without<00:02:39.420> a

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
was also a bit more useful

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.460 
was also a bit more useful
and<00:04:24.130> there's<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.520> little<00:04:24.850> less<00:04:25.210> noise<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:26.290> the

picture in the pictures one thing that

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.320 
picture in the pictures one thing that
surprised<00:04:30.190> me<00:04:30.340> very<00:04:30.850> much

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
surprised me very much

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.100 
surprised me very much
was<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.750> battery<00:04:32.020> life<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:34.090> older<00:04:34.630> version

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
was the battery life the older version

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.550 
was the battery life the older version
of<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:36.810> 1100<00:04:37.830> D<00:04:38.830> had<00:04:39.820> in<00:04:40.120> battery<00:04:40.540> up<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.690> 700

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
of the 1100 D had in battery up to 700

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.070 
of the 1100 D had in battery up to 700
shots<00:04:41.950> which<00:04:42.670> is<00:04:43.150> good

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
shots which is good

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.300 
shots which is good
I'm<00:04:44.320> actually<00:04:44.950> not<00:04:45.370> bad<00:04:46.230> but<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.950> newer

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
I'm actually not bad but the newer

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.430 
I'm actually not bad but the newer
version<00:04:48.730> has<00:04:48.910> only<00:04:49.180> 500<00:04:49.510> shot<00:04:50.050> so<00:04:50.410> that

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
version has only 500 shot so that

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.550 
version has only 500 shot so that
surprised<00:04:51.130> me<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.370> lot<00:04:51.550> I've<00:04:52.420> no<00:04:52.660> idea<00:04:52.690> why<00:04:53.140> they

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
surprised me a lot I've no idea why they

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.920 
surprised me a lot I've no idea why they
did<00:04:53.740> that<00:04:53.770> I'm<00:04:54.760> sure<00:04:55.000> they<00:04:55.630> could<00:04:55.810> have

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
did that I'm sure they could have

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.160 
did that I'm sure they could have
improved<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.680> battery<00:04:56.980> life<00:04:57.160> or<00:04:57.400> at<00:04:57.490> least

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
improved the battery life or at least

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.550 
improved the battery life or at least
stayed<00:04:59.170> the<00:04:59.620> same<00:04:59.910> so<00:05:00.910> I'm<00:05:01.420> not<00:05:01.720> sure<00:05:01.780> so<00:05:02.410> if

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
stayed the same so I'm not sure so if

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.230 
stayed the same so I'm not sure so if
you<00:05:02.710> want<00:05:02.980> a<00:05:03.070> high<00:05:03.340> battery<00:05:03.640> life<00:05:03.970> you

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
you want a high battery life you

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.560 
you want a high battery life you
shouldn't<00:05:04.630> buy<00:05:05.230> the<00:05:05.820> newer<00:05:06.820> version<00:05:07.270> because

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
shouldn't buy the newer version because

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.770 
shouldn't buy the newer version because
it's<00:05:08.260> only<00:05:08.590> lasts<00:05:08.830> for<00:05:08.920> 500<00:05:09.520> shots<00:05:09.730> which<00:05:10.570> is

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
it's only lasts for 500 shots which is

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.830 
it's only lasts for 500 shots which is
not<00:05:11.020> very<00:05:11.260> good<00:05:11.620> last<00:05:12.280> but<00:05:12.610> not<00:05:12.760> least<00:05:13.060> is<00:05:13.300> the

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
not very good last but not least is the

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.390 
not very good last but not least is the
video<00:05:14.230> mode<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:15.100> video<00:05:15.430> mode<00:05:15.610> improved<00:05:16.240> a<00:05:16.480> lot

a<00:05:42.970> huge<00:05:43.420> improvement<00:05:43.660> I<00:05:44.170> haven't<00:05:44.920> tried<00:05:45.130> it

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
a huge improvement I haven't tried it

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.050 
a huge improvement I haven't tried it
but<00:05:46.090> from<00:05:46.450> specs<00:05:46.870> wise<00:05:47.140> it's<00:05:47.470> very<00:05:47.770> good

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
but from specs wise it's very good

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.600 
but from specs wise it's very good

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
detection in video I don't know how it

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.560 
detection in video I don't know how it
works<00:05:54.960> but<00:05:55.960> if<00:05:56.500> it<00:05:56.950> works<00:05:57.130> good<00:05:57.400> it's<00:05:58.120> a<00:05:58.300> very

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
works but if it works good it's a very

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.320 
works but if it works good it's a very
good<00:05:58.840> improvement<00:05:59.140> for<00:05:59.530> a<00:05:59.850> very<00:06:00.850> good<00:06:01.090> feature

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
good improvement for a very good feature

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.790 
good improvement for a very good feature
for<00:06:01.540> a<00:06:01.750> very<00:06:02.200> inexpensive<00:06:03.300> DSLR<00:06:04.300> camera

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
for a very inexpensive DSLR camera

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.540 
for a very inexpensive DSLR camera
overall<00:06:05.800> both<00:06:06.430> DSLRs<00:06:07.420> are<00:06:07.600> great<00:06:08.190> but<00:06:09.190> for<00:06:09.520> a

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
overall both DSLRs are great but for a

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.150 
overall both DSLRs are great but for a
very<00:06:09.820> low<00:06:10.180> price<00:06:10.210> point<00:06:11.020> I<00:06:11.230> think<00:06:11.920> they're

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
very low price point I think they're

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.760 
very low price point I think they're
worth<00:06:12.610> a<00:06:12.850> shot<00:06:13.180> if<00:06:13.450> you<00:06:13.480> have<00:06:13.720> a<00:06:13.750> low<00:06:13.960> budget<00:06:14.170> or

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
worth a shot if you have a low budget or

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.570 
worth a shot if you have a low budget or
a<00:06:14.830> very<00:06:15.370> very<00:06:16.090> beginning<00:06:16.330> photographer<00:06:17.290> um

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
a very very beginning photographer um

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.970 
a very very beginning photographer um
otherwise<00:06:18.580> I<00:06:18.970> would<00:06:19.240> go<00:06:19.390> with<00:06:19.600> the<00:06:19.780> 700d<00:06:20.710> if

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 
otherwise I would go with the 700d if

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.810 
otherwise I would go with the 700d if
you<00:06:21.100> have<00:06:21.280> a<00:06:21.310> bit<00:06:21.610> more<00:06:21.850> to<00:06:22.030> spend<00:06:22.330> or<00:06:22.980> a<00:06:23.980> Nikon

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
you have a bit more to spend or a Nikon

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.890

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
I like my D 3200 with the 3300 or the
