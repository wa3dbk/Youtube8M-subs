when I come in Ozzy trying to me here

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.880 
when I come in Ozzy trying to me here
that<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.450> optimal<00:01:54.929> position<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.530> this

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
that is the optimal position for this

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.770 
that is the optimal position for this
other<00:01:56.190> than<00:01:56.490> not<00:01:56.670> being<00:01:56.940> there<00:01:57.179> at<00:01:57.330> all<00:01:57.450> this

other than not being there at all this

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.809 
other than not being there at all this

would be the optimal position if you had

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.210 
would be the optimal position if you had
to<00:01:59.970> engage<00:02:00.090> me<00:02:00.500> this<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.679> a<00:02:01.709> great<00:02:02.039> position

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
to engage me this is a great position

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.600 
to engage me this is a great position
because<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:02.910> relative<00:02:04.550> distance<00:02:05.550> between

us<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.209> angle<00:02:06.690> makes<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.349> very<00:02:07.440> difficult

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
us and the angle makes it very difficult

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.280 
us and the angle makes it very difficult

always<00:02:44.739> going<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:44.950> end<00:02:45.040> up<00:02:45.459> in<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.909> cross<00:02:46.120> body

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
always going to end up in the cross body

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.089 
always going to end up in the cross body
position<00:02:46.840> sometimes<00:02:47.110> it's<00:02:47.500> happening<00:02:47.829> so

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
position sometimes it's happening so

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.059 
position sometimes it's happening so
fast<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:49.450> easiest<00:02:50.140> safest<00:02:50.379> thing<00:02:50.769> to<00:02:50.799> do

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
fast that the easiest safest thing to do

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.679 
fast that the easiest safest thing to do
at<00:02:51.189> that<00:02:51.340> moment<00:02:51.370> just<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.150> survive<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
at that moment just to survive the

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.899 
at that moment just to survive the
initial<00:02:52.840> attack<00:02:53.260> would<00:02:53.439> be<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:54.220> same<00:02:54.519> side

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
initial attack would be the same side

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.750 
initial attack would be the same side
hand<00:02:55.329> going<00:02:55.629> up<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.019> boss<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.349> facing<00:02:56.799> me<00:02:56.920> that

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
hand going up so boss is facing me that

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.339 
hand going up so boss is facing me that
may<00:02:58.090> be<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.360> hand<00:02:58.569> that<00:02:58.720> necessarily<00:02:59.200> needs

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
may be the hand that necessarily needs

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.589 
may be the hand that necessarily needs
to<00:02:59.620> come<00:02:59.859> up<00:02:59.890> right<00:03:00.189> away<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.970> this<00:03:01.150> comes<00:03:01.390> in

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
to come up right away so this comes in

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.020 
to come up right away so this comes in
and<00:03:01.810> he<00:03:02.049> checks<00:03:02.349> me<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.980> problem<00:03:03.579> is<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.909> if

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
and he checks me the problem is that if

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.119 
and he checks me the problem is that if
he<00:03:04.120> doesn't<00:03:04.359> do<00:03:04.659> something<00:03:04.689> very<00:03:05.260> quickly<00:03:05.590> I'm

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
he doesn't do something very quickly I'm

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.119 
he doesn't do something very quickly I'm
going<00:03:06.159> to<00:03:06.400> cut<00:03:06.579> through<00:03:06.790> his<00:03:06.879> arm<00:03:07.829> okay

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
going to cut through his arm okay

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.509 
going to cut through his arm okay
now<00:03:10.170> he<00:03:11.170> also<00:03:11.319> understands<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.099> my

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
now he also understands that my

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.210 
now he also understands that my
shoulders<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.180> articulate<00:03:13.720> inward<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:14.889> if

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
shoulders that articulate inward so if

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.550 
shoulders that articulate inward so if
you<00:03:15.459> had<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.849> put<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.209> hand<00:03:16.450> up<00:03:16.659> and<00:03:17.230> let's<00:03:17.470> do

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
you had to put this hand up and let's do

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.190 
you had to put this hand up and let's do
it<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:17.799> way<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.389> smart<00:03:19.389> thing<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.629> do<00:03:19.900> would<00:03:20.049> be

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
it this way a smart thing to do would be

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.869 
it this way a smart thing to do would be
to<00:03:20.230> block<00:03:20.470> my<00:03:20.680> shoulder<00:03:21.099> so<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.459> comes<00:03:21.700> in

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
to block my shoulder so this comes in

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.789

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
this prevents me from cutting through

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.369 
this prevents me from cutting through
and<00:03:26.049> buys<00:03:26.560> him<00:03:26.799> some<00:03:27.069> measure<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.519> time<00:03:28.349> okay

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
underneath I'm training for that but I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.230 
underneath I'm training for that but I
need<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.050> barrier<00:04:43.440> on<00:04:43.590> this<00:04:43.800> side<00:04:44.070> I<00:04:44.400> want<00:04:45.180> to

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
variation of this exercise I will be

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.350 
variation of this exercise I will be
cutting<00:04:50.400> them<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:50.790> is<00:04:50.910> almost<00:04:51.210> the

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
cutting them this is almost the

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.700 
cutting them this is almost the
intermediate<00:04:51.840> level<00:04:52.110> of<00:04:52.320> this<00:04:53.220> drill<00:04:53.700> again

if<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:56.040> need<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.250> check<00:04:56.580> me<00:04:56.880> on<00:04:56.910> one<00:04:57.240> side

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
if you need to check me on one side

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.780 
if you need to check me on one side
because<00:04:57.690> maybe<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.190> surprised<00:04:59.190> them<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.550> know

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
because maybe I surprised them I know

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.140 
because maybe I surprised them I know
this<00:04:59.970> out<00:05:00.200> that<00:05:01.200> would<00:05:01.350> be<00:05:01.470> optimal<00:05:01.940> but<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.030> is

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
this out that would be optimal but it is

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.730 
this out that would be optimal but it is
got<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.450> check<00:05:03.660> me<00:05:03.810> on<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:03.990> other<00:05:04.080> side<00:05:04.200> you

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
got to check me on the other side you

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.410 
got to check me on the other side you
may<00:05:04.890> want<00:05:05.100> to<00:05:05.160> stop<00:05:05.370> my<00:05:05.520> shoulder<00:05:05.970> as<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.210> come

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
may want to stop my shoulder as I come

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.200 
may want to stop my shoulder as I come
in<00:05:06.600> boom<00:05:07.370> okay<00:05:08.370> at<00:05:08.520> this<00:05:08.670> point<00:05:08.760> he<00:05:09.060> can

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
in boom okay at this point he can

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.990 
in boom okay at this point he can
recover<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.990> cross<00:05:10.230> body<00:05:10.470> position<00:05:10.950> and<00:05:12.350> I<00:05:13.350> can

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
recover to cross body position and I can

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.080 
recover to cross body position and I can
break<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.210> repetition<00:05:16.250> of<00:05:17.250> bringing<00:05:17.820> the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
break the repetition of bringing the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.000 
break the repetition of bringing the
same<00:05:18.419> side<00:05:18.780> Arnold

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.860 

by<00:05:23.010> putting<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.730> little<00:05:23.760> bit<00:05:24.000> of<00:05:24.120> trapping<00:05:24.630> into

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
by putting a little bit of trapping into

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.390 
by putting a little bit of trapping into
the<00:05:24.990> mix<00:05:25.460> okay<00:05:26.460> so<00:05:27.380> this<00:05:28.380> is<00:05:28.620> just<00:05:28.650> one<00:05:29.190> way

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
the mix okay so this is just one way

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.670 
the mix okay so this is just one way
that<00:05:29.430> we<00:05:29.760> can<00:05:29.940> do<00:05:30.120> this<00:05:30.330> this<00:05:31.290> is<00:05:31.470> a<00:05:31.500> great

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
that we can do this this is a great

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.510 
that we can do this this is a great
warm-up<00:05:32.070> for<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.580> scenario<00:05:32.940> training

warm-up for a scenario training
sometimes<00:05:35.520> we<00:05:35.850> may<00:05:35.970> use<00:05:36.120> knife<00:05:36.360> sparring<00:05:36.900> as<00:05:37.020> a

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
sometimes we may use knife sparring as a

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.750 
sometimes we may use knife sparring as a
prelude<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.590> this<00:05:37.830> just<00:05:38.100> to<00:05:38.190> get<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.430> nervous

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
prelude to this just to get the nervous

prelude to this just to get the nervous
system<00:05:39.150> a<00:05:39.180> little<00:05:39.390> bit<00:05:39.600> more<00:05:39.780> hyped<00:05:40.020> up

sometimes<00:05:41.790> we<00:05:42.030> incorporate<00:05:42.600> hitting<00:05:43.020> or<00:05:43.650> even

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
sometimes we incorporate hitting or even

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.800 
sometimes we incorporate hitting or even
kicking<00:05:44.370> into<00:05:44.610> this<00:05:44.910> drill<00:05:45.240> there's<00:05:45.450> a<00:05:45.540> lot<00:05:45.690> of

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
kicking into this drill there's a lot of

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.080 
kicking into this drill there's a lot of
