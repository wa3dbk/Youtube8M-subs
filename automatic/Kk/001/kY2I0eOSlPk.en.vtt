enclosures they basically you can view

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.620 
enclosures they basically you can view
all<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.449> way<00:00:21.869> around<00:00:23.119> what<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.150> like<00:00:24.420> about

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
all the way around what I like about

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.870 
all the way around what I like about
this<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.410> comes<00:00:25.740> several<00:00:26.550> different<00:00:26.789> ways

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
this is it comes several different ways

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.700 
this is it comes several different ways
it<00:00:27.090> comes<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> ability<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.199> put<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.560> on

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it comes with the ability to put it on

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.480 
it comes with the ability to put it on
the<00:00:28.890> stand

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the stand

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.250 
the stand
it<00:00:29.760> also<00:00:29.970> comes<00:00:30.330> through<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.599> ability<00:00:30.840> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
it also comes through the ability to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.709 
it also comes through the ability to
actually<00:00:31.650> hang<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.489> from<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:32.940> ceiling<00:00:33.180> so

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
actually hang it from your ceiling so

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.150 
actually hang it from your ceiling so
this<00:00:33.930> could<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.110> something<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.530> could<00:00:34.920> be

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
this could be something that could be

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.090 
this could be something that could be
hung<00:00:35.460> obviously<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.600> not<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.170> heavy<00:00:37.410> you

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
hung obviously it's not that heavy you

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.490 
hung obviously it's not that heavy you
put<00:00:38.579> some<00:00:38.790> substrate<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:40.020> course<00:00:40.260> it's

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
put some substrate in it of course it's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200 
put some substrate in it of course it's
gonna<00:00:40.649> get<00:00:40.890> some<00:00:41.100> weight<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:42.030> they

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
gonna get some weight to it but they

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.330 
gonna get some weight to it but they
came<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.989> way<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.260> actually<00:00:43.890> hang<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
came up with a way to actually hang it

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.580 
came up with a way to actually hang it
and<00:00:44.489> there's<00:00:44.969> two<00:00:45.149> clips<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.200> then

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and there's two clips in here and then

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.250 
and there's two clips in here and then
this<00:00:46.800> basically<00:00:47.610> comes<00:00:47.969> out<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.480> there's<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
this basically comes out and there's a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.350 
this basically comes out and there's a
cord<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.070> comes<00:00:50.309> out<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.760> two<00:00:51.059> hanger

cord that comes out of here two hanger

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.020 
cord that comes out of here two hanger
and<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:52.170> great<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.920> some<00:00:53.430> features<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.879> want

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
and it's great so some features I want

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.729 
and it's great so some features I want
to<00:00:54.090> show<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.270> about<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.809> chameleon<00:00:55.140> Cantina

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
to show you about this chameleon Cantina

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.130 
to show you about this chameleon Cantina
which<00:00:56.250> make<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.550> an<00:00:56.850> exciting<00:00:57.449> different<00:00:57.750> kind

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
which make it an exciting different kind

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.189 
which make it an exciting different kind
of<00:00:58.199> enclosure<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.699> basically<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:01.170> can

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
of enclosure is that basically you can

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.529 
of enclosure is that basically you can
put<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:01.800> dome<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.820> there's<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
put your dome up here and there's just a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.250 
put your dome up here and there's just a
few<00:01:03.570> clips<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.290> hold<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.790> place<00:01:06.260> these

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
few clips that hold this in place these

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.730 
few clips that hold this in place these
clips<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.880> put<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.420> here

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
clips out and then you can put up here

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
clips out and then you can put up here
which<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.890> course<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:12.119> screen<00:01:12.600> cop<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.200> top

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
which of course as a screen cop on top

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.730 
which of course as a screen cop on top
so<00:01:14.150> it's<00:01:15.150> metal<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
so it's metal just like this and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.370 
so it's metal just like this and
essentially<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.700> rest<00:01:21.299> your<00:01:21.750> dome

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
essentially all you do is rest your dome

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.230 
essentially all you do is rest your dome
here<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.920> could<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> 10<00:01:23.490> inch<00:01:23.700> dome<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> could

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
here it could be a 10 inch dome it could

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.999 
here it could be a 10 inch dome it could
be<00:01:24.330> an<00:01:24.420> extra<00:01:24.780> deep<00:01:24.960> dome<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.439> could<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> mini

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
be an extra deep dome it could be a mini

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.560 
be an extra deep dome it could be a mini
dome<00:01:26.280> depending<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.150> want<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> put

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
dome depending on what you want to put

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.569 
dome depending on what you want to put
in<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.080> lot<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.619> people<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.189> need<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
in here a lot of people just need a

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.060 
in here a lot of people just need a
compact<00:01:30.180> fluorescent<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.990> they'll<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.860> some

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
compact fluorescent and they'll do some

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.890 
compact fluorescent and they'll do some
kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> heat<00:01:32.490> map<00:01:32.700> from<00:01:32.939> below<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.720> this

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
kind of heat map from below but on this

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.789 
kind of heat map from below but on this
type<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.229> enclosure

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
type of enclosure

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.590 
type of enclosure
what's<00:01:35.159> mostly<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> go<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.390> is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
what's mostly going to go in here is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.100 
what's mostly going to go in here is
chameleons<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.610> similar<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.820> boreal<00:01:39.450> types<00:01:39.869> of

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
chameleons and similar a boreal types of

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.230 
chameleons and similar a boreal types of
small<00:01:40.710> lizards<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:41.790> you're<00:01:41.939> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> need

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
small lizards so you're going to need

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.870 
small lizards so you're going to need
smaller<00:01:42.600> species<00:01:42.960> chameleons<00:01:43.710> or<00:01:43.880> smaller

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
smaller species chameleons or smaller

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.760 
smaller species chameleons or smaller
chameleons<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.229> eventually<00:01:46.439> grow

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
chameleons that will eventually grow

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.399 
chameleons that will eventually grow
larger<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.549> outgrow<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.270> enclosure<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.320> it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
larger and outgrow this enclosure but it

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
bulb in extra deep dome and that will do

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.860 
bulb in extra deep dome and that will do
the<00:02:10.349> entire<00:02:10.590> closure<00:02:11.220> like

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
the entire closure like

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
mega ray 70 watt works perfectly in here

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.050 
mega ray 70 watt works perfectly in here
so<00:02:15.140> another<00:02:15.650> thing<00:02:15.739> about<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.340> enclosure<00:02:16.730> is

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
so another thing about this enclosure is

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.059 
so another thing about this enclosure is
it<00:02:17.420> doesn't<00:02:17.780> come<00:02:18.170> with<00:02:18.319> this<00:02:18.440> cantina

it doesn't come with this cantina

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.680 
it doesn't come with this cantina

chameleon drinking fountain so now the

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.520 
chameleon drinking fountain so now the
back<00:02:42.590> of<00:02:42.829> this<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.280> interesting<00:02:44.079> the<00:02:45.079> back<00:02:45.290> of

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
back of this is interesting the back of

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.550 
back of this is interesting the back of
this<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:45.950> put<00:02:46.220> on<00:02:46.370> with<00:02:46.760> magnets<00:02:47.329> I'm<00:02:47.930> going<00:02:48.440> to

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
this is put on with magnets I'm going to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.520 
this is put on with magnets I'm going to
make<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.739> recommendation<00:02:48.980> here<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.290> like<00:02:51.290> this

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
make a recommendation here I like this

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.979 
make a recommendation here I like this
concept<00:02:51.799> it's<00:02:52.400> great<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.030> magnets<00:02:53.780> work

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
concept it's great the magnets work

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.880 
concept it's great the magnets work
pretty<00:02:54.290> well<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:55.220> if<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.549> was<00:02:55.790> my<00:02:56.000> enclosure

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
pretty well but if this was my enclosure

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.009 
pretty well but if this was my enclosure
because<00:02:57.890> magnets<00:02:58.579> can<00:02:58.730> only<00:02:58.909> do<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.420> much<00:02:59.690> I

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
because magnets can only do so much I

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.180 
because magnets can only do so much I
would<00:03:00.650> actually<00:03:00.829> apply<00:03:01.810> velcro<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:03.440> all<00:03:03.829> the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
would actually apply velcro to all the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.970 
would actually apply velcro to all the
edging<00:03:04.609> here<00:03:04.909> and<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.659> will<00:03:05.900> enable<00:03:06.379> you<00:03:06.950> to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
edging here and this will enable you to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.360 
edging here and this will enable you to
pull<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.609> off<00:03:07.879> and<00:03:08.769> you'll<00:03:09.769> be<00:03:09.829> able<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.190> easily

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
pull it off and you'll be able to easily

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.430 
pull it off and you'll be able to easily
getting<00:03:10.819> but<00:03:11.329> your<00:03:11.480> animals<00:03:11.840> will<00:03:12.049> never<00:03:12.230> be

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
getting but your animals will never be

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.559 
getting but your animals will never be
able<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.680> just<00:03:13.040> push<00:03:13.519> this<00:03:13.700> magnetic<00:03:14.299> strip

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
able to just push this magnetic strip

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.780 
able to just push this magnetic strip
off<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.500> would<00:03:15.980> like<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.250> see<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.430> little<00:03:16.579> more

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
off so I would like to see a little more

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.430 
off so I would like to see a little more
stability<00:03:16.940> here<00:03:17.480> but<00:03:17.690> adding<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.079> little<00:03:18.290> bit

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
stability here but adding a little bit

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.680 
stability here but adding a little bit
of<00:03:18.560> velcro<00:03:18.709> around<00:03:19.310> will<00:03:19.819> certainly<00:03:20.209> secure

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
of velcro around will certainly secure

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.360 
of velcro around will certainly secure
it<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:20.959> again<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:22.099> is<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.370> great<00:03:23.319> 360-degree

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
it so again this is a great 360-degree

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.250 
it so again this is a great 360-degree
enclosure<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.910> comes<00:03:26.269> with<00:03:26.510> all<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:27.019> stuff

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
enclosure it comes with all of the stuff
