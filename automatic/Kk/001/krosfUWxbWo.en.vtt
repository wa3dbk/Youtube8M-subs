00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.870
 so here is little a whole she who 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.809
 is a reflexive relationship in 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.639
 can it only for all xyz 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.410
 belonging to sore x who are sleeping 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.790
 relationship with y is answering in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.199
 relationship with z 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.609
 I do not need to say that it is 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.900
 by airbus he has no ambiguity 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.949
 between home and this relationship 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.070
 it implies that z in relation to x in 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.220
 question or request to demonstrate that the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.230
 air relation and a relationship 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.579
 equivalence already she and reflective 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.160
 so we have more to prove 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.960
 do not forget that a relationship 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.670
 of equivalence and remained in agreement so 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.840
 more than he had already reflexive he we 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:55.550
 lack symmetry to demonstrate and finally 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:58.920
 transitivity already air and reflexive 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:03.059
 it only remains to demonstrate the two 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.780
 who remain then I demonstrate it and the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.590
 symmetry 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.619
 I remember that symmetry for a 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.140
 binary relation 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:19.259
 that's when for any type there 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.890
 belonging to them I risked in 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.700
 aldo relationship will say that implies that there 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.390
 is in relation with worse if I have that 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.210
 necessarily 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:39.040
 the problem males i have macinnis hockey 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:42.220
 and for transitivity if for all 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.990
 tripled have everything xyz 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.910
 I want a catechean project so I 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.490
 can talk like that belonging to them 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.830
 if the two conditions of reunited they 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.590
 would be in relation with yy is in 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.190
 relationship with z let's remember it 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.720
 involved 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:03.039
 x is related to these aids ok I 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.050
 so go away from what for the 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.970
 symmetry of hickstead in relation to y 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.700
 for all can belong to it 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.989
 square ips in connection with involving there 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.330
 and there I look what I 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.010
 can do 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.630
 so I know that already the relationship 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.180
 and click on it necessarily makes a 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.410
 hypothesis that will reuse either for 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.200
 assimilate it to bring in the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.780
 transitivity or see even the two so 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.459
 x in relation y years when he invites 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.640
 relational are involved e you are in 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.019
 relationship with x I hope especially that 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.650
 you do not think that that means 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.320
 that relationship and transit eyes a little 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.049
 attention to the order here an earthquake is in 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.130
 relationship the aids and not the opposite 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:53.860
 okay even though whatever you say whatever 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.459
 because the starting assumptions can 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.799
 to be that it could change 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.140
 so you agree with me 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.440
 since my relationship is very flexible 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.350
 bah I'm doing a little pass pass 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.920
 I'm going badly a game so a middle of this 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.220
 relationship 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.230
 so I will take this property 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.770
 for granted well I'll say that x 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.770
 who is connected with 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.230
 it's like saying that x is in relation 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.910
 with y 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.330
 and then an investigation related to 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:32.600
 himself anyway the eric relationship 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:37.940
 excited by this process what does it mean 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.280
 z is related to x so y is in 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.550
 relation with x by this same process 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.620
 so that implies that there is in relation 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.210
 with mx and I just demonstrated to May 6 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.670
 so I know that my property and if m 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.560
 precisely because I know that badly 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.400
 symmetrical probability I use it well 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.470
 thinking then for all tripled xyz 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.910
 belonging to them at the cube 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.260
 I owe it from this relationship 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:12.100
 Ben makes the pout qazana x in relation 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.410
 with y up and y in relation to z 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.340
 already involved kicks is in relation 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.440
 with z 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.299
 but since the property is symmetrical 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.760
 with a few years is in relation 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.480
 with x in jalles twenty three assists 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.870
 I say it like that now it's 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.880
 completed 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.350
 that means that the big place one 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.900
 symmetry cpt and his friends jacques of 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.630
 transitive largo to order if you 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.160
 have understood well if she started to 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.660
 demonstrate that the variation of transits 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.720
 yvon would be stuck from there 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.990
 okay that means he's going to 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.910
 first show who has been so mythical 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.770
 if there are problems of this type to 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.540
 inverting sometimes we may have 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.760
 need a transitivity to demonstrate 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.760
 asymmetry is the opposite also
