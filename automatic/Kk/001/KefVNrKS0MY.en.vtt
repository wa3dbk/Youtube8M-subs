00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.880
 unboxing samsung galaxy tab pro 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:16.230
 8.4 a really interesting tablet for 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.940
 performance ratio size we go 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.949
 then extracting the tablet by doing 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.750
 scroll down this side we can see 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.880
 the device we will talk about here 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.039
 soon we go to see the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.910
 rest of the budget which includes the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.750
 charger with usb shared by two 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.660
 amp USB micro USB data cable 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.870
 earphones also present in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.450
 this case therefore not always accessory 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.010
 present in the packaging of a tablet i 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.390
 domains for adaptation for i 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.309
 ear pads the manuals 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.289
 quick and nothing else 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.930
 then we take device in hand and 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:57.000
 let's talk about dimensions are 219 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.690
 mm x 128.5 for 7.2 the millimeters of 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.460
 thickness for a weight of 336 g 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.930
 the battery that equips this tablet 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.090
 is 4,800 milian per hour and we go to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.670
 see the examination of the sides of the tablet 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.640
 here on the left side only the slot of 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.610
 micro sd expansion upper side that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.729
 finds the jack of the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.520
 three and a half right side headphones that 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.350

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.840
 unlocking and volume rocker as well 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.720
 the infrared port for functions 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.090
 on the remote we go to the side 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.210
 lower where we find the two speakers 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.810
 stereo for playing the sounds of 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.700
 system and micro usb input 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.810
 let's go to the front where we find the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.990
 2 megapixel camera with the sensor of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.350

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.079
 touch and and the middle physical key for 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.140

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.330

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.090
 imagine we find the rubberized cover that 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.870
 now identifies all the products of 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.090
 samsung 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.330
 at least the high-end ones that 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.700
 embeds the 8 megapixel camera with 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.170
 the led flash and autofocus 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.800

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.709
