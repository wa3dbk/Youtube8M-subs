00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.790

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.010

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.080

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.199
 in order to watch this 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.600
 magnificent than the phenomenon and speculate 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.640
 about life which is also beautiful also 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.650

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.449

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.250
 this is sugar and what kind of plant is it 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.980
 today we are in more detail 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.050
 this and find out actually Sakura 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.420
 this is a generic name for several 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.910
 varieties of cherries though in garden literature 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.610
 more common 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.910
 designation sakura is superfluous 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.950
 the serrate is now bred 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.530
 a huge number of varieties are very 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.629
 ornamental with weeping branches even 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.489
 there are that hang down to the ground with 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.899
 terry flowers really sakura 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.870
 when this stunner blooms 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.100
 when you can see almost no branches and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.780
 foliage only big ones so big 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.380
 bright pink flowers here we have a garden 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.900
 center 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.400
 one of the varieties of sakura cherry 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.439
 finely serrated mono goals 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.119
 it is generally relatively small 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.630
 tree up to five meters high on 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.850
 grows somewhere a couple of meters wide 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.060
 the branches of this cherry grow exclusively 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.420
 up strictly upward directed large 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.920
 large rivers have shiny leaves 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.829
 here we have such a standard culture 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.829
 presented flowers sometime in May 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.600
 appear terry large to four 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.070
 centimeters in diameter they are collected in 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.320
 bunches and really gorgeous 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.180
 stunner naked trunk and 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.850
 The tip is so completely pink May 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.869
 of the month 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.189
 like basically enough 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.400
 demanding soils loves fertile 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.509
 soils and well moistened soils 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.850
 protected sunny places 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.280
 unfortunately not very resistant cultivar times 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.380
 especially young when you are saplings and 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.090
 buy desirable cover something 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.680
 well mature trees of course with age 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.380
 becomes more frost-resistant 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.659
 if you buy container culture 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.170
 sakura in the garden center in principle 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.670
 landing time no matter April 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.030
 Yes, and in summer you can even well, in principle 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.350
 the best is considered earlier autumn 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.150
 be sure to dig a hole so that 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.560
 root neck was at the level as she 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.540
 located in the container and 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.120
 be sure to grumble because you still have a fight 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.890
 us pine mulch for that 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.830
 so that the moisture is well kept because 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.480
 Sakura still love wet soil 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.280
 Well, again for the winter 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.590
 if you grumble you protect and 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.870
 this way your root system 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.730
 cherry blossoms from too much frost 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.239
 Still, the root system is not very 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.239
 deep 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.460
 if you want in the month of May to think about 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.570
 sense of life as the Japanese do here 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.800
 plant in my garden in the sakura 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.020
 admire and ride the game magnificent 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.640
 bloom and so we learned today with you
