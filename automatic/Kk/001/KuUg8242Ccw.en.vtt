00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.790 
going to layer those one on top of the
other<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.270> there's<00:01:26.510> about<00:01:26.780> like<00:01:27.350> just<00:01:27.680> a

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
other so there's about like just a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.380 
other so there's about like just a
smidge<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.400> border<00:01:28.760> so<00:01:29.570> something<00:01:30.020> like

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
smidge of a border so something like

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.180 
smidge of a border so something like
that<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.170> just<00:01:33.440> like<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.620> little<00:01:33.800> bit<00:01:34.010> of<00:01:34.040> an

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
that so just like a little bit of an

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.820 
that so just like a little bit of an
extra<00:01:34.460> moon<00:01:34.700> shape<00:01:35.030> there<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.510> why<00:01:36.350> I'm<00:01:36.530> doing

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
extra moon shape there and why I'm doing

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.500 
extra moon shape there and why I'm doing
that<00:01:36.920> is<00:01:36.980> because<00:01:37.220> this<00:01:37.520> whisper<00:01:37.970> white<00:01:38.180> is

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
that is because this whisper white is

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.430 
that is because this whisper white is
going<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.380> layer<00:01:39.730> right<00:01:40.730> on<00:01:40.940> top<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:42.290> might

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
going to layer right on top you might

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.990 
going to layer right on top you might
want<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.650> little<00:01:42.680> bit<00:01:43.070> more<00:01:43.220> than<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:43.550> but<00:01:43.760> I'm
