00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.920
 hello to all 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.950
 today we make a DIY video 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:27.259
 that is, I show you what I have 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:29.689
 purchased to make the vacuum cleaner for the 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.340
 dust since it gives me lately 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:38.300
 having a lot of trouble 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:41.379
 dust around then this is a 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.460
 beautiful bathroom vacuum cleaner 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.739
 what we can also call 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.969
 whirlwind etc. 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.909
 and then on the advice of some girls 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:58.280
 who have tried I decided to 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:01:01.550
 buying this costs member then 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:09.580
 this venture block was from Mr. 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:12.200
 briko and bricocenter and is the aa model 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.440
 10m paid 31 euros 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:25.370
 so this is the fan 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:28.010
 fan the exhaust fan then 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.720
 found on the market even lower 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:36.050
 I mean the part that goes e 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.510
 protrudes from the table from the floor I have 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.720
 bought this to try then later 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:51.590
 having taken this we took one 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 plug one button and wire are approx 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.330
 two meters there to the electric cable that 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.530
 find all the brie comte then the 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.200
 button used for switching on and off 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.550
 we stick under the attack I speak 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.480
 the plural because I can not do 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.460
 laurel 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:19.880
 under the table the plug serves of the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:26.330
 generally the ciabatta ok so now i 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:29.150
 bags I thought of bags as 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.210
 it is not easy to find them for 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:37.450
 the built-in inspirer and they want us 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:40.070
 long enough that it doesn't suffocate 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:45.710
 the aspirator and succeeds in sucking all 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:51.740
 the dust around I thought of 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:55.910
 use the bags the bags that 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.970
 contain the bags you see this is the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.930
 saga that contained my shoulder strap and is 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.900
 right in the fabric it was possible to 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.940
 see it what we commonly do 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.180
 we have in our bags of ours 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.420
 table viewers or who are there 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.070
 in the collection viewer 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.709
 so these are if you definitely have 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.239
 you have bags at home so that 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:27.230
 contained your bags 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:31.810
 I'll cut it in half and then I'll do it 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:35.300
 apply the elastic on one side if you have 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.570
 mom grandmother aunt sister friend or seamstress 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.600
 you can have her cut 22 bags of 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.580
 qs he bags of these are more than 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.650
 enough I do not put the one I change it and 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.620
 so i'm quick so we have 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.040
 thought to use this fabric 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.930
 because to these micro holes and not fabric 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.030
 fabric because it is made of paper but it is 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.030
 durable you can wash 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.580
 there is a little breathable and therefore not 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.400
 explodes the bag leaves leaves 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.500
 pass some air and at the same time 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.090
 ready and holds between tina and dust 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:18.959
 so we decided to use 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:20.609
 this tomorrow I will go to the ikea precisely 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.419
 change this plan because it is now 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:27.240
 ruined and I thought precisely of 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:30.840
 replace it with this test 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.470
 I'll let you know how it went tomorrow 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.419
 we will make holes and the opposition rho more or 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.550
 less in this position here where I have the 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.400
 camera now so that my hands 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:46.289
 are near equitable in this area 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:49.710
 I will put the hand rest I think I have there 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.360
 give all the indications to do 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.789
 this beautiful actor challenge da 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.990
 you and also hopes to be re 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.490
 help 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:03.599
 if you want to do this too 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:07.550
 this day of bricolage nothing to 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.550
 next video and hello to all
