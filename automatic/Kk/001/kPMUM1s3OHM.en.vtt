but<00:01:20.729> us<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.000> think<00:01:21.030> he's<00:01:21.450> informed<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.080> air

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
but us I think he's informed this air

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.640 
but us I think he's informed this air
week<00:01:22.590> he<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> 60<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.030> 69<00:01:24.930> pace<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.439> quite

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
week he is a 60 to 69 pace is quite

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.550 
week he is a 60 to 69 pace is quite
lacking<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.670> suppose<00:01:27.350> FIFA<00:01:28.350> tree

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
lacking on that but I suppose FIFA tree

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.200 
lacking on that but I suppose FIFA tree
should<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.860> about<00:01:29.009> how<00:01:29.189> fast<00:01:29.520> defender<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
should be about how fast defender is it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030 
should be about how fast defender is it
should<00:01:30.390> mainly<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.750> about<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.470> defending<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
should mainly be about the defending and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.649 
should mainly be about the defending and

kind<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.370> media<00:03:53.819> center<00:03:54.090> attack<00:03:54.239> in<00:03:54.420> mid<00:03:54.600> but<00:03:55.260> I

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
kind of media center attack in mid but I

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.170 
kind of media center attack in mid but I
definitely<00:03:55.560> replace<00:03:55.980> him<00:03:56.190> with<00:03:56.220> her<00:03:56.489> kazakov

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
definitely replace him with her kazakov

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.089 
definitely replace him with her kazakov
who<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.870> much<00:03:58.109> better<00:03:58.139> finisher<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:58.859> also<00:03:59.069> i

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
who is a much better finisher and also i

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.800 
who is a much better finisher and also i
think<00:03:59.250> has<00:03:59.609> caused<00:03:59.880> full<00:04:00.120> star<00:04:00.299> skills<00:04:00.569> also

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
think has caused full star skills also

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.440 
think has caused full star skills also
so<00:04:01.260> i'd<00:04:01.769> recommend<00:04:01.829> just<00:04:02.609> dropping<00:04:03.120> him<00:04:03.269> from

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
so i'd recommend just dropping him from

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.360 
so i'd recommend just dropping him from
the<00:04:03.540> team<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.930> getting<00:04:04.530> yourself<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.920> cask<00:04:05.220> of
