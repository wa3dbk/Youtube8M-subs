 It looks like it can go on 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.900
 the new mixture and milk are coming 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.820
 The whole thing will be as short as possible 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.500
 stirred into a smooth dough and the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 half on a paper backed with baking paper 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.280
 baking tray given so that the dough 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 better distributed without that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.940
 Baking paper you can slip it 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.460
 simply fix with a little dough on the plate 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.570
 The sheet should measure about 30 x 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.570
 40 cm 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.180

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.500
 the light dough layer is distributed and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.500
 works deleted 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.909
 be on these two layers of dough 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.039
 then well drained sour cherries 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.510
 or city models distributed and easy 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.040
 in the dough pressed by this 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.830
 step later, the typical arises 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.380
 wave pattern at 165 degrees upper 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.780
 the whole country will heat up for 30 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.700
 given up to 35 minutes in the oven 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.739
 After that, bake it the whole way 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.030
 off and should cool off well in this 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.920
 time can ever be the custard 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.050
 be prepared for the cream 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.790
 this is the pudding powder with 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.380
 some sugar and some milk 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.940

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.040
 video linked to the infobox 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.880
 the rest of the milk will be with the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.160
 remaining sugar and a little vanilla 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.380
 Sugar is heated until shortly before it 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.310

 given to it 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.010
 so pulling should then be for one 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.010
 stir while stirring 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.580
 then he is in a bowl 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.370
 filled and with fresh foil 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.930
 Covered to avoid skin 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.560
 should the film directly on the pudding 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.560
 rest 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.360
 once the cake is under pudding 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.760
 it's cool with the cream 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.769
 further on , soft butter becomes three to 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.079
 four minutes until she nearly hit 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.760
 looks white gradually comes to the 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.760
 smooth custard 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.390
 this cream then distributed 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.060
 evenly on the cake and set 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.320
 in the refrigirator 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.210
 if you have the same problem as us 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.890
 have and a baking sheet or yours 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.870
 fat pan are not high enough 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.070
 you can easily join the fight 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.070
 increase some aluminum foil 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.330
 In the last step, time will be bitter 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.190
 Coating with coconut fat with warm water 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.690
 was melted that 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.640
 Coconut oil ensures that the 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.200
 chocolate gets a nice shine 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.030
 and can be easily cut 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.100
 pay attention that the chocolate mass only 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.960
 is heated quite easily and not too 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.790
 hot on the cake is given that 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.790
 to cool the chocolate slightly 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.940
 if the cake is about half an hour 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.990
 was in the refrigerator, the chocolate mass 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.990
 be distributed on it 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.229
 with a serrated pastry card can then 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.979
 still a slight wave form indicated 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.449
 become 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.100
 so should the donau if he still has 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.900
 an hour in the fridge and 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.849
 can be served afterwards 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.270
 It lasts about three days when chilled 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.270
