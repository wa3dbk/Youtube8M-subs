00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
I think it really gives me the

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.520 
I think it really gives me the
opportunity<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.940> be<00:00:50.180> creative<00:00:50.210> in<00:00:51.020> everything

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
opportunity to be creative in everything

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.430 
opportunity to be creative in everything
that<00:00:51.680> I<00:00:51.710> do<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.309> think<00:00:52.579> outside<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.030> box

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
that I do and think outside the box

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.040 
that I do and think outside the box
especially<00:00:54.440> with<00:00:54.890> some<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.340> my<00:00:55.370> classes<00:00:55.670> I've

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
especially with some of my classes I've

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.299 
especially with some of my classes I've
learned<00:00:57.050> to<00:00:57.170> take<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.469> role<00:00:57.649> on<00:00:57.829> as<00:00:58.010> a<00:00:58.039> leader

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
learned to take the role on as a leader

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.650 
learned to take the role on as a leader
I<00:01:00.160> think<00:01:01.160> arts<00:01:01.550> are<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.699> vital<00:01:02.329> part<00:01:02.570> of

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
I think arts are a vital part of

I think arts are a vital part of
Education<00:01:03.379> they're<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.680> corner<00:01:04.129> one<00:01:04.399> of<00:01:04.489> the

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
Education they're the corner one of the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.879 
Education they're the corner one of the
cornerstones<00:01:05.149> of<00:01:05.299> education<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.229> think<00:01:06.799> the

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:06.889 
cornerstones of education I think the

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:08.469 
cornerstones of education I think the
arts<00:01:07.100> is<00:01:07.219> important<00:01:07.639> because<00:01:07.759> it<00:01:08.060> gives<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:08.450> a

normal<00:01:49.270> routine<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.840> curriculum<00:01:50.530> but<00:01:51.160> I<00:01:51.190> think

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
normal routine of curriculum but I think

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.490 
normal routine of curriculum but I think
that<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:52.180> great<00:01:52.360> thing<00:01:52.540> about<00:01:52.570> Vic<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.230> that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
that the great thing about Vic is that

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.230 
that the great thing about Vic is that
you<00:01:53.830> can<00:01:54.010> have<00:01:54.520> teachers<00:01:54.940> that<00:01:55.120> are

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
you can have teachers that are

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.990 
you can have teachers that are
incorporating<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.260> arts<00:01:56.590> into<00:01:57.460> it<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:57.730> it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
incorporating the arts into it so it

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.880 
incorporating the arts into it so it
helps<00:01:58.600> students<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.110> get<00:01:59.200> engaged<00:01:59.380> because

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
helps students to get engaged because

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.890 
helps students to get engaged because
they're<00:02:00.400> listening<00:02:00.610> in<00:02:00.970> on<00:02:01.240> stuff<00:02:01.600> that<00:02:01.630> they

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
are passionate about and it helps them

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.900 
are passionate about and it helps them
learn<00:02:05.470> that<00:02:05.650> way<00:02:05.800> because<00:02:05.950> they<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.580> teachers

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910
