00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello to all youtube people 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.940
 whoever is watching the video and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.120
 good today let's see how to make a 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.519
 farm in minecraft then this though 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.630
 you see that it is such a strange map and everything 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.150
 what I have done apart 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.179
 this always happens in all cases 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.630
 It's worth it to start you need what 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.630
 following 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.809
 of course and the wheat is as well as what 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.910
 I have English as wheat and many of 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.570
 these wait 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.720
 many fences berries then I will do 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.070
 a lot of berries and in the way I put how 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.879
 they do so that people do not know what 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.700
 ask and well and of course two 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.480
 animals of any kind is worth 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.190
 I will use pigs for the case 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.100
 we make many berries 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.910
 After all, well, I 'll use, I'm not going to 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.910
 make lifelong valleys 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.090
 so good 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.370
 meanwhile you will also need 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.900
 a fence gate that I am also going to 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.070
 say how a moment is done right away 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.070
 I think this is going to be enough 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.350
 so to see worth is denis the fence and 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.740
 now you want to make a fence door 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.300
 so you are going to do this you put a 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.450
 here another one here here and here 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.640
 and here he gave me two you're wooden you have 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.480
 a fence gate to be able to open 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.220
 lavalle all that 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.220
 then you put yourself right here 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.010
 and do the following build a mini 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.090
 enclosure do not put the door to start 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.090
 and you make a mini enclosure 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.820
 roe 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.520
 you make a mini enclosure 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.899
 well I'm overruning mallet so I 'm going 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.899
 to 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.720
 of the shortest and such 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.720
 right here 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:38.070
 and well that guy is stupid was said no 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:41.210
 do not enter you are silly that salt is worth 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.210
 to have this closed and all that 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.560
 and nothing here we have is a permitted place 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.660
 no and now what everyone asks 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.850
 how do we make pigs enter one 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.390
 of pigs that are not stupid like this 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.319
 from here, you take the wheat and I 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.310
 put in your hand 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.130
 and the pigs or serve you see me follow 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.720
 and we go for a couple of pigs 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.050
 occasions 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.040
 but pig well and we have them follow us 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.980
 to the place we want them to go 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.700
 OK 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.069
 let's continue towards the place worth 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.860
 we let the pigs come in or who 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.670
 want us to be and fast 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.410
 came in and closed and now you say clear 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.200
 but I have two pigs are these two 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.840
 pigs you aisha each a little bit of 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.260
 wheat 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.370
 and good they do their thing that you guard for 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.319
 favor and a mini pig is born 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.010
 and nothing then up to five 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.680
 minutes not the little pig will not grow in a 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.840
 big pig not and when it's a pig 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.940
 big can be played and so on and so 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.940
 is when you want 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.120
 that more than saying that in the case of 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.640
 chickens I recommend more than anything good 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.090
 in case of generating all the animals 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.690
 make a mini pit because like that if they jump 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.990
 what is said 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.060
 so if they jump and they do not escape because 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.490
 he passes me an egg of times he was 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.480
 with a chicken he started to chase me and 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.590
 because it has jumped what is and such 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.590
 that touches the noses a lot 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.030
 I recommend that it be 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.670
 teaches two by two good two of 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.560
 Under no circumstances 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.310
 can very low 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.330
 I'm here if I'm good like that under 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.699
 no concept can 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.360
 can go out is not the important thing not 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:42.729
 come out 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.729
 then we do two depth 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.880
 ok we have this little hole and 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.730
 rest assured that this will be put again 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.220
 green and good as right now does not believe 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.490
 do stairs because I'm lazy 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.490
 I am 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.110
 and so they do not escape in any way 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.700
 and we have a pig farm here 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.480
 in the case of the hen it is the same and 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.280
 careful that in the case of sheep and 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.250
 of the cows that I know like in herbs 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.230
 and then they chew and they turn brown like that 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.910
 go from green to brown worries them and 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.610
 is that you can not die or abel 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.180
 nothing so good 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.669
