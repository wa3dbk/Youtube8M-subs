00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.440
 servus follow christian songs of edith 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.019
 and this time i make a benchmark 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.670
 Comparison between the sony xperia z1 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.100
 we can see that on the left side 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.930
 and the sony xperia set on the right 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.699
 But before we get to the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.230
 benchmarks we look at each other 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.600
 just ran it very short 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.189
 with which specifications the two 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.670
 devices are equipped 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.520
 the new sony xperia z1 is only available 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.579
 has been presented two weeks and will 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.840
 through a qualcomm snapdragon 800 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.510
 This is a quad core 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.660
 processor with a maximum of 2 2 gigahertz 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.780
 Performance 2 GB of RAM are on 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.450
 board and a kind renault 330 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.280
 graphics unit the same we can 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.020
 of course here at the xperia set 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.230
 I go there too under the ice 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.629
 info and here will be a snapdragon s4 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.780
 pro that is one of the predecessors in the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.640
 device with a maximum of 1 5 gigahertz 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.920
 also a quad core 2 gigabytes 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.720
 RAM is on board and the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.960
 a little worse adreno 220 gpu so much 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.700
 now from the presets 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.710
 they all the same I'll go out here 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.380
 the existing applications will still 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.780
 close so that they are really on one 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.530
 same level and also the display 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.060
 Brightness is on the automatic 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.030
 Regulated and I'll just join me 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.100
 the quadrant start because it so 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.079
 one of the most common benchmarks on 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.710
 android devices and i'm trying that 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.770
 of course at the same time too 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.619
 start and go with it 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.420
 and as we see the snapdragon 800 on 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.600
 the left room is properly ran 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.119
 de is already in the third chapter 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.320
 while the s4 pro express at still in the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.350
 second or third now 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.090
 is also and we see quite here 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.130
 clearly the differences where the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.659
 performance differences lie in the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.130
 a period of about one 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.670
 three quarters of a year that's really real 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.129
 Considerable if you think about which 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.100
 meanwhile or become processors 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:17.560
 certainly better called 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.990
 here to use the xperia or 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.120
 the xperia set 1 on the left side 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.410
 is now finished we look 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.820
 give us the result 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.250
 and I hope we like it 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:32.500
 We recognize that there is one 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.460
 worth of 20600 and 89 points that is 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.040
 really unique and phenomenal though 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.530
 this will have nunmal this snapdragon 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.660
 800 while here we have four each 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:50.860
 only in quotes 7170 have yes 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.890
 because you just noticed the old but im 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.770
 you will feel purely subjective 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.330
 that hardly notice or will he or normal 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.840
 user that no longer right now in the 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.210
 next 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.730
 and that's very much at poker benchmark too 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.910
 this is a commercial benchmark 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.160
 and I try both here again 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.880
 devices to start simultaneously 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.580
 I hope that works and I go up 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.210
 test and off you go here, of course 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.400
 zero percent 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.050
 and since this takes a while, I will 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:32.290
 the video at this point something 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:35.230
 perform so you have seen that 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.490
 xperia set 1 has just finished 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.300
 and we'll just have a look 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.800
 result 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.090
 and that should be beyond the 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.010
 There are 30,000 points and each one there 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.140
 34,200 8 points this is a similar one 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.910
 worth like the xperia arc set already 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.110
 has reached around 35 points as one 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:56.530
 can say the xperia set 1 is really 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.260
 here in the best position and there comes 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.510
 also a galaxy s 4 with snapdragon 600 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.550
 and also the 800er version like we already do 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.300
 could not determine on the ifa 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.180
 after 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.750
 That's where the device is here 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.690
 below 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.200
 the xperia had a value of 20,000 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.850
 331 points 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.670
 I hope you can see it there may 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.180
 The election is there with around 20,000 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.830
 that means 14,000 14,000 points 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.569
 less than 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.430
 the xperia set the new device last 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.409
 but not least, I will do that again 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.650
 Run through sunspider benchmark 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:38.560
 this is a browser benchmark 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.620
 about the same 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.639
 How fast internet sites are here 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.620
 the respective devices are loaded 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:55.930
 and how easy is the page of 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:05:07.210
 suns both on there it will be loaded 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:12.909
 good the next spider and you see too 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:14.650
 there the page is loaded and with it 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.750
 that everything will be correct 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.060
 I throw the title out again 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:27.370
 clean the sunspider and try too 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:28.960
 to start at the same time 1 2 and 3 yes and 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.449
 you see that does not quite work for me 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.580
 worked the xperia sat 1 is something 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.979
 later at the start but we also want 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.409
 see here how the two devices 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:40.240
 land and become around 1000 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:43.930
 milliseconds that really will 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.520
 phenomenal the iphone 5 has mine 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.490
 after knowing no value from around 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.310
 the 8 100 milliseconds and lay and 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:55.839
 probably also lies with it 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:58.060
 some time at the top and it in 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.969
 things browser speeds 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.060
 really top notch so 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:08.919
 although I started later that 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:10.539
 xperia sat 1 is ready and we want 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.909
 Just take a look at which 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:17.199
 worth we land now and we land 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:19.629
 all respect at 770 milliseconds in the 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:22.479
 sunspider benchmark this is really one 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:24.279
 absolutely well proven and the 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.650
 I have been on such an android phone so far 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:29.050
 not really seen and that 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.949
 xperia it is now a quarter to three 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.680
 year of 1470 milliseconds say so 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:37.039
 we will 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.590
 probably so slowly 770 versus 1400 that 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.330
 is really a word and outclassed 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.479
 really the xperia set in all 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.669
 But also, yes, of my knowledge 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:49.100
 after the iphone 5 and that put that 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.199
 xperia is currently setting the 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.610
 lock top that was with ours 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:54.380
 benchmark comparison between the sony 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.850
 xperia set 1 on the left and 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.889
 the xperia set on the right side 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.990
 Thank you very much for being back 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.990
 until soon it will be good and bye
