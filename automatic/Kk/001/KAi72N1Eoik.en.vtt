general gist one of the things that

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.229 
general gist one of the things that
we're<00:00:43.890> trying<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:44.309> differently<00:00:44.760> it's

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
we're trying to do differently it's

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.910 
we're trying to do differently it's
really<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.719> target<00:00:46.020> immersion<00:00:46.440> right<00:00:46.739> we

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
really just target immersion right we

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.470 
really just target immersion right we
just<00:00:47.219> want<00:00:47.340> players<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.850> feel<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.300> they're

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
just want players to feel like they're

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840 
just want players to feel like they're
completely<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.530> virtual<00:00:49.710> space<00:00:50.129> no

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
completely in that virtual space no

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.240 
completely in that virtual space no
sacrifices<00:00:51.510> although<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> mean<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:53.039> make<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
sacrifices although I mean we make a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.160 
sacrifices although I mean we make a
bunch<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> sacrifices<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.300> achieve<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.780> but

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
bunch of sacrifices to achieve that but

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.319 
bunch of sacrifices to achieve that but
no<00:00:55.350> sacrifices<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.190> terms<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.550> immersion<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
no sacrifices in terms of immersion and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.270 
no sacrifices in terms of immersion and
so<00:00:57.719> that's<00:00:57.899> our<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.410> only<00:00:58.680> goal<00:00:58.829> which<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so that's our one and only goal which is

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.470 
so that's our one and only goal which is
why<00:00:59.460> we're<00:00:59.640> able<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.030> some<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> things

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
why we're able to do some of the things

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
why we're able to do some of the things
that<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> rifts<00:01:01.620> oh<00:01:01.770> well<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.190> you
