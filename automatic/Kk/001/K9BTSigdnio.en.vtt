00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.950 

okay<00:00:44.040> let's<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.120> do

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
okay let's see what you can do

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.200 
okay let's see what you can do
there's<00:00:46.290> no<00:00:46.440> hatch<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:47.220> which<00:00:47.430> some<00:00:47.940> cars

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
there's no hatch here which some cars

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.150 
there's no hatch here which some cars
have<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> do<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.649> little<00:00:49.920> button

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
have but I do see this little button

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.030 
have but I do see this little button
this<00:00:50.970> looks<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.690> release<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.860> fuel

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
this looks like the release for the fuel

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.310 
this looks like the release for the fuel
door<00:00:53.220> in<00:00:53.370> case<00:00:53.400> your<00:00:53.730> power<00:00:53.970> release<00:00:54.780> goes<00:00:55.110> out

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
door in case your power release goes out

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.520 
door in case your power release goes out
but<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.100> big<00:00:56.610> hex<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:58.230> might

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
but there is a big hex here that might

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.189 
but there is a big hex here that might
take<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.190> light<00:00:59.430> assembly<00:00:59.910> out<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.330> yeah

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
take this light assembly out and yeah

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.600 
take this light assembly out and yeah
there's<00:01:01.470> there's<00:01:01.769> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.129> slot<00:01:02.370> at<00:01:02.580> the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
there's there's a little slot at the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.430 
there's there's a little slot at the
bottom<00:01:02.970> so<00:01:03.089> I<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.570> made<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
bottom so I think it's made for a

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:14.719 
bottom so I think it's made for a
screwdriver<00:01:05.210> such<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
screwdriver such as this so now that

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.370 
screwdriver such as this so now that
we've<00:01:14.970> got<00:01:15.149> this<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.140> this

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
we've got this out you can see this

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.529 
we've got this out you can see this
moves<00:01:16.680> which<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> good<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.610> there's<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.300> little

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
moves which is good and there's a little

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.210 
moves which is good and there's a little
resistance<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.350> end<00:01:19.590> which<00:01:20.009> probably

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
resistance on this end which probably

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.499 
resistance on this end which probably
means<00:01:20.399> there's<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> couple<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.149> snaps

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
means there's a couple of little snaps

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.499 
means there's a couple of little snaps
so<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.320> really<00:01:22.560> careful<00:01:23.509> so

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
so I just have to be really careful so

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.150 
so I just have to be really careful so
we<00:01:25.020> got<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> take<00:01:25.410> it<00:01:25.470> apart<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.860> little<00:01:26.070> bit

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
we got to take it apart a little bit

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.190 
we got to take it apart a little bit
more<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.550> there's<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.789> little<00:01:27.060> clip<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
more and there's a little clip here and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.700 
more and there's a little clip here and
it<00:01:28.259> looks<00:01:28.440> like<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.979> pull<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.369> down<00:01:30.710> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it looks like if I pull this down and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.660 
it looks like if I pull this down and
pull<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.160> down<00:01:33.830> how'd<00:01:34.830> you<00:01:34.920> help<00:01:35.130> James<00:01:35.399> once

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
right now because they could go for

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.109 
right now because they could go for
months<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.619> know<00:01:49.740> that's<00:01:50.009> done<00:01:50.340> it's

months but you know that's done it's
just<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.330> matter<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.599> snapping<00:01:51.959> this<00:01:52.080> back

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
just a matter of snapping this back

just a matter of snapping this back
together<00:01:53.869> get<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.020> snap<00:01:55.640> get<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.789> snap

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:08.199 

we<00:01:59.670> will<00:01:59.820> clips<00:02:00.149> first<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:03.360> then<00:02:03.600> our<00:02:03.750> screw

the biggest thing is getting over the

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.229 
the biggest thing is getting over the
uncertainty<00:02:11.359> of<00:02:11.390> what<00:02:11.900> you've<00:02:12.019> got<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.319> do<00:02:12.469> and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
see if they work sure I'm sure they will

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.670 
see if they work sure I'm sure they will
but<00:02:26.689> you<00:02:27.079> might<00:02:27.230> as<00:02:27.319> well

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:03:28.980 

okay<00:02:33.640> let's<00:02:34.030> see<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.360> other<00:02:34.480> cars

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.720 

your<00:03:29.990> car<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.410> likely<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.070> be<00:03:31.220> different<00:03:31.580> but

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
your car is likely to be different but

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.790 
your car is likely to be different but
it's<00:03:32.090> also<00:03:32.360> likely<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.960> be<00:03:33.140> at<00:03:33.320> least<00:03:33.500> similar

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
it's also likely to be at least similar

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.100 
it's also likely to be at least similar
to<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.280> ones<00:03:34.460> we<00:03:34.610> use<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:35.180> just<00:03:35.720> poke<00:03:35.960> around

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
to the ones we use so just poke around

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.350 
to the ones we use so just poke around
consult<00:03:36.920> your<00:03:37.040> manual<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.610> use<00:03:37.880> some<00:03:38.060> common

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
consult your manual and use some common

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.510 
consult your manual and use some common
sense
