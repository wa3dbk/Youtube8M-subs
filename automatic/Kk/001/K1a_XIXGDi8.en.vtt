00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hi everybody, from the direct tank, that's okay. 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.529
 let's leave it here in today's video 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.719
 an application recommendation that you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.740
 like the weather forecast i recommend 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.620
 for you 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.990
 the app is that the year or welcome 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.609
 depends on the way you prefer to speak 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 This is how it is written that going is 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.260
 sure there are two versions of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.320
 applications in the store one flame only is that the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.130
 iran and other mech ir ir for life that is 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.289
 this from here 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.510
 this version of the producer of the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.910
 application is the other version of nokia 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.660
 I prefer the one that has some options to 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.610
 more 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.239
 so I'm going to fix it on my screen 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.370
 initial great he's already saying here 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.399
 region that I'm tapping on it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.410
 So I'll go where the 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.180
 supplier you can see here 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.890
 taking the time from now forecast're 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.960
 saying that they are 19 degrees 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.340
 it has a thermal sensation of 15 degrees 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.739
 and also giving wind speed 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.410
 humidity at the time of sunset 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.750
 sunrise pretty thing 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.600
 it also has the forecast for today to 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.580
 tomorrow for the sixth the minimum and the maximum 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.830
 he has enough weather option 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.720
 and it has an hourly forecast for today 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.750
 What does he have on the map? 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.010
 from here just tap the map then the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.130
 option that I had never seen before in 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.189
 another app that is that thing 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.780
 the weather forecast with the air masses 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.840
 moving as if they are watching the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.570
 masses of air moving on the map is 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.030
 very interesting is not very useful but it is 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.659
 interesting in-app 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.369
 so you have a lot of choice and the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.409
 more interesting are people who like 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.390
 customize windows phone 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.509
 besides this life style that allows you 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.939
 put it is not so useful in a 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.939

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.270

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.280
