00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.250
 for the estate and welcome to the 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.230
 episode number 4 of Korean makeup 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.629
 in this section of my channel I tell you 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.030
 about some Korean cosmetics how 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.949
 is that they work if they are good or not and 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.410
 where you can get today 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:19.619
 I'll show you 5 Korean cosmetics and 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.039
 I'll tell you if they're good or not starting 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.800
 with tomatoes tomatoes is a mask 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.439
 clarifying that I have seen a lot in 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.570
 internet and well I really had 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.640
 very afraid to use this mask 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.980
 because they actually sell it to you as a 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.260
 clarifying product and I as they are very 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.170
 Blanca was afraid that this would leave me 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.330
 still whiter but I decided to try 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.890
 use it because they also say that you 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.080
 it diminishes what are the little spots 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.900
 caused by granites or by 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.910
 sunburn then I started to 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.700
 use it and actually what it ended 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.330
 happening was that I loved the product 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.550
 what he did was to decrease notoriously 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.720
 from the first application the pores in 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.420
 My skin 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.400
 makes them look more closed and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.770
 then your skin looks like softer 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.230
 like that velvet skin effect and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.640
 it's really quite effective I already noticed 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.190
 the changes from the first application 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.290
 and it left me surprised as I went 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.750
 using what he did instead of that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.160
 my skin would be white ghost more than 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.890
 that was already was that it was decreasing 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.710
 the little spots that I had for granites 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.750
 when I was in my teen age 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.300
 then this is a product extremely 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.310
 good that I believe that anyone 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.680
 you can use it does not matter if you're 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.130
 man or woman if you have oily skin 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.380
 mixed or dry as is a mask and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.530
 only used between one or two 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.570
 times per week as per 15 or 20 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.670
 minutes is actually a product 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.340
 it's not going to damage your skin and vice versa 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.290
 will benefit you is very good to me 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.780
 he liked it a lot and really 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.300
 I recommend another very lightening product 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.300
 popular on the internet and in cosmetics 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.570
 Korean is snow white is difference 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.870
 of the tomato if it is a lightening cream and 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.110
 at the moment you apply it, 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.180
 immediately the difference of your skin 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.580
 you can compare one arm with the other and 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.470
 you will notice that one looks extremely more 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.440
 Of course, the other is truly 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.960
 impressive what it does however to 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.540
 difference of what many believe is that 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.850
 if you are chubby, the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.980
 skin as white as snow white as 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.620
 his name says it is not one what he does 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.570
 this product what this product does 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.030
 is that it will help you recover the 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.100
 your skin's natural tone when you were 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.710
 a baby you were born with a skin tone and 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.690
 as you grew up over the years and 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.330
 with the sun you went back from a 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.190
 skin more brunette then what does 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.500
 this product is that it helps you 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.230
 recover your natural skin tone the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.240
 clear tone that you have then is a 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.860
 product also pretty good and very 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.380
 recommended I have not used this 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.900
 My sister's product has used it 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.660
 true that he has liked him very much and is very 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.150
 well really also if your interest is 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.280
 clear the skin this is one that I can 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.300
 recommend the following that I am going to 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.150
 show is 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.460
 product for the eye area and they are 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.800
 these patches of bread half of the brand 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.080
 tom and molly and these as their name 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.050
 it says it's a little patch like from a 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.270
 little piece of paper that you wear on your eyes when 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.520
 you reveal a lot and what he does is 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.950
 inflammation of the eye and decrease 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.810
 dark circles and this is a perfect product 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.970
 for all of us but maniacs 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.060
 We are seeing as we reveal enough 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.830
 now I liked it a lot and what 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.050
 use when I have very tired eyes 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.970
 because it hurts me more than anything at weekends 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.890
 of the week and really that if I also 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.840
 He liked it a lot and I recommend it 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.610
 very much the two products that I am going to 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.680
 show below is among the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.800
 most popular and best-selling brand 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.050
 atom and molly and these are the network 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.590
 and the green pointed are both products 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.990
 very good and they are two cremitas that I'm going 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.570
 to explain how the bold network works 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.810
 touch is a creampie that is made to 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.630
 red apple and honey base and it's a 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.060
 consistency as very creamy as if 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.120
 you were holding honey and what it does 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.329
 is that it helps you control the excess 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.280
 of fat on your skin and therefore you 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.040
 helps control the brightness on your face 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.889
 It's very good, I liked it a lot 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.080
 and I really noticed the difference in my 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.240
 skin from the first application of 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.940
 products is amazing everything 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.699
 does Korean cosmetics that creampie to 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.770
 I like to complement it with the green 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.650
 botox I feel that they are products that 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.470
 they are complemented because you can 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.260
 alternate one night and the other one 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.229
 night and then let your skin rest and 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.830
 So you help your skin control the 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.350
 excess fat and decrease the 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.169
 impurities because it is more half green what 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.330
 what it does is that it is a creampie 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.780
 exfoliating and that is exfoliating good 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.669
 Exfoliating is when you apply a 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.190
 product and this product helps you 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.440
 eliminate impurities that your skin no longer 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.229
 you need then when you apply 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.360
 Darwin Botox what he does is he is going to 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.720
 eliminate all the impurities that it has 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.700
 your skin and everything you need all the 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.449
 society of the day all the excess of 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.610
 makeup 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.229
 everything will be eliminating obviously 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.300
 you have to wash your face well before 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.830
 apply it and after applying the one 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.830
 you have to wash your little face 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.809
 but I quite liked me and 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.430
 true that they are quite effective 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:35.559
 these two creams but I like 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.749
 use them in a complementary way and 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:39.639
 Well, those are all cosmetics 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:42.189
 Koreans with whom I will speak 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.770
 today my favorite without any doubt 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:47.379
 is the tomato is the best- selling product 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.999
 worldwide of the tony moli brand and 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.409
 I was really afraid of 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.689
 use it but now that I 've 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.999
 started to really use that I can 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:57.339
 say because it's the best selling and what 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:06:00.039
 I can recommend quite and good all 

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:02.469

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:05.289
 online store called core a cagua 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:08.529

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:10.360
 shipments within mexico many girls from 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.029
 Many parts of Latin America have 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.520
 been asking for cosmetics forgive me 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:17.860
 but I could not get the form of 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.469

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.210
