a<00:00:10.870> few<00:00:11.110> days<00:00:11.349> ago<00:00:11.969> where<00:00:12.969> we<00:00:13.150> only<00:00:13.360> have<00:00:13.660> one<00:00:14.049> of

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
a few days ago where we only have one of

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.560 
a few days ago where we only have one of
each<00:00:14.469> tower<00:00:14.769> and<00:00:15.129> a<00:00:15.309> maximum<00:00:15.519> of<00:00:15.910> three<00:00:16.330> this

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
each tower and a maximum of three this

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.200 
each tower and a maximum of three this
time<00:00:16.810> Bradley<00:00:17.770> I<00:00:17.800> cheated<00:00:18.279> on<00:00:18.550> the<00:00:18.730> last<00:00:18.939> one

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
time Bradley I cheated on the last one

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.750 
time Bradley I cheated on the last one
well<00:00:19.570> I<00:00:19.840> didn't<00:00:20.470> know<00:00:20.500> I<00:00:20.619> was<00:00:20.980> cheating<00:00:21.369> but<00:00:21.609> so

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
well I didn't know I was cheating but so

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.230 
well I didn't know I was cheating but so
I<00:00:22.000> didn't<00:00:22.359> do<00:00:22.660> it<00:00:22.779> on<00:00:22.900> purpose<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:24.250> apparently

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
I didn't do it on purpose but apparently

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.529 
I didn't do it on purpose but apparently
i<00:00:25.769> placed<00:00:26.769> to<00:00:27.250> spike<00:00:27.609> factories<00:00:28.119> i<00:00:28.269> wasn't

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
i placed to spike factories i wasn't

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.710 
i placed to spike factories i wasn't
aware<00:00:28.810> of<00:00:28.869> that<00:00:29.679> i<00:00:30.250> could<00:00:30.580> only<00:00:30.609> place<00:00:31.179> one<00:00:31.449> but

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
aware of that i could only place one but

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.600 
aware of that i could only place one but
if<00:00:31.840> you<00:00:31.990> sell<00:00:32.290> one<00:00:32.320> of<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.710> towers<00:00:33.100> then<00:00:33.370> you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
if you sell one of the towers then you

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.410 
if you sell one of the towers then you
can<00:00:33.790> place<00:00:34.030> a<00:00:34.060> second<00:00:34.600> one<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:36.270> kind<00:00:37.270> of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
can place a second one so kind of

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.200 
can place a second one so kind of
cheated<00:00:37.870> and<00:00:38.050> that<00:00:38.170> way<00:00:38.380> and<00:00:38.620> i<00:00:39.430> thought<00:00:40.150> i

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
cheated and that way and i thought i

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.570 
cheated and that way and i thought i
just<00:00:40.540> read<00:00:40.900> the<00:00:41.050> instructions<00:00:41.650> wrong<00:00:41.890> but

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
just read the instructions wrong but

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.880 
just read the instructions wrong but
this<00:00:43.030> time<00:00:43.210> i<00:00:43.450> made<00:00:43.720> sure<00:00:43.750> that<00:00:44.200> i<00:00:44.500> read<00:00:44.740> them

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
this time i made sure that i read them

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.250 
this time i made sure that i read them
correctly<00:00:45.340> and<00:00:45.610> that<00:00:45.640> i<00:00:46.510> know<00:00:46.690> that<00:00:47.110> i<00:00:47.140> can

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
correctly and that i know that i can

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.600 
correctly and that i know that i can
only<00:00:47.530> build<00:00:47.980> one<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:48.460> each<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.950> this<00:00:51.280> is<00:00:51.310> my

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
only build one of each so this is my

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.600 
only build one of each so this is my
second<00:00:52.120> attempt<00:00:52.450> at<00:00:52.570> this<00:00:53.040> which<00:00:54.040> basically

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
second attempt at this which basically

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.740 
second attempt at this which basically
means<00:00:55.080> it's<00:00:56.080> not<00:00:56.410> very<00:00:56.650> hard<00:00:57.270> because<00:00:58.270> some<00:00:58.720> of

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
means it's not very hard because some of

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.180 
means it's not very hard because some of
these<00:00:58.990> puzzles<00:00:59.770> have<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.790> do<00:01:01.380> like<00:01:02.380> 20<00:01:02.920> times

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
these puzzles have to do like 20 times

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.369 
these puzzles have to do like 20 times
before<00:01:03.790> i<00:01:03.820> actually<00:01:04.180> get<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.570> setup<00:01:05.170> right

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
before i actually get the setup right

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.620 
before i actually get the setup right
but<00:01:06.190> here<00:01:06.370> you<00:01:06.520> don't<00:01:06.670> really<00:01:07.090> have<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.450> lot<00:01:07.570> of

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
but here you don't really have a lot of

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.410 
but here you don't really have a lot of
choice<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:09.100> have<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.340> go<00:01:09.610> for<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:09.910> weekend

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
choice you have to go for the a weekend

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.960 
choice you have to go for the a weekend
and<00:01:10.600> that<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.320> much<00:01:11.530> was<00:01:11.770> but<00:01:12.550> certain

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
and that that much was but certain

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.460 
and that that much was but certain
because<00:01:13.240> otherwise<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:13.900> can't<00:01:14.200> really

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
because otherwise you can't really

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.670 
because otherwise you can't really
handle<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:15.040> big<00:01:15.280> waves<00:01:15.550> like<00:01:15.880> with<00:01:16.120> 60<00:01:16.680> known

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
handle the big waves like with 60 known

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.580 
handle the big waves like with 60 known
yeah<00:01:18.430> like<00:01:18.640> wave<00:01:18.880> 63<00:01:19.510> but<00:01:19.720> we're<00:01:19.930> only<00:01:20.290> going

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
yeah like wave 63 but we're only going

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.180 
yeah like wave 63 but we're only going
to<00:01:20.770> wave<00:01:21.250> 60<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.300> that<00:01:23.230> one<00:01:23.440> is<00:01:23.470> not<00:01:23.740> a<00:01:23.770> problem

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
to wave 60 so that one is not a problem

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.940 
to wave 60 so that one is not a problem
I<00:01:24.310> think<00:01:24.520> 55<00:01:25.120> and<00:01:25.360> 53<00:01:25.900> are<00:01:26.080> also<00:01:26.230> waves<00:01:26.650> with<00:01:26.920> a

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
I think 55 and 53 are also waves with a

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.680 
I think 55 and 53 are also waves with a
lot<00:01:27.160> of<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:30.130> come<00:01:30.970> out<00:01:31.090> what<00:01:31.240> articles

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
lot of the come out what articles

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.680 
lot of the come out what articles
ceramic<00:01:32.650> balloons<00:01:32.950> those<00:01:33.880> are<00:01:34.090> really<00:01:34.360> hard

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
ceramic balloons those are really hard

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.800 
ceramic balloons those are really hard
to<00:01:34.810> stop<00:01:35.140> without<00:01:35.320> an<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.980> we<00:01:36.159> cannon<00:01:36.580> so<00:01:37.390> that's

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
to stop without an a we cannon so that's

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.810 
to stop without an a we cannon so that's
why<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.020> go<00:01:38.260> for<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:38.620> then<00:01:39.070> of<00:01:39.370> course<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.790> a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
why I go for that then of course the a

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.780 
why I go for that then of course the a
wee<00:01:40.150> wizards<00:01:40.840> because<00:01:41.650> that<00:01:41.830> one<00:01:42.190> does<00:01:42.430> way

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
wee wizards because that one does way

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.880 
wee wizards because that one does way
more<00:01:42.820> damage<00:01:43.540> than<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:44.170> one<00:01:44.320> with<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.590> wind

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
more damage than the one with the wind

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.570 
more damage than the one with the wind
upgrades<00:01:45.610> on<00:01:45.970> path<00:01:46.210> one<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:47.229> then<00:01:47.650> yeah<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.100> am

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
upgrades on path one and then yeah I am

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.090 
upgrades on path one and then yeah I am
kind<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.300> doubt<00:01:49.510> it<00:01:49.750> for<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.020> last<00:01:50.229> hour<00:01:50.470> first

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
kind of doubt it for the last hour first

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.670 
kind of doubt it for the last hour first
time<00:01:51.400> I<00:01:51.580> took<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:54.030> attack<00:01:55.080> shooter<00:01:56.080> but<00:01:56.380> that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
time I took the attack shooter but that

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.160 
time I took the attack shooter but that
one<00:01:56.860> doesn't<00:01:57.070> do<00:01:57.549> enough<00:01:57.700> damage<00:01:57.880> not<00:01:58.750> nearly

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
one doesn't do enough damage not nearly

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.469 
one doesn't do enough damage not nearly
so<00:01:59.770> this<00:01:59.950> time<00:02:00.130> i<00:02:00.310> took<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.670> boomerang<00:02:01.180> and

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
so this time i took the boomerang and

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.170 
so this time i took the boomerang and
you<00:02:02.260> can<00:02:02.440> choose<00:02:02.680> between<00:02:02.710> past<00:02:03.610> one<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:03.880> path

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
you can choose between past one and path

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.430 
you can choose between past one and path
to<00:02:04.510> and<00:02:04.750> path<00:02:05.620> to<00:02:05.920> does<00:02:06.420> well<00:02:07.420> not<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.019> whole<00:02:08.140> lot

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
to and path to does well not a whole lot

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.640 
to and path to does well not a whole lot
of<00:02:08.500> damage<00:02:08.770> unless<00:02:09.130> you<00:02:09.429> activate<00:02:10.000> the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
of damage unless you activate the

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.590 
of damage unless you activate the
special<00:02:11.650> ability<00:02:12.300> but

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
special ability but

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.970 
special ability but
the<00:02:13.690> special<00:02:13.930> ability<00:02:14.440> can<00:02:14.650> only<00:02:14.770> be

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
the special ability can only be

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.430 
the special ability can only be
activated<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.670> once<00:02:15.940> every<00:02:16.330> wave<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.840> that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
activated like once every wave and that

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.160 
activated like once every wave and that
is<00:02:17.620> not<00:02:17.830> good<00:02:17.890> enough<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.580> handle<00:02:19.300> most<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:20.020> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
is not good enough to handle most of the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.200 
is not good enough to handle most of the
balloons<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:21.130> one<00:02:21.340> does<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.580> lot<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:22.000> wee

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
balloons this one does a lot of a wee

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.140 
balloons this one does a lot of a wee
damage<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.890> shoots<00:02:24.250> pretty<00:02:24.550> quickly<00:02:24.820> so

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
damage and it shoots pretty quickly so

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.320 
damage and it shoots pretty quickly so
we<00:02:25.930> should<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.380> okay<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:27.340> this<00:02:27.670> one<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:30.300> yet<00:02:31.300> a

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
we should be okay so this one the yet a

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.020 
we should be okay so this one the yet a
final<00:02:31.720> upgrade<00:02:32.050> on<00:02:32.290> my<00:02:32.590> wizard<00:02:32.860> tower<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.820> it

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
final upgrade on my wizard tower is it

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.030 
final upgrade on my wizard tower is it
going<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.330> wipe<00:02:34.510> out<00:02:34.690> all<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.440> mo<00:02:35.830> apps

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
going to wipe out all of the mo apps

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.610 
going to wipe out all of the mo apps
since<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.700> stays<00:02:36.970> alive<00:02:37.300> for<00:02:37.630> 20<00:02:38.020> seconds<00:02:38.470> if

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
since it stays alive for 20 seconds if

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.070 
since it stays alive for 20 seconds if
you<00:02:39.280> can<00:02:39.430> trigger<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.820> right<00:02:40.420> when<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:40.930> on

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
you can trigger it right when it's on

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.960 
you can trigger it right when it's on
the<00:02:41.200> right<00:02:41.470> side<00:02:41.740> of<00:02:41.770> your<00:02:42.160> screen<00:02:42.340> yeah<00:02:42.760> one

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
the right side of your screen yeah one

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.280 
the right side of your screen yeah one
of<00:02:43.000> my<00:02:43.120> mouse<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.360> right<00:02:43.780> now<00:02:44.340> then<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.760> can

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
of my mouse is right now then you can

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.640 
of my mouse is right now then you can
actually<00:02:47.290> get<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:48.040> best<00:02:49.320> yeah<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.500> best

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
killing going on ammo up that is right

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.030 
killing going on ammo up that is right
there<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:55.140> yeah<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.200> have<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.560> take<00:02:56.740> care<00:02:56.950> of

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
there so yeah you have to take care of

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.730 
there so yeah you have to take care of
that<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.640> of<00:02:57.910> course<00:02:57.970> yeah<00:02:58.630> in<00:02:58.840> some<00:02:59.020> ways<00:02:59.080> it

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
that and of course yeah in some ways it

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.650 
that and of course yeah in some ways it
won't<00:03:00.130> be<00:03:00.280> available<00:03:00.580> until<00:03:00.850> later<00:03:01.330> in<00:03:01.480> the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
won't be available until later in the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.160 
won't be available until later in the
round<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:03.030> yeah<00:03:04.030> you're<00:03:04.210> one<00:03:04.360> mo<00:03:04.570> up<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:04.960> not<00:03:05.140> a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
round and yeah you're one mo up is not a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.630 
round and yeah you're one mo up is not a
problem<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.770> shouldn't<00:03:06.040> have<00:03:06.130> triggered<00:03:06.490> it

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
problem I shouldn't have triggered it

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.700 
problem I shouldn't have triggered it
here<00:03:06.940> but<00:03:07.150> yeah<00:03:07.690> it's<00:03:07.840> going<00:03:08.020> to<00:03:08.170> damage<00:03:08.350> the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
here but yeah it's going to damage the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.240 
here but yeah it's going to damage the
second<00:03:09.040> mo<00:03:09.130> up<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.490> little<00:03:09.790> bit<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.980> can

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
second mo up a little bit so you can

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.060 
second mo up a little bit so you can
handle<00:03:12.760> if<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.150> upgrade<00:03:14.050> everything<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.770> full

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
handle if you upgrade everything to full

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.790 
handle if you upgrade everything to full
you<00:03:15.580> can<00:03:15.610> pretty<00:03:16.150> much<00:03:16.240> handle<00:03:16.800> everything

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
you can pretty much handle everything

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.820 
you can pretty much handle everything
you<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.880> should<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.120> no<00:03:19.480> problem<00:03:19.830> except

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
you you should have no problem except

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.310 
you you should have no problem except
the<00:03:21.130> double<00:03:21.460> mo<00:03:21.610> ops<00:03:21.820> like<00:03:22.360> this<00:03:22.600> one<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.080> this

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
the double mo ops like this one so this

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.370 
the double mo ops like this one so this
is<00:03:23.560> where<00:03:23.740> you<00:03:23.890> need<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.930> burden<00:03:25.930> as<00:03:26.110> you<00:03:26.230> can

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
is where you need the burden as you can

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.830 
is where you need the burden as you can
see<00:03:26.620> if<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.370> trigger<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.760> when<00:03:28.240> it's<00:03:28.420> on<00:03:28.630> the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
see if you trigger it when it's on the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.640 
see if you trigger it when it's on the
right<00:03:29.530> side<00:03:29.830> of<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.240> towers<00:03:31.240> so<00:03:32.050> just<00:03:32.380> in<00:03:32.530> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
right side of the towers so just in the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.820 
right side of the towers so just in the
bend<00:03:32.890> there<00:03:33.130> then<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.090> get<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.450> best

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
bend there then you get the best

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.980 
bend there then you get the best
reaction<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.550> bird<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.060> there<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:37.960> can

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
reaction of the bird and there you can

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.870 
reaction of the bird and there you can
see<00:03:38.110> taking<00:03:38.770> out<00:03:38.860> three<00:03:39.100> mo<00:03:39.250> ops<00:03:39.460> this<00:03:39.670> time

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
see taking out three mo ops this time

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.010 
see taking out three mo ops this time
and<00:03:41.790> yeah<00:03:42.790> now<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.180> course<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.690> won't<00:03:43.840> be

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
and yeah now of course it won't be

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.410 
and yeah now of course it won't be
available<00:03:44.320> so<00:03:44.830> this<00:03:45.550> round<00:03:45.820> I<00:03:46.000> will<00:03:46.210> have<00:03:46.390> a

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
available so this round I will have a

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.690 
available so this round I will have a
little<00:03:46.630> bit<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:47.020> problem<00:03:47.350> losing<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.520> few

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
little bit of a problem losing a few

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.640 
little bit of a problem losing a few
lives<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.420> can<00:03:49.690> probably<00:03:50.110> play<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.470> little

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
lives you can probably play that little

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.430 
lives you can probably play that little
bit<00:03:50.890> differently<00:03:51.280> by<00:03:52.060> triggering<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.750> lit

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
bit differently by triggering it lit

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.230 
bit differently by triggering it lit
birth<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.280> little<00:03:54.490> bit<00:03:54.580> earlier<00:03:54.760> in<00:03:55.150> the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
birth a little bit earlier in the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.560 
birth a little bit earlier in the
previous<00:03:55.570> rounds<00:03:56.050> and<00:03:56.170> then<00:03:56.290> blah<00:03:56.620> blah<00:03:56.860> but

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
previous rounds and then blah blah but

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.130 
previous rounds and then blah blah but
anyway<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.810> single<00:03:59.380> moves<00:03:59.710> easy<00:04:00.070> enough<00:04:00.340> and

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
anyway the single moves easy enough and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.290 
anyway the single moves easy enough and
yeah<00:04:02.140> we're<00:04:02.350> just<00:04:02.560> going<00:04:02.860> on<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.430> big<00:04:04.060> wave

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
yeah we're just going on to a big wave

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.140 
yeah we're just going on to a big wave
here<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:07.020> yeah<00:04:08.070> double<00:04:09.070> mo<00:04:09.220> up<00:04:09.400> again<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:10.060> I'm

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
moment and then it's going to take out

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.820 
moment and then it's going to take out
all<00:04:14.950> four<00:04:15.280> mo<00:04:15.960> OPS+<00:04:16.960> damage<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.590> one<00:04:17.799> a

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
all four mo OPS+ damage this one a

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.410 
all four mo OPS+ damage this one a
little<00:04:18.040> bit<00:04:18.310> but<00:04:18.640> this<00:04:18.790> one<00:04:19.000> shouldn't<00:04:19.270> be<00:04:19.390> a

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
little bit but this one shouldn't be a

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.980 
little bit but this one shouldn't be a
problem<00:04:20.130> these<00:04:21.130> are<00:04:21.430> all<00:04:21.460> well<00:04:22.390> not<00:04:22.630> grouped

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
problem these are all well not grouped

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.840 
problem these are all well not grouped
up<00:04:23.200> so<00:04:23.560> as<00:04:23.830> long<00:04:23.979> as<00:04:24.040> they're<00:04:24.250> not<00:04:24.280> grouped<00:04:24.669> up

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
up so as long as they're not grouped up

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.030 
up so as long as they're not grouped up
you<00:04:25.150> should<00:04:25.210> be<00:04:25.540> okay<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.620> course<00:04:26.860> you

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
want to use the bird whenever it's

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.110 
want to use the bird whenever it's
available<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:29.130> well<00:04:30.130> there<00:04:30.340> r<00:04:30.460> mo<00:04:30.670> ops<00:04:30.850> on<00:04:31.060> the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
available and well there r mo ops on the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.840 
available and well there r mo ops on the
screen<00:04:31.920> and<00:04:32.920> then<00:04:33.040> we're<00:04:33.220> going<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.460> get<00:04:33.700> a

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
screen and then we're going to get a

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.480 
screen and then we're going to get a
relaxed<00:04:34.330> round<00:04:34.540> here<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:36.010> is<00:04:36.100> normally

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
relaxed round here this is normally

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.670 
relaxed round here this is normally
quite<00:04:36.790> a<00:04:36.820> difficult<00:04:37.150> round<00:04:37.600> but<00:04:37.930> in<00:04:38.350> this<00:04:38.470> case

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
quite a difficult round but in this case

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.760 
quite a difficult round but in this case
not<00:04:38.950> so<00:04:39.160> much<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.730> i<00:04:40.210> will<00:04:40.330> get<00:04:40.450> level<00:04:40.780> 60<00:04:41.290> and

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
not so much and i will get level 60 and

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.310 
not so much and i will get level 60 and
of<00:04:42.340> course<00:04:42.610> doing<00:04:43.240> exactly<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.900> same<00:04:43.930> thing

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
of course doing exactly the same thing

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.990 
of course doing exactly the same thing
with<00:04:44.560> my<00:04:44.740> birth<00:04:45.010> here<00:04:45.340> but<00:04:45.550> that's<00:04:45.730> wrong

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
with my birth here but that's wrong

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.320 
with my birth here but that's wrong
because<00:04:46.390> this<00:04:47.380> balloon<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:48.070> slower<00:04:48.550> so<00:04:49.300> i

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
because this balloon is slower so i

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.360 
because this balloon is slower so i
should<00:04:49.540> have<00:04:49.660> waited<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:50.110> little<00:04:50.260> bit<00:04:50.500> more<00:04:50.680> but

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
should have waited a little bit more but

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.630 
should have waited a little bit more but
i'm<00:04:51.550> going<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:51.910> get<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.540> more<00:04:53.200> apps<00:04:53.350> anyway<00:04:53.770> so

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
i'm going to get the more apps anyway so

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.340 
i'm going to get the more apps anyway so
either<00:04:54.700> i<00:04:54.880> hope<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.270> enjoyed<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:56.020> will<00:04:56.050> see
