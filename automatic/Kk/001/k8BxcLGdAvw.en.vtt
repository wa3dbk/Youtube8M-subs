00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
to show how I've been getting some

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.950

sounds<00:00:10.210> in<00:00:10.389> our<00:00:10.540> Twitty

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
sounds in our Twitty

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.190 
sounds in our Twitty
and<00:00:11.170> I<00:00:12.130> couldn't<00:00:12.700> quite<00:00:12.850> go<00:00:13.570> to<00:00:13.630> the<00:00:13.780> bluetooth

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.529 
and I couldn't quite go to the bluetooth
handset<00:00:14.650> so<00:00:15.160> this<00:00:16.090> was<00:00:16.390> a<00:00:16.420> very<00:00:17.410> very<00:00:17.560> good

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
holder which actually serves as a very

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.990 
holder which actually serves as a very
good<00:01:46.440> absorber<00:01:47.440> of<00:01:47.590> any<00:01:47.740> vibrations<00:01:48.580> so<00:01:48.850> that

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
good absorber of any vibrations so that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.220 
good absorber of any vibrations so that
when<00:01:49.120> it<00:01:49.240> sits<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.630> glove<00:01:49.810> box

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.080 
speaker itself I could have set it
louder<00:02:53.290> but<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:53.739> found<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.849> video

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
louder but I found the video

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.610 
louder but I found the video
experimentation<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.959> was<00:02:56.110> just<00:02:56.349> fight

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
experimentation that was just fight

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.009 
experimentation that was just fight
volume<00:02:57.099> so<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.060> when<00:02:58.209> it's<00:02:58.359> on<00:02:58.480> maximum<00:02:58.870> on

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
volume so that when it's on maximum on

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.680 
volume so that when it's on maximum on
the<00:02:59.230> iPhone<00:02:59.859> that<00:03:00.069> I've<00:03:00.220> got<00:03:00.519> that's<00:03:01.480> loud

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
the iPhone that I've got that's loud

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.449 
the iPhone that I've got that's loud
enough<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.959> be<00:03:01.989> heard<00:03:02.079> over<00:03:02.470> any<00:03:02.739> extraneous

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
enough to be heard over any extraneous

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.869 
enough to be heard over any extraneous
noise<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.299> car<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:06.129> electric<00:03:06.519> motor<00:03:06.730> and

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
noise of the car the electric motor and

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.780 
noise of the car the electric motor and
everything<00:03:07.000> else<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:09.069> don't<00:03:09.220> want<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.489> draw

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
everything else you don't want to draw

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.430 
everything else you don't want to draw
too<00:03:10.000> much<00:03:10.090> attention<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.720> yourself<00:03:10.900> as<00:03:11.290> you're

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
too much attention to yourself as you're

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.710 
too much attention to yourself as you're
driving<00:03:11.650> on<00:03:11.920> either<00:03:12.130> so<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:13.120> think<00:03:13.299> so<00:03:13.569> works

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
driving on either so I think so works

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.989 
driving on either so I think so works
pretty<00:03:13.870> well
