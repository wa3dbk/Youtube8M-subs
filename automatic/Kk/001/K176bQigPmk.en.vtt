you<00:03:41.510> want<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.840> be<00:03:41.930> sure<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.560> form<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.310> not<00:03:44.000> only

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
you want to be sure to form it not only

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.349 
you want to be sure to form it not only
directly<00:03:44.660> on<00:03:44.870> top<00:03:45.230> like<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:45.700> but<00:03:46.700> also<00:03:46.940> on<00:03:47.209> the

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
directly on top like so but also on the

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.819 
directly on top like so but also on the
sides<00:03:47.570> a<00:03:47.720> little<00:03:47.810> bit<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.260> really<00:03:48.590> give<00:03:48.799> it

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
sides a little bit to really give it

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.430 
sides a little bit to really give it
that<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:50.030> know<00:03:50.120> look<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.720> it's<00:03:50.900> kind<00:03:51.320> of

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
that you know look that it's kind of

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.520 
that you know look that it's kind of
almost<00:03:52.130> climbing<00:03:53.060> over<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.600> rice<00:03:54.140> if<00:03:54.350> you

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
almost climbing over the rice if you

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.300 
almost climbing over the rice if you
will<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:56.230> once<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.440> get<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.040> shape

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
will and once you get it to the shape

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.309 
will and once you get it to the shape
and<00:03:58.549> form<00:03:58.609> that<00:03:59.090> you<00:03:59.180> like<00:03:59.420> you<00:03:59.660> might<00:03:59.840> have<00:03:59.870> to

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
and form that you like you might have to

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.890 
and form that you like you might have to
rip<00:04:00.890> it<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.099> couple<00:04:01.310> times<00:04:01.579> to<00:04:01.879> make<00:04:02.030> sure<00:04:02.269> you

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
rip it a couple times to make sure you

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.420 
rip it a couple times to make sure you
want<00:04:03.079> to<00:04:03.170> grip<00:04:03.319> firmly<00:04:03.590> but<00:04:04.040> you<00:04:04.129> don't<00:04:04.310> want

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
want to grip firmly but you don't want

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.890 
want to grip firmly but you don't want
to<00:04:04.519> smash<00:04:04.730> it<00:04:04.969> all<00:04:05.030> together<00:04:05.239> that's<00:04:05.629> really

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
to smash it all together that's really

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.360 
to smash it all together that's really
not<00:04:06.019> where<00:04:06.170> you're<00:04:06.290> going<00:04:06.319> before<00:04:06.769> but<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.099> do

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
not where you're going before but you do

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.819 
not where you're going before but you do
want<00:04:07.579> to<00:04:07.640> make<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.849> so<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.209> comes<00:04:08.420> together

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
want to make it so it comes together

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.940 
want to make it so it comes together
into<00:04:09.829> one<00:04:10.129> piece<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.810> as<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:12.319> see<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:12.799> know

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
into one piece and as you see you know

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.319 
into one piece and as you see you know
you<00:04:13.040> might<00:04:13.310> have<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.519> play<00:04:13.670> with<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.150> little

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
you might have to play with it a little

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.569 
you might have to play with it a little
bit<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.750> really<00:04:15.049> get<00:04:15.200> it<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.409> that<00:04:15.530> point<00:04:15.590> but<00:04:16.549> a

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
bit to really get it to that point but a

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.249 
bit to really get it to that point but a
little<00:04:16.940> bit<00:04:17.150> goes<00:04:17.329> a<00:04:17.359> long<00:04:17.509> way<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:17.930> it's

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259 
little bit goes a long way so it's

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.080 
little bit goes a long way so it's
better<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.620> be<00:04:18.889> gentler<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:19.519> take<00:04:19.820> a<00:04:19.850> little

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
better to be gentler and take a little

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.080 
better to be gentler and take a little
bit<00:04:20.209> longer<00:04:20.449> than<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.889> really<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:23.060> know

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
bit longer than it is to really you know

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.529 
bit longer than it is to really you know
mash<00:04:23.600> it<00:04:23.840> together<00:04:24.169> in<00:04:24.350> one<00:04:24.560> shot<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:26.030> now

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
mash it together in one shot so now

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.909 
mash it together in one shot so now
we're<00:04:26.720> going<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:26.870> show<00:04:27.110> you<00:04:27.169> how<00:04:27.350> to<00:04:27.410> make<00:04:27.650> one

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
we're going to show you how to make one

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.400 
we're going to show you how to make one
more<00:04:28.100> piece<00:04:28.370> here<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:28.850> you'll<00:04:29.810> see<00:04:30.080> once

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
more piece here and you'll see once

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.040 
more piece here and you'll see once
again<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.800> water<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.610> rice<00:04:32.270> vinegar<00:04:32.300> mix<00:04:32.870> on

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
again the water and rice vinegar mix on

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.409 
again the water and rice vinegar mix on
the<00:04:33.139> hands<00:04:33.500> keep<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.949> rice<00:04:34.130> from<00:04:34.280> sticking

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
the hands keep the rice from sticking

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.640 
the hands keep the rice from sticking
that's<00:04:35.419> really<00:04:35.780> important<00:04:36.259> if<00:04:36.380> you<00:04:36.500> don't

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
that's really important if you don't

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.650 
that's really important if you don't
keep<00:04:36.800> doing<00:04:37.130> that<00:04:37.389> you're<00:04:38.389> going<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.570> have

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
keep doing that you're going to have

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.050 
keep doing that you're going to have
your<00:04:38.780> hands<00:04:39.020> coated<00:04:39.500> in<00:04:39.620> rice<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.759> it's

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
your hands coated in rice and it it's

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.080 
your hands coated in rice and it it's
really<00:04:41.599> hard<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:41.930> clean<00:04:42.169> up<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:43.490> there<00:04:43.910> we<00:04:44.060> go

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
really hard to clean up so there we go

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.999 
really hard to clean up so there we go
our<00:04:44.449> model<00:04:45.139> is<00:04:45.229> going<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.470> be<00:04:45.560> kind<00:04:45.710> enough<00:04:45.860> to

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
our model is going to be kind enough to

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.890 
our model is going to be kind enough to
show<00:04:46.160> us<00:04:46.340> one<00:04:46.669> at<00:04:46.849> more<00:04:47.030> full<00:04:47.360> speed<00:04:47.690> if<00:04:47.870> you

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
show us one at more full speed if you

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.499 
show us one at more full speed if you
will<00:04:48.169> and<00:04:48.789> she<00:04:49.789> has<00:04:49.910> really<00:04:50.210> got<00:04:50.389> the

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
will and she has really got the

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.390 
will and she has really got the
technique<00:04:50.900> down<00:04:51.139> she's<00:04:51.530> been<00:04:51.680> doing<00:04:51.830> this<00:04:52.130> for

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
technique down she's been doing this for

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.499 
technique down she's been doing this for
a<00:04:52.430> long<00:04:52.940> time<00:04:53.599> and<00:04:54.340> once<00:04:55.340> again<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.940> crimping

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
a long time and once again that crimping

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.230 
a long time and once again that crimping
motion<00:04:56.960> to<00:04:57.229> get<00:04:57.440> it<00:04:57.590> together<00:04:57.910> flip<00:04:58.910> it<00:04:59.090> over

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
motion to get it together flip it over

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.659 
motion to get it together flip it over
put<00:04:59.590> those<00:05:00.590> little<00:05:00.919> hollow<00:05:01.160> points

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
put those little hollow points

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.110 
put those little hollow points
underneath<00:05:02.500> grab<00:05:03.500> another<00:05:03.860> slice<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.550> you'll

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
underneath grab another slice and you'll

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.159 
underneath grab another slice and you'll
notice<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:05.479> we<00:05:05.599> do<00:05:05.690> have<00:05:05.810> a<00:05:05.870> little<00:05:06.050> bit

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
notice that we do have a little bit

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.689 
notice that we do have a little bit
thicker<00:05:06.380> slices<00:05:06.770> there<00:05:07.099> that's<00:05:07.340> because<00:05:07.550> we

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
thicker slices there that's because we

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.899 
thicker slices there that's because we
do<00:05:07.849> like<00:05:08.060> this<00:05:08.300> a<00:05:08.599> sashimi<00:05:08.810> type<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:10.430> i<00:05:10.580> really
