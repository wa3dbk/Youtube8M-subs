00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
command blocks and yeah you don't you

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.840 
command blocks and yeah you don't you
can't<00:00:30.119> move<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.869> don't<00:00:31.080> fall<00:00:31.489> but<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.520> can

maps and I'm going to show you how it's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.040

redstone and in this command block
you<00:00:59.129> only<00:00:59.280> need<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.520> TP<00:01:00.090> command<00:01:01.340> teleport

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
you only need one TP command teleport

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.190 
you only need one TP command teleport
all<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:04.010> um<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:06.590> criteria<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.710> want<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.220> my

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
my example I'll make it that everyone

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.210 
my example I'll make it that everyone
with<00:01:14.010> game-mode<00:01:14.610> 0<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:15.150> survival<00:01:15.630> mode<00:01:15.659> is

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
with game-mode 0 in survival mode is

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.800 
with game-mode 0 in survival mode is
held<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.400> place<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.330> need<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.600> teleport

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
held in place and you need to teleport

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:29.899 
held in place and you need to teleport
them<00:01:19.350> relative<00:01:20.210> 0<00:01:21.770> 0<00:01:22.850> 0<00:01:25.460> well<00:01:28.040> it's<00:01:29.040> not<00:01:29.549> only

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
them relative 0 0 0 well it's not only

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.670 
them relative 0 0 0 well it's not only
that<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.329> need<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.900> fast<00:01:31.439> clock<00:01:32.630> like<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.960> put

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that you need a fast clock like this put

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.569 
that you need a fast clock like this put
a<00:01:34.710> comparator<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.710> subtract<00:01:37.710> them<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
a comparator and subtract them out and

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:47.139 
a comparator and subtract them out and
you<00:01:41.579> could<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.649> with<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.250> one<00:01:45.229> posing<00:01:46.229> a

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
you could do it with this one posing a

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:56.109 
you could do it with this one posing a
repeater<00:01:48.149> alone<00:01:49.369> but<00:01:52.220> if<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.520> go<00:01:54.180> into<00:01:54.360> Q<00:01:54.869> into

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
repeater alone but if I go into Q into

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.450 
repeater alone but if I go into Q into
game-mode<00:01:57.119> 0<00:01:59.329> you'll<00:02:00.329> see<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.130> can<00:02:02.130> still

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
game-mode 0 you'll see I can still

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.119 
game-mode 0 you'll see I can still
slowly<00:02:03.290> move<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.299> this<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.479> not<00:02:06.659> good<00:02:06.869> enough

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
slowly move so this is not good enough

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:11.340 
slowly move so this is not good enough
so<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.399> need<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.819> little<00:02:09.300> bit<00:02:09.420> more

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
so we need a little bit more

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.890 
so we need a little bit more
give<00:02:12.350> it<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.530> second<00:02:13.070> pose<00:02:13.400> just<00:02:14.300> one<00:02:14.660> tick

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
give it a second pose just one tick

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.940 
give it a second pose just one tick
later<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:18.070> will<00:02:19.070> make<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.490> freeze

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
later and this will make you freeze

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.240 
later and this will make you freeze
completely<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.910> can't<00:02:23.270> move<00:02:23.600> at<00:02:23.870> all<00:02:24.250> because

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
completely you can't move at all because

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.270 
completely you can't move at all because
every<00:02:25.970> redstone<00:02:26.630> tick<00:02:26.930> every<00:02:27.380> tenth<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
every redstone tick every tenth of a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.080 
every redstone tick every tenth of a
second<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.090> get<00:02:29.360> teleported<00:02:30.580> back<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.880> where

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
second you get teleported back to where

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.630 
second you get teleported back to where
you<00:02:32.270> were<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.840> previous<00:02:33.440> two<00:02:33.980> redstone<00:02:34.160> tick

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
you were the previous two redstone tick

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.180 
you were the previous two redstone tick
so<00:02:36.220> neat<00:02:37.220> little<00:02:37.840> trick<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.260> keep<00:02:39.740> people<00:02:40.130> in

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
so neat little trick to keep people in

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.030 
so neat little trick to keep people in
place<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.490> make<00:02:40.910> jail<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:42.100> maybe<00:02:43.900> have<00:02:44.900> people

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
place to make jail to maybe have people

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.210 
place to make jail to maybe have people
freeze<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.220> place<00:02:46.250> before<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.570> PvP<00:02:48.380> game<00:02:48.650> starts

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
freeze in place before a PvP game starts

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.870 
freeze in place before a PvP game starts
and<00:02:49.490> to<00:02:50.120> have<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.510> nuts<00:02:50.930> run<00:02:51.590> around<00:02:51.880> destroy

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
and to have the nuts run around destroy

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.660 
and to have the nuts run around destroy
stuff<00:02:53.270> click<00:02:53.750> things<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.440> explore<00:02:55.430> things

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
stuff click things and explore things

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.430 
stuff click things and explore things
before<00:02:56.180> they're<00:02:56.330> allowed<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:57.730> just<00:02:59.440> teleport

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
before they're allowed to just teleport

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.660 
before they're allowed to just teleport
them<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.890> place<00:03:02.590> take<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.650> selector<00:03:04.250> like<00:03:04.490> you

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
them in place take a selector like you
