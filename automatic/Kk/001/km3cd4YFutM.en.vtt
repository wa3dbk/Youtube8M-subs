00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.560
 kind a very personal advice that in its 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.450
 Mr. Roberto gave it to me 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.730
 mitzuko when he studied miranda for a 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.410
 dream when I had some mistake I did it 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.110
 very obvious until I got angry 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.540
 bothered making gestures on the track and the 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.700
 sir once told me in dressing rooms if 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.010
 you do not make gestures sometimes the judges do not 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.110
 we perceive it then and 2/3 of the 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.440
 milestones that you had and I saw your face as of 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.050
 frustration then try not to do it 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.110
 and maybe maybe we 're going to give 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.070
 account then for the next smile and 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.070

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.770
