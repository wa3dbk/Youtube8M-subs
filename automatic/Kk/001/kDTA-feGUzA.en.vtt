00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.890 
have the texture of what you'll teleport
you<00:02:58.100> outside<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.850> air<00:02:59.030> which<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.690> housed

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
you outside of the air which is housed

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.630 
you outside of the air which is housed
now<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.350> trick<00:03:00.590> here<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.920> use<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.130> hedges

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
now the trick here is to use the hedges

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.730 
now the trick here is to use the hedges
so<00:03:01.790> she<00:03:01.880> can't<00:03:02.150> detect<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:03.500> literally

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
so she can't detect you so literally

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.620 
so she can't detect you so literally
hide<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.490> middle<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:04.820> them<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.180> then

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
hide in the middle of them and then

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.570 
hide in the middle of them and then
we're<00:03:05.870> only<00:03:06.290> movement<00:03:06.710> her<00:03:07.010> back<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.370> turned

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
we're only movement her back is turned

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.250 
we're only movement her back is turned
to<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.120> basically<00:03:08.450> Donna<00:03:08.630> be<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.050> line<00:03:09.230> of

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
to so basically Donna be in a line of

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.250 
to so basically Donna be in a line of
vision<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:10.180> if<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.360> time<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.570> well<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.050> can

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
vision and if you time it well you can

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.840 
vision and if you time it well you can
apparently<00:03:12.530> use<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.980> surge<00:03:13.250> ability<00:03:13.730> to

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
apparently use the surge ability to

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.190 
apparently use the surge ability to
transport<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.450> other<00:03:14.600> side<00:03:14.810> of<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.990> garden

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
transport the other side of the garden

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.170 
transport the other side of the garden
but<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.530> wouldn't<00:03:15.950> risk<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.370> i'll<00:03:16.550> let<00:03:16.850> you<00:03:16.970> just

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
but I wouldn't risk it i'll let you just

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.330 
but I wouldn't risk it i'll let you just
walk<00:03:17.390> around<00:03:17.570> slowly<00:03:17.990> and<00:03:18.350> see<00:03:18.980> doesn't

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
walk around slowly and see doesn't

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.370 
walk around slowly and see doesn't
catchy<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:20.510> also<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:20.840> want<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:20.990> work<00:03:21.140> all

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
catchy and but also you want to work all

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.820 
catchy and but also you want to work all
the<00:03:21.500> way<00:03:21.590> around<00:03:21.740> and<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.790> obtain<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:24.650> reach

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
the way around and to obtain to reach

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.020 
the way around and to obtain to reach
the<00:03:25.010> fountain<00:03:25.400> even

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.699 

so<00:03:28.660> once<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.900> arrive<00:03:29.110> at<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.319> fountain

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
so once you arrive at the fountain

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.530 
so once you arrive at the fountain
search<00:03:29.950> around<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:30.730> you'll<00:03:30.850> find<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:31.270> key

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
search around it and you'll find a key

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.510 
search around it and you'll find a key
to<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.900> shed<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.410> now<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:32.920> need<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.190> be<00:03:33.400> able

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
to the shed and now you need to be able

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.490 
to the shed and now you need to be able
to<00:03:33.700> head<00:03:34.209> back<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.720> shed<00:03:34.959> door<00:03:35.200> with<00:03:35.350> the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
to head back to the shed door with the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.290 
to head back to the shed door with the
key<00:03:35.530> if<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.100> get<00:03:36.340> spotted<00:03:36.640> by<00:03:36.670> 2<00:03:36.819> which<00:03:37.060> with

key if you get spotted by 2 which with
the<00:03:37.450> key<00:03:37.569> from<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.780> fountain<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.350> will<00:03:38.530> need

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
the key from the fountain you will need

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.410 
the key from the fountain you will need
to<00:03:38.800> connect<00:03:39.069> another<00:03:39.310> one<00:03:39.580> to<00:03:39.700> open<00:03:39.970> its<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.209> be

o our boys your combat stats will be
decreased<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.770> want<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.010> attack<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.459> witches

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
decreased you want to attack the witches

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.390 
decreased you want to attack the witches
experiment<00:03:49.390> and<00:03:49.540> as<00:03:50.380> I<00:03:50.500> said<00:03:50.560> each<00:03:50.920> time<00:03:51.280> you

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
experiment and as I said each time you

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.830 
experiment and as I said each time you
kill<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.730> experiment<00:03:52.270> it<00:03:52.330> changes<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.720> a

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
kill the experiment it changes to a

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.420 
kill the experiment it changes to a
stronger<00:03:53.140> form<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.800> you<00:03:53.860> have<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.130> kill<00:03:54.280> the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
stronger form and you have to kill the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.190 
stronger form and you have to kill the
experiment<00:03:54.940> at<00:03:55.030> about<00:03:55.330> four<00:03:55.600> times<00:03:55.900> before

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
experiment at about four times before

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.170 
experiment at about four times before
it's<00:03:56.530> eventually<00:03:56.770> defeated<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.000> first

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
it's eventually defeated so the first

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.660 
it's eventually defeated so the first
stage<00:03:58.480> is<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.690> scabbard<00:03:59.140> level<00:03:59.560> 24<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.489> it<00:04:00.580> will

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
stage is a scabbard level 24 and it will

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.900 
stage is a scabbard level 24 and it will
become<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.880> level<00:04:01.239> 34<00:04:01.750> spider<00:04:02.170> at<00:04:02.590> 54<00:04:03.280> bear<00:04:03.640> and

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
become a level 34 spider at 54 bear and

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.050 
become a level 34 spider at 54 bear and
lower<00:04:04.180> level<00:04:04.570> 17<00:04:05.050> more<00:04:05.320> so<00:04:05.739> um<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.640> didn't

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
lower level 17 more so um I didn't

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.820 
lower level 17 more so um I didn't
struggle<00:04:07.300> too<00:04:07.600> much<00:04:07.870> obviously<00:04:08.230> my<00:04:08.410> combat
