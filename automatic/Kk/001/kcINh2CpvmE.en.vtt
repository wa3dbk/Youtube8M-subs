00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.040
 Hello, this is Haiti. 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:13.570
 Oh for Kana Mouse SteelSeries Kana mouse 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:18.610
 Explanation of appearance and overall feeling 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.930
 Let's shoot a movie, first turn on the mouse, the first tone 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.730
 The feeling of 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:30.280
 Two people have to be white space systems are 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:33.670
 It was easy to get rid of, so I felt pretty sophisticated when I had a young man. 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:38.760
 If you look here, Galaxy Note 2 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:41.879
 I have a cell phone, and this backing is like a ginger. 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.949
 The feeling is fairly smooth 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.250
 The following inter- sweat on my hands go big or caught looking at different when geuraeteul 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:53.969
 I felt I could use it very smoothly without any symptoms. 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.589
 It's a bit bigger than a regular mouse. 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.649
 Men's losses, yes. 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.859
 Usage 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.430
 It's a perfect feeling for those who use it . 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:12.630
 Because it is a mouse characterized by a gaming mouse, 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:18.030
 On the left and right sides, 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:22.770
 Obtaining all the way from the right-left, so the four buttons itgu 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.690
 And I was born with this kind of scrolling. 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.620
 With five buttons in total 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.970
 It consists of a circle scrollbar. 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:38.430
 If you look at the side view of the scroll foot 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 Amy is white, etc. This is the place when it comes blankets so overall 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.070
 It appears to be fairly uniform mouse that is completely white. 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.000
 I can evaluate it. 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:55.490
 If you look forward and backward are common examples 2 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.830
 It is not skin look, but it is piled up like this cloth, and more 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:05.030
 It seems to convey a sense of luxury 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.030
 In fact, when I compare it to the mouse I used , 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.110
 Soft feeling 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.230
 Our whole example 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.909
 Kim Seong- mang is luxurious 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:24.019
 The first impression received is going to require you see this side of the child 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:31.400
 If you look at i on the last 10 days, 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:36.380
 This is the part of the floor surface has got to enjoy the noodles are processed separately 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:41.300
 Did you ever see a mouse that could be used for a relatively long time ? 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.500
 I have used Logitech mice once before. 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.810

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.480
 The same 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:59.210
 If we look at the bottom of the mouse, the steel series 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:05.660
 Yes, I have a mark, but I can not do any horse arcs or shanks . 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:09.580
 Overall, you can feel the feeling is quite luxurious. 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.580
 Actually, 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.690

 I can see that you are very gentle. 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.299
 If you look bigger 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:48.560
