 dempster full of the later 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:10.629
 carlos ghosn 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.629
 we did three centuries ago the necessary ingredients 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.859
 the necessary ingredients to realize these beings 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.489
 the first 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:22.669
 prawns 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.279
 sewed because they have 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.429
 with this contingency 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.489
 More or less like 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:31.739
 bruschi package 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.290
 stretched are 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.380
 dehydrated in this way 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.910
 nor webber of your vehicle 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.910
 you just have to put them in hot water 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.190
 and slowly revise her husband floating until October 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.500
 this is to follow this color the premiere of purple onion to apply the 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.910
 lessons of macarÃ¡ and media 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.260
 a baby teaspoon 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.070
 chopped garlic 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.370
 then we have here 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.770
 some soy sauce reduce in jumps 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.519
 i the most important thing about these leaves of him 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.119
 of low that on the contrary it has practically all the stores of 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.590
 Asian products 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.870
 as you can see they are 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.950
 It is a soft mass 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.930
 white 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.420
 a paradon to moisturize 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.150
 when the young people are going to perform 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
 borbolla the water of the eyes and take 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.970
 the hydrated 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.970
 and exclaimed has a very very interesting aroma very nice 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.179
 That's what I'm going to fight to release quickly 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.699
 passing the meter long sheet for a few moments before ruining the letters 

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:41.769
 armed at that time is not presentable in a container we are going to 

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:44.150
 place the cameras first then 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.330
 experience has 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.800
 almost everything out of fear 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.060
 barron's 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.360
 Now they are going to put in the mushrooms that I have here 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.670
 the eyes 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.290
 as well as 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.290
 the onion 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.630
 and it was complicated 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.479
 the remaining 20 years 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.479
 The prisoners 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.839
 special mention kings do not confuse 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:36.939
 thick enough 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.079
 moderate wind I do not want it too thin I want you to feel the pp 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.359
 I do not want something specifically 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.029
 then once this is done let's start ap 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:54.159
 arming just to mention a few less like these 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.779
 I just finished 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.149
 then we will win the massa sheet 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.059
 we are going to win 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:03.350
 a few seconds 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.350
 published bush so simply 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:09.919
 the opposition 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:14.579
 then let's see a nice filling two changes of your album be too 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.509
 big so do not go remember 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.949
 and now comes the interesting thing that is harder than it is to bend 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:25.189
 far from achieving it the opposite corners of this structural way back 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.489
 carrascosa corner pieces 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.029
 said this carries it 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.509
 and in this term 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.509
 We were going to be several urkullu has bet 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.819
 the currelantes does not happen the same 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.259
 ethics can be found in any network 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.900
 and in which the Asian reader the procession 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.729
 of course on a small uriarte 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.779
 hot water is happening 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.589
 and that's what 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:18.370
 generate more work we need to 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.879
 kitchen said 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:23.150
 then now I have remember the dolphins that says 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.449
 this usually place 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.939
 henao and be careful because it's hot 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.939
 burnt area 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:35.189
 be careful they can be placed in the situation of separating them a little bit to 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:38.189
 that do not stick 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.639
 the only thing that is achieved is 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.099
 - it's installed 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.959
 the important thing is to cover the well so that it is not done everywhere 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.370
 certainly you have to leave them more or less 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.779
 the Chinese are minutes 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:58.809
 they also put themselves ahead 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:02.529
 the masses have another color turned more sticky 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.839
 sevilla Spain 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:08.520
 and this happens in stellar moments and then before 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.189
 Similar 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:13.189
 the two are already 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.460
 some said that we were accomplices little invest 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:30.569
 also the who insisted kilos 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.229
 some to make yours 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.110
 basically villa 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.990
 a goal of our presence in power 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.990
 two times a little slow 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.849
 of it is all the ipf 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:50.240
 8 let's play now let's go through all this 4 I tell you written illusion
