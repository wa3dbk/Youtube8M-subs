education on the new line mount from

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.410 
education on the new line mount from
camera<00:00:06.839> now<00:00:07.049> this<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.700> camera<00:00:08.700> line<00:00:09.059> mount

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
camera now this is the camera line mount

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.240 
camera now this is the camera line mount
this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> new<00:00:10.080> one<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.650> for<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.889> hero

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
this is the new one this is for the hero

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.180 
this is the new one this is for the hero
one<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.940> two<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.690> then<00:00:12.809> another<00:00:12.870> one<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.740> for

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
one and two and then another one is for

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.530 
one and two and then another one is for
the<00:00:14.280> hero<00:00:14.549> three<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.210> there<00:00:15.330> are<00:00:15.389> two

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
the hero three so there are two

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.060 
the hero three so there are two
different<00:00:15.719> versions<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.830> they<00:00:16.890> both

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
different versions of this and they both

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.519 
different versions of this and they both
work<00:00:17.369> exactly<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.000> same<00:00:18.240> now<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.869> difference

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
work exactly the same now the difference

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.500 
work exactly the same now the difference
that<00:00:19.590> they<00:00:19.740> did<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.189> mold<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.789> they<00:00:21.240> used

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
that they did in this mold is they used

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.450 
that they did in this mold is they used
to<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.080> camera<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.859> was<00:00:22.949> positioned

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
to have the camera and it was positioned

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.670 
to have the camera and it was positioned
up<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.760> top<00:00:24.000> or<00:00:24.449> positioned<00:00:25.050> below<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
up on top or positioned below and the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.320 
up on top or positioned below and the
problem<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.220> when<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.490> get<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.880> mount<00:00:27.210> on

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
problem is when you get this mount on

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.630 
problem is when you get this mount on
the<00:00:27.420> lines<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.109> narrow<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.890> starts<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the lines with this narrow it starts to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.669 
the lines with this narrow it starts to
shake<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.090> go<00:00:30.240> back<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.750> forth<00:00:31.050> because<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
shake and go back and forth because of

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.380 
shake and go back and forth because of
that<00:00:31.830> weight<00:00:32.070> distribution<00:00:32.790> well<00:00:33.270> they

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that weight distribution well they

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
that weight distribution well they
changed<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.110> definitely<00:00:34.649> change<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.219> for

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
changed it and definitely change it for

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.790 
changed it and definitely change it for
in<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.910> very<00:00:36.239> good<00:00:36.480> way<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:37.200> they've<00:00:37.350> done<00:00:37.559> is

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
in a very good way what they've done is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.889 
in a very good way what they've done is
now<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> camera<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.670> mounted<00:00:38.940> centrally

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
now the camera is mounted centrally

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.560 
now the camera is mounted centrally
inside<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.160> line<00:00:41.370> mount<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
inside of the line mount and because of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.139 
inside of the line mount and because of
that<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:43.110> centers<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.760> weight

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
that it's centers that that that weight

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.110 
that it's centers that that that weight
or<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:46.170> center<00:00:46.860> gravity<00:00:47.129> within<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
or the center gravity within it and it

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.690 
or the center gravity within it and it
keeps<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> from<00:00:48.780> wanting<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.500> toss<00:00:49.800> around<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
keeps it from wanting to toss around and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.490 
keeps it from wanting to toss around and
centers<00:00:51.539> everything<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.140> keeps<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.469> from

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
centers everything that keeps it from

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.010 
centers everything that keeps it from
wanting<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> spin<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.370> much<00:00:53.640> now<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.809> is

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
wanting to spin as much now that this is

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.560 
wanting to spin as much now that this is
a<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> hero3<00:00:56.039> mounted<00:00:56.820> into<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.239> now

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
a this is the hero3 mounted into it now

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.770 
a this is the hero3 mounted into it now
the<00:00:57.629> rig<00:00:57.899> comes<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.469> these<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.680> silicone

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
the rig comes with these little silicone

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.660 
the rig comes with these little silicone
inserts<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.020> go<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.500> between<00:01:01.949> now<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> that's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
inserts that go in between now to that's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.579 
inserts that go in between now to that's
another<00:01:03.059> great<00:01:03.390> addition<00:01:03.870> before<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.379> didn't

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
another great addition before it didn't

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.980 
another great addition before it didn't
have<00:01:04.799> these<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.820> had<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.330> some<00:01:06.750> kind

have these so you had to have some kind
of<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.680> break<00:01:08.490> or<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> hold<00:01:09.000> onto<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.450> line<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:10.290> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
of a break or to hold onto a line or it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.710 
of a break or to hold onto a line or it
just<00:01:10.950> set<00:01:11.220> right<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.610> against<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.450> far

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
just set right up against here as far

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539 
just set right up against here as far
down<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.229> wanted<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> sit<00:01:13.830> between<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.220> Y

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
down as it wanted to sit between the Y

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.789 
down as it wanted to sit between the Y
of<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.060> front<00:01:15.360> two<00:01:15.570> lines<00:01:15.869> now<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.470> haven't

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
of your front two lines now I haven't

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.440 
of your front two lines now I haven't
mounted<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.759> only<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
mounted in here and I only have one of

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.450 
mounted in here and I only have one of
the<00:01:18.659> silicones<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.290> got<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.650> comes<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:20.040> four

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the silicones I got that comes with four

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
the silicones I got that comes with four
but<00:01:21.000> I've<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.570> silicone<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:22.560> now

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
but I've got one silicone in here now

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.100 
but I've got one silicone in here now
the<00:01:22.740> reason<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.369> only<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.900> is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the reason I have only one is this is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.870 
the reason I have only one is this is
plenty<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.500> hold<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.920> camera<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.610> not

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
plenty to hold the camera it is not

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.730 
plenty to hold the camera it is not
going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> slide<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.479> or<00:01:27.810> down<00:01:28.020> now<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.619> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
going to slide up or down now if you

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.130 
going to slide up or down now if you
push<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.000> push<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.780> it'll

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
push it you can push it up and it'll

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.870 
push it you can push it up and it'll
stay<00:01:31.530> where<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.009> that's<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.790> of

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
stay where it is that's with one of

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880 
stay where it is that's with one of
these<00:01:32.970> brakes<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> would<00:01:34.049> suggest<00:01:34.229> putting

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
these brakes so I would suggest putting

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.560 
these brakes so I would suggest putting
these<00:01:35.070> other<00:01:35.310> three<00:01:35.520> away<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.270> case<00:01:36.450> you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
these other three away just in case you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.200 
these other three away just in case you
lose<00:01:36.750> one<00:01:37.079> you've<00:01:37.619> got<00:01:37.650> them<00:01:38.159> now<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> reason

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
lose one you've got them now the reason

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.520 
lose one you've got them now the reason
I<00:01:39.270> don't<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.509> them<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> left<00:01:40.140> side<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
I don't have them on the left side is

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.620 
I don't have them on the left side is
this<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> safety<00:01:41.340> pull<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.030> sling<00:01:42.360> shot

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
this the safety pull on this sling shot

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.230 
this the safety pull on this sling shot
bar<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.770> throw<00:01:44.070> my<00:01:44.250> bar<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.729> camera<00:01:45.090> will

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
bar so if I throw my bar the camera will

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.179 
bar so if I throw my bar the camera will
slide<00:01:45.540> up<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.470> will<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:47.100> will

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
slide up with it and it will it will

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.249 
slide up with it and it will it will
still<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.820> safety<00:01:48.090> involved<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> so

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
still have the safety involved in it so

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350 
still have the safety involved in it so
be<00:01:49.799> aware<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.460> don't<00:01:50.850> want<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.180> stick

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
be aware of that you don't want to stick

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.840 
be aware of that you don't want to stick
all<00:01:51.570> these<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.070> load<00:01:53.280> comes<00:01:53.610> up

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
all these on and then the load comes up

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.460 
all these on and then the load comes up
and<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.450> your<00:01:54.630> kite<00:01:54.810> doesn't<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.290> that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and then your kite doesn't have that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.280 
and then your kite doesn't have that
safety<00:01:55.920> side<00:01:56.909> line<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.899> deep<00:01:58.079> power

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
safety side line on there the deep power

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.850 
safety side line on there the deep power
line<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.570> put<00:02:00.750> two<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:00.990> one<00:02:01.350> side<00:02:01.409> but

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
line so you can put two on one side but

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.590 
line so you can put two on one side but
not<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.430> safety<00:02:02.850> side<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.270> your<00:02:03.390> front

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
not on the safety side of your front

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.850 
not on the safety side of your front
line<00:02:03.810> which<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.079> almost<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> kite

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
line which is almost all the kite

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.100 
line which is almost all the kite
systems<00:02:05.759> now<00:02:05.939> power<00:02:06.390> systems<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:06.840> deep

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
systems now power systems are deep

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.990 
systems now power systems are deep
powering<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> front<00:02:08.039> line<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.910> aware

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
powering on the front line so be aware

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.449 
powering on the front line so be aware
of<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:09.569> as<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.289> mean<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.250> is

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
of that but as you see I mean this is

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.910 
of that but as you see I mean this is
not<00:02:11.670> moving<00:02:12.180> anywhere<00:02:12.709> so

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
not moving anywhere so

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.230 
not moving anywhere so
move<00:02:14.160> back<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> little<00:02:14.730> bit<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.090> you'll<00:02:15.180> see

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
move back a little bit and you'll see

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.510 
move back a little bit and you'll see
how<00:02:15.569> this<00:02:15.750> kind<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.110> works<00:02:16.170> we've<00:02:17.040> got<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.340> set

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
how this kind of works we've got it set

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.220 
how this kind of works we've got it set
up<00:02:17.550> just<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.180> see<00:02:18.510> how<00:02:18.660> positions

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
up just so you can see how positions

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.740 
up just so you can see how positions
itself<00:02:19.650> if<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.920> load<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.370> front<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.819> line<00:02:21.090> now

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
itself if you load the front to line now

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.170 
itself if you load the front to line now
picture<00:02:22.440> here<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.739> realize<00:02:23.340> your<00:02:23.580> kite<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.940> way

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
picture here to realize your kite is way

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.699 
picture here to realize your kite is way
up<00:02:24.390> higher<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.140> line<00:02:25.349> is<00:02:25.470> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> be

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
up higher so the line is going to be

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.839 
up higher so the line is going to be
spread<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.250> there's<00:02:26.370> not<00:02:26.520> going<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.700> be<00:02:26.760> as

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
spread and there's not going to be as

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.339 
spread and there's not going to be as
much<00:02:27.000> force<00:02:27.360> trying<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.690> spread<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.200> that

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
much force trying to spread on that

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.680 
much force trying to spread on that
camera<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.370> can<00:02:29.610> slide<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.390> up<00:02:30.569> a

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
camera so you can slide this on up a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.630 
camera so you can slide this on up a
good<00:02:31.020> four<00:02:31.319> or<00:02:31.380> five<00:02:31.560> feet<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.459> will

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
good four or five feet and that will

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.910 
good four or five feet and that will
widen<00:02:33.209> your<00:02:33.330> range<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.989> view<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.560> everything

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
widen your range of view and everything

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.190 
widen your range of view and everything
else<00:02:35.069> on<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> camera<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.239> really<00:02:36.870> really

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
else on the camera but a really really

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.720 
else on the camera but a really really
nice<00:02:37.380> setup<00:02:37.680> they<00:02:37.920> definitely<00:02:38.430> made<00:02:38.550> some

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
nice setup they definitely made some

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.780 
nice setup they definitely made some
great<00:02:38.940> changes<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.600> these<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:41.400> will

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
great changes to these and it will

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.699 
great changes to these and it will
definitely<00:02:42.450> give<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.780> some<00:02:42.959> great<00:02:43.230> pictures

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
definitely give you some great pictures

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.670 
definitely give you some great pictures
and<00:02:44.130> imagery<00:02:45.000> from<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.660> riding<00:02:46.140> down<00:02:46.319> below

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
and imagery from you riding down below

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.190 
and imagery from you riding down below
and<00:02:46.950> being<00:02:47.790> able<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.060> set<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.690> where<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.050> won't

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
and being able to set it where it won't

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.460 
and being able to set it where it won't
slide<00:02:49.650> down<00:02:49.980> low<00:02:50.430> it'll<00:02:51.120> give<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.630> range

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
slide down low it'll give you that range

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.990 
slide down low it'll give you that range
of<00:02:52.680> field<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.190> when<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.519> start<00:02:53.790> shooting

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
some other moves down on the board it's

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
some other moves down on the board it's
fantastic
