00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.420
 Hello, my name is Andrea, I am 50 years old 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.800
 and I want to tell you my story today, 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.780
 how I got my weight back under control thanks to the MetaCheck 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.120
 and I feel really comfortable since then 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.820
 and super happy, 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.360
 that I was offered the MetaCheck. 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.560
 My story begins 2012. 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.380
 At the beginning of 2012 my girlfriend took me to the sport. 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.740
 Alone I did not go then, 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.600
 And then I just spent the time with it 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.660
 to eat more than to do sports 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.540
 and then I really gained a lot. 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.160
 And when Christmas came, and I did not come in my clothes anymore 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 I have to say, I felt really uncomfortable. 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.920
 The situation, how to walk around in beautiful clothes, 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.800
 Everyone who simply does not feel well knows. 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.840
 I simply did not want that situation and feeling anymore. 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.820
 So I signed in the gym, 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.580
 how to do that 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.580
 and then I went there in January 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.100
 then got a personal trainer, 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.040
 who has put together a program for me. 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.000
 Lift a lot with weights, with proper strength training 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 and of course I did what everyone else does, 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 namely waived carbohydrates. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.980
 And I have to tell you 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.500
 I did not get full at all. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.280
 And the situation was very bad 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.300
 I really tapped myself in the gym 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.600
 and I still gained weight 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.540
 Anyone who starts a diet and hopes 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.900
 Lose kilos and instead also increase kilos, 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.660
 He knows that there can not be more frustration in life. 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.120
 I was about to cancel the whole situation again 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.260
 My personal trainer then said I should have dinner instead 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.860
 drink a protein shake 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.860
 and he was terrible 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.400
 and he did not satisfy me either. 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.320
 I actually have the time where I have a lot of energy 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.480
 put in the sport 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.980
 have taken many proteins and protein drinks, 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.760
 say and write another 2 kg increased. 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.060
 That made me so frustrated that I just did not feel like 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.060
 to continue the whole thing. 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.060
 A few weeks later, I had an appointment 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.560
 with my gynecologist 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.740
 and I have complained to her of all my suffering, 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.040
 from all my frustration that had dammed in me 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.800
 and she then gave me a flyer 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.540
 a MetaCheck from the company CoGAP in the hand 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.120
 and I should inform myself internet, 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120
 what this test offers me. 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.520
 I did that, I went home 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.060
 have looked on the Internet, what this test can 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.060
 and I have to tell you, I was totally convinced 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.420
 from what was there 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.820
 and did this test a little later with my gynecologist, 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.840
 and the test result came 14 days later 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.760
 and I was very surprised 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.300
 that I'm not the type 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.300
 that decreases with proteins, 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.300
 but with carbohydrates. 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.520
 If you tell that, you think it's crazy! 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.480
 Because, who takes off with carbohydrates and fats? 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.440
 But that says my guy, my delta guy, 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.600
 that I should lose weight with carbonated spirits and fats. 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.380
 Then I organized my day afterwards 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.400
 and it does not matter what job you're in at the time 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.660
 because with carbohydrates, fats and little protein 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.820
 you can do it the whole day 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.540
 that you never fall into a hunger-low, 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.920
 that the insulin level always stays at the same level 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.840
 and you have accordingly no hunger attacks. 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.500
 That's the beauty of it. 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.340
 I am full 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.340
 I have lost weight 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.960
 and I started to feel really comfortable. 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.800
 The pounds tumbled despite many carbohydrates 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.920
 and there were at least 54% carbs, 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.140
 I have taken to myself 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.960
 In addition came 30% fat and only 16% proteins. 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.580
 That's incredible, with such a system 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.940
 even lose kilocalories. 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.720
 And that worked for me 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.340
 I lost 11 kg within 4 months. 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.700
 I'm finally back for my 50th birthday 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.300
 the six had stood in front 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.300
 and that was my goal. 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.300
 And the nice thing is: 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.180
 I hold the weight since. 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.600
 It's been over half a year now 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.560
 and I have my weight under control. 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.080
 And there is nothing better than finally losing weight 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.860
 rushing back to town, 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.480
 to buy clothes in size 38 or 40, 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.440
 to be admired by my husband, 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.140
 from my work colleagues and from my environment. 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.300
 The nicest compliment I have received 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.500
 was actually from my husband. 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.020
 He then told me, after I took off so nicely on my birthday, 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.000
 I would just be the most beautiful woman in the world. 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.200
 And that touched me a lot.
