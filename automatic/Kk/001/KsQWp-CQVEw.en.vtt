00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.280
 welcome to the long awaited question and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.090
 our first question is how to put the goddess 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.519
 Brezhnev 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.309
 Well, there is only one way out here 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.810
 so here so here so here and only 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.330
 so no longer like ladies transition 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.519
 the next question candles the question sounds 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.260
 us about so why do you call me names 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:32.219
 great king alexander nevsky what 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:37.469
 the price may be this one or this one 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:39.590
 and can be the case in fact that 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.059
 ancient Alexander somewhat labored 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.550
 commanders we do not touch 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.100
 arched it is necessary the great alexander 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.360
 Nevsky inventor methods like this 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.820

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.129
 screenwriters a great actor and so on 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.899
 and just a man with a capital letter 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.270
 alexander nevsky who actually 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.500
 is alexander kuritsyn and he took 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.390
 a surname after that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.390
 the great commander Alexander Nevsky 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.280
 so you let's not understand next 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.689
 question

 on the windowsill there is no how to spend my saber 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.700

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.330
 have you ever seen hemp on the internet you 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 thought 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.850

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.549

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.079
 opens backstage on in chicken dancing 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.479
 with a view from the window seem to sign here 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.259
 so here so here so on the water and I 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.259
 saw the result 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.930
 this is normal 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.659
 answer the question you wanted 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.640
 take the last question nickname namely 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.450
 attitude haters screen question I have 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.180
 got lost 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.569
 so he missed July as simple as 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.519
 you belong to haight itself 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.349
 why are they mine they are common but how not 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.349
 you can wear them you can love and 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.349
 hate and you can just take and 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.329
 all-all-all i give up and now let's 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.910
 We will understand this issue in more or less 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.849
 started seriously fought on who 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.950
 such haters well in the general concept haters 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.049
 these are the people who want 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.640
 anywhere and for any reason without 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.129
 reasons anywhere for anything 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.049
 podnasrat anyone something or 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.170
 just so bad shit well or somehow 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.359
 something like this, I can divide everyone 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.670
 about 4 conditioners 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.349
 the first groups it can almost not cheat 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.099
 These are people who are not a good time in 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.139
 bad moment 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.000
 went for example let's say the channel got on 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.959
 some very persistent video you 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.900
 watched from wiki 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.060
 that's what it was to put dizlink 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.560
 him saiga not keep a comment gone and 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.480
 never return to the channel and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.669
 you came back we didn't even know what 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.829
 sometime on this channel this is sort of 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.160
 so did a less perturbed video 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.440
 or the fact that not so much shocked 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.569
 the second group is people who consider 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.609
 I don't know myself too proud to 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.349
 like someone thinks that nobody 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.060
 not worthy of go Like and therefore not easy 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.340
 all put dizlike regardless of all 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.530
 liked this video did not like 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.690
 moore write in the comments to anyone at all 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.160
 it's not easy to put dizlike and even 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.500
 never open comments and 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.829
 next we have the most foolish ones 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.169
 groups and the third group is such people so 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.090
 called things in the sense that they have 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.349
 physique what there they are small and 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.700
 puny not 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.650
 not himself not physique here 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.590
 absolutely nothing to do with the fact that 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.729
 Drisch is with him from all cracks 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.709
 who are only in his body 10 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.110
 huge tons of diarrhea and prison and other things 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.120
 garbage that wants to spray on all 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.940
 surrounding it all that surrounds it 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.710
 thereby just every day comes 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.419
 send a video and how to work just 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.940
 comments come and starts there 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.849
 shit she is one of the most unpleasant 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.770
 groups of haters who are furious but 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.050
 most sad for them if on them 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.690
 nobody pays attention and finally 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.240
 most moronic dumb group 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.539
 faders are the very people who 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.400
 try at the expense of someone else's name somehow 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.530
 unleash your exactly example by 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.780
 smashing someone else's channel unleash your 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.120
 the channel is so to speak people who are themselves 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.009
 can't achieve anything they just 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.740
 bounce off all other people for 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.360
 spray all your poop so that 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.400
 the background of all splattered where he they are 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.160
 looked cleaner more so 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.930
 say that is not better than if they are on 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.970
 really well or something like this 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.669
 kind of and about this group of people there 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.830
 one fun modern folk 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.310
 saying that sounds like this but 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.229
 another's fire will not leave and this lovers 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.050
 drive on strangers but you understand what 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.789
 you could wish for only one thing you do not accidentally 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.370
 hit a point and now personally mine 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.229
 attitude to these same hayter as 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.270
 said one great man and what 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.949
 I do not remember exactly if the train will 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.870
 stop and pay attention to 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.940
 each Shawky who on his light, he 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.500
 never reach your goal here 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.020
 can already be seen in terms of 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.759
 benefits what happens if we allow 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.030
 consider from the point of view of that quote 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.830
 tank belts and people waiting for the train 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.960
 if the train stopped to prove 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.300
 dogs that he belt she is online to him 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.370
 in vain he lost time he did not 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.680
 proved dogs pleased the dog and people 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.390
 did not wait for the train all lost except 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.950
 dogs i.e. haters in reverse 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.250
 happy when they pay attention 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.980
 a bunch there I so the train stopped you che 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.990
 so straight sina just fight me 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.480
 power took attention all haters shit 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.340
 In short, I am the best heder of you 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.170
 what do you see for this not heels we 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.910
 something like tale and it follows 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.070
 output to haters is simply not worth it 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.200
 pay attention because there is no shit 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.940
 go stop stink you will them 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.980
 touch they will understand even more so 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.990
 what if you put down some very 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.000
 cruel crucified cruiser is simply not 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.460
 pay attention to it it will be the 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.690
 sore blow for his reputation and in general 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.490
 for him and now we finally 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.180
 back to more familiar to us 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.130
 the subject 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.620
 I really lost his little square 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.590
 so it sounds right on somehow the same 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.780
 but does not want to cook to eat what to do but 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.090
 that and should cook just male 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:53.710
 dinner then will understand that they are ready to eat 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:07:02.530
 you need to peel the potatoes and serve 8 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:04.090
 weed and cooked and can be eaten only with 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.400
 chicken eggs better lead them 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.650
 cost a little bit thicker and it can 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.230
 be a little dangerous and remember chief 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.150
 the law of the male dinner prepared must 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.130
 be in one step you can boil the potatoes and 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.610
 eat it wash potatoes eat 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:23.800
 brushing eat your eggs out makes sense 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:25.540
 understandable and after that did not forget dinner in 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.120
 next time to cook dinner myself and 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.490
 the last question for today is frost what 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.400

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.260
