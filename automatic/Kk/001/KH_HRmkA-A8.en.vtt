00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
computer you should have a machine that

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.339 
computer you should have a machine that
looks<00:00:08.580> very<00:00:08.760> similar<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:10.080> an

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
looks very similar to this it's an

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.589 
looks very similar to this it's an
optical<00:00:10.710> x<00:00:10.950> 320<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:13.130> you<00:00:14.130> want<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.670> first<00:00:15.330> open

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
optical x 320 and you want to first open

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.950 
optical x 320 and you want to first open
the<00:00:16.020> tower<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.789> way<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:17.970> do<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.510> you're

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
the tower and the way you do that you're

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.870 
the tower and the way you do that you're
gonna<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> little<00:00:19.590> lever<00:00:19.980> here<00:00:20.130> that

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
gonna have a little lever here that

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.179 
gonna have a little lever here that
looks<00:00:21.090> like<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.199> you're<00:00:22.529> gonna<00:00:22.619> pull<00:00:23.010> it

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
looks like this and you're gonna pull it

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.509 
looks like this and you're gonna pull it
out<00:00:23.449> and<00:00:24.449> when<00:00:24.660> we<00:00:24.750> pull<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.170> out<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:26.220> gonna

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
out and when we pull it out it's gonna

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.359 
out and when we pull it out it's gonna
pop<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.830> want<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> pull

forward and bring it out these little

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.970 
forward and bring it out these little
connections<00:00:37.950> there<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:39.260> it's<00:00:40.260> pretty<00:00:40.500> simple

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
connections there and it's pretty simple

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.639 
connections there and it's pretty simple
what<00:00:41.760> we're<00:00:41.910> gonna<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.690> we're<00:00:43.590> gonna

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
replace the memory which is located

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.819 
replace the memory which is located
right<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:48.899> way<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.559> is

see the little insert here that has a

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.510 
see the little insert here that has a
little<00:02:05.570> line<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:06.740> where<00:02:07.740> where<00:02:08.160> it

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
little line here where where it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.850 
little line here where where it
case<00:02:08.760> that<00:02:09.660> that's<00:02:09.870> going<00:02:10.230> to<00:02:10.290> go<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
case that that's going to go to that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.590 
case that that's going to go to that
that's<00:02:11.250> got<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.520> fit<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.060> little<00:02:12.360> line

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
that's got to fit in that little line

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.740 
that's got to fit in that little line
there<00:02:12.770> okay<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:13.830> first<00:02:14.730> thing<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.120> would<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.480> is

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
there okay so first thing I would do is

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.490 
there okay so first thing I would do is
make<00:02:16.470> sure<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.830> align<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.210> see

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
make sure you align it and you can see

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.310 
make sure you align it and you can see
that<00:02:19.500> if<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:19.890> put<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.430> there<00:02:21.080> it's<00:02:22.080> gonna

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
that if you put it in there it's gonna

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.830 
that if you put it in there it's gonna
fit<00:02:22.650> right<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.130> there<00:02:23.370> okay<00:02:24.120> if<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.420> turned<00:02:24.720> it

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
fit right in there okay if you turned it

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.310 
fit right in there okay if you turned it
around<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:26.580> try<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.850> align<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:28.170> can

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
around and you try to align it you can

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.520 
around and you try to align it you can
see<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.670> little<00:02:29.850> slid<00:02:30.330> it's<00:02:30.930> not<00:02:31.170> it's

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
see that the little slid it's not it's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.910 
see that the little slid it's not it's
not<00:02:31.910> matching<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.690> don't<00:02:34.230> want<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.470> insert

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
not matching so you don't want to insert

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.340 
not matching so you don't want to insert
it<00:02:35.070> this<00:02:35.220> way<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.610> want<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.850> insert<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.450> this

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
it this way you want to insert it this

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.970 
it this way you want to insert it this
way<00:02:37.790> because<00:02:38.790> when<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.390> put<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:39.980> it's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
way because when you put it in it's

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.400 
way because when you put it in it's
going<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.310> fit<00:02:41.550> right<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.910> there<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.390> what<00:02:43.260> you

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
going to fit right in there and what you

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.370 
going to fit right in there and what you
do<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.970> make<00:02:45.150> sure<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.480> these<00:02:45.720> little

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
do is you make sure that these little

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.540 
do is you make sure that these little
handles<00:02:47.010> are<00:02:47.430> pushed<00:02:47.760> all<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.000> way<00:02:48.090> back<00:02:48.390> and

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
handles are pushed all the way back and

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.890 
handles are pushed all the way back and
you're<00:02:50.550> going<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.730> insert<00:02:50.940> your<00:02:51.180> first<00:02:51.600> chip

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
you're going to insert your first chip

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.140 
you're going to insert your first chip
once<00:02:52.740> you've<00:02:52.980> removed<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.430> originals<00:02:54.000> in

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
once you've removed the originals in

once you've removed the originals in
there<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.600> you're<00:02:55.410> going<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.590> make<00:02:55.740> sure<00:02:55.800> that

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
there and you're going to make sure that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.790 
there and you're going to make sure that
it<00:02:56.430> goes<00:02:56.580> right<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.180> through<00:02:57.360> here<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.990> that

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
it goes right in it through here on that

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.190 
it goes right in it through here on that
side<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.400> then<00:03:00.090> on<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.390> other<00:03:00.420> side<00:03:00.690> right

side and then on the other side right

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.770 
side and then on the other side right
here<00:03:01.530> okay<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.460> it<00:03:03.180> should<00:03:03.390> look<00:03:03.540> like<00:03:03.600> that

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.060 
chips and and both prongs are gripping
the<00:03:30.180> memory<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:31.170> should<00:03:31.410> not<00:03:31.590> be<00:03:31.770> able<00:03:31.920> to

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
the memory you should not be able to
