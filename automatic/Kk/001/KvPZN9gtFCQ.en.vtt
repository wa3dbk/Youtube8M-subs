it's up guys this Tyler with board

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.080 
it's up guys this Tyler with board
insiders<00:00:02.100> I'm<00:00:02.250> getting<00:00:02.460> ready<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.820> do<00:00:02.939> the

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
insiders I'm getting ready to do the

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.680 
insiders I'm getting ready to do the
Flex<00:00:03.360> test<00:00:03.659> on<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.080> niche<00:00:04.350> ether<00:00:05.310> this<00:00:05.609> is<00:00:05.730> 156

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
Flex test on the niche ether this is 156

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.960 
Flex test on the niche ether this is 156
centimeter<00:00:07.170> board<00:00:07.470> it's<00:00:08.040> also<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.370> mid<00:00:08.670> Y

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
centimeter board it's also a mid Y

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.200 
centimeter board it's also a mid Y
mid-wide<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.469> camber<00:00:11.460> profile<00:00:11.880> on<00:00:12.090> this

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
mid-wide the camber profile on this

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.940 
mid-wide the camber profile on this
board<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> reverse<00:00:13.139> camber<00:00:13.440> right<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
board is a reverse camber right in the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.189 
board is a reverse camber right in the
center<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.429> then<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.839> mellow

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
center and then you have a really mellow

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.769 
center and then you have a really mellow
camber<00:00:16.859> zone<00:00:17.070> throughout<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.119> insert<00:00:18.449> area

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
camber zone throughout the insert area

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.410 
camber zone throughout the insert area
so<00:00:19.050> reverse<00:00:19.439> camber<00:00:19.740> -<00:00:20.279> regular<00:00:20.490> camber<00:00:20.939> which

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
so reverse camber - regular camber which

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.929 
so reverse camber - regular camber which
is<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> mellow<00:00:21.960> regular<00:00:22.500> camber<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.789> see

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
is a mellow regular camber you can see

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.730 
is a mellow regular camber you can see
that<00:00:24.090> reverse<00:00:24.390> camber<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.840> quite<00:00:25.080> quite

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
that reverse camber is quite quite

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.670 
that reverse camber is quite quite
extreme<00:00:26.130> though<00:00:26.689> alright<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.990> remember<00:00:28.320> this

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
extreme though alright so remember this

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.939 
extreme though alright so remember this
is<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.859> mid<00:00:29.130> wide<00:00:29.279> board<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.500> then<00:00:31.500> look<00:00:31.830> at

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
is a mid wide board and then look at

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.670 
is a mid wide board and then look at
that<00:00:32.130> Magna<00:00:32.550> traction<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.360> that

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
that Magna traction can you see that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.240 
that Magna traction can you see that
he's<00:00:34.680> got<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> lot<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> mat<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.149> it

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
he's got a lot of mat going on on it

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.319 
he's got a lot of mat going on on it
should<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.340> able<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.520> hold<00:00:38.670> an<00:00:38.820> edge<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:38.969> know

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
should be able to hold an edge you know

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.720 
should be able to hold an edge you know
on<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.020> solid<00:00:41.010> ice<00:00:41.160> cliff<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.879> baby

or insiders real riders real reviews
alright<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.579> first<00:00:49.610> thing<00:00:50.000> I<00:00:50.120> usually

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
alright so the first thing I usually

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.150 
alright so the first thing I usually
like<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.750> do<00:00:50.870> is<00:00:51.020> just<00:00:51.170> kind<00:00:51.350> of<00:00:51.410> rock<00:00:51.650> back<00:00:51.920> on

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160

the tip and tail not really giving it a
lot<00:00:55.399> of<00:00:55.520> leg<00:00:55.670> muscle<00:00:56.030> just<00:00:56.120> kind<00:00:56.329> of<00:00:56.360> seeing

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
lot of leg muscle just kind of seeing

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.210 
lot of leg muscle just kind of seeing
where<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.870> board<00:00:57.050> wants<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.350> go<00:00:57.470> just<00:00:57.710> with<00:00:58.040> my

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
where the board wants to go just with my

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.780 
where the board wants to go just with my
weight<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.670> with<00:00:58.820> me<00:00:59.000> leaning<00:00:59.360> around<00:00:59.660> I<00:01:00.790> mean

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
weight and with me leaning around I mean

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.759 
weight and with me leaning around I mean
fortunately<00:01:02.360> this<00:01:02.629> board<00:01:02.900> feels<00:01:03.140> super

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
fortunately this board feels super

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.380 
fortunately this board feels super
comfortable<00:01:04.220> I<00:01:04.309> can<00:01:04.339> lift<00:01:04.640> those<00:01:04.850> especially

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
comfortable I can lift those especially

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.090 
comfortable I can lift those especially
for<00:01:05.720> a<00:01:05.750> mid<00:01:05.990> wide<00:01:06.170> usually<00:01:06.650> you<00:01:06.740> get<00:01:06.830> a<00:01:06.890> little

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
for a mid wide usually you get a little

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.370 
for a mid wide usually you get a little
bit<00:01:07.220> more<00:01:07.369> torsional<00:01:07.940> resistance<00:01:08.090> but<00:01:08.750> this

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
bit more torsional resistance but this

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.899 
bit more torsional resistance but this
is<00:01:09.590> actually<00:01:09.740> very<00:01:09.979> comfortable<00:01:10.520> on<00:01:10.790> the

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
is actually very comfortable on the

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.630 
is actually very comfortable on the
torsional<00:01:11.300> flex<00:01:11.950> all<00:01:12.950> right<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:13.369> let's<00:01:13.520> see

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
torsional flex all right and let's see

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.150 
torsional flex all right and let's see
if<00:01:13.759> I<00:01:13.880> really<00:01:14.150> mash<00:01:14.360> into<00:01:14.690> it<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.840> little<00:01:14.930> bit

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
if I really mash into it a little bit

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.249 
if I really mash into it a little bit
see<00:01:16.160> what<00:01:16.190> we<00:01:16.369> can<00:01:16.460> get<00:01:16.610> out<00:01:16.759> of<00:01:16.789> it<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.259> can

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
see what we can get out of it you can

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.080 
see what we can get out of it you can
see<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:18.680> feels<00:01:18.920> like<00:01:19.100> it's<00:01:19.250> got<00:01:19.399> a<00:01:19.460> nice<00:01:19.700> stiff

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
see it feels like it's got a nice stiff

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.940 
see it feels like it's got a nice stiff
zone<00:01:20.360> right<00:01:20.690> under<00:01:21.050> feet<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:21.500> then<00:01:21.649> it<00:01:21.770> feels

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
zone right under feet and then it feels

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.070 
zone right under feet and then it feels
like<00:01:22.130> it's<00:01:22.280> bending<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.570> center<00:01:23.899> and<00:01:24.050> on

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
like it's bending in the center and on

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.779 
like it's bending in the center and on
the<00:01:24.200> tip<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:24.530> tail<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:24.920> right<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.340> insert

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
the tip and tail but right in the insert

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.650 
the tip and tail but right in the insert
area<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:26.180> got<00:01:26.330> some<00:01:26.600> stability<00:01:26.840> in<00:01:27.259> there<00:01:31.660> the

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
area you got some stability in there the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.210 
area you got some stability in there the
tip<00:01:32.899> actually<00:01:33.350> feels<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:33.649> little<00:01:33.860> bit<00:01:33.979> stiffer

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
tip actually feels a little bit stiffer

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.300 
tip actually feels a little bit stiffer
than<00:01:34.429> the<00:01:34.490> tail<00:01:34.789> does<00:01:35.060> I<00:01:35.860> got<00:01:36.860> more<00:01:37.039> stiffness

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
than the tail does I got more stiffness

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.889 
than the tail does I got more stiffness
right<00:01:37.700> here<00:01:38.030> than<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:38.960> do<00:01:39.020> right<00:01:39.170> here

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899
