00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.380
 let's continue with your next exercise friends to classmates the day 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.299
 today we are going to see how to retouch photographs to use them for 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.350
 print let's do it ahead with the help of the rule of law let's 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.919
 locate the files 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.139
 I am an uncle who desk and still tomaticán mind visualized all the 

00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:23.909
 files that are contained of the type that is this time I'm going to recopa 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:28.229
 locate this goat that was previously scanned by double clicking 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:31.499
 automatically we are good photoshop and how can you see this canvas 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.470
 has three photographs inside it 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.330
 because if you put the rest a tool that I recommend a lot for 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.880
 this kind of applications is the following this truly amazing in the 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.000
 top right menu and bon 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.639
 hoffa in what the masters auto told me nuance 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:51.860
 and we're going to locate propane luck in photos or else 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.170
 crop and straighten photographs 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.390
 when I occupy and click here 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.370
 clearly the application performs 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.840
 the separation of each of the archives 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.989
 apart the previous one prevails 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.940
 in this case I'm going to use the photography of our superman visions 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.370
 to fix it 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.760
 what I have to do is print south shoulder hence the impression of 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.350
 this 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.000
 Well, it's going to be shorter 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.900
 locals are shit lie of color 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 and only rehn box 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.960
 I'm going to do it for this part and I'm going to try to find a 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.530
 exact square 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.880
 very well 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.980
 there is not a double click I have the audition signature but they look a little 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.610
 green no 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.000
 let's tell him that we are not more fair 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.280
 an adjustment in him higher command of jaén more in them mans 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.200
 we can tell you that the disk had made variations 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.480
 and as you see that photograph we have an original and we also have the 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.790
 current selection 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.150
 at this moment I see it very very very very green and it is more reddish good if 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.600
 would see a click it looked bad more red I dedicate it tropical in red or in the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.880
 magenta like it would look like that 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.030
 in the pub now that today a double click here medicinal 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.790
 center all this 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.930
 well, in this case, be very green or photograph only how to make a 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.009
 click to make it a bit arrogant 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.220
 in little more blue 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.480
 so that certain combinations are given, it is better for me to take my photograph of that 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.289
 way 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.669
 for any doubt that he has recommended that also adjustments use 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.689
 the automatic levels 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.219
 and see how it will be much more after photography 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.449
 Another important point that we must contemplate here is that we must 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.589
 change the color mode asimelec to since it is for printing 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:31.779
 in the case of a Emmaus 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.929
 also ares another image 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.330
 let's tell you that hundreds of other supporters 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.580
 and there is the size that you need it this time or you needed ten 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.679
 centimeters approximately 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.399
 I tell him that mr formulated the size 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.999
 I think I'll do this time is save as 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.999
 and here we are going to put marbury cioppo 1 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.239
 I'm going to tell you that I keep it on the desk 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.209
 subsequently boi has given the same environment and I will locate the file 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.439
 who say hector illustrated previously here there is not a double clip 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.720
 click and also open automatically in projects 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.629
 I'm going to erase the velar of the photograph because from fahel file 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.929
 I will give you placed plays 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.879
 and I will locate the photograph 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.819
 like the beautiful place mauricio 1 here we have it we say 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.509
 Only the consultation may 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:24.319
 original as I asked because I stuck 10 centimeters but it turns out that it has 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.609
 to be a little smaller when very simple way to do it 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:32.479
 reduced is this point 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.930
 and there we have our photograph as we wanted 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.239
 that's going to be a south member to print what I want to do now is 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.789
 locate all my printing area 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.399
 I'm going to generate here 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:43.470
 a square 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.520
 this box already generates from lowe soul selector 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.819
 superior command of copies 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.659
 and located to palliate the cut-out pop-rock elvia 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:54.679
 and I tell him to create 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:56.639
 that's how our days will be 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.379
 of cork I have smooth file nor how do I have to do it again 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.340
 As you can see, this retouch of images helps us a lot for the 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.859
 print quality I hope you here in virtual classroom visit our 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.809
 Internet page also until next time
