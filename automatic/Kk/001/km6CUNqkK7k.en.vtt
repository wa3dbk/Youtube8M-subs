00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.429 
matter where I click it disables me from
walking<00:01:32.689> so<00:01:33.689> that's<00:01:34.079> one<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
walking so that's one of the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.620 
walking so that's one of the
disabilities<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.579> doing<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.420> allows

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
disabilities to doing this but it allows

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.760 
disabilities to doing this but it allows
your<00:01:36.780> penguin<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.229> anywhere<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.590> want

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
now you can do this anywhere around the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.550

island<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.479> my<00:01:39.570> favorite<00:01:39.900> spot<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
island and my favorite spot to do it is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.870 
island and my favorite spot to do it is
actually<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> ski<00:01:41.310> village<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.790> you

actually in the ski village because you
get<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.090> go<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.450> these<00:01:42.600> mountains<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.079> let's

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
get to go up in these mountains so let's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.319 
get to go up in these mountains so let's
just<00:01:43.920> try<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.189> let's<00:01:44.430> transform<00:01:44.880> into<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
just try it let's transform into the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.469 
just try it let's transform into the
Pteranodon<00:01:45.869> again<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.909> let's<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.270> how<00:01:48.360> this

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
Pteranodon again and let's see how this

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.749 
Pteranodon again and let's see how this
all<00:01:48.659> goes<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:49.829> I'm<00:01:49.920> gonna<00:01:50.040> want<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
all goes so what I'm gonna want to do is

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.440 
all goes so what I'm gonna want to do is
click<00:01:52.100> click<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.220> my<00:01:53.340> profile<00:01:53.790> over<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.299> and

click click on my profile over here and
then<00:01:54.659> click<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> area<00:01:55.409> where<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.619> want<00:01:55.740> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
then click on the area where I want to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.090 
then click on the area where I want to
walk<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:57.149> disabled<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.890> cell<00:01:58.890> allows

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
walk to and then disabled it cell allows

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.560 
walk to and then disabled it cell allows
me<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.369> walk<00:01:59.579> all<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.000> way<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.450> now

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
me to walk all the way up here and now

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.149 
me to walk all the way up here and now
I'm<00:02:00.630> cognitive<00:02:01.170> firing<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> laws<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.799> gravity

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
I'm cognitive firing the laws of gravity

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.459 
I'm cognitive firing the laws of gravity
because<00:02:02.460> I'm<00:02:02.610> standing<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:04.170> little

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
because I'm standing on this little

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.139 
because I'm standing on this little
mountain<00:02:04.619> up<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.759> cool<00:02:06.090> because

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
mountain up here but it's cool because

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.210 
mountain up here but it's cool because
you<00:02:06.659> get<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> different<00:02:06.899> perspective<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.890> I

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you get a different perspective and I

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.440 
you get a different perspective and I
like<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.550> because<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.849> get<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.149> anywhere

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
like it because you get to go anywhere

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.510 
like it because you get to go anywhere
really<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> map<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.319> want<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.770> I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
really on the map that you want to and I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.400 
really on the map that you want to and I
think<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:12.060> might<00:02:12.270> want<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.480> go<00:02:12.599> over<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.110> so

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
think I might want to go over to this so

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.670 
think I might want to go over to this so
let

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
let

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.330 
let
transform<00:02:14.579> one<00:02:14.849> more<00:02:15.030> time<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:16.530> now<00:02:16.980> let's<00:02:17.189> go

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
transform one more time and now let's go

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.920 
transform one more time and now let's go
over<00:02:17.549> here<00:02:17.640> let's<00:02:17.819> click<00:02:17.939> on<00:02:18.090> my<00:02:18.180> guy<00:02:18.329> let's<00:02:18.750> go

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
over here let's click on my guy let's go

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.750 
over here let's click on my guy let's go
up<00:02:19.170> there<00:02:20.900> disable<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.430> now<00:02:23.430> I'm<00:02:23.549> up<00:02:23.670> in

up there disable that and now I'm up in

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.460 
up there disable that and now I'm up in
the<00:02:23.879> top<00:02:24.090> like<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.659> I'm<00:02:24.870> all<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.290> way<00:02:25.319> up

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
the top like of that I'm all the way up

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.690 
the top like of that I'm all the way up
in<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.680> sky<00:02:25.709> all<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.159> way<00:02:26.370> up<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
island I've done it in almost every

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.089 
island I've done it in almost every
single<00:02:33.510> location<00:02:34.079> you<00:02:34.170> can<00:02:34.319> do<00:02:34.409> it<00:02:34.530> inside<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
single location you can do it inside the

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.009 
single location you can do it inside the
buildings<00:02:35.549> you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.209> do<00:02:36.299> it<00:02:36.420> outside<00:02:36.599> you<00:02:36.930> can

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
buildings you can do it outside you can

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.110 
buildings you can do it outside you can
do<00:02:37.109> whatever<00:02:37.260> now<00:02:38.010> what<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> wanted<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.730> try<00:02:38.939> was
