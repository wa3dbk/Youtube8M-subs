00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.980
 total this time I will have the video of 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.060
 how the process is done to activate 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.660
 a galaxy sprint s 3 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.760
 cdm 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.930
 I need to postpone it since I put it in new 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.810
 of 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.640
 beach I will continue 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.430
 As it's been a little bit too long, I'll try to 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.430
 served as short as possible 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.430
 he came back 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.140
 I have deployed as a team even waiting 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.140
 that the restart without errors 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.590
 appear all right 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.329
 as you will see it started perfectly well in 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.940
 this moment there was a call which 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.199
 will give you pure worried tone since 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.960
 is not programmed and does not have the 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:57.410
 plastic configuration of mexico 44 23 24 48 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.400
 63 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.880
 we call and 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.590
 let's call it finalized it does not let 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:11.399
 enter absolutely nothing 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.399
 we go back 44 23 24 48 63 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.649
 and in this case they are busy ok 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.649
 we finalize 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.140
 we continue to be able to program the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.660
 phone need to put what we 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.430
 have a body with the computer by 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.690
 what we are going to have to mark 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:39.930
 on the cat cat phone 34-24 ogando y 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.930
 let's choose the model cdm option 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.950
 we enter options which concept and 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:51.500
 we chose the atv memo option 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.420
 and we give ok we go out 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.420
 we connect our usb cable 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.350
 and Czech on computer home panel of the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.220
 control adware systems announcing 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.540
 dispositives 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.730
 the Czech harbor with the most generated in 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.190
 this case generated me the samsung usb by 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.650
 number 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.370
 back because I will take care of 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.010
 the humans 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:32.030
 I already have the number 5 programmed and the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.310
 number 1000 to what proceeds is to write 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.950
 the parameters 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.739
 that set for the configuration 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.160
 they do has been the program with 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.740
 we reboot the team 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.570
 It starts automatically and returns 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.790
 again to steal that is already 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.970
 linking to calls even if you no longer have 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.970
 something 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.320
 already restart our phone we proceed 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.060
 to corroborate that you already have extreme if 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.580
 is very active I'm going to say the ones that do not 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.080
 we have enough balance to 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.080
 make our call 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.760
 correct but I do not know why I do not know 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:29.250
 saw so we're going to try again 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.250
 44 23 24 48 63 we mark loudspeaker 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.420
 for what 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.890
 morning
