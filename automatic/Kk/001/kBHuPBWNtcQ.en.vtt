buttons and right here unlike the
previous<00:01:40.030> um<00:01:40.619> g3<00:01:41.619> gimbal<00:01:42.429> this<00:01:43.420> now<00:01:43.780> they

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
previous um g3 gimbal this now they

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.820 
previous um g3 gimbal this now they
implemented<00:01:44.709> the<00:01:45.039> new<00:01:45.069> thumb<00:01:46.000> screw<00:01:46.649> which<00:01:47.649> is

implemented the new thumb screw which is
pretty<00:01:48.039> nice<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.610> convenient<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:51.280> let's<00:01:51.520> put

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
pretty nice and convenient so let's put

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.390 
pretty nice and convenient so let's put
a<00:01:52.149> day

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.420 

doesn't<00:02:00.120> have<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.440> really<00:02:01.440> tight<00:02:01.800> but<00:02:02.400> uh

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
doesn't have to be really tight but uh

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.120 
doesn't have to be really tight but uh
that<00:02:03.420> would<00:02:03.540> do<00:02:03.830> and<00:02:04.830> hang<00:02:05.550> on<00:02:05.700> let<00:02:05.880> me<00:02:05.910> put<00:02:07.130> the

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
that would do and hang on let me put the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.300 
that would do and hang on let me put the
batteries<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:08.520> oh<00:02:12.560> by<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.590> way<00:02:13.710> it's<00:02:14.040> only

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
batteries in oh by the way it's only

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.650 
batteries in oh by the way it's only
take<00:02:14.550> three<00:02:15.060> battery<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:17.480> thought<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.630> would

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
take three battery so I thought it would

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.160 
take three battery so I thought it would
take<00:02:18.960> four<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.680> only<00:02:19.830> need<00:02:20.070> three<00:02:20.570> and

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:34.050 

let<00:02:25.170> me<00:02:25.350> turn<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:27.350> quickly<00:02:28.850> power<00:02:29.850> on

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.199 

give<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.840> few<00:02:34.870> seconds<00:02:35.500> for<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.849> system<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
give it a few seconds for the system to

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:47.610 
give it a few seconds for the system to
initialize<00:02:40.530> there<00:02:41.530> we<00:02:41.590> go<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.470> a

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
initialize there we go so this is a

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.040 
initialize there we go so this is a
photo<00:02:48.160> mode<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:52.000> when<00:02:52.120> you<00:02:52.239> pan<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.750> follow

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
photo mode so when you pan to follow

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.229 
photo mode so when you pan to follow
left<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.560> right<00:02:56.550> notice<00:02:57.550> when<00:02:57.970> you're<00:02:58.120> on

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
left and right notice when you're on

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.740 
left and right notice when you're on
mode<00:02:58.480> 1<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:59.050> only<00:02:59.200> one<00:02:59.620> flash<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:01.420> is

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
mode 1 it's only one flash and this is

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.820 
mode 1 it's only one flash and this is
the<00:03:02.550> battery<00:03:03.550> indicator<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:05.290> tell<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.680> how

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
the battery indicator so tell you how

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.020 
the battery indicator so tell you how
much<00:03:05.980> battery<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.549> have<00:03:06.580> left<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.790> let<00:03:09.940> me

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
much battery you have left so let me

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.420 
much battery you have left so let me
switch<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.630> mode<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.290> 12<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:14.410> now<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.709> had<00:03:14.830> two

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
switch to mode to 12 so now it had two

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.720 
switch to mode to 12 so now it had two
flashes<00:03:17.459> motu<00:03:18.459> it's<00:03:18.940> for<00:03:19.299> tilt<00:03:20.250> up<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.519> down

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
flashes motu it's for tilt up and down

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.350 
flashes motu it's for tilt up and down
to<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.750> up<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.049> down<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:24.220> also<00:03:24.790> has<00:03:24.940> follow

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
to it up and down and it also has follow

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.430 
to it up and down and it also has follow
modes<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.950> for<00:03:26.950> mode<00:03:27.130> 3<00:03:27.430> it's<00:03:27.880> some<00:03:28.440> silicon

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
modes and for mode 3 it's some silicon

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.670 
modes and for mode 3 it's some silicon
so<00:03:29.709> it<00:03:29.860> will<00:03:30.280> not<00:03:30.549> move<00:03:30.849> at<00:03:31.150> all<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.650> let<00:03:32.650> me

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
so it will not move at all like let me

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.130 
so it will not move at all like let me
go<00:03:32.950> for<00:03:33.370> lock<00:03:33.519> on<00:03:35.880> there<00:03:36.880> we<00:03:36.970> go<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:37.780> mostly

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
go for lock on there we go so mostly

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.160 
go for lock on there we go so mostly
it's<00:03:38.380> solid<00:03:38.980> light<00:03:39.780> doesn't<00:03:40.780> matter<00:03:40.989> where

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
it's solid light doesn't matter where

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.270 
it's solid light doesn't matter where
you<00:03:41.380> move<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.870> gimbal<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.799> camera<00:03:45.130> will

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
you move the gimbal the camera will

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.479 
you move the gimbal the camera will
state<00:03:45.930> facing<00:03:46.930> forward<00:03:47.850> there<00:03:48.850> we<00:03:49.000> go<00:03:50.459> let<00:03:51.459> me

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
state facing forward there we go let me
