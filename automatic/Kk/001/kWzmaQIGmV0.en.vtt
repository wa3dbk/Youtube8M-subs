00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.760
 girls, how are you guys doing ? 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.190
 with another recipe and this time I'm going to 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.389
 make a rice with longaniza so the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.420
 following necessary to do 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.170
 longaniza this is from organists of 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.790
 village with gut we go to the typical 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.590
 always sausage garlic coloring 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:29.070
 rice onion I will use this from the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.689
 fallera and pea so nothing we're going to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 Start by chopping what is the onion and 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.550
 the garlic and we started to fry it 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.950
 in the oil pan in the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.140
 background not much either and I'm going to add 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.730
 over here I have what is the onion 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.730
 chopped and chopped garlic 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.270
 good 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.970
 let's pray a little 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.690
 we come back like this in the background we put a 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.690
 little salt 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.880
 and while it is rolling what is the 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.310
 frying I will grow what they are 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.740
 the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.730
 the longanizas in four others by 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.220
 example like that would be 1 2 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.840
 and 4 because it's so big I do not like it that way 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.320
 that in four pieces more or less so 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.320
 I'm going to them, it's a little golden 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.770
 and I'm going to add the sausages that 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.800
 previously they cut the pieces that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.360
 he told the humanist 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.320
 here it is also called sausage 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.320
 barbecue and others 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.230
 low 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.740
 let's take it a little bit together with the 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.740
 onion 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.560
 so that it releases the fat a little 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.560
 beginning 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.799
 there is the one minute thing 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:24.890
 pick up the typical little color this white 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.890
 and we will add rice and water 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.310
 I did not add more salt until rice 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.890
 because the sausage can have can 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.329
 let go out then until the end there 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.329
 do not rectify salt 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.130
 the amount then depends 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.640
 here you go to my payment, I'll call you 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.640
 backwards industry 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.280
 term 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.350
 I would be down 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.350
 Now let's add sugar 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.820
 one 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.580
 let's play the 5 liters of 9 and the 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.140
 second glass of rice 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.140
 and now we are going to add 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.420
 5 glasses of water 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.900
 above 4 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.900
 Y 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:51.990
 5 although typically the law or the law 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.880
 as you want to say for each one because 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.530
 I make a bold step because it happened 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.410
 of rostrÃ­o and two glasses of water but I 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.630
 I have always done for example if it is a 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.640
 glass of rice in fact two and a half yes 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.150
 Two oak steps and made four 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.350
 medium 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:14.390
 415 would be half of each would be five 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.390
 so that the thing is more loose 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.750
 we mix everything 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.740
 if not then they throw him 4 but I just say 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.740
 that is more loose 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.090
 now we are going to add the coloring 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.200
 The truth is that it is a recipe 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.180
 easy to do and fast because as well 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.850
 they saw at the beginning it was more than what 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.889
 you will hear garlic onion a little 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.690
 then one minute nothing else is left sausage 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.570
 and already add the rice and now leave it 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.570
 do I now I'm going to leave 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.639
 Well my vitro since 9 I will not leave 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.099
 the 5 better that the food take a 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.590
 little pages but what that after 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.659
 final we stopped the food of the 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.970
 Mom, now it's worth to upload it to the number that 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.440
 the food becomes very fast then 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.879
 slowly and with good lyrics for good 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.379
 is ready now let's add what 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:35.470
 which are in the end because these peas 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:37.479
 where he had it are listed and we're going to 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.909
 solve everything there will give you a 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.889
 little bit of salt that I've tried and 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.969
 there was no salt 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.969
 So nothing 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.180
 and we mix everything 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.810
 we turn off the micro that with the heat that 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.810
 remains in the vitro is already finished 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.289
 and good if they do it because they let me 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.039
 know I do not know by comment a picture of 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.039
 anything 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.540
 ah 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.360
 Well, it's ready 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.820
 and I hope you like it 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.040
 in practice if they already tell me in a 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.850
 comment a little kiss and see you in the 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.850
