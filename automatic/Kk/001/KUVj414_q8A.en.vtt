 part of the harvest that in the settlement is mechanized 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.640
 but what lies behind 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.070
 is withdrawn by the workers themselves 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.449
 which use the leftovers as seeds for the next planting to look at most 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.709
 this scene that they are taking where it foresaw does not 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.959
 is that one day I go home and in which if I finish carefully take more 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:31.669
