should have available soon so what do we
have<00:00:11.190> here<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.700> vilest<00:00:12.090> charger<00:00:12.719> as<00:00:12.870> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
have here is the vilest charger as a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.200 
have here is the vilest charger as a
showcase<00:00:13.230> as<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> prototype<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.940> problem

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
showcase as a prototype the problem

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.760 
showcase as a prototype the problem
nowadays<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.020> smartphones<00:00:16.529> that

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
nowadays is that the smartphones that

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.910 
nowadays is that the smartphones that
they<00:00:17.340> run<00:00:17.699> out<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.880> power<00:00:18.210> too<00:00:19.199> soon<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.710> we

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
they run out of power too soon and we

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.800 
they run out of power too soon and we
want<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.250> use<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.880> time<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.270> example<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
want to use the time for example in the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.620 
want to use the time for example in the
car<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.529> recharge<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> batteries<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.730> use<00:00:24.420> it

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
car to recharge the batteries to use it

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.269 
car to recharge the batteries to use it
whenever<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.109> need<00:00:25.380> it

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
whenever we need it

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.670 
whenever we need it
nowadays<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.480> cheap<00:00:28.019> wires<00:00:28.439> we

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
nowadays we do this with cheap wires we

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.080 
nowadays we do this with cheap wires we
buy<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.490> connect<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.000> it's

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
buy and we have to connect and it's

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.870 
buy and we have to connect and it's
quite<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> hassle<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.769> showcase<00:00:32.669> here

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
quite a hassle so the showcase here

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580 
quite a hassle so the showcase here
shows<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.690> would<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:33.989> easily<00:00:34.410> possible

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
shows that it would be easily possible

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.910 
shows that it would be easily possible
to<00:00:34.920> just<00:00:35.130> place<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> phone<00:00:36.500> there<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
to just place a phone there in the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.630 
to just place a phone there in the
charger<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:39.210> gets<00:00:40.020> by<00:00:40.640> magnetic

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
charger and it gets by magnetic

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.150 
charger and it gets by magnetic
resonance<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.480> power<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.079> charges<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
resonance the power and charges the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.250 
resonance the power and charges the
phone<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.270> see<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> works

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
phone but you can see here that it works

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.090 
phone but you can see here that it works
we<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> feedback<00:00:48.530> done<00:00:49.530> over<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
we have the feedback done over the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.209 
we have the feedback done over the
blinking<00:00:50.940> LED<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.110> also<00:00:52.379> shows<00:00:52.620> here<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
blinking LED and it also shows here and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.700 
blinking LED and it also shows here and
the<00:00:53.539> charging<00:00:54.539> battery<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.530> getting

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the charging battery and is getting

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.099 
the charging battery and is getting
recharged<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.699> doesn't<00:00:57.030> matter<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.719> place

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
recharged it doesn't matter if you place

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.380 
recharged it doesn't matter if you place
it<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.440> way<00:00:58.710> or<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.129> other<00:00:59.160> way<00:00:59.489> around<00:00:59.520> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
it this way or the other way around it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.650 
it this way or the other way around it
even<00:01:00.809> wouldn't<00:01:01.079> matter<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.829> place<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.660> 90

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
even wouldn't matter if you place it 90

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.240 
even wouldn't matter if you place it 90
degrees<00:01:03.690> angle<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.589> don't<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
degrees angle but we don't have the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.080 
degrees angle but we don't have the
space<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.519> our<00:01:06.770> center<00:01:07.770> console<00:01:08.159> here<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
space in our center console here and the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.990 
space in our center console here and the
nice<00:01:09.360> thing<00:01:09.750> about<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:10.950> well<00:01:11.280> that

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
nice thing about that is as well that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
nice thing about that is as well that
you<00:01:12.360> could<00:01:12.570> place<00:01:12.900> whatever<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
you could place whatever you have and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.950 
you could place whatever you have and
keys<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.790> other<00:01:15.950> metal<00:01:16.950> parts<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.689> well

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
keys or other metal parts there as well

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.990 
keys or other metal parts there as well
or<00:01:19.170> nearby<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.250> wouldn't<00:01:20.520> wouldn't

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
or nearby and it wouldn't wouldn't

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060 
or nearby and it wouldn't wouldn't
matter<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.360> much<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.140> maybe<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.590> efficiency

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
matter that much so maybe the efficiency

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.010 
matter that much so maybe the efficiency
goes<00:01:23.189> down<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.430> little<00:01:23.580> bit<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.360> would

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
goes down a little bit but it would

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.140 
goes down a little bit but it would
still<00:01:25.140> charge<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.460> other<00:01:26.610> thing<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.030> if

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
still charge and the other thing is if

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.670 
still charge and the other thing is if
you<00:01:27.270> place<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.810> are<00:01:27.930> used<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.320> place<00:01:28.530> your

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
you place if you are used to place your

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.960 
you place if you are used to place your
wallet<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.400> credit<00:01:29.670> cards<00:01:29.909> or

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
wallet with all your credit cards or

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.300 
wallet with all your credit cards or
whatever<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.720> there<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.799> won't<00:01:32.130> be

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
whatever you have in there they won't be

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.840 
whatever you have in there they won't be
destroyed

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
destroyed

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.580 
destroyed
let's<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.509> assuming<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> metal

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
let's see it so assuming the metal

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.890 
let's see it so assuming the metal
contacts<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> back<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.909> how<00:01:36.030> how<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.659> was

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
contacts on the back and how how it was

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.210 
contacts on the back and how how it was
it's<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> thing<00:01:37.560> actually<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.130> no

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
it's the thing actually there is no

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.210 
it's the thing actually there is no
metal<00:01:38.460> contact<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.920> technology<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.070> use

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
metal contact so the technology we use

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.240 
metal contact so the technology we use
here<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.610> done<00:01:42.150> by<00:01:42.390> Qualcomm<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.229> white<00:01:44.009> power

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
here is done by Qualcomm and white power

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.749 
here is done by Qualcomm and white power
which<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> company<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.810> Qualcomm<00:01:46.020> the

shell<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.790> an

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
shell and we have an

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.800 
shell and we have an
sending<00:01:52.530> antenna<00:01:52.950> underneath<00:01:53.760> here<00:01:54.150> so<00:01:54.630> it's

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
sending antenna underneath here so it's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.070 
sending antenna underneath here so it's
sending<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> power<00:01:55.410> in<00:01:55.800> approximately<00:01:56.670> this

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
sending the power in approximately this

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.560 
sending the power in approximately this
there<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.370> you<00:01:59.370> just<00:01:59.400> have<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.000> place<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.270> so

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
there and you just have to place it so

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.180 
there and you just have to place it so
no<00:02:00.750> contacts<00:02:01.260> are<00:02:01.380> necessary<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
no contacts are necessary and the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.040 
no contacts are necessary and the
gentleman<00:02:02.640> before<00:02:02.910> we<00:02:03.150> show<00:02:03.330> me<00:02:03.480> the<00:02:03.600> contacts

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
gentleman before we show me the contacts

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.150 
gentleman before we show me the contacts
inside<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:04.740> bone<00:02:05.640> case<00:02:06.000> yeah<00:02:06.620> so<00:02:07.620> this<00:02:07.860> phone

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
inside the bone case yeah so this phone

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.540 
inside the bone case yeah so this phone
is<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.840> shell<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.160> filled<00:02:11.400> up<00:02:11.460> like

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
is this shell is just filled up like

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.390 
is this shell is just filled up like
that<00:02:11.820> that<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.450> using<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.260> external<00:02:13.950> context

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
that that is using the external context

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400 
that that is using the external context
this<00:02:14.880> blackberry<00:02:15.300> has<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:16.020> easier<00:02:16.380> to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
this blackberry has so it's easier to

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.100 
this blackberry has so it's easier to
build<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.160> shell<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.730> as<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.940> prototype<00:02:18.510> so

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
build the shell for it as a prototype so

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.040 
build the shell for it as a prototype so
it<00:02:19.200> has<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.500> contacts<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.810> shell

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
it has the contacts here and the shell

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.860 
it has the contacts here and the shell
is<00:02:22.290> using<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.830> very<00:02:23.040> same<00:02:23.130> context<00:02:23.870> other

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
is using the very same context other

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.530 
is using the very same context other
than<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.200> we<00:02:25.350> could<00:02:25.560> use<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:26.040> normal

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
than that we could use the normal

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.220 
than that we could use the normal
contact<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.690> charger<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:29.210> charger<00:02:30.230> device

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
contact the charger to charger device

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.380 
contact the charger to charger device
over<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.800> example<00:02:32.010> USB<00:02:32.490> or<00:02:32.640> whatever<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
over it for example USB or whatever and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.660 
over it for example USB or whatever and
the<00:02:34.200> plan<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.910> comes<00:02:36.540> into<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
the plan is that this comes into the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.520 
the plan is that this comes into the
cell<00:02:38.670> phone<00:02:38.910> chipsets<00:02:39.330> meaning<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.170> will<00:02:40.380> be

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
cell phone chipsets meaning it will be

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.560 
cell phone chipsets meaning it will be
integrated<00:02:41.070> into<00:02:41.220> smartphones<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:42.270> won't

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
integrated into smartphones so you won't

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.630 
integrated into smartphones so you won't
have<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> shell<00:02:43.440> anymore<00:02:43.890> but<00:02:44.520> you

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
have to have a shell anymore but you

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.520 
have to have a shell anymore but you
could<00:02:44.880> use<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.840> smartphone<00:02:46.110> like<00:02:46.350> that

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
could use just a smartphone like that

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.740 
could use just a smartphone like that
currently<00:02:47.310> there<00:02:47.970> are<00:02:48.000> no<00:02:48.180> phones<00:02:48.390> like<00:02:48.600> that

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
currently there are no phones like that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.240 
currently there are no phones like that
out<00:02:48.870> there<00:02:49.080> in<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.260> market<00:02:49.820> Thank<00:02:50.820> You<00:02:50.910> Markus
