 we take a positive balance sheet in ten years' time 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.250
 how do you think you're going to count on people 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.509

 with much joy celebrating partying we passed by 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.820
 difficult moments but 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.470
 in ten years until people will understand enough why it will already have 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.400
 have been through this situation many times of celebration 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.690
 of joy of celebrating several important titles then everyone 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.830
 will understand and will be the beginning I have called this virtuous circle of the 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.990
 athletic who would return to mean back at that time 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.789
 means 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.469
 financially also with a good business that increases his 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:13.010
 right of transmission 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.150
 back to have more prestige also at national level

 partners to invest in the athletic so it's all good and go to Minasirão 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.730
 nor that crowded mineirão shaken at the time of the goal and even without a goal how 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.840
 Is this this vibration? 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.170
 It's just up to the air in our skin to realize why it's difficult to 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.170
 to transmit 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.630
 every feeling every positive feeling every emotion that we feel 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.840
 it's gratifying to see the crowd cheering on that satisfaction in that 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.030
 joy and have to party even is an important title pro athletic people 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.500
 does not want it to repeat itself but it is an important milestone in

 Athletic a team is a title that the CBF even values ​​a lot then it was a 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.209
 indescribable feeling was there with my family who enjoyed it a lot 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.389
 We stepped on the lawn of the mineirão we watched the crowd sing to watch the sun 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.409
 was perhaps the most beautiful party that Brazilian soccer has ever seen here 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.759
 within our country
