00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.039
 Union so welcome the wildlife Mercier and then YÃ¼cel upper jaw also me 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.470
 am who comes either today we learn how to get the right breeder 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:35.159
 fought back today is again wonderful Martina's love and 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:39.079
 admire and always bump Schiersch must children in front of locked Martin 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.060
 Velits all topics 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.770
 what is that nice animal 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.019
 Oh, you are pretty 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.600
 Yes 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.940
 that is of course Mercedes is doing 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.400
 al-Omary 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.289
 pretty great and big mistake 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.589
 which brings with two first question how do I know about a German domain billion 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.380
 the right journey is for me 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.410
 First, they must decide which race suits their lifestyle 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.619
 does not know if they are home or not at work often 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.709
 on it can come over point there is a grandiose dating agency 

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:16.769
 if you can call it that there you will find the eternal ones just for you 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.210
 and how does that work? May ask them questions about theirs 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.950
 Personality is unbelievably 29 points but I'm not quite 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.150
 Of course I know all the questions I would like to answer 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.900
 There are questions about the environment in which they put life and then all the data 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.390
 put together to find the right fund for you 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.070
 as far as I know what I need I search in the right one 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.480
 Table of the and the Wars 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.930
 It's not that easy, unfortunately, not all are known 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.329
 Breeders alike they have to look for the right breeders 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.960
 he usually has an excellent condition he has healthy dogs and that is 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.219
 important of course yes and I think it Abbas also a passion for 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.349
 this breed he really believes in that or the castle again 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.859
 An absolute something with passion makes and strives for only the best 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.049
 to be exactly right as well as before in the plant should pay attention 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.499
 if you look at the test by the constraints, look for clean 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.360
 Not only shows in museums but also smell 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.700
 They have to be very clean and tidy and they feel that the dogs are good 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.050
 be treated if you take good care of them this still brought up 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.930
 good databases or facts about the round the breeding of Hunte in her 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.419
 Prehistory and her background are important to her 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.869
 the criminal records more who has them well so you will probably know 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.590
 Safest something about the lineage weaknesses 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.029
 true exactly April are always looking for 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.739
 When looking for working hours, look for customers who have already done this job 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.969
 if you have something to confirm that you can show around 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.589
 then they also look for something like this forever the kennels have seen and they me 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.659
 liked similar questions so ran the breeders 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:58.659
 I think 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.310
 My first question wagging so cleanly at the dog, why did they turn 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.529
 decided to breed German mastiffs or why they wanted to vouch 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.739
 Warriors breed light flashes logically they learn something about his 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.790
 Attitude and how should a good answer be any answer of the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.309
 Breeder who sounds like minority and love of the race No you want 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.480
 Feel that he really believes in what he does when you do it 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.479
 a trusted professional has to do 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:27.099
 and what would be the wrong reasons to become a breeder you will notice 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.169
 whether it is the breeders only about the money whether it is only about economic gain 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.959
 to be careful, if that's the case, he likes to go 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.160
 more comfortable way to go on stage 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.269
 namely children there are such breeders but we are interested in the love of the cash register 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.669
 whether he would ever pay attention to what is here today about the health of 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:47.889
 difficult questions 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:48.779
 these days 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.360
 we can all and have physical weaknesses 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.190
 all the puppies they should buy from a breeder two in the 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.960
 Club home and have been dewormed two in football and in the storm 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.960
 you Manning I think so 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.010
 I want the world and the seven and a half 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.069
 8 weeks are 8 weeks 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.059
 just because theater why that 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:14.499
 because she already spent time with her siblings and her mother 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:18.609
 and of which he was already educated but above all they became 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.740
 socializes the socialization also starts with the grower 8 weeks are on 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.300
 or Schlotter at least Oliver Voss forgot yes I have the before 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.780
 Parents of the puppy mentioned 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.760
 maybe I have not stressed clearly enough that her dog once 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.800
 As well as that, normally, nothing should go for it 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.710
 have to be proud of showing parents 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.660
 but if she does not show them either the parents or their health 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.610
 that could have suggested to me a healthy parent healthy puppy 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.540
 Exactly usually no in which the mother show while the 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.639
 should be clear sometimes the driver was far away and now has to cover 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.039
 so ask the breeders about the personality of the older ones 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.910
 when they are there, they can picture themselves, but they should 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.900
 Clue from the prehistory of the personalities the character of the 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.170
 Have parents and especially if they are aggressive I would be fine 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.690
 think 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.300
 so incredibly her puppy wants to thank her on the 18th 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.900
 Baby her knowledge and her tenderness Year 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.470
 I can not thank you enough for a visit to us shares was one 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.409
 pleasure 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.939
 okay we declared our country of five stars by Google can Huber the 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:24.740
 Finding the right one to start 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.980
 First of all, before you start looking for a breeder you will find it 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.750
 out which breed you want 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.240
 Coming to Colombo point helps them 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.110
 second, pay close attention to a clean and orderly record 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.249
 About the breeding prehistory leads all dogs 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:42.419
 Congratulations the right breeder tenant a profession with passion 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.939
 and ran his work 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:49.330
 HP is going through the worlds should have two in the foot clean and be dewormed as well 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
 they should be at least 8 weeks old and virtualized 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:57.610
 fifth, a respected breeder likes to enjoy the health of the parents 

00:05:57.609 --> 00:06:00.759
 before and informed about their predictions will not hold well 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.040
 Great extra one until next time at the Ritschel World Mercier and 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.910
 on her account after TV Precht tiptop
