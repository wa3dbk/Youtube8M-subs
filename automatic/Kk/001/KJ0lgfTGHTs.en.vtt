00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.410
 and we take advantage of this space in the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.200
 transfer regime for 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.560
 present them officially and here in 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.009
 mexico to our new technical director 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.480
 the gentleman gustavo matosas that 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.340
 incorporates from now on the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.030
 organization 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.880
 I am convinced that gustavo is a 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.060
 technician who gathers the profile that atlas 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060
 needs to 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.500
 in the philosophy of the atlas goes beyond 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 win 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.120
 it's about respecting a style of play 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.960
 that all life has had the atlas 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.329
 contracara liked it 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.969
 it was the opinion of the people 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.550
 through social networks through 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.600
 of a survey that we had out there 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.600
 the day 17 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.659
 we feel that the skin matches what it is 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.850
 the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.520
 the coach and ideal technical director 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.440
 for our team 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.540
 so waiting 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.620
 that supports us because it is a no team 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.620
 who needs a lot of support 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.050
 we continue giving what deserves to be 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.720
 hobby the noble one we call the 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.760
 skin 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.660
 and then I have nothing left to say 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.660
 that welcome 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.740
 I believe that the requirement has to be 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.170
 always high 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.240
 but also that is 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.619
 one when he talks about winning first has 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.080
 What to talk about the road you are going to cover 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.720
 What kind of road are you going to go? 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.929
 save kickback to the long ball in 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.480
 the position of the ball 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.939
 so if you put together what you do 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.650
 like if what you like me and the 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:21.159
 players apply it on the court 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.230
 surely we are going to enjoy everything I 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.700
 like exactly the same 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.370
 I would like same as well that I have the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.890
 ball that until many times 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.019
 in rival plays but the central idea 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.549
 it has to be done the responsibility 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.590
 What I have is to make a stone 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.840
 to the team behind and we have some players 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.489
 is close to win and you have quality 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.400
 hierarchy and personality 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.650
 we're in the try this team team 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.690
 that has good players yes 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.690
 what seduced me was 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.370
 was the number of dynamic players 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.130
 that has back the speed it has and 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.020
 especially after 78 hours that 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.530
 we chat with him and berto 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.870
 the intention to reinforce the team 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.310
 and know the deficiencies that there were and which 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.490
 are the fundamental points for 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.830
 reinforce I take care of the zero I do not want 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.420
 make a goal more than the opponent that's what 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.790
 that I think that what the players 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.819
 they enjoy what I enjoy and 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.410
 style is the one that swore to get to a 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.930
 team has to internalize a little 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.470
 of history is not an atlas phrase 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.290
 which I think speaks a lot about winning at 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.150
 back that time until the last moment 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.700
 until the last second fighting playing 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.920
 well since one has to stick a 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.480
 little to the history of each club know 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.459
 what do people like at 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.140
 throughout history and that adapt it to 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.790
 modern times it travels not because 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.160
 the story is obviously changing 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.530
 now there is time to work and that 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.870
 for me it is very important to know the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.650
 players who do not know them now 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.720
 and understanding the identity of a city 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.940
 I think that's the first thing because 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.190
 talk about 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.110
 to win without shares is complicated 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.990
 first to start training that the 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.330
 player 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.280
 I arrived physically well to learn 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.690
 suffer in training in the 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.930
 equipment in mexico you have to spend the 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.180
 money from the middle to forward 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.620
 knowing that for example this meat hand 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.780
 here on the computer that there are others 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.180
 important in all black medina 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.990
 so the idea is to spend 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.210
 ahead 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.190
 dalí is not a challenge 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.410
 to me in these things keep me alive and 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.759
 keeps undertaken that are the kind of 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.460
 challenges that I like because if maybe 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.300
 you go to a team that always comes out champion 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.509
 and that he has to keep coming champion 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.400
 but this this size is coming out is 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:49.400
 a challenge that I just want to catch your atlas 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.919
 you have to reinforce it you have to start 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.660
 work you have to adapt quickly to the 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.680
 I am very excited to get to 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.520
 the city ​​that is a city that I like 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.800
 so much so let the first thing 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.350
 first and what has already happened is trodden 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.030
 everything is going to leave everything all everything until the 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.030
 last drop of blood that is needed
