00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.960
 hey people if you are here 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:15.990
 today is day 2 1 and to the training and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:18.330
 Today legs and hey people are today 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.600
 second part of the training course and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:27.210
 today, the focus is on four people 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.500
 exercises this time only but believe me the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.470
 have it in ourselves we start with 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.340
 Squats one of the best exercises for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.200
 the legs for the quadriceps so the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.370
 big muscle on the thigh and front 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:47.030
 suppress the blood from the muscle of the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.700
 at the bz are also very well used 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.940
 You do not see the feet here 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.160
 are positioned in their shoulder width 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.020
 the tips of the foot are pointing outwards 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.750
 the knees remain over the feet bank 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.470
 go down so that is not the knee 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:09.110
 brings together like girls while peeing 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:11.690
 the farmers act in the matter and for that 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.430
 Let's listen to four sentences 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.900
 Repeat range up to 20 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.560
 repetitions and then it goes 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.510
 a break in the deadlift that is 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.330
 Knee-bending is one of the best more 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.120
 joint exercises that everyone should do 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.500
 The one in a position is definitely 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.080
 that a super exercise for the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.030
 mass building for the broad strong 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.100
 back of strong neck 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.650
 it works very well as legs and 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.350
 the lower back really back 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.890
 just do not let it round 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.410
 pay close attention here as well 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.630
 press forward and bend 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:53.600
 in the trade not forward and backward 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.490
 Let's just keep the eyes low 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.090
 city ​​as possible on the legs of a small book 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.860
 and we make three sets of them 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.900
 Here's the military press or 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.550
 press stationary front that they here at 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.440
 not too much weight starts with art 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.620
 ethereal first on it the weight 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.300
 nice to control clean press 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.700
 especially the backs as possible 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.690
 just keep it up so that we have one now 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.680
 few repetitions happen quickly 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.269
 that you make a passenger red cross around 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.510
 the last few repetitions up there too 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.790
 note and that goes pretty well on the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.290
 shoulder muscles because the front 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.989
 shoulder muscles and the triceps 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.879
 of course, rendering 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.170
 which make the two sets and then 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.980
 is it synonymous to the last exercise 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.910
 the dumbbells row that exercise 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.830
 for the back the latin must be in addition 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.680
 also for the neck, of course 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.030
 the trapezium of the bz works of course 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.670
 busy with here and we do it 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.610
 use for a poor and more direct 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.220
 connecting the sentence for the other poor 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.410
 girl weight with whom he got ten 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:10.130
 to a maximum of twelve repetitions creates 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:13.349
 keep at least 88 elevated straight 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.260
 and just really nice with the country 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.569
 pull 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.360
 and if it wonders why banker 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.250
 There is no sound in itself 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.239
 vacation 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.400
 we have the video before the holiday 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.489
 quickly absorbed all the exercises and the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.860
 are three parts 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.709
 if you fall in case you have the video 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.639
 here I am probably already 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.810
 I'm probably already on the way 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.760
 back and that was just two of them 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.019
 sentences of it 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.730
 that means i really like many exercises 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.780
 said the volume will be freaks 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.519
 maybe a bit skeptical rainer 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.019
 Bahr I invite you to try this 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.880
 get caught off the picture so you at least 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.400
 eight to a maximum of twelve repetitions 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.220
 sharp as I said in squats allowed 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.079
 it also likes to be more 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.860
 So give us a try 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.600
 feedback in the comments 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.340
 that's what I'm training for 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.680
 Hope that helped if it was you 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.460
 liked to comment on licon 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.460
 Until next time
