00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.150
 or the two microphones good and I'm 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:09.300
 back and as many of you will know everything counts 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.389
 It's been quite a lot that did not go up 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.340
 no video and for the last time I hope 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.840
 because I do not ask thousands of 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.690
 Sometimes what happened to me was that 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.600
 the minecraft was not going and I had many 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.660
 problems I was giving the rest video card 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.300
 drivers good if you do not know if I made a 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.239
 video about that and a lot of people helped me and 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.730
 but none of the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.870
 solutions that were proposed to me served as 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.530
 nothing and what a couple of days ago 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.489
 install the java jdk and it turns out that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.870
 with that it has worked perfectly for me and 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.970
 I make this little video to teach you 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.660
 especially 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.460
 what 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.040
 I'm going back but now 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.660
 I'm having enough little time and 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.970
 I need a small margin then to 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.710
 prepare the videos and such so of 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.800
 moment I leave you with a little trick that 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.369
 I discovered a lot ago and it's just 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.050
 that when we are from a high place 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.560
 although probably now I do not leave 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.350
 with which I have is that the low fps 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.020
 it's like a few versions when I put 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.020
 when you put a water one like that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.549
 you hurt yourself from fall but now there's 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.009
 for example if you jump and it would not hurt me 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.009
 of fall but now yes that 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.930
 so when it jumps over a block of 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.310
 water you do not hurt yourself therefore if 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.960
 we carry a bucket of water on top of this 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.960
 may well come very well for the pvp 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.470
 well that when jumping you do not know anything about 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.850
 hurt if you get to put it to me as 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.520
 you have noticed the cut because it is 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.680
 simply because recording in this 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.770
 piece of computer chunk well I'm going 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.100
 quite slow and in a much more fall 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.130
 slow but here you see that you can put 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.140
 water like I just did even myself 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.720
 what I do is to piss the click 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.040
 right but you can simply 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.379
 calculate it 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.719
 and well that was the whole video 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.599
 the falls were a little bad because 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:21.700
 I'm going to 15 fps is recording but good 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.069
 I'm sorry now 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.349
 It's not my fault but I also tell you that 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.260
 if you want to try it in creative the best 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.069
 is to have a sign in hand and when 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.959
 let's go 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.790
 try to put it as you have seen here 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.939
 before I fall 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.310
 I have put the poster and that is more comfortable 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.219
 that a bucket of water because mushrooms in your 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.209
 river you end up dying and such and such 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:47.359
 that's all I hope you liked 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.019
 soon you will have more videos and 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.019
 until next time
