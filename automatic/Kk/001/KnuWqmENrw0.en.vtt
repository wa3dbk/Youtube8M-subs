00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:07.279 
stuck a stuck an old speaker that we

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:08.740 
stuck a stuck an old speaker that we
found<00:02:07.459> laying<00:02:07.700> around<00:02:07.850> Tripoli's<00:02:08.390> custom

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
found laying around Tripoli's custom

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.650 
found laying around Tripoli's custom
shop<00:02:09.399> stuck<00:02:10.399> one<00:02:10.610> in<00:02:10.759> there<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.180> was<00:02:11.540> like<00:02:11.630> a

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
shop stuck one in there I was like a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.960 
shop stuck one in there I was like a
screw<00:02:12.170> it

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.110 

this<00:02:18.970> one<00:02:19.380> isn't<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.650> factory<00:02:21.069> speaker<00:02:21.489> but<00:02:22.090> I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
this one isn't the factory speaker but I

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.660 
this one isn't the factory speaker but I
think<00:02:22.390> someone<00:02:22.660> ordered<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:26.670> specifically

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
think someone ordered it specifically

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.010 
think someone ordered it specifically
for<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:28.030> vehicle<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.660> mean<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.900> fits

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
for this vehicle I mean it fits

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.920 
for this vehicle I mean it fits
absolutely<00:02:29.230> perfect<00:02:29.920> fits<00:02:30.099> flush<00:02:30.900> but<00:02:31.900> I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
absolutely perfect fits flush but I

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.600 
absolutely perfect fits flush but I
definitely<00:02:32.230> do<00:02:32.530> not<00:02:32.620> think<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:33.099> a<00:02:33.160> factory

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
definitely do not think it's a factory

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.720 
definitely do not think it's a factory
speaker<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:35.400> because<00:02:36.400> again<00:02:37.110> they<00:02:38.110> are<00:02:38.730> they
