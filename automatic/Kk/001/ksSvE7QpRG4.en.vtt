yes<00:00:05.650> we<00:00:05.830> have<00:00:05.950> a<00:00:05.980> lot<00:00:06.070> of<00:00:06.190> clients<00:00:06.400> talking

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
yes we have a lot of clients talking

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.850 
yes we have a lot of clients talking
about<00:00:07.270> some<00:00:07.600> of<00:00:07.630> the<00:00:07.779> range<00:00:07.990> of<00:00:08.170> motion<00:00:08.530> on<00:00:08.650> the

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
about some of the range of motion on the

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.850 
about some of the range of motion on the
on<00:00:09.070> the<00:00:09.370> lap<00:00:10.180> lap<00:00:10.600> tail<00:00:10.840> here<00:00:11.139> so<00:00:11.620> if<00:00:11.740> you're

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
on the lap lap tail here so if you're

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.460 
on the lap lap tail here so if you're
six<00:00:12.070> foot<00:00:12.250> plus<00:00:12.840> there<00:00:13.840> are<00:00:13.960> a<00:00:14.019> couple<00:00:14.200> of

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:14.470 
six foot plus there are a couple of

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.440 
six foot plus there are a couple of
strategies<00:00:14.710> that<00:00:15.100> you<00:00:15.190> can<00:00:15.400> use<00:00:15.730> to<00:00:16.270> maximize

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
strategies that you can use to maximize

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.980 
strategies that you can use to maximize
the<00:00:17.110> pull<00:00:17.470> down<00:00:17.680> arm<00:00:18.040> on<00:00:18.340> the<00:00:19.029> multi<00:00:19.810> system

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
the pull down arm on the multi system

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.710 
the pull down arm on the multi system
draw<00:00:20.710> on<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:20.949> leverage<00:00:23.610> so<00:00:24.610> what<00:00:25.420> I'll<00:00:25.539> do<00:00:25.690> is

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
draw on the leverage so what I'll do is

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.700 
draw on the leverage so what I'll do is
what<00:00:26.020> option<00:00:26.470> one<00:00:26.680> is<00:00:26.980> II<00:00:27.279> think<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:29.199> can<00:00:29.440> take

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
what option one is II think you can take

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.619 
what option one is II think you can take
the<00:00:29.949> bench<00:00:30.730> down<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.539> deep<00:00:31.779> quiet<00:00:32.080> position

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
the bench down to a deep quiet position

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.620 
the bench down to a deep quiet position
to<00:00:34.629> put<00:00:34.809> it<00:00:34.900> right<00:00:35.019> down<00:00:35.080> in<00:00:35.350> decline<00:00:35.680> position

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.530 

and<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:41.860> can't<00:00:42.160> increase<00:00:42.550> increase<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.390> range

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
and we can't increase increase the range

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.190 
and we can't increase increase the range
of<00:00:43.750> motion<00:00:45.120> by<00:00:46.120> just<00:00:46.360> doing<00:00:46.450> that<00:00:46.600> there<00:00:46.960> so<00:00:47.110> we

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
of motion by just doing that there so we

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.810 
of motion by just doing that there so we
get<00:00:47.320> a<00:00:47.350> bad<00:00:47.500> mother<00:00:47.680> we've<00:00:48.190> got<00:00:48.309> a<00:00:48.399> half<00:00:48.670> a<00:00:48.790> foot

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
get a bad mother we've got a half a foot

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.240 
get a bad mother we've got a half a foot
and<00:00:49.420> you<00:00:49.809> can<00:00:50.050> get<00:00:50.770> that<00:00:50.890> range<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.190> motion

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
and you can get that range of motion

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.229 
and you can get that range of motion
there

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
there

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.729 
there
okay<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.430> obviously<00:00:55.120> I'm<00:00:55.540> shorter<00:00:56.110> so<00:00:56.289> I've

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
okay so obviously I'm shorter so I've

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.830 
okay so obviously I'm shorter so I've
said<00:00:56.980> it's<00:00:57.129> it's<00:00:57.700> bottoming<00:00:58.239> out<00:00:58.360> before<00:00:58.750> I'm

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
said it's it's bottoming out before I'm

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.119 
said it's it's bottoming out before I'm
getting<00:00:59.320> here<00:00:59.410> but<00:00:59.530> that's<00:00:59.649> what<00:00:59.890> you<00:01:00.010> could

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
getting here but that's what you could

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.529 
getting here but that's what you could
do<00:01:00.309> it<00:01:00.430> to<00:01:00.520> fix<00:01:00.700> it<00:01:00.789> up<00:01:00.850> if<00:01:01.210> you're<00:01:01.390> still

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
do it to fix it up if you're still

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.479 
do it to fix it up if you're still
finding<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.680> if<00:01:02.920> you<00:01:03.039> blow<00:01:03.219> up<00:01:03.340> the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
finding that that if you blow up the

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.219 
finding that that if you blow up the
seat<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.000> when<00:01:04.360> you<00:01:04.420> pull<00:01:04.660> down<00:01:04.690> that<00:01:05.110> you

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
seat and when you pull down that you

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.080 
seat and when you pull down that you
that<00:01:05.649> it's<00:01:05.800> not<00:01:06.160> coming<00:01:06.490> out<00:01:06.700> of<00:01:06.789> your<00:01:06.850> chest

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
that it's not coming out of your chest

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.040 
that it's not coming out of your chest

burner

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.859 
burner
the<00:01:08.649> other<00:01:08.770> option<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.310> can<00:01:09.580> do<00:01:09.789> what<00:01:10.000> it's

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
the other option is you can do what it's

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.320 
the other option is you can do what it's
like<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.050> hybrid<00:01:11.350> pulldown<00:01:12.069> okay<00:01:12.640> we're<00:01:13.240> not

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
like a hybrid pulldown okay we're not

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.830 
like a hybrid pulldown okay we're not
explained<00:01:13.780> that<00:01:15.209> so<00:01:16.209> we<00:01:16.330> do<00:01:16.450> with<00:01:16.569> the<00:01:16.630> hybrid

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
explained that so we do with the hybrid

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.680 
explained that so we do with the hybrid
pulldown<00:01:19.050> is<00:01:20.050> that<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:25.030> have<00:01:25.179> the<00:01:25.300> pressing

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
pulldown is that we have the pressing

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.050 
pulldown is that we have the pressing
arm<00:01:25.869> set<00:01:26.560> on<00:01:26.679> the<00:01:26.740> lowest<00:01:26.890> setting<00:01:29.819> we<00:01:30.819> grab

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
arm set on the lowest setting we grab

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.389 
arm set on the lowest setting we grab
the<00:01:31.209> bar<00:01:31.390> as<00:01:31.990> an<00:01:32.110> unimportant<00:01:32.470> now<00:01:33.009> stenason

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
the bar as an unimportant now stenason

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.059 
the bar as an unimportant now stenason
even<00:01:33.640> closer<00:01:33.849> huh<00:01:34.289> we<00:01:35.289> just<00:01:35.470> place<00:01:35.649> that<00:01:35.679> fleet

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
even closer huh we just place that fleet

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.940 
even closer huh we just place that fleet
up<00:01:36.610> on<00:01:36.849> here<00:01:37.119> okay<00:01:37.690> so<00:01:37.720> we've<00:01:37.959> got<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.110> grip<00:01:38.800> in

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
up on here okay so we've got a grip in

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.480 
up on here okay so we've got a grip in
here<00:01:39.190> okay<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.619> we're<00:01:42.069> bracing<00:01:42.429> ourselves

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
here okay so we're bracing ourselves

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.029 
here okay so we're bracing ourselves
here<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:44.020> then<00:01:44.200> as<00:01:44.349> you<00:01:44.440> can<00:01:44.530> see<00:01:44.590> it's<00:01:44.830> not<00:01:44.920> my

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
here and then as you can see it's not my

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.520 
here and then as you can see it's not my
hybrid<00:01:45.429> it's<00:01:45.580> like<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.789> pull<00:01:46.240> down<00:01:46.539> and<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:47.259> roll

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
hybrid it's like a pull down and a roll

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.960 
hybrid it's like a pull down and a roll
at<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:47.860> same<00:01:47.950> time<00:01:48.399> but<00:01:48.610> you're<00:01:48.700> still<00:01:48.789> going

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
at the same time but you're still going

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.779 
at the same time but you're still going
to<00:01:49.000> get<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.179> effectiveness<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.929> a<00:01:50.020> pull<00:01:50.319> down

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
to get the effectiveness of a pull down

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.889 
to get the effectiveness of a pull down
make<00:01:51.789> sure<00:01:51.819> this<00:01:52.060> one<00:01:52.239> you<00:01:52.300> don't<00:01:52.420> round<00:01:52.660> you

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
make sure this one you don't round you

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.589 
make sure this one you don't round you
back<00:01:53.080> down<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.770> pull<00:01:53.950> him<00:01:54.340> up<00:01:54.489> this<00:01:54.640> okay<00:01:55.179> the

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
back down and pull him up this okay the

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.449 
back down and pull him up this okay the
idea<00:01:55.690> is<00:01:55.989> is<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.170> keep<00:01:56.860> an<00:01:57.009> arching<00:01:57.340> your<00:01:57.369> back

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
idea is is to keep an arching your back

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:03.089 
idea is is to keep an arching your back
chest<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.119> boy<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.780> pull<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.560> in<00:02:02.099> okay

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
chest that boy and pull it in okay

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:04.859 
chest that boy and pull it in okay
normally<00:02:03.729> what<00:02:04.000> you<00:02:04.060> find<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.450> one<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:04.780> do

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
normally what you find is one you do

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.050 
normally what you find is one you do
have<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.229> put<00:02:05.410> like<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.619> chain<00:02:05.979> or<00:02:06.190> so<00:02:06.819> I'll<00:02:06.910> just

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
have to put like a chain or so I'll just

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.890 
have to put like a chain or so I'll just
do<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.110> so<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:09.700> we<00:02:09.729> do<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.149> we

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.030 

we<00:02:13.900> put<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.170> chain<00:02:14.440> on<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.770> locks<00:02:14.890> it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
we put the chain on and locks it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.940 
we put the chain on and locks it
depending<00:02:15.370> on<00:02:15.430> how<00:02:15.520> much<00:02:15.640> Cheney<00:02:16.030> need<00:02:19.950> okay

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
depending on how much Cheney need okay

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.730 
depending on how much Cheney need okay
then<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.280> idea<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.700> like<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:22.470> bracelet<00:02:23.470> fit

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
then the idea is like this bracelet fit

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.970 
then the idea is like this bracelet fit
into<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.130> edge<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.640> handles<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.600> army

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
into the edge of the handles on the army

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.320 
into the edge of the handles on the army
get<00:02:26.980> back<00:02:27.130> in<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> comfy<00:02:27.520> position<00:02:27.670> arch<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
get back in a comfy position arch the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.110 
get back in a comfy position arch the
back<00:02:28.360> chest<00:02:29.110> boss<00:02:29.380> line<00:02:29.880> pull<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
back chest boss line pull it in and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.740 
back chest boss line pull it in and
that's<00:02:34.120> utilizing<00:02:34.570> with<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> pull<00:02:35.860> down<00:02:36.840> okay

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
that's utilizing with a pull down okay

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.480 
that's utilizing with a pull down okay
couple<00:02:40.750> other<00:02:40.900> variations<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.500> use<00:02:41.920> as

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
couple other variations you can use as

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.930 
couple other variations you can use as
you<00:02:42.640> can<00:02:42.730> use<00:02:43.800> other<00:02:44.800> handles<00:02:45.400> I'll

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
you can use other handles I'll

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.090 
you can use other handles I'll
demonstrate<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:49.560> if<00:02:50.560> we<00:02:50.650> want<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.890> little<00:02:51.010> bit

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
demonstrate that if we want a little bit

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.280 
demonstrate that if we want a little bit
less<00:02:51.370> bicep<00:02:51.940> play<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.900> basically<00:02:53.170> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
less bicep play this is basically the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.800 
less bicep play this is basically the
same<00:02:53.440> as<00:02:53.620> doing<00:02:53.770> them<00:02:53.980> with<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.160> straight<00:02:54.430> bar

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
same as doing them with a straight bar

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.380 
same as doing them with a straight bar
but<00:02:55.810> because<00:02:56.080> it's<00:02:56.200> got<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.380> hands<00:02:56.590> pronated<00:02:57.390> we

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
but because it's got a hands pronated we

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.480 
but because it's got a hands pronated we
have<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.810> little<00:02:59.050> less<00:02:59.230> bicep<00:02:59.890> involvement

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
have a little less bicep involvement

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.940 
have a little less bicep involvement
okay<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.960> we<00:03:02.050> can<00:03:02.170> even<00:03:02.320> isolate<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.800> back

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
okay so we can even isolate the back

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.850 
okay so we can even isolate the back
further<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.110> great<00:03:11.290> book<00:03:11.440> because<00:03:11.650> I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
further this is a great book because I

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.750 
further this is a great book because I

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
rowing movement so those with bad backs

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.130 
rowing movement so those with bad backs
when<00:03:18.910> they<00:03:19.030> want<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.209> do<00:03:19.270> they<00:03:19.390> bend<00:03:19.989> our

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
movements or their seated row movements

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.310 
movements or their seated row movements
it<00:03:22.209> doesn't<00:03:22.480> put<00:03:22.600> something<00:03:22.900> put<00:03:23.050> a<00:03:23.080> lot<00:03:23.260> of

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
it doesn't put something put a lot of

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.120 
it doesn't put something put a lot of
pressure<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.709> lower<00:03:23.890> back

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
pressure on the lower back

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.970 
pressure on the lower back
well<00:03:24.730> this<00:03:24.850> is<00:03:25.000> take<00:03:25.239> stayed<00:03:25.480> out<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.050> it

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
well this is take stayed out of it so it

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.229 
well this is take stayed out of it so it
is<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.130> good<00:03:27.340> way<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:27.550> doing<00:03:27.760> your<00:03:27.910> rows<00:03:28.180> as<00:03:28.420> well

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
is a good way of doing your rows as well

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.670 
is a good way of doing your rows as well
now<00:03:31.239> that's<00:03:31.360> all<00:03:31.540> going<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.840> hit<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.200> in<00:03:32.500> the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
now that's all going to hit you in the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.660 
now that's all going to hit you in the
back<00:03:34.860> then<00:03:35.860> you're<00:03:35.950> going<00:03:36.070> to<00:03:36.160> hit<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.430> outer

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
back then you're going to hit the outer

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.020 
back then you're going to hit the outer
that's<00:03:37.330> more<00:03:37.930> effectively<00:03:38.500> use<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.520> question

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
that's more effectively use a question

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.770 
that's more effectively use a question
handle<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.810> same<00:03:44.019> thing<00:03:44.200> again<00:03:45.540> back<00:03:46.540> arch

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
handle the same thing again back arch

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.589 
handle the same thing again back arch
justify<00:03:47.500> pull<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.519> in

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.509 

it<00:03:53.599> always<00:03:53.750> aiming<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.800> lower<00:03:55.129> part<00:03:55.430> of

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
it always aiming to the lower part of

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.150 
it always aiming to the lower part of
chess<00:03:55.730> it's<00:03:56.000> not<00:03:56.120> up<00:03:56.300> in<00:03:56.540> your<00:03:56.720> neck<00:03:56.900> or<00:03:57.200> down

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
chess it's not up in your neck or down

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.150 
chess it's not up in your neck or down
into<00:03:58.400> your<00:03:58.459> stomach<00:03:58.700> we<00:03:59.390> wanted<00:03:59.690> I'm<00:04:00.290> into<00:04:01.010> the

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
into your stomach we wanted I'm into the

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.520 
into your stomach we wanted I'm into the
lower<00:04:01.310> chest<00:04:01.700> squeeze<00:04:03.069> squeeze

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
lower chest squeeze squeeze

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.860 
lower chest squeeze squeeze
okay<00:04:06.739> so<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.519> idea<00:04:07.790> is<00:04:07.910> when<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.540> hands<00:04:08.750> are

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
okay so the idea is when the hands are

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.229 
okay so the idea is when the hands are
out<00:04:08.959> wider<00:04:09.230> you're<00:04:09.799> working<00:04:10.129> more<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.519> inner

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
out wider you're working more the inner

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.150 
out wider you're working more the inner
back<00:04:11.480> I'm<00:04:12.019> taking<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.470> back<00:04:12.650> any<00:04:12.860> more<00:04:12.920> laps

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
back I'm taking the back any more laps

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.430 
back I'm taking the back any more laps
when<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.000> put<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.269> hands<00:04:14.450> in<00:04:14.629> closer<00:04:14.900> you're

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
when you put the hands in closer you're

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.310 
when you put the hands in closer you're
working<00:04:15.709> more<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:15.980> Analects<00:04:16.519> and<00:04:16.760> outer<00:04:16.970> back

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
working more the Analects and outer back

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.629 
working more the Analects and outer back
okay<00:04:19.419> know<00:04:20.419> that<00:04:21.169> those<00:04:21.590> options<00:04:22.010> there<00:04:22.250> and

this<00:04:32.180> movement<00:04:32.450> is<00:04:33.100> you<00:04:34.100> don't<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.430> get<00:04:34.520> into<00:04:34.669> a

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
this movement is you don't to get into a

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.879 
this movement is you don't to get into a
swinging<00:04:35.090> match<00:04:35.240> okay<00:04:35.600> because<00:04:36.139> squaddies<00:04:36.680> do

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
swinging match okay because squaddies do

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.159 
swinging match okay because squaddies do
that<00:04:37.070> load<00:04:37.400> right<00:04:37.760> up<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.150> then<00:04:38.570> start<00:04:38.900> you

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
that load right up and then start you

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.680 
that load right up and then start you
know<00:04:39.290> up<00:04:39.440> swing<00:04:40.300> that's<00:04:41.300> not<00:04:41.479> gonna<00:04:41.570> do

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
know up swing that's not gonna do

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.909 
know up swing that's not gonna do
anything<00:04:41.840> more<00:04:42.169> their<00:04:42.320> shoulders<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:42.740> half

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
anything more their shoulders and half

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:43.600 
anything more their shoulders and half
doing<00:04:43.250> them

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
doing them

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.640 
doing them
the<00:04:44.030> idea<00:04:44.300> is<00:04:44.419> blocks<00:04:44.960> are<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.169> game<00:04:45.350> of<00:04:45.470> race

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
the idea is blocks are the game of race

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.219 
the idea is blocks are the game of race
off<00:04:45.950> in<00:04:46.130> equation<00:04:46.820> bin<00:04:47.000> against<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.510> the

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
off in equation bin against the the

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.520 
off in equation bin against the the
press<00:04:48.470> arm<00:04:48.850> okay<00:04:49.850> I<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.539> back<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:51.410> then

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
press arm okay I to the back and then

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.710 
press arm okay I to the back and then
just<00:04:51.560> squeeze<00:04:52.130> just<00:04:52.669> using<00:04:53.090> your<00:04:53.180> back<00:04:53.389> have

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
just squeeze just using your back have

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.320 
just squeeze just using your back have
you<00:04:53.810> seen<00:04:54.050> there's<00:04:54.229> no<00:04:55.210> movement<00:04:56.210> there

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
you seen there's no movement there

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.010 
you seen there's no movement there
whatsoever<00:04:56.600> okay<00:04:58.300> because<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.600> does<00:04:59.720> involve

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
whatsoever okay because it does involve

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.260 
whatsoever okay because it does involve
like<00:05:00.440> when<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.770> more<00:05:00.919> upright<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:02.150> you're

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
like when you more upright and you're

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.770 
like when you more upright and you're
doing<00:05:02.479> lat<00:05:02.630> pull-downs<00:05:04.330> you<00:05:05.330> can<00:05:05.450> probably<00:05:05.600> go

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
doing lat pull-downs you can probably go

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.050 
doing lat pull-downs you can probably go
the<00:05:05.900> lowest<00:05:06.410> rep<00:05:06.620> range<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:06.919> about<00:05:07.070> ten<00:05:07.370> with

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
the lowest rep range of about ten with

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.520 
the lowest rep range of about ten with
this<00:05:08.210> one<00:05:08.389> because<00:05:08.539> your<00:05:08.870> back<00:05:09.050> becomes

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
this one because your back becomes

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.870 
this one because your back becomes
involved<00:05:09.860> so<00:05:10.039> you're<00:05:10.160> getting<00:05:10.340> a<00:05:10.370> bit<00:05:10.460> of<00:05:10.700> lats

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
involved so you're getting a bit of lats

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.969 
involved so you're getting a bit of lats
and<00:05:11.150> back<00:05:11.479> I<00:05:11.750> prefer<00:05:12.680> to<00:05:12.770> keep<00:05:12.889> the

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
and back I prefer to keep the

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.250 
and back I prefer to keep the
repetitions<00:05:13.400> higher<00:05:13.550> maybe<00:05:14.090> like<00:05:14.330> 12<00:05:14.660> to<00:05:14.900> 15

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
repetitions higher maybe like 12 to 15

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.230 
repetitions higher maybe like 12 to 15
repetitions<00:05:15.470> is<00:05:16.039> better<00:05:16.340> alright<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:17.060> only

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
repetitions is better alright the only

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.339 
repetitions is better alright the only
factor<00:05:17.510> that<00:05:17.539> is<00:05:17.720> that<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:17.930> do<00:05:18.020> have<00:05:18.050> your

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
factor that is that you do have your

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.560 
factor that is that you do have your
back<00:05:18.470> Buster<00:05:18.830> which<00:05:18.950> are<00:05:19.130> stronger<00:05:19.580> so<00:05:20.389> you're

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
back Buster which are stronger so you're

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:21.820 
back Buster which are stronger so you're
going<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.750> keep<00:05:20.810> it<00:05:20.960> up<00:05:21.020> dishes<00:05:21.260> up<00:05:21.380> higher<00:05:21.590> to

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
going to keep it up dishes up higher to

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.010 
going to keep it up dishes up higher to
make<00:05:22.070> sure<00:05:22.250> that<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:22.639> you<00:05:23.120> do<00:05:23.300> get<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.840> lacks

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
make sure that you you do get the lacks

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.850 
make sure that you you do get the lacks
exhausted<00:05:24.919> as<00:05:25.039> well<00:05:25.220> okay<00:05:25.729> so<00:05:26.560> that's<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.770> way

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
exhausted as well okay so that's the way

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.680 
exhausted as well okay so that's the way
that<00:05:28.099> you<00:05:28.190> do<00:05:28.370> can<00:05:28.820> still<00:05:29.030> get<00:05:29.210> an<00:05:29.300> effective

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
that you do can still get an effective

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.910 
that you do can still get an effective
