they<00:02:41.840> laughed<00:02:42.109> when<00:02:42.290> Galileo<00:02:42.829> said<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.250> world

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
they laughed when Galileo said the world

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.550 
they laughed when Galileo said the world
was<00:02:43.609> round<00:02:43.849> must<00:02:44.780> have<00:02:44.930> been<00:02:45.019> his<00:02:45.170> delivery

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
was round must have been his delivery

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.949 
was round must have been his delivery
and<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:46.579> through<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.000> course<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.540> love<00:02:47.750> is

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
and so through the course of love is

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.569 
and so through the course of love is
round<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.409> so<00:02:48.650> until<00:02:48.920> next<00:02:49.069> week<00:02:49.219> when<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
round and so until next week when the

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.550 
round and so until next week when the
circle<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.090> again<00:02:50.390> complete<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.049> we<00:02:51.379> meet

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
circle is again complete and we meet

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.500 
circle is again complete and we meet
through<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.950> miracle<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.489> television<00:02:52.730> tubes

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
through the miracle of television tubes

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.259 
through the miracle of television tubes
and<00:02:53.719> wiring<00:02:54.200> this<00:02:54.799> is<00:02:54.950> far<00:02:55.250> beyond<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:56.090> most

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
and wiring this is far beyond the most

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.929 
and wiring this is far beyond the most
beautiful<00:02:56.810> man<00:02:56.989> in<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.290> cosmos<00:02:57.799> saying<00:02:58.730> these

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
beautiful man in the cosmos saying these

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:08.500 
beautiful man in the cosmos saying these
things<00:02:59.290> now<00:03:00.290> yeah
