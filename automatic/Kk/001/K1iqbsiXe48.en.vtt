luck with importing SVG so with my logo
work<00:00:38.610> when<00:00:38.879> i<00:00:39.410> bring<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> into<00:00:40.700> blender<00:00:41.700> by

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
work when i bring it into blender by

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.540 
work when i bring it into blender by
adobe<00:00:43.260> illustrator<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.739> don't<00:00:44.040> save<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
illustrator format I save it in SVG so

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.910 
illustrator format I save it in SVG so
then<00:00:57.570> when<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> important<00:00:58.530> i'm<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> have

then when I important i'm going to have

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.189 
then when I important i'm going to have
it<00:00:59.039> clamp<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.789> height<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:03.019> there's<00:01:04.019> my

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
it clamp on the height and there's my

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.940 
it clamp on the height and there's my
logo<00:01:05.420> or<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:06.510> least<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.930> version<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.740> that's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
logo or at least a version of it that's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.460 
logo or at least a version of it that's
just<00:01:08.010> made<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.630> liner<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
just made up of just the the liner the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.230 
just made up of just the the liner the
bezzie<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> line<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.400> I'll<00:01:11.580> tab<00:01:11.850> into<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
bezzie a line so I'll tab into it and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.010 
bezzie a line so I'll tab into it and
what<00:01:15.240> I'm<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:15.900> actually

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
what I'm going to do is I'm actually

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.370 
what I'm going to do is I'm actually
going<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.350> separate<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> outer<00:01:17.520> rectangle<00:01:18.380> so

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
going to separate the outer rectangle so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.410 
going to separate the outer rectangle so
let's<00:01:19.560> make<00:01:19.799> sure<00:01:19.860> nothing<00:01:20.820> selected<00:01:21.060> by

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
let's make sure nothing selected by

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.080 
let's make sure nothing selected by
hitting<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> key<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.409> couple<00:01:22.710> times<00:01:23.090> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hitting the a key a couple times and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.499 
hitting the a key a couple times and
then<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.330> hit<00:01:24.479> l<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.439> select<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.860> path<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.509> key

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
then I hit l to select this path and key

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.219 
then I hit l to select this path and key
to<00:01:27.659> separate<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:29.390> tab<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
to separate and tab to get out of the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.200 
to separate and tab to get out of the
object<00:01:31.650> altogether<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:33.630> now<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:35.060> turn<00:01:36.060> this

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
object altogether so now I turn this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.830 
object altogether so now I turn this
around<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.600> little<00:01:36.720> bit<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.750> let<00:01:39.750> me

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
around a little bit you can see let me

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.710 
around a little bit you can see let me
select<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.290> rectangle<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.509> that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
select the rectangle you can see that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.330 
select the rectangle you can see that
these<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.860> two<00:01:44.310> separate<00:01:44.700> objects<00:01:46.220> what<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
these are two separate objects what you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.660 
these are two separate objects what you
can<00:01:47.490> do<00:01:47.640> when<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.270> bez<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.049> paths<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.740> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
can do when you have bez a paths is you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.130 
can do when you have bez a paths is you
can<00:01:50.820> use<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.299> curves<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> surface<00:01:52.790> panel

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
can use on this curves and surface panel

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.940 
can use on this curves and surface panel
the<00:01:55.140> extrude<00:01:55.500> feature

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
the extrude feature

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.359 
the extrude feature
so<00:01:57.850> now<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.030> just<00:01:58.149> extruded<00:01:58.869> that<00:01:59.159> and<00:02:00.159> it's

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
so now I just extruded that and it's

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.620 
so now I just extruded that and it's
like<00:02:00.520> this<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:00.969> I'll<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:02.259> once<00:02:02.500> there<00:02:03.630> you

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
like this and I'll that once there you

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.149 
like this and I'll that once there you
click<00:02:05.079> it<00:02:05.200> as<00:02:05.259> many<00:02:05.409> times<00:02:05.469> as<00:02:05.679> you<00:02:05.799> want<00:02:05.950> as

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
click it as many times as you want as

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.160 
click it as many times as you want as
deep<00:02:06.429> as<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.820> want<00:02:06.880> for<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.539> extrusion<00:02:08.019> and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
deep as you want for the extrusion and

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:18.740 
deep as you want for the extrusion and
I'll<00:02:09.160> switch<00:02:09.429> this<00:02:09.610> back<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.970> solid<00:02:14.610> boom<00:02:15.610> and

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.610 

let's<00:02:19.750> see<00:02:19.930> let's<00:02:20.140> look<00:02:20.230> at<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.440> through<00:02:20.590> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
let's see let's look at it through the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.600 
let's see let's look at it through the
camera<00:02:22.410> just<00:02:23.410> like<00:02:23.590> both<00:02:23.830> those<00:02:23.980> I'll<00:02:24.340> scale

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
camera just like both those I'll scale

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.170 
camera just like both those I'll scale
it<00:02:24.819> up<00:02:24.849> a<00:02:25.030> bit

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:39.030 

and<00:02:29.599> then<00:02:34.390> let's<00:02:35.390> throw<00:02:35.659> a<00:02:35.750> little<00:02:35.959> texture

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.270 

it's<00:02:40.040> almost<00:02:40.459> black<00:02:40.879> and<00:02:41.769> it's<00:02:42.769> just<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.099> little

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
it's almost black and it's just a little

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.990 
it's almost black and it's just a little
bit<00:02:43.519> reflective<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:45.370> then<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.400> looks<00:02:46.819> like

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
bit reflective and then I looks like

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.699 
bit reflective and then I looks like
this<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:49.450> I'm<00:02:50.450> gonna<00:02:50.569> make<00:02:50.659> this<00:02:50.840> white<00:02:51.139> even

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
this and I'm gonna make this white even

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.699 
this and I'm gonna make this white even
though<00:02:51.829> the<00:02:52.129> Nyquist<00:02:52.549> part<00:02:52.760> i'm<00:02:53.500> not<00:02:54.500> going<00:02:54.650> to

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
though the Nyquist part i'm not going to

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.270 
though the Nyquist part i'm not going to
do<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:55.549> faithful<00:02:55.909> reproduction<00:02:56.689> here<00:02:56.870> because

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
do a faithful reproduction here because
