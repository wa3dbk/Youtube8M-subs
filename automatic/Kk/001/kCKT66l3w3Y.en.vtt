00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello welcome to a new one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.029
 video of me 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.309
 As you can see I have it here again 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.920
 a small box prepared with all 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.049
 possible things and that should be today 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.150
 my grooming routine will be 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.770
 that means I want you all today 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.710
 I introduce my products for you 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.720
 facial care routine use in the evening 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.850
 and in the morning alike with me 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.529
 that actually hardly changes and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.119
 I have two different product types 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.070
 once they really perceive that and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.380
 then a few I go every now and then 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.960
 sometimes exchanges or not so often 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.239
 I actually found it in the evening 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.420
 always on with the cleaning towels of 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.980
 in leather jacket he wore that are here 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.750
 grabs now is almost empty again 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.360
 I still have everyone at home 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.469
 they are relatively interchangeable for me 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 so i would like others too 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.820
 cleaning towels but use the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.620
 do not burn and they do not leave an eye 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.289
 dry the feeling back and therefore 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.870
 I think that's totally okay 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.390
 another from the balance of care 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.770
 row is the mild wash that knows 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.350
 her yes I think also I have already 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.750
 from numerous favorite videos 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.580
 numerous care routines new 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.869
 but that's me with one 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.560
 I'll tell you stag 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.299
 that's what ebeling uses 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.020
 I think so synonymous of dm 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.720
 which can be here as the hand 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.369
 stuck and then so beautiful that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.380
 play a work that has its 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.750
 slight peeling effect is quite 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.090
 nice and soft and very very 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.020
 I do not recommend everyone 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.000
 but especially under the day 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.770
 What I usually do before then 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.500
 I somehow start to turn from 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.390
 silly the part of the earth tonic knows her 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.490
 also from numerous videos of me because 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.869
 I really love it very much 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.479
 do not use it then a bit 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.799
 Main problems do not actually get 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.670
 probably left off 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.950
 but because of somebody else 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.569
 but I started then 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.399
 I have to use that again 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.959
 my skin normalized immediately 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.390
 and it got better after i did that 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:00.100
 then everything applied to lubricated 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.200
 I 'll continue then and that 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.110
 really with cranes I have completely 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.920
 unspectacular momentarily creamed by cd 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.500
 this is the moisturizer 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.440
 water lilies without mineral oils silicones 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.230
 plastic and animal ingredients 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.010
 that in principle a completely neutral white 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.349
 cream is slightly cosmetic but not 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.329
 possible and above all else 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.310
 good here very large area still for the 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.799
 neck and use for this area 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.680
 and I recommend it I believe this 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.709
 Also very suitable for sensitive skin 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.000
 not for overly dry skin because 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.609
 I think they need one more 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.900
 a bit more moisture maybe 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.209
 then another product which I sometimes 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.489
 sometimes do not exchange with cream 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.489
 is still enough in the fund make up of 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.190
 clinic divas battle skin sound correctly in 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.930
 motion with sun protection factor 20 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.260
 I should probably have in mind 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.319
 the fact that I am just now 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.239
 no sunscreen is here yet 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.190
 I have used meticulous though 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.139
 I have a clinic cream now 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.239
 I too should always know 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.859
 but most of the time I'm lucky 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.660
 a foundation with sun protection factor 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.540
 that was not so terrible 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.190
 for my skin and that's why I want 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.989
 but still if it's even warmer 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.540
 is and I'm very bright, 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.549
 sensitive skin a sun protection factor 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.769
 in the form of a cream or something else 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.980
 stronger in my grooming routine 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:30.519
 integrate more creamy also currently 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.909
 Use is the change loud at atomic as 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.379
 an eye cream that is so and 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.330
 So unfortunately badly as you do here 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.280
 Most of the time, unfortunately, we get too much out 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.959
 and now it's my only one 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.390
 criticism of the thing else is 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.099
 She cools quite well and is above all else 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.590
 very, very much what I am 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.540
 it is always quite good with the eye cream 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.000
 Usually I'm done then either 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.980
 I go to bed then because it is evening 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.590
 then I jump with these kiels 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.590
 damage protecting toning it again 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:04.510
 my face on it can show once 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.760
 and that attracts you very quickly 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.310
 not flat or bacon or something 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.500
 from and I use that also during the day 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.530
 my routine as setting spray for my 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.310
 make-up and this is my purchase 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.049
 Product high 3000 forever and me 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.300
 use this every day i love the im 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.789
 summer will be even more beautiful because it still 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.800
 better than any year 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.440
 so you have to face each other 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.860
 can and still spray one 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.590
 test but currently more soy for the 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.419
 special day I say so now 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.030
 user every day but he so if 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.400
 I want to do something good for me 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.280
 which minimally sinks from the 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.479
 same series also from kiels and it is 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.530
 such a foam you pretty much 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.139
 can apply 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.780
 I usually take that instead of 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.729
 the gel then I take this and here 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.250
 he smells the likes of him 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.810
 is the really great smell now 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.580
 I still have a product that I show now 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.470
 so in the end both new and I still 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.360
 not really properly tested 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.120
 So just started one was 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.120
 few days and that of l'orÃ©al paris 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.960
 this tube for the bio the man that 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.400
 I usually use either 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.370
 right after the section books 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.780
 sometimes now but also after that I am 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.960
 I'm not so sure now 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.300
 has its best effect and unfolds 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.129
 my first mini review on this 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.470
 comparison to the bio of the hammer that me 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.870
 a few times already used is that 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.129
 I do not think so much of the effect 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.629
 can determine if it is at all 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.099
 a difference is good for you 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.590
 this product is because that means that 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:40.340
 but is quite good, unfortunately, is the 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.750
 packaging but i know that can see 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.699
 but it does not really work 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.680
 dose how much comes out of it and 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.419
 this unfortunately disappears relatively 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.610
 Now I'm pretty much what product 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.889
 pity but price 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.440
 performance ratio that costs about me 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.699
 I got 425 that I have 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.349
 This already belongs to a lot of people 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.080
 cheaper for three euros 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:03.620
 or so and the bio derma costs so 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.389
 online mostly 17 euro and yes that is 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.190
 partly always something like organic 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.969
 I can give you the ans volt 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.500
 heart 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.539
 I will always do that in the morning, too 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.250
 build in my routine and before 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.469
 In any case, I still ton this 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.819
 probably will probably apply 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:18.949
 I even set that I have to go 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.840
 watch how this develops I will 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.819
 give you in any case an update 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.190
