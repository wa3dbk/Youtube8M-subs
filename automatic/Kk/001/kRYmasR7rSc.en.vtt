00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:08.180
 good afternoon, this afternoon 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:11.720
 He is very satisfied very very very happy 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.680
 and I really think that 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:19.660
 it could not have gone better 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.980
 our team work in a way 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:27.200
 really great as if they were one 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.720
 we are very happy about it on 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.410
 new trophy worked at a thousand 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.040
 wonders and then the human team here 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.240
 both tavo and javi what a barbarian if 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.510
 they did an excellent job 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:48.310
 it was a difficult day starting up so far back 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.560
 to excel so many vehicles and the 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.450
 deliver the trophy to me in the position 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.890
 and on the condition that he gave it to me 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:00.820
 well, it also demands a lot 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.640
 concentration of really a lot 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.310
 patience because it brought a lot of traffic 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:13.470
 opposite and then he did it like the big 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.860
 little by little he was one by one eating 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.000
 the climbs until then only ville and 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.740
 he's physically ahead of us 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.660
 but in corrected time when I was 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.450
 a delivered the trophy and there we go 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.030
 go ahead if it was a fabulous 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.360
 race I did not have incidents then it 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.110
 climbed out and a small appointment section 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.850
 and that they changed us at the last minute 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.670
 I had traveled on the other side that I 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.800
 I had to mark and run with my 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.310
 marks passed and he had a puncture of 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.380
 rim that was him 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.500
 or incident that we had in all the 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.170
 We are going to exhibit the trophy in 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.909
 the vicente guerrero today and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.159
 mechanically be in perfect 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.149
 clear conditions the body 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.970
 the two rear sides are missing in the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.360
 chest here is in Mexican and if it is that 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.390
 we are going to put it but very satisfied 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.470
 very happy with the result of the end 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.130
 of the week in 2010 things happened 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.480
 differently we start in second 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.960
 place 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.060
 we could 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.950
 first position around 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.660
 the 150 180 mile and we take the baton and 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.220
 never as it says new we never turn around 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.020
 back and we went in front and 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.020
 we could win that race 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.830
 I was talking with andy grandeur in 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.680
 peace and that this reaffirms what 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.660
 we did in 2010 he tells me the truth as 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.540
 runners we need that we need 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.269
 something that reaffirms that what we did 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.819
 it was true that we can follow 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.709
 doing but it makes me that for 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.930
 for the fans for the people who are 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.180
 watching out for the race win 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.879
 in 2010 if we win in 2012 be like 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.209
 but if we think that way 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:13.170
 this was very different to start at 24 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:17.159
 place and have to exceed 23 vehicles 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.900
 and physically I am at mile 7 that 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:22.620
 when we go to the first one in the mile 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.170
 nine thousand that we passed last we passed 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.950
 to 23 vehicles to position ourselves in 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.440
 first place and I feel that as 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.630
 runner 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.360
 this gives us more satisfaction because it was 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.210
 much harder to win it but really 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.580
 yes yes I see her as a fan because you won 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.860
 work to me he knows it's the same they 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.540
 they started first and tasks like brais 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.940
 menzies in the low 500 from end to end 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.210
 in first or you have come from behind 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.980
 from 24 and spent the whole site 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.520
 trophy has the evidence that we passed 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.450
 we all do not turn around, we do not crash 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.340
 do not throw me out they say we hit 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.830
 something with the defense we did not do anything of 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.270
 that's the truth it was to stumble or clean 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.790
 that we removed the pieces that were in 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.210
 front of us and as a result 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.350
 if we run out of lights in the part of 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.239
 down the trophy we were not going to enter 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.859
 part of the story we are left without 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.140
 defense also to the point where already 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.600
 I mentioned and do not hit anyone else 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.540
 because you do not have to hit him 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.630
 so we had to take care 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:35.020
 much more 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:38.140
 but light because that is tremendous the 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.120
 the lights we lost in San Felipe 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.460
 already in san felipe we already have lights 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.830
 so the whole night race that 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.750
 it was five in the afternoon that goes down 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.840
 the sun at 6 7 in the morning that goes up the 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.760
 sun at 13 14 o'clock went at night 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.990
 with am to the bar above lights and 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.300
 still so again nothing more truth 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.710
 nine times in the history of this 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.390
 race the cars have won the 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.090
 motorcycles we have two of the nine 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.500
 and we were able to go win the honey then yes 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.380
 It is extremely a cup 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.870
 extremely satisfied much more 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.490
 difficult is that of 2010 but 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.260
 also very happy because we showed 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.210
 goodbye even though many people said 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.830
 that we would see of running the gaiser and that 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.810
 the new trophy does not work that I know that 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.550
 us and you know if we knew that 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.030
 we had something very special inside fine and 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.610
 we show it on Thursday and Friday 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.030
 Well definitely not wanting to win 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:37.300
 a low to a thousand everyone expected 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.040
 that we won the second and then after 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.540
 to win the second hour I think that 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.870
 everyone expects we have everything 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.850
 hopefully and it becomes reality that is the 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.360
 intention the year that enters our 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:53.350
 objective because there are only three races 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.770
 scoring championship last year or this 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.230
 year rather it was very difficult because 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.930
 to build the new trophy we decided 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:06.640
 stop running the first two 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:09.730
 races of the year and well that put us in 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.090
 a difficult position really difficult to 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.260
 which then starts we go in the second 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.500
 draw no 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.450
 now with this 1000 low having the 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.390
 won for san felipe we enter 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.220
 draw of the first 12 then what 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.130
 worse than we can go to start san 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.800
 felipe is twelfth and we can start in 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.880
 front so I think we're going to 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:39.980
 start 2013 with the right foot as 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:44.030
 we wanted with a trophy ready with a 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:47.060
 motivated team and then starting in the 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:51.110
 first 12 so we started well on 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:55.300
 13 and we hope to have for 14 the 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.300
 number 1 instead of 21 in the trophy
