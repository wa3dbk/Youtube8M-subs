 yes hello people and welcome 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.460
 Now again to a small server 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.350
 video yahaya ours 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.869
 community is a bit off and mine 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.490
 apps also do not go away a bit yes 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.289
 I've had ours before 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.400
 server tracker i already had my ex 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.890
 once presented 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.779
 and yes that server is already 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.420
 a bit outdated and that's why 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.040
 I wanted the service again 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.559
 imagine and the people meppen grad 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.930
 So, yes, that's ours now 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.840
 wonderful apartment on the server so 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.969
 here first our service or 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.129
 welcome visually better said so yes 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.289
 Here are the rules when you're on it 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.760
 then you just go here 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.410
 Of course, that will be the first time 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.539
 the rules and then you do it first 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.309
 nice tutorial and will then 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.110
 unlocked this is our sport 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.789
 then you can go right here 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.590
 running back toward and directly 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.260
 buy your own property here 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 here you then clicks simply because here 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.140
 are signs and since then clicking 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.479
 up and then buy his own 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.350
 land yes that is easy 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.479
 a little bit, actually 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.850
 made easy but I find it 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.200
 not so bad after all 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.360
 then you can own your own property 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.150
 if you buy then at the city-run me 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.880
 not if you are at veb city then 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.920
 you are here in the wm are all here too 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.930
 plots if you are yours 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.159
 Property buys so then you will 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.200
 of course immediately to her 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.369
 land teleported and here is yes 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.000
 also just written you have to 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.530
 done before that 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.329
 you always have to when you are one 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.259
 plot buys satow but that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.740
 is good for now then he shows 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.720
 now just business server em up 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.509
 Dismantling here you can resources 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.340
 if you're down if you're right now 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.570
 on a server side and just yours 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.030
 you want to build a house then you can 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.090
 reduce your resources and could use it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.310
 then your house build so yes behind 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.759
 You can do everything with this bedrock line 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.979

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.689
 can you from the ender there he is synonymous 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.170
 latently there you can go to the end 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.420
 then you can make yet available 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.400
 here you can even have your own 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.230
 buy colors so the costs of course 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.819
 also a little money and then you can 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.680
 Here are your very own colors 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.170

 here you can just this whole rule 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.890
 and you have here for example 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.540
 could zombie fans and you can as 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.280
 you can quite a lot of pugs 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.959
 kill and leveling you were, or what 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.440
 also if you your things he if 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.000
 you need it from the types then 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.459
 Of course you can do that too 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.879
 You can of course experience in the pvp 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.769
 also play pvp is clear here you can 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.000
 then of course your own base too 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.220
 You can build up here too 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.150
 dismantle everything and here behind this 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.650
 Of course you can also line 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
 you are still attacked here 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.599
 a little pont protection but luck 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.599
 also gets pvp play so then you could 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.040
 her still was pvp arena there only 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.870
 an arena you could join us 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.829
 also look at where from black 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.489
 I do not necessarily need a board there 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.650
 down 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.850
 or maybe I'm still weak 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.160
 I do not even know if it all 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.729
 yes with black boards is nothing more 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.050
 that is still overlooked by that 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.300
 we the now just so that's 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.349

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.419
 Of course, the second floor is still here 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.240
