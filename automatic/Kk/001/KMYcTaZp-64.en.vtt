I<00:00:56.280> decided<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.789> let<00:00:56.940> my<00:00:57.090> strands<00:00:57.930> twist<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.680> on

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
I decided to let my strands twist up on

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.160 
I decided to let my strands twist up on
themselves<00:00:59.090> cuz<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.359> really<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.960> look

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
themselves cuz I really like that look

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.290 
themselves cuz I really like that look
but<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.250> could<00:01:02.430> lay<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.730> flat<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.210> you

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
but you could lay them flat if you

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.090 
but you could lay them flat if you
wanted<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.930> keep<00:01:04.140> twisting<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.680> around<00:01:04.769> as

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
wanted to and keep twisting it around as

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
wanted to and keep twisting it around as
you<00:01:05.189> lay<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> barrel<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.780> makes<00:01:06.930> any

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you lay it on the barrel it makes any

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.929 
you lay it on the barrel it makes any
sense<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.590> way<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.770> lays<00:01:07.890> flat<00:01:07.950> so

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
sense in that way it lays flat so

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.170 
sense in that way it lays flat so
basically<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.750> twist<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> hair

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
basically if you twist of the hair

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.399 
basically if you twist of the hair
purposely<00:01:12.180> it'll<00:01:12.450> lay<00:01:12.600> flat<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.140> barrel

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
purposely it'll lay flat on the barrel

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.410 
purposely it'll lay flat on the barrel
but<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.340> don't<00:01:14.549> trust<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> hair<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.270> will

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
but if you don't trust the hair it will

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.990 
but if you don't trust the hair it will
twist<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> barrel<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:17.909> I'm

about<00:05:14.550> 10<00:05:14.849> minutes<00:05:15.030> I'm<00:05:15.870> ready<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.229> take<00:05:16.380> out

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
about 10 minutes I'm ready to take out

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.950 
about 10 minutes I'm ready to take out
the<00:05:16.590> curls<00:05:16.830> so<00:05:17.759> what<00:05:18.270> I'm<00:05:18.389> doing<00:05:18.419> is<00:05:18.900> just

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
the curls so what I'm doing is just

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.600 
the curls so what I'm doing is just
starting<00:05:19.530> at<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.710> bottom<00:05:20.039> where<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.220> started

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
starting at the bottom where I started

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.029 
starting at the bottom where I started
this<00:05:20.729> curling<00:05:21.389> and<00:05:21.659> just<00:05:22.590> taking<00:05:22.889> out<00:05:22.949> the

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
this curling and just taking out the

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.640 
this curling and just taking out the
pins<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.639> by<00:05:24.270> now<00:05:24.419> all<00:05:24.780> these<00:05:25.139> curls<00:05:25.500> are

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
pins and by now all these curls are

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.610 
pins and by now all these curls are
completely<00:05:26.039> cooled<00:05:26.310> and<00:05:26.580> so<00:05:27.419> they<00:05:27.960> will<00:05:28.349> stay

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
completely cooled and so they will stay

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.899 
completely cooled and so they will stay
curled<00:05:28.949> for<00:05:29.190> much<00:05:29.430> longer

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
curled for much longer

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.330 
curled for much longer
which<00:05:30.479> I<00:05:30.720> love<00:05:31.139> that's<00:05:31.830> why<00:05:31.979> I<00:05:32.009> love<00:05:32.220> doing

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
which I love that's why I love doing

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.939 
which I love that's why I love doing
this<00:05:32.490> technique<00:05:32.639> of<00:05:32.940> cleaning<00:05:33.210> up<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.360> curls

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
this technique of cleaning up the curls

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.649 
this technique of cleaning up the curls
so<00:05:34.949> I'm<00:05:35.190> just<00:05:35.400> reaching<00:05:35.580> in<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.180> just<00:05:36.419> finding

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
so I'm just reaching in and just finding

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.420 
so I'm just reaching in and just finding
the<00:05:36.780> pins<00:05:37.020> at<00:05:37.199> the<00:05:37.229> bottom<00:05:37.500> of<00:05:37.560> my<00:05:37.650> head<00:05:37.860> I'm

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
the pins at the bottom of my head I'm

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.459 
the pins at the bottom of my head I'm
removing<00:05:39.210> those<00:05:39.389> and<00:05:39.780> the<00:05:39.930> curls<00:05:40.199> will<00:05:40.259> just

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
removing those and the curls will just

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:45.020 
removing those and the curls will just
fall<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:41.310> lay<00:05:42.030> beautifully

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.190 

okay<00:05:46.030> so<00:05:46.090> now<00:05:46.420> I'm<00:05:46.510> about<00:05:46.720> in<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:46.960> middle

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
okay so now I'm about in the middle

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.200 
okay so now I'm about in the middle
section<00:05:47.410> and<00:05:47.770> just<00:05:47.830> continuing<00:05:48.640> and

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.980 

sometimes<00:05:52.210> the<00:05:52.360> pins<00:05:52.540> will<00:05:52.660> get<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:52.780> little

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
sometimes the pins will get a little

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.690 
sometimes the pins will get a little
stuck<00:05:53.200> or<00:05:53.320> whatever<00:05:53.560> so<00:05:54.160> what<00:05:54.250> you<00:05:54.340> can<00:05:54.460> do<00:05:54.580> to

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
stuck or whatever so what you can do to

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.990 
stuck or whatever so what you can do to
fix<00:05:54.850> that<00:05:54.970> is<00:05:55.120> just<00:05:56.310> slowly<00:05:57.310> release<00:05:57.670> the<00:05:57.700> curl

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
fix that is just slowly release the curl

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.090 
fix that is just slowly release the curl
and<00:05:58.210> then<00:05:58.480> I<00:05:58.780> twisted<00:05:59.410> around<00:05:59.560> your<00:05:59.830> finger

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
and then I twisted around your finger

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.750 
and then I twisted around your finger
and<00:06:00.130> stop<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.700> take<00:06:01.420> out<00:06:01.540> all<00:06:01.660> the<00:06:01.750> frizziness

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
and stop to take out all the frizziness

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.860 
and stop to take out all the frizziness
and<00:06:03.760> I<00:06:03.970> had<00:06:04.090> to<00:06:04.180> do<00:06:04.270> that<00:06:04.360> for<00:06:04.420> a<00:06:04.570> couple<00:06:04.810> of

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
and I had to do that for a couple of

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.070 
and I had to do that for a couple of
pieces<00:06:05.110> but<00:06:06.240> overall<00:06:07.240> this<00:06:07.600> pretty<00:06:07.750> easy<00:06:07.960> to

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
pieces but overall this pretty easy to

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.600 
pieces but overall this pretty easy to
take<00:06:08.260> out<00:06:08.410> so<00:06:08.920> like<00:06:08.980> you<00:06:09.100> can<00:06:09.220> see<00:06:09.340> here<00:06:09.520> I'm

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
take out so like you can see here I'm

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.760 
take out so like you can see here I'm
trying<00:06:09.790> to<00:06:09.850> remove<00:06:10.530> where<00:06:11.530> there<00:06:11.650> was<00:06:11.740> a

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
trying to remove where there was a

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.130 
trying to remove where there was a
little<00:06:11.920> tangle<00:06:12.370> so<00:06:13.090> I'm<00:06:13.330> just<00:06:13.600> kind<00:06:14.080> of

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
little tangle so I'm just kind of

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.520 
little tangle so I'm just kind of
twisting<00:06:14.470> that<00:06:14.530> back<00:06:14.710> up<00:06:14.890> and<00:06:16.290> continuing<00:06:17.290> to

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
twisting that back up and continuing to

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:24.720 
twisting that back up and continuing to
take<00:06:17.680> out<00:06:17.800> this<00:06:22.470> and<00:06:23.470> I'm<00:06:24.070> sorry<00:06:24.280> if<00:06:24.460> you<00:06:24.550> saw

this<00:06:32.530> was<00:06:32.680> a<00:06:32.710> force<00:06:32.950> -<00:06:33.100> voiceover<00:06:33.520> I<00:06:33.970> didn't

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
this was a force - voiceover I didn't

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.390 
this was a force - voiceover I didn't
have<00:06:34.930> to<00:06:35.050> stop<00:06:35.230> the<00:06:35.350> video<00:06:35.500> but<00:06:35.980> I<00:06:36.010> just<00:06:36.250> told

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
have to stop the video but I just told

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.580 
have to stop the video but I just told
him<00:06:36.520> to<00:06:36.640> stay<00:06:36.790> out<00:06:36.820> of<00:06:36.940> sight<00:06:37.000> but<00:06:37.930> yeah<00:06:38.290> anyway

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
him to stay out of sight but yeah anyway

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.220 
him to stay out of sight but yeah anyway
so<00:06:38.620> that's<00:06:39.100> what<00:06:39.250> happens<00:06:39.550> so<00:06:40.420> if<00:06:40.990> there's

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
so that's what happens so if there's

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.540 
so that's what happens so if there's
some<00:06:41.350> hands<00:06:41.500> behind<00:06:41.650> me<00:06:41.890> because<00:06:42.100> my<00:06:42.280> sister

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
some hands behind me because my sister

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.910 
some hands behind me because my sister
was<00:06:42.640> trying<00:06:42.850> to<00:06:42.910> do<00:06:43.030> her<00:06:43.150> hair<00:06:43.300> as<00:06:43.390> well<00:06:43.540> so<00:06:44.350> now

I'm<00:06:45.130> just<00:06:45.280> taking<00:06:45.580> out<00:06:45.670> the<00:06:45.760> top<00:06:45.970> pins<00:06:46.210> and

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
I'm just taking out the top pins and

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.640 
I'm just taking out the top pins and
just<00:06:48.190> continuing<00:06:48.700> that<00:06:49.090> process<00:06:49.410> it's<00:06:50.410> pretty

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
just continuing that process it's pretty

00:06:50.650 --> 00:07:03.420 
just continuing that process it's pretty
self-explanatory
