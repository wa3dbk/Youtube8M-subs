you<00:00:13.370> miss<00:00:13.580> something

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
you miss something

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.369 
you miss something
you've<00:00:14.240> missed<00:00:14.480> a<00:00:14.600> whole<00:00:14.780> piece<00:00:14.959> and<00:00:15.170> it's<00:00:15.289> a

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
you've missed a whole piece and it's a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.320 
you've missed a whole piece and it's a
little<00:00:15.590> more<00:00:15.680> obvious<00:00:16.180> because<00:00:17.180> it's

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
little more obvious because it's

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.820 
little more obvious because it's
important<00:00:17.660> to<00:00:17.720> get<00:00:17.930> every<00:00:18.380> part<00:00:18.619> of<00:00:18.680> this

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
important to get every part of this

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.529 
important to get every part of this
thing<00:00:19.010> putty<00:00:19.220> because<00:00:19.640> this<00:00:20.150> stuff<00:00:20.359> does<00:00:20.510> a

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
thing putty because this stuff does a

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.689 
thing putty because this stuff does a
lot<00:00:20.750> of<00:00:20.810> good<00:00:20.990> things<00:00:21.380> for<00:00:21.529> our<00:00:21.680> window<00:00:21.859> so

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
lot of good things for our window so

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.400 
lot of good things for our window so
I've<00:00:22.849> talked<00:00:23.240> about<00:00:23.330> filling<00:00:23.960> up<00:00:24.050> some<00:00:24.140> gaps

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
I've talked about filling up some gaps

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.099 
I've talked about filling up some gaps
last<00:00:25.130> weekend<00:00:25.580> or<00:00:25.759> last<00:00:26.089> week<00:00:26.240> it's<00:00:26.449> a<00:00:26.599> it's

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
last weekend or last week it's a it's

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.540 
last weekend or last week it's a it's
going<00:00:27.259> to<00:00:27.320> it's<00:00:27.679> going<00:00:27.740> to<00:00:27.890> fill<00:00:28.070> up<00:00:28.189> some<00:00:28.310> gaps

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
going to it's going to fill up some gaps

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.829 
going to it's going to fill up some gaps
right<00:00:28.849> that's<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:29.240> one<00:00:29.390> thing<00:00:29.509> it's<00:00:29.630> going<00:00:29.749> to

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
right that's the one thing it's going to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.290 
right that's the one thing it's going to
do<00:00:29.900> is<00:00:30.019> help<00:00:30.199> to<00:00:30.380> close<00:00:30.919> on<00:00:31.130> those<00:00:31.249> gaps<00:00:31.429> it's

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
do is help to close on those gaps it's

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.460 
do is help to close on those gaps it's
also<00:00:32.480> going<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:32.810> strengthen<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.200> window

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
also going to strengthen the window

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.720 
also going to strengthen the window
substantially<00:00:34.040> because<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.340> turns<00:00:34.550> into

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
substantially because it turns into

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.790 
substantially because it turns into
semantics<00:00:35.360> it<00:00:35.480> sets<00:00:35.720> off<00:00:35.900> so<00:00:36.410> right<00:00:36.440> now<00:00:36.739> you

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
semantics it sets off so right now you

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.530 
semantics it sets off so right now you
know<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.130> windows<00:00:37.400> kind<00:00:37.610> of<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.180> windows<00:00:38.420> are

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
know the windows kind of the windows are

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.000 
know the windows kind of the windows are
kind<00:00:38.690> of<00:00:38.750> flexible<00:00:39.260> they're<00:00:39.410> a<00:00:39.440> little<00:00:39.650> little

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
kind of flexible they're a little little

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.350 
kind of flexible they're a little little
flexi<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:40.520> we<00:00:40.580> got<00:00:40.730> to<00:00:40.790> be<00:00:40.850> careful<00:00:41.150> with<00:00:41.240> them

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
flexi and we got to be careful with them

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.540 
flexi and we got to be careful with them
as<00:00:41.450> we're<00:00:41.630> flipping<00:00:41.900> them<00:00:41.990> because<00:00:42.170> they're

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
as we're flipping them because they're

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.590 
as we're flipping them because they're
half-baked<00:00:43.550> right<00:00:43.820> they're<00:00:43.970> not<00:00:44.000> not<00:00:44.420> quite

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
half-baked right they're not not quite

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.780 
half-baked right they're not not quite
done<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.740> so<00:00:46.160> this<00:00:46.280> stuff<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.580> going<00:00:46.730> to

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
done so so this stuff is going to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.100 
done so so this stuff is going to
strengthen<00:00:47.000> it<00:00:47.240> up<00:00:47.270> once<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:47.630> stuff<00:00:47.840> sets

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
strengthen it up once this stuff sets

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.930 
strengthen it up once this stuff sets
off<00:00:48.290> this<00:00:48.860> window<00:00:49.190> is<00:00:49.250> going<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.430> be<00:00:49.610> just<00:00:49.820> as

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
off this window is going to be just as

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.160 
off this window is going to be just as
stiff<00:00:50.150> as<00:00:50.270> a<00:00:50.360> board<00:00:50.390> it's<00:00:50.750> going<00:00:50.810> to<00:00:50.930> be<00:00:51.020> really

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
stiff as a board it's going to be really

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.560 
stiff as a board it's going to be really
rigid<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.160> it's<00:00:52.370> so<00:00:52.730> it's<00:00:52.820> going<00:00:52.970> to<00:00:53.030> help<00:00:53.240> hide

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
rigid so it's so it's going to help hide

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.450 
rigid so it's so it's going to help hide
those<00:00:53.750> gaps<00:00:53.960> it's<00:00:54.740> going<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:54.980> strengthen<00:00:55.220> the

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
those gaps it's going to strengthen the

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.340 
those gaps it's going to strengthen the
window<00:00:55.730> it's<00:00:56.180> going<00:00:56.270> to<00:00:56.480> weatherproof<00:00:57.020> it<00:00:57.170> too

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
window it's going to weatherproof it too

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.960 
window it's going to weatherproof it too
so<00:00:57.770> if<00:00:57.830> we<00:00:57.950> install<00:00:58.070> this<00:00:58.400> window<00:00:58.670> right<00:00:58.850> now

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
so if we install this window right now

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.400 
so if we install this window right now
like<00:00:59.150> exposed<00:00:59.540> to<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.750> weather<00:00:59.870> it<00:01:00.140> was<00:01:00.200> just

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
like exposed to the weather it was just

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.660 
like exposed to the weather it was just
leak<00:01:00.530> like<00:01:00.680> crazy<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.130> winds<00:01:01.310> blow<00:01:01.550> right

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
leak like crazy the winds blow right

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.460 
leak like crazy the winds blow right
through<00:01:01.730> it<00:01:01.970> it's<00:01:02.090> all<00:01:02.240> loose<00:01:02.840> in<00:01:02.990> rally<00:01:03.170> so

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
through it it's all loose in rally so

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.560 
through it it's all loose in rally so
this<00:01:03.650> is<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:03.830> sealant<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:04.879> it<00:01:05.000> seals<00:01:05.330> up<00:01:05.449> the

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
this is a sealant so it seals up the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.450 
this is a sealant so it seals up the
window<00:01:05.810> nice<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.170> tight<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:07.130> it<00:01:07.280> won't

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
window nice and tight so that it won't

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.810 
window nice and tight so that it won't
leak<00:01:08.530> so<00:01:09.530> fourth<00:01:09.860> thing<00:01:10.009> that<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:10.310> does<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.490> it

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
leak so fourth thing that it does is it

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.190 
leak so fourth thing that it does is it
darkens<00:01:11.210> all<00:01:11.329> the<00:01:11.420> metals<00:01:11.719> to<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.960> same

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
darkens all the metals to the same

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.099 
darkens all the metals to the same
pewter<00:01:12.679> II<00:01:12.710> like<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.429> dark<00:01:13.759> gray<00:01:13.789> color<00:01:13.990> so<00:01:14.990> the

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
pewter II like a dark gray color so the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.469 
pewter II like a dark gray color so the
solder<00:01:15.350> joints<00:01:15.740> are<00:01:16.280> nice<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.090> bright<00:01:17.270> right

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
solder joints are nice and bright right

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:18.819 
solder joints are nice and bright right
now<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:17.869> let's<00:01:18.049> kind<00:01:18.380> of<00:01:18.439> starting<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
now and it let's kind of starting the

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.560 
now and it let's kind of starting the
darken<00:01:19.189> a<00:01:19.219> bit<00:01:19.369> but<00:01:19.789> once<00:01:19.969> we<00:01:20.090> put<00:01:20.119> this<00:01:20.390> stuff

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
darken a bit but once we put this stuff

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.090 
darken a bit but once we put this stuff
on<00:01:20.719> there<00:01:20.960> all<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.409> metal<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:21.829> going<00:01:21.890> to<00:01:22.009> be

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
on there all the metal is going to be

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.760 
on there all the metal is going to be
nice<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.549> evenly<00:01:23.210> dark<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.170> helps<00:01:24.560> hide

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
nice and evenly dark so that helps hide

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.739 
nice and evenly dark so that helps hide
those<00:01:25.009> you<00:01:25.850> know<00:01:25.939> joints<00:01:26.299> maybe<00:01:26.479> you're<00:01:26.659> not

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:26.749 
those you know joints maybe you're not

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:28.239 
those you know joints maybe you're not
so<00:01:26.899> happy<00:01:27.049> with<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.499> big<00:01:27.649> ones<00:01:27.829> of<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.009> small

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
so happy with the big ones of the small

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:30.160 
so happy with the big ones of the small
ones<00:01:28.399> and<00:01:28.549> maybe<00:01:28.700> even<00:01:29.060> everything<00:01:29.990> is<00:01:30.049> going

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
ones and maybe even everything is going

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.749 
ones and maybe even everything is going
to<00:01:30.229> kind<00:01:30.439> of<00:01:30.499> look<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.619> same<00:01:30.859> because<00:01:31.520> the

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
to kind of look the same because the

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.459 
to kind of look the same because the
solder<00:01:31.999> joints<00:01:32.359> to<00:01:32.479> just<00:01:32.719> kind<00:01:32.929> of<00:01:32.990> blend<00:01:33.289> in

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
solder joints to just kind of blend in

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.349 
solder joints to just kind of blend in
they<00:01:33.679> disappear<00:01:34.189> I<00:01:34.429> had<00:01:34.729> asked<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.060> last<00:01:35.210> week

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
they disappear I had asked you last week

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.999 
they disappear I had asked you last week
about<00:01:35.539> it<00:01:36.170> at<00:01:36.679> all

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
about it at all

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.980 
about it at all
if<00:01:37.219> you<00:01:37.429> buy<00:01:37.549> the<00:01:37.609> bigger<00:01:37.909> pint<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.479> does<00:01:38.659> have

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
if you buy the bigger pint it does have

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.660 
if you buy the bigger pint it does have
some<00:01:39.170> two<00:01:39.560> directions<00:01:40.069> which<00:01:40.189> are<00:01:40.310> basically

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
some two directions which are basically

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.609 
some two directions which are basically
telling<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.149> same<00:01:41.299> thing<00:01:41.359> just<00:01:41.719> to<00:01:41.840> work<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:42.590> a

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
telling the same thing just to work it a

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:43.870 
telling the same thing just to work it a
little<00:01:42.710> bit<00:01:42.979> just<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.189> warm<00:01:43.429> it<00:01:43.549> up

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
little bit just to warm it up

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.419 
little bit just to warm it up
can<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.149> over<00:01:44.479> need<00:01:44.719> it<00:01:44.869> nope<00:01:45.350> no<00:01:46.069> if<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.310> want

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
can you over need it nope no if you want

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:47.620 
can you over need it nope no if you want
it<00:01:46.579> nice<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.729> warm<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.210> can<00:01:47.240> just<00:01:47.479> keep

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
it nice and warm you can just keep

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.569 
it nice and warm you can just keep
working<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.530> mark<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.280> your<00:01:49.310> hands

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
working it and the mark of your hands

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.699 
working it and the mark of your hands
helps<00:01:49.909> and<00:01:50.119> then<00:01:50.209> just<00:01:50.389> work<00:01:50.959> at<00:01:51.109> it<00:01:51.200> helps<00:01:51.530> and

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
helps and then just work at it helps and

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.379 
helps and then just work at it helps and
then<00:01:52.280> if<00:01:52.399> it's<00:01:52.549> still<00:01:52.729> kind<00:01:52.909> of<00:01:52.939> crunchy<00:01:53.270> or

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:53.389 
then if it's still kind of crunchy or

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:55.510 
then if it's still kind of crunchy or
thick<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.749> can<00:01:53.899> add<00:01:54.039> paint<00:01:55.039> thinner<00:01:55.280> or

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
thick you can add paint thinner or

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.340 
thick you can add paint thinner or
linseed<00:01:55.880> oil<00:01:55.969> to<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:56.719> it's<00:01:56.869> linseed<00:01:57.259> oil

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
linseed oil to it so it's linseed oil

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.020 
linseed oil to it so it's linseed oil
base<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:57.950> that's<00:01:58.069> the<00:01:58.249> best<00:01:58.459> thing<00:01:58.639> for<00:01:58.700> it

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
base and that's the best thing for it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.789 
base and that's the best thing for it
just<00:01:59.600> add<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.840> little<00:02:00.109> splash<00:02:01.929> so<00:02:02.929> now<00:02:03.649> we're

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
just add a little splash so now we're

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.709 
just add a little splash so now we're
ready<00:02:03.889> to<00:02:04.039> putty<00:02:04.310> but<00:02:05.029> you<00:02:05.149> need<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.450> putty<00:02:05.630> the

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
ready to putty but you need to putty the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.290 
ready to putty but you need to putty the
first<00:02:06.049> site<00:02:06.259> first<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:07.549> what<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.819> means<00:02:08.060> is

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
first site first so what that means is

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.180 
first site first so what that means is
like<00:02:08.479> on<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.720> first<00:02:08.959> night<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:09.319> guys<00:02:09.530> some<00:02:10.130> of

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
like on the first night you guys some of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.640 
like on the first night you guys some of
you<00:02:10.250> guys<00:02:10.369> were<00:02:10.550> asking<00:02:10.670> me<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.300> know

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
you guys were asking me you know

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.649 
you guys were asking me you know
look<00:02:11.799> at<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.010> lead<00:02:12.280> channel<00:02:12.579> that<00:02:13.299> you<00:02:13.569> were

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
look at the lead channel that you were

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.240 
look at the lead channel that you were
expecting<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.200> glasses<00:02:14.409> like<00:02:14.680> snapped<00:02:15.069> into

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
expecting the glasses like snapped into

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.710 
expecting the glasses like snapped into
everything<00:02:15.579> nice<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.730> tight<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.239> like<00:02:16.569> well

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
everything nice and tight you like well

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.880 
everything nice and tight you like well
the<00:02:16.810> channel<00:02:17.140> seems<00:02:17.349> kind<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.620> loose<00:02:17.739> the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
the channel seems kind of loose the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.110 
the channel seems kind of loose the
glass<00:02:18.069> is<00:02:18.220> kind<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.430> floating<00:02:18.760> around<00:02:18.849> in

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
glass is kind of floating around in

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.520 
glass is kind of floating around in
there<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.720> that's<00:02:19.870> that's<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.319> way<00:02:20.349> it's

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
there and that's that's the way it's

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.929 
there and that's that's the way it's
supposed<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.829> be<00:02:20.950> because<00:02:21.040> glass<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.549> very<00:02:21.730> in

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
supposed to be because glass is very in

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.520 
supposed to be because glass is very in
thickness<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.420> bit<00:02:22.599> so<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.140> channel<00:02:23.470> is

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
thickness a bit so the channel is

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.929 
thickness a bit so the channel is
substantially<00:02:24.069> bigger<00:02:24.220> than<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.549> glass<00:02:24.700> is

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
substantially bigger than the glass is

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.179 
substantially bigger than the glass is
thick<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.230> glass<00:02:26.379> is<00:02:26.590> floating<00:02:26.890> around<00:02:26.980> in

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
thick so the glass is floating around in

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.530 
thick so the glass is floating around in
there<00:02:27.280> what<00:02:27.459> happened<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:28.030> he<00:02:28.060> built<00:02:28.359> that<00:02:28.390> it

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
there what happened is he built that it

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.599 
there what happened is he built that it
settled<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.989> bottom<00:02:29.049> right<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.189> so

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
settled to the bottom right and so

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.860 
settled to the bottom right and so
there's<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.879> little<00:02:31.030> bit<00:02:31.150> more<00:02:31.239> space<00:02:31.569> on<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
there's a little bit more space on the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.270 
there's a little bit more space on the
top<00:02:32.019> than<00:02:32.200> there<00:02:32.319> is<00:02:32.349> at<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.590> bottom<00:02:32.620> overall

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
top than there is at the bottom overall

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.910 
top than there is at the bottom overall
and<00:02:33.579> then<00:02:34.000> once<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.299> solder<00:02:34.599> it<00:02:34.840> solder<00:02:35.439> as<00:02:35.769> you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
and then once we solder it solder as you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.530 
and then once we solder it solder as you
know<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> liquid<00:02:36.730> for<00:02:36.879> a<00:02:36.909> few<00:02:37.060> seconds<00:02:37.390> and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
know is a liquid for a few seconds and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.509 
know is a liquid for a few seconds and
it's<00:02:37.840> kind<00:02:38.049> of<00:02:38.140> seeped<00:02:38.500> around<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.040> as<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
it's kind of seeped around and as the

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.610 
it's kind of seeped around and as the
glass<00:02:39.700> more<00:02:39.970> let's<00:02:40.209> pin<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.629> the<00:02:40.720> bottom<00:02:41.049> so<00:02:41.530> if

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
glass more let's pin to the bottom so if

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.440 
glass more let's pin to the bottom so if
we<00:02:41.769> if<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.010> flip<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.430> over<00:02:42.549> and<00:02:42.790> do<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
we if you flip it over and do the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.229 
we if you flip it over and do the
backside<00:02:44.139> first<00:02:44.379> it's<00:02:45.040> likely<00:02:45.819> you're<00:02:46.000> more

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
backside first it's likely you're more

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:54.209 
backside first it's likely you're more
likely<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.629> break<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.840> piece

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:54.219 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.729 

could<00:02:54.670> probably<00:02:54.790> work<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.480> back<00:02:55.659> in<00:02:55.900> but<00:02:56.200> it's

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
could probably work it back in but it's

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.589 
could probably work it back in but it's
it's<00:02:57.459> kind<00:02:57.489> of<00:02:57.640> borderline<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.269> just<00:02:58.480> took

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
it's kind of borderline so I just took

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.959 
it's kind of borderline so I just took
it<00:02:58.719> off<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.469> you<00:02:59.560> got<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.769> scrape<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.459> skin<00:03:00.790> off

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
it off so you got to scrape the skin off

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.910 
it off so you got to scrape the skin off
of<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.209> top<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.569> it<00:03:01.719> because<00:03:02.379> this<00:03:02.560> stuff<00:03:02.620> has

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
of the top of it because this stuff has

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.380 
of the top of it because this stuff has
a<00:03:02.950> very<00:03:03.250> poor<00:03:03.489> shelf<00:03:03.909> life

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
a very poor shelf life

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.559 
a very poor shelf life
it's<00:03:04.959> oil-based<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.459> has<00:03:06.640> linseed<00:03:07.150> oil<00:03:07.299> in

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
it's oil-based so it has linseed oil in

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.849 
it's oil-based so it has linseed oil in
it<00:03:07.689> and<00:03:07.840> gum<00:03:08.079> turpentine

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
it and gum turpentine

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.360 
it and gum turpentine
it<00:03:09.609> also<00:03:09.760> has<00:03:10.090> Portland<00:03:10.989> cement<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.560> plaster

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
it also has Portland cement and plaster

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.789 
it also has Portland cement and plaster
of<00:03:12.489> Paris<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:13.659> some<00:03:13.870> lampblack<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.620> what

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
of Paris and then some lampblack is what

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.440 
of Paris and then some lampblack is what
makes<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.159> dark<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.609> that<00:03:15.819> so<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.799> oils

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
makes it dark like that so so the oils

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.410 
makes it dark like that so so the oils
start<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.599> go<00:03:19.720> off<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.980> they<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:22.329> like

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
start to go off in and they just like

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.940 
start to go off in and they just like
with<00:03:22.569> oil<00:03:22.689> paint<00:03:22.989> you<00:03:23.319> know<00:03:23.439> oil<00:03:23.469> paint<00:03:23.859> you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
with oil paint you know oil paint you

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.319 
with oil paint you know oil paint you
open<00:03:24.159> up<00:03:24.189> an<00:03:24.340> old<00:03:24.459> can<00:03:24.639> it'll<00:03:24.849> have<00:03:24.939> a<00:03:24.969> skin<00:03:25.299> on

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
open up an old can it'll have a skin on

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.970 
open up an old can it'll have a skin on
there<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.659> got<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.870> kind<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:26.049> peel<00:03:26.230> out<00:03:26.409> same

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
there you got to kind of peel out same

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.920 
there you got to kind of peel out same
with<00:03:27.010> this<00:03:27.220> stuff<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:28.120> when<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.269> buy<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.569> stuff

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
with this stuff so when I buy this stuff

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.050 
with this stuff so when I buy this stuff
the<00:03:29.680> first<00:03:29.889> thing<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.099> do<00:03:30.159> is<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.489> kind<00:03:30.639> of<00:03:30.730> squish

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
the first thing I do is I kind of squish

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.339 
the first thing I do is I kind of squish
the<00:03:31.209> can<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.599> make<00:03:31.750> sure<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.989> hasn't<00:03:32.260> turned

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
the can to make sure it hasn't turned

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.490 
the can to make sure it hasn't turned
into<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.680> brick<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.450> my<00:03:34.450> recommendation<00:03:35.169> is<00:03:35.349> to

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
into a brick and my recommendation is to

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.929 
into a brick and my recommendation is to
buy<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.709> half<00:03:36.040> pint<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.639> know<00:03:36.730> by<00:03:36.879> the

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
buy the half pint you know by the

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.179 
buy the half pint you know by the
smallest<00:03:37.359> quantity<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.019> can<00:03:38.049> because<00:03:38.980> don't

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
smallest quantity you can because don't

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.440 
smallest quantity you can because don't
look<00:03:39.310> at<00:03:39.400> your<00:03:39.549> window<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:39.909> go<00:03:39.970> I'm<00:03:40.209> going<00:03:40.419> to

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
look at your window and go I'm going to

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.000 
look at your window and go I'm going to
need<00:03:40.599> a<00:03:40.629> gallon<00:03:41.139> of<00:03:41.349> this<00:03:41.470> stuff<00:03:41.680> cuz<00:03:41.799> I'm<00:03:41.889> got

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
need a gallon of this stuff cuz I'm got

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.369 
need a gallon of this stuff cuz I'm got
a<00:03:42.040> bunch<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.340> big<00:03:42.489> projects<00:03:42.939> coming<00:03:43.120> up<00:03:43.379> coming

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
a bunch of big projects coming up coming

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.399 
a bunch of big projects coming up coming
up<00:03:44.439> because<00:03:44.650> if<00:03:44.799> if<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.519> do<00:03:45.669> buy<00:03:45.849> a<00:03:45.879> gallon<00:03:46.409> you

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
up because if if you do buy a gallon you

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.720 
up because if if you do buy a gallon you
need<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.650> use<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:47.980> like<00:03:48.159> within<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.459> month

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
need to use it like within a month

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.879 
need to use it like within a month
because<00:03:49.180> it'll<00:03:49.450> it'll<00:03:49.810> start<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.620> go<00:03:50.709> bad

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
because it'll it'll start to go bad

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.830 
because it'll it'll start to go bad
onion<00:03:51.250> it's<00:03:51.400> really<00:03:51.609> expensive<00:03:51.909> and<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.720> goes

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
onion it's really expensive and it goes

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.080 
onion it's really expensive and it goes
a<00:03:52.870> long<00:03:53.169> ways<00:03:53.409> like<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.250> half<00:03:54.639> pint<00:03:54.879> will

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
a long ways like this half pint will

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.539 
a long ways like this half pint will
probably<00:03:55.510> do<00:03:55.689> three<00:03:56.049> or<00:03:56.079> four<00:03:56.169> of<00:03:56.409> these<00:03:56.549> we

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
probably do three or four of these we

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.170 
probably do three or four of these we
may<00:03:57.730> end<00:03:57.909> up<00:03:58.000> using<00:03:58.139> you<00:03:59.139> know<00:03:59.260> about<00:03:59.970> most<00:04:00.970> of

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
may end up using you know about most of

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.050 
may end up using you know about most of
the<00:04:01.329> can<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.870> begin<00:04:02.409> with<00:04:02.560> we<00:04:02.739> probably<00:04:03.010> use<00:04:03.430> at

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
the can to begin with we probably use at

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.420 
the can to begin with we probably use at
least<00:04:04.359> at<00:04:04.750> least<00:04:04.959> half<00:04:05.169> probably<00:04:05.919> this<00:04:06.069> amount

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
least at least half probably this amount

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.909 
least at least half probably this amount
here<00:04:06.639> we<00:04:07.629> probably<00:04:08.079> use<00:04:08.229> about<00:04:08.530> this<00:04:08.979> much<00:04:09.040> on

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
here we probably use about this much on

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.219 
here we probably use about this much on
they'll<00:04:11.919> maybe<00:04:12.400> on<00:04:12.579> this<00:04:12.760> side<00:04:13.109> so<00:04:14.109> we're

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
they'll maybe on this side so we're

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:15.479 
they'll maybe on this side so we're
going<00:04:14.319> to<00:04:14.409> spread<00:04:14.680> this<00:04:14.829> all<00:04:14.949> over<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.310> place

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
going to spread this all over the place

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.460 
going to spread this all over the place
but<00:04:16.299> we're<00:04:16.419> going<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.599> take<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:16.989> much<00:04:17.199> of<00:04:17.229> it

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
but we're going to take that much of it

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.349 
but we're going to take that much of it
back<00:04:17.620> off<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.130> put<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.280> back<00:04:18.370> of<00:04:18.639> the<00:04:18.699> jar<00:04:18.909> just

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
back off and put it back of the jar just

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.449 
back off and put it back of the jar just
a<00:04:19.510> little<00:04:19.750> bit<00:04:19.900> gets<00:04:20.049> left<00:04:20.260> behind<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:21.310> it's

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
a little bit gets left behind so it's

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.460 
a little bit gets left behind so it's
kind<00:04:21.579> of<00:04:21.609> like<00:04:21.729> grout<00:04:22.000> for<00:04:22.300> tile<00:04:22.570> right<00:04:22.870> just<00:04:23.349> a

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
kind of like grout for tile right just a

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.839 
kind of like grout for tile right just a
little<00:04:23.500> bit<00:04:23.889> of<00:04:23.979> it<00:04:24.070> gets<00:04:24.220> left<00:04:24.490> inside<00:04:24.789> the

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
little bit of it gets left inside the

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.550 
little bit of it gets left inside the
channel<00:04:25.300> there's<00:04:25.479> a<00:04:25.539> little<00:04:26.139> bit<00:04:26.229> of<00:04:26.320> space<00:04:26.530> in

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
channel there's a little bit of space in

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.320 
channel there's a little bit of space in
there<00:04:26.919> so<00:04:27.159> it's<00:04:27.639> a<00:04:27.699> little<00:04:27.940> bit<00:04:28.030> of<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.180> gets

works<00:04:53.700> really<00:04:53.910> well<00:04:54.120> because<00:04:54.420> it<00:04:54.570> hides

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
works really well because it hides

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.890 
works really well because it hides
really<00:04:55.800> well<00:04:55.920> in<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:57.030> in<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.480> metal<00:04:57.720> because

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
really well in the in the metal because

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.750 
really well in the in the metal because
the<00:04:58.020> metal<00:04:58.170> is<00:04:58.230> going<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.470> turn<00:04:58.590> black<00:04:58.800> so<00:04:59.670> if

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
the metal is going to turn black so if

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.520 
the metal is going to turn black so if
you<00:04:59.880> use<00:04:59.970> white<00:05:00.210> putty<00:05:00.480> which<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.170> white<00:05:01.350> is

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
you use white putty which the white is

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.080 
you use white putty which the white is
made<00:05:01.800> for<00:05:02.010> installing<00:05:02.460> your<00:05:02.670> window<00:05:02.910> like

made for installing your window like

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.940 
made for installing your window like
once<00:05:03.270> its<00:05:03.420> installed<00:05:03.510> into<00:05:04.050> an<00:05:04.170> old<00:05:04.320> frame<00:05:04.800> or

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
once its installed into an old frame or

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.070 
once its installed into an old frame or
a<00:05:04.980> sash<00:05:05.220> that's<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.270> little<00:05:06.390> bevel<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:06.870> putty

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
a sash that's that little bevel a putty

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.840 
a sash that's that little bevel a putty
around<00:05:07.230> the<00:05:07.470> edge<00:05:07.620> to<00:05:07.650> seal<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:08.580> on<00:05:08.760> the

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
around the edge to seal it on the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.940 
around the edge to seal it on the
outside<00:05:09.090> that's<00:05:09.300> old-school<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:09.900> so<00:05:10.680> that's

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
outside that's old-school and so that's

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.180 
outside that's old-school and so that's
the<00:05:11.040> white<00:05:11.220> it's<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.490> same<00:05:11.730> compound
