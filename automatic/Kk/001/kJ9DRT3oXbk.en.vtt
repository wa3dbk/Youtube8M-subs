00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.720 
today I'm going to review the BioLite

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.090 
today I'm going to review the BioLite
stove<00:00:09.050> just<00:00:09.350> want<00:00:09.500> to<00:00:09.560> go<00:00:09.680> over<00:00:09.770> some<00:00:09.830> of<00:00:10.010> the

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
stove just want to go over some of the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.470 
stove just want to go over some of the
features<00:00:10.160> what<00:00:10.610> it<00:00:10.730> comes<00:00:10.850> boxed<00:00:11.120> in<00:00:11.420> and

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
features what it comes boxed in and

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.080 
features what it comes boxed in and
everything<00:00:11.870> else<00:00:12.050> so<00:00:12.490> here's<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:13.580> box<00:00:13.760> by

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
everything else so here's the box by

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.470 
everything else so here's the box by

life stove comes in here this one's on
hoping<00:00:17.750> I<00:00:18.470> suppose<00:00:19.340> I<00:00:19.460> can<00:00:19.610> crack<00:00:19.820> it<00:00:19.850> open<00:00:20.000> to

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
hoping I suppose I can crack it open to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.550 
hoping I suppose I can crack it open to
show<00:00:20.390> you<00:00:20.450> how<00:00:20.570> it's<00:00:20.720> packaged<00:00:21.050> but<00:00:21.230> it's<00:00:21.350> not

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
show you how it's packaged but it's not

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.920 
show you how it's packaged but it's not
rocket<00:00:22.100> science<00:00:23.770> here's<00:00:24.770> one<00:00:24.950> that<00:00:25.040> is<00:00:25.190> open

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
rocket science here's one that is open

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.990 
rocket science here's one that is open
so<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.230> stove<00:00:28.160> those<00:00:28.520> who<00:00:28.700> have<00:00:28.880> been

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
so the stove those who have been

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.790 
so the stove those who have been
following<00:00:29.210> a<00:00:29.540> few<00:00:29.750> years<00:00:29.840> like<00:00:30.080> I<00:00:30.230> basically

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
following a few years like I basically

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.569 
following a few years like I basically
uses<00:00:31.490> a<00:00:31.520> thermal<00:00:32.390> conversion<00:00:32.719> to<00:00:33.110> convert

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
uses a thermal conversion to convert

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.520 
uses a thermal conversion to convert
thermal<00:00:34.579> heat<00:00:35.450> directly<00:00:36.110> into<00:00:36.500> electricity

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
thermal heat directly into electricity

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.579 
thermal heat directly into electricity
to<00:00:37.460> power<00:00:37.489> a<00:00:37.879> fan<00:00:38.300> in<00:00:38.570> this<00:00:38.690> little<00:00:38.960> box<00:00:39.140> a

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:39.589 
to power a fan in this little box a

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:42.489 
to power a fan in this little box a
little<00:00:39.649> cube<00:00:40.489> in<00:00:40.789> order<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:41.660> give<00:00:41.899> you<00:00:42.170> air

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:42.499 
little cube in order to give you air

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:44.979 
little cube in order to give you air
assisted<00:00:43.280> combustion<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.420> it<00:00:44.539> comes<00:00:44.749> also

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
assisted combustion and it comes also

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.439 
assisted combustion and it comes also
with<00:00:45.199> an<00:00:45.499> external<00:00:45.859> USB<00:00:46.010> charger<00:00:46.999> so<00:00:47.179> that<00:00:47.300> you

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
with an external USB charger so that you

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.529 
with an external USB charger so that you
can<00:00:47.629> charge<00:00:48.190> portable<00:00:49.190> electronics<00:00:50.030> wire<00:00:50.210> on

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
can charge portable electronics wire on

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.439 
can charge portable electronics wire on
them<00:00:50.719> go<00:00:51.249> I<00:00:52.249> want<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:52.789> cover<00:00:52.940> some<00:00:53.149> things<00:00:53.179> that

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
them go I want to cover some things that

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.660 
them go I want to cover some things that
I<00:00:53.600> did<00:00:53.749> not<00:00:53.780> know<00:00:54.140> about<00:00:54.319> the<00:00:54.589> stove<00:00:54.890> really

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
I did not know about the stove really

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.759 
I did not know about the stove really
before<00:00:56.050> purchasing<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.260> I<00:00:57.469> mean<00:00:57.620> I've<00:00:57.739> been

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
before purchasing it I mean I've been

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.709 
before purchasing it I mean I've been
following<00:00:58.489> it<00:00:58.609> for<00:00:58.640> years<00:00:58.999> but<00:00:59.300> first<00:00:59.569> off

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
following it for years but first off

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.110 
following it for years but first off
there<00:00:59.870> is<00:00:59.899> a<00:01:00.019> battery<00:01:00.460> inside<00:01:01.460> this

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
there is a battery inside this

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.030 
there is a battery inside this
permanently<00:01:03.050> sealed<00:01:03.409> not<00:01:03.769> really

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
permanently sealed not really

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.439 
permanently sealed not really
permanently<00:01:04.430> sealed<00:01:04.699> but<00:01:04.970> they<00:01:05.089> say<00:01:05.300> that

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
permanently sealed but they say that

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.910 
permanently sealed but they say that
it's<00:01:05.570> not<00:01:05.659> user<00:01:05.960> replaceable<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.770> mean

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
it's not user replaceable I mean

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.120 
it's not user replaceable I mean
obviously<00:01:07.010> there's<00:01:07.460> some<00:01:08.110> screw<00:01:09.110> holes<00:01:09.440> etc<00:01:09.680> I

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
obviously there's some screw holes etc I

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.319 
obviously there's some screw holes etc I
could<00:01:10.310> probably<00:01:10.490> dig<00:01:10.759> in<00:01:10.909> there<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.210> figure

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
could probably dig in there and figure

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.230 
could probably dig in there and figure
it<00:01:11.450> out<00:01:11.600> but<00:01:12.640> basically<00:01:13.640> they<00:01:13.880> say<00:01:14.060> if<00:01:14.149> the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
it out but basically they say if the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.859 
it out but basically they say if the
battery<00:01:14.479> goes<00:01:14.689> bad<00:01:14.899> send<00:01:15.860> in<00:01:15.950> for<00:01:16.130> service<00:01:16.869> the

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
battery goes bad send in for service the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.620 
battery goes bad send in for service the
USB<00:01:18.320> port<00:01:18.350> is<00:01:18.770> used<00:01:18.829> to<00:01:19.790> charge<00:01:20.090> that<00:01:20.420> battery

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
USB port is used to charge that battery

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.200 
USB port is used to charge that battery
before<00:01:20.990> first<00:01:21.439> use<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.159> they<00:01:22.310> actually<00:01:22.430> ship

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
before first use so they actually ship

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.969 
before first use so they actually ship
it<00:01:23.390> with<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.600> little<00:01:23.869> USB<00:01:24.259> cable<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:26.979> little

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
it with a little USB cable a little

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.980 
it with a little USB cable a little
yellow<00:01:28.189> USB<00:01:28.670> cable<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:29.240> that<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:29.479> can<00:01:29.630> plug<00:01:29.810> it

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
yellow USB cable so that you can plug it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.649 
yellow USB cable so that you can plug it
in<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.500> charge<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.159> sucker<00:01:31.399> up<00:01:31.600> once<00:01:32.600> you

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
in and charge this sucker up once you

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.539 
in and charge this sucker up once you
plug<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:33.020> in<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.320> turn<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.500> on<00:01:33.710> obviously<00:01:34.369> you

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
plug it in and turn it on obviously you

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.420 
plug it in and turn it on obviously you
know<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.689> little<00:01:36.530> green<00:01:36.740> light<00:01:36.920> shows<00:01:37.189> up

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
know it a little green light shows up

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.740 
know it a little green light shows up
the<00:01:37.549> cables<00:01:37.850> not<00:01:37.939> long<00:01:38.119> enough<00:01:38.329> I<00:01:38.450> can<00:01:38.600> show

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
the cables not long enough I can show

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.810 
the cables not long enough I can show
you<00:01:38.840> here<00:01:39.020> but<00:01:39.229> little<00:01:39.979> green<00:01:40.130> light<00:01:40.310> shows<00:01:40.549> up

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
you here but little green light shows up

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.429 
you here but little green light shows up
it<00:01:40.969> just<00:01:41.000> kind<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.299> flashes<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.049> that<00:01:42.320> it's

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
it just kind of flashes and so that it's

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.249 
it just kind of flashes and so that it's
charging<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:43.600> single<00:01:44.600> power<00:01:44.719> button<00:01:45.049> it's<00:01:45.170> got

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
charging a single power button it's got

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.349 
charging a single power button it's got
a<00:01:45.289> low<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.770> high<00:01:45.799> LED<00:01:46.670> indicator<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:47.270> the

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
a low and a high LED indicator and the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.830 
a low and a high LED indicator and the
power<00:01:47.509> button<00:01:47.719> itself<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.700> way<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.850> goes<00:01:50.060> and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
power button itself a way it goes and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.029 
power button itself a way it goes and
then<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.079> can<00:01:51.229> hold<00:01:51.380> down<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.619> button<00:01:51.649> to<00:01:51.890> shut

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
then I can hold down the button to shut

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.000 
then I can hold down the button to shut
it<00:01:52.159> off

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
it off

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.120 
it off
so<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.900> works<00:01:57.140> comes<00:01:57.470> with<00:01:57.620> a<00:01:57.650> little<00:01:57.860> bit<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.010> a

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
so it works comes with a little bit of a

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.740 
so it works comes with a little bit of a
charge<00:01:58.370> I'm<00:01:58.970> going<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.150> go<00:01:59.270> ahead<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.479> charge

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
charge I'm going to go ahead and charge

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.460 
charge I'm going to go ahead and charge
that<00:02:00.430> it<00:02:01.430> comes<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:02.540> packages<00:02:02.960> down<00:02:03.170> pretty

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
that it comes it packages down pretty

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.230 
that it comes it packages down pretty
small<00:02:03.800> enough<00:02:04.100> we<00:02:04.250> can<00:02:04.400> really<00:02:04.580> tell<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> size

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
small enough we can really tell the size

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.859 
small enough we can really tell the size
because<00:02:05.690> I<00:02:05.810> got<00:02:05.960> huge<00:02:06.200> monkey<00:02:06.440> hands<00:02:07.270> but<00:02:08.270> like

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
because I got huge monkey hands but like

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.270 
because I got huge monkey hands but like
yeah<00:02:09.020> there's<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.289> full<00:02:09.649> logitech<00:02:10.070> gaming

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
yeah there's a full logitech gaming

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.370 
yeah there's a full logitech gaming
mouse<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:10.940> it's<00:02:11.120> pretty<00:02:11.480> small<00:02:11.810> here's<00:02:12.320> a

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
mouse so it's pretty small here's a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.260 
mouse so it's pretty small here's a
water<00:02:13.340> bottle<00:02:13.580> for<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.000> size<00:02:14.240> comparison<00:02:16.270> it's

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
water bottle for a size comparison it's

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.610 
water bottle for a size comparison it's
not<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.930> know<00:02:17.959> so<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:18.650> about<00:02:18.740> their<00:02:20.620> about

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
not you know so it's about their about

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.199 
not you know so it's about their about
these<00:02:21.800> legs<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.250> cool<00:02:22.430> thing<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.640> these<00:02:22.880> legs

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
these legs the cool thing is these legs

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.080 
these legs the cool thing is these legs
we<00:02:23.480> hold<00:02:23.750> them<00:02:23.810> flat<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:25.280> still<00:02:25.610> performs<00:02:26.000> a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
we hold them flat it still performs a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.199 
we hold them flat it still performs a
nice<00:02:26.270> flat<00:02:26.600> surface<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.910> sits<00:02:29.120> down

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
nice flat surface and it sits down

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.090 
nice flat surface and it sits down
nicely<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:29.959> then<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.140> can<00:02:30.290> take<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.680> actual

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
nicely and then you can take the actual

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.490 
nicely and then you can take the actual
little<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:32.000> conversion<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.840> thermal<00:02:33.320> and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
little the conversion to the thermal and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.620 
little the conversion to the thermal and
you<00:02:33.620> throw<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.640> in<00:02:34.790> there<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.209> then<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.330> packs

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
you throw it in there and then it packs

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.960 
you throw it in there and then it packs
down<00:02:35.750> pretty<00:02:36.110> light<00:02:36.489> comes<00:02:37.489> with<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.670> little

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
down pretty light comes with a little

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.979 
down pretty light comes with a little
bag<00:02:40.000> fire<00:02:41.000> starters<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.520> cable<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.510> explain

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
bag fire starters and a cable to explain

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.380 
bag fire starters and a cable to explain
that's<00:02:45.260> pretty<00:02:45.500> much<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:46.090> it's<00:02:47.090> got<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.239> little

that's pretty much it it's got a little
one<00:02:47.660> page<00:02:48.050> instruction<00:02:48.890> manual<00:02:49.340> not<00:02:50.269> much<00:02:50.480> to

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
one page instruction manual not much to

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.900 
one page instruction manual not much to
it<00:02:50.840> it's<00:02:51.110> like<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.260> single<00:02:51.590> folded<00:02:52.550> up<00:02:52.670> piece<00:02:52.850> of

it it's like a single folded up piece of

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.229 
it it's like a single folded up piece of
paper<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:55.040> know<00:02:55.130> just<00:02:55.400> kind<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:55.760> goes<00:02:55.940> over

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
paper you know just kind of goes over

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.180 
paper you know just kind of goes over
cleaning<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:56.959> features<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.739> all<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:57.980> kind

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
cleaning and features and all that kind

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.520 
cleaning and features and all that kind
of<00:02:58.280> stops<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.810> warning<00:02:59.810> tells<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.320> not<00:03:00.470> to

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
of stops and warning tells you not to

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.160 
of stops and warning tells you not to
you<00:03:01.310> know<00:03:01.430> basically<00:03:02.120> put<00:03:02.390> gasoline<00:03:02.630> or

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
you know basically put gasoline or

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.979 
you know basically put gasoline or
plastics<00:03:03.680> in<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:04.299> feels<00:03:05.299> overcharging<00:03:05.930> and

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
plastics in it feels overcharging and

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.720 
plastics in it feels overcharging and
all<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.230> kind<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.500> stuff<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:07.250> that's<00:03:07.459> pretty

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
all that kind of stuff so that's pretty

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.970 
all that kind of stuff so that's pretty
much<00:03:07.880> everything<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.450> comes<00:03:08.630> in<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.840> box

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
much everything that comes in the box

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.069 
much everything that comes in the box
instructions<00:03:10.120> bag<00:03:11.769> fire<00:03:12.769> starters<00:03:13.750> cable<00:03:14.750> and

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
instructions bag fire starters cable and

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.770 
instructions bag fire starters cable and
then<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.220> stove<00:03:16.519> with<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.940> thermal

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
then the stove with the a thermal

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.650 
then the stove with the a thermal
electrical<00:03:18.650> unit<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.940> this<00:03:20.090> is<00:03:20.209> also<00:03:20.390> pretty

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
electrical unit so this is also pretty

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.900 
electrical unit so this is also pretty
cool<00:03:20.989> I<00:03:21.230> can't<00:03:22.010> really<00:03:22.190> see<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.489> well<00:03:22.730> but

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
cool I can't really see it that well but

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.850 
cool I can't really see it that well but
this<00:03:23.030> little<00:03:23.209> foot<00:03:23.570> here<00:03:23.900> there's<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.739> little

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
this little foot here there's a little

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.360 
this little foot here there's a little
plastic<00:03:25.430> foot<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.510> sits<00:03:26.780> in<00:03:27.019> there<00:03:27.370> so

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
plastic foot and it sits in there so

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.120 
plastic foot and it sits in there so
when<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:28.610> slide<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.239> stove<00:03:29.510> together<00:03:30.130> it

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
when you slide the stove together it

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.259 
when you slide the stove together it
goes<00:03:31.340> down<00:03:31.610> and<00:03:31.820> then<00:03:31.910> when<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.120> actually

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
goes down and then when you actually

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.810 
goes down and then when you actually
fold<00:03:32.690> out<00:03:32.870> this<00:03:33.049> bottom<00:03:33.410> foot<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:34.519> center

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
fold out this bottom foot the center

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.890 
fold out this bottom foot the center
foot<00:03:36.519> that's<00:03:37.519> what<00:03:37.730> actually<00:03:38.120> locks<00:03:38.420> this<00:03:38.690> on

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
foot that's what actually locks this on

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.410 
foot that's what actually locks this on
there<00:03:39.200> so<00:03:40.160> then<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.459> can<00:03:40.610> hold<00:03:40.820> it<00:03:41.000> strictly

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
there so then you can hold it strictly

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.880 
there so then you can hold it strictly
by<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.690> plastic<00:03:42.230> piece<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:42.560> don't<00:03:42.739> burn

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
by the plastic piece so you don't burn

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.140 
by the plastic piece so you don't burn
the<00:03:43.070> crap<00:03:43.280> out<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.489> yourself<00:03:43.670> while<00:03:44.060> you're

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
the crap out of yourself while you're

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.990 
the crap out of yourself while you're
cooking

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
cooking

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.300 
cooking
the<00:03:46.000> other<00:03:46.150> two<00:03:46.300> legs<00:03:46.510> pulled<00:03:46.810> down<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:48.160> was

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
the other two legs pulled down it was

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.870 
the other two legs pulled down it was
pretty<00:03:48.490> nice<00:03:48.700> solid<00:03:49.120> base<00:03:49.300> I<00:03:49.660> mean<00:03:50.580> came<00:03:51.580> a<00:03:51.610> too

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
pretty nice solid base I mean came a too

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.690 
pretty nice solid base I mean came a too
terribly<00:03:52.210> much<00:03:52.330> but<00:03:53.310> forms<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.370> pretty<00:03:54.550> good

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
terribly much but forms a pretty good

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.500 
terribly much but forms a pretty good
base<00:03:55.740> for<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:58.330> unit<00:03:58.690> itself<00:03:59.520> I<00:04:00.520> also<00:04:00.880> noticed

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
base for the unit itself I also noticed

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.210 
base for the unit itself I also noticed
when<00:04:01.720> i<00:04:01.750> was<00:04:01.960> on<00:04:01.990> packaging<00:04:02.710> and<00:04:02.890> if<00:04:02.980> i<00:04:03.130> don't

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
when i was on packaging and if i don't

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.750 
when i was on packaging and if i don't
know<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.600> good<00:04:04.840> better<00:04:05.050> than<00:04:05.230> different

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
know this is good better than different

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.690 
know this is good better than different
but<00:04:06.760> i<00:04:06.790> also<00:04:06.970> noticed<00:04:07.330> that<00:04:08.460> when<00:04:09.460> i<00:04:09.490> was

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
but i also noticed that when i was

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.280 
but i also noticed that when i was
trying<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.060> twist<00:04:10.450> out<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:13.050> this<00:04:14.050> came

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
trying to twist out the this came

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.780 
trying to twist out the this came
wrapped<00:04:14.530> in<00:04:14.710> a<00:04:14.770> piece<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:14.980> cardboard<00:04:15.280> shoved

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
wrapped in a piece of cardboard shoved

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.130 
wrapped in a piece of cardboard shoved
in<00:04:15.970> here<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.330> so<00:04:16.420> it<00:04:16.510> had<00:04:16.630> some<00:04:16.780> pretty<00:04:16.930> good

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
in here and so it had some pretty good

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.259 
in here and so it had some pretty good
friction<00:04:17.470> on<00:04:17.739> it<00:04:17.920> and<00:04:18.160> so<00:04:18.850> i'm<00:04:18.940> sitting<00:04:19.120> here

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
friction on it and so i'm sitting here

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.120 
friction on it and so i'm sitting here
trying<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.570> like<00:04:19.750> muscle<00:04:20.350> it<00:04:20.470> out<00:04:20.560> of<00:04:20.769> here<00:04:20.920> and

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
trying to like muscle it out of here and

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.880 
trying to like muscle it out of here and
i<00:04:21.910> noticed<00:04:22.330> that<00:04:22.420> this<00:04:22.720> top<00:04:23.050> piece<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.770> know

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
i noticed that this top piece you know

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.470 
i noticed that this top piece you know
you<00:04:23.950> can<00:04:24.160> see<00:04:24.370> this<00:04:24.520> hole<00:04:24.790> right<00:04:24.970> here<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.330> goes

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
you can see this hole right here it goes

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.260 
you can see this hole right here it goes
all<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.690> way<00:04:25.870> through<00:04:25.900> obviously<00:04:27.120> where<00:04:28.120> the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
all the way through obviously where the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.260 
all the way through obviously where the
thermal<00:04:28.660> rod<00:04:29.500> comes<00:04:29.800> through<00:04:30.070> but<00:04:30.790> i<00:04:30.820> noticed

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
thermal rod comes through but i noticed

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.600 
thermal rod comes through but i noticed
that<00:04:31.330> what<00:04:31.570> i<00:04:31.600> was<00:04:31.780> trying<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:31.990> twist<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.440> out

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
that what i was trying to twist it out

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.930 
that what i was trying to twist it out
that<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.790> can<00:04:33.970> actually<00:04:34.150> almost<00:04:36.960> unscrew

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
that you can actually almost unscrew

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.410 
that you can actually almost unscrew
this<00:04:39.940> inner<00:04:40.270> peace<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.920> haven't<00:04:42.160> really

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
this inner peace and I haven't really

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.760 
this inner peace and I haven't really
don't<00:04:43.420> know<00:04:43.480> if<00:04:43.540> it's<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.780> post<00:04:44.020> on<00:04:44.260> screw<00:04:44.590> or

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
don't know if it's a post on screw or

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.190 
don't know if it's a post on screw or
what<00:04:45.100> but<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:47.680> definitely<00:04:48.750> has<00:04:49.750> a<00:04:49.780> positive

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
what but it it definitely has a positive

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.520 
what but it it definitely has a positive
click<00:04:52.919> once<00:04:53.919> it's<00:04:54.100> lined<00:04:54.370> up<00:04:54.640> and<00:04:55.110> I'm<00:04:56.110> not

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
click once it's lined up and I'm not

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.780 
click once it's lined up and I'm not
sure<00:04:56.740> if<00:04:56.800> you're<00:04:56.950> supposed<00:04:57.280> to<00:04:57.400> unscrew<00:04:57.760> it

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
sure if you're supposed to unscrew it

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.159 
sure if you're supposed to unscrew it
but<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.090> was<00:04:58.210> just<00:04:58.300> trying<00:04:58.510> to<00:04:58.570> manhandle<00:04:58.750> this

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
but I was just trying to manhandle this

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.770 
but I was just trying to manhandle this
thing<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.530> get<00:04:59.650> it<00:04:59.770> out<00:04:59.919> and<00:05:00.070> it's<00:05:00.160> obviously

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
thing to get it out and it's obviously

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.560 
thing to get it out and it's obviously
it<00:05:01.780> appears<00:05:01.930> to<00:05:02.350> be<00:05:02.440> threaded<00:05:03.390> so<00:05:04.390> that's

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
it appears to be threaded so that's

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.409 
it appears to be threaded so that's
pretty<00:05:04.750> much<00:05:04.960> it<00:05:05.880> comes<00:05:06.880> with<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.090> stove

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
pretty much it comes with the stove

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.540 
pretty much it comes with the stove
pretty<00:05:07.870> light<00:05:08.140> pretty<00:05:08.500> compact<00:05:08.950> you<00:05:09.220> can<00:05:09.280> read

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
pretty light pretty compact you can read

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.230 
pretty light pretty compact you can read
up<00:05:09.580> on<00:05:09.790> all<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:11.440> actual<00:05:11.910> weight<00:05:12.910> of<00:05:13.120> it

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
sticks and stuff that I was going to

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.330 
sticks and stuff that I was going to
take<00:05:27.940> to<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.120> dump<00:05:28.330> from<00:05:28.600> trimming<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.050> tree

I'm<00:05:30.340> going<00:05:30.460> to<00:05:30.520> line<00:05:30.669> it<00:05:30.700> up<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.180> see<00:05:31.330> what<00:05:31.360> it

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
I'm going to line it up and see what it

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.400 
I'm going to line it up and see what it
does<00:05:31.690> when<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:31.960> light<00:05:32.200> it<00:05:32.229> up<00:05:32.470> but<00:05:34.410> that's

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
does when I light it up but that's

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.140 
does when I light it up but that's
pretty<00:05:35.620> much<00:05:35.740> covers<00:05:36.340> everything<00:05:36.760> you<00:05:37.060> know

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
pretty much covers everything you know

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.640 
pretty much covers everything you know
the<00:05:37.360> instruction<00:05:37.870> book<00:05:38.020> also<00:05:38.200> talks<00:05:38.530> about

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
the instruction book also talks about

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.080 
the instruction book also talks about
you<00:05:38.919> know<00:05:39.040> windage<00:05:39.430> you<00:05:39.610> know<00:05:39.700> you<00:05:39.760> want<00:05:40.000> the

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
you know windage you know you want the

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.780 
you know windage you know you want the
wind<00:05:40.240> blowing<00:05:40.690> not<00:05:41.260> this<00:05:41.470> direction<00:05:41.770> but<00:05:42.520> this

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
wind blowing not this direction but this

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
don't toast the piece of plastic can you

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.890 
don't toast the piece of plastic can you
tell<00:05:47.080> you<00:05:47.169> to<00:05:47.260> clean<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.560> off<00:05:47.710> in<00:05:48.100> suit<00:05:49.060> etc<00:05:49.330> and

tell you to clean it off in suit etc and
I<00:05:49.960> mean<00:05:50.080> there's<00:05:50.229> not<00:05:50.410> much<00:05:50.620> in<00:05:50.650> here<00:05:51.010> but

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:51.689 
I mean there's not much in here but

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:53.600 
I mean there's not much in here but
in<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.289> little<00:05:52.589> instruction<00:05:53.069> manual<00:05:53.399> but<00:05:53.519> it

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
in the little instruction manual but it

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.649 
in the little instruction manual but it
pretty<00:05:53.729> much<00:05:53.849> covers<00:05:54.209> everything<00:05:54.479> you
