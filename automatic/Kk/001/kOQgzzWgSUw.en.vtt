00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.260
 Today we will make moro a green one 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.590
 Spanish tip especially on the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.599
 Canarian islands is eaten 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:20.130
 Of course, the coriander need it 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.670
 fresh parsley olive oil something 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.420
 lemon juice pepper salt and whole 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.849
 important for the aroma of two toes garlic 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.679
 this beautiful parsley and this one 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.100
 I have a wonderfully scented cure 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.890
 get the lemons and something 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.050
 garlic pepper and salt belong 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.860
 of course, too 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.700
 and the whole thing I'm going to mix now 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.950
 recognize 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.969
 Let's see how it will be if the fat 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.489
 I can handle style 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.789
 consciously with it 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:01.190
 because they are particularly aromatic stuffs 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.979
 that's all in the mixer commonplace that 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.540
 olive oil too 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.540
 so you see it is now running in there 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.320
 Neat olive oil because that makes that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:24.890
 metro'm going out I look times'll 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.890
 now discovered and off you go 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:43.649
 Wow, that looks great 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:47.729
 I'm a bit shadowy if you 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:53.840
 the smell could now be the garlic 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:58.110
 so that is now mixed in and 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:05.520
 the lemons 30 still from a hand 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:07.770
 not so easy but the lemon juice 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.269
 it gives the special taste 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.269
 the whole thing a bit durable 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.549
 again pepper and salt 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:33.889
 tidy now I take the lid on 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.889
 do 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:50.980
 and driving is our super great green 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:54.120
 sauce and it tastes exquisite that is 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.120
 really a herbal bomb
