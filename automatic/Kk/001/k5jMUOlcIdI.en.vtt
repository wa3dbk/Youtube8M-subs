like this is home

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.749 
like this is home
yeah<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.799> he's<00:01:34.890> always<00:01:35.130> been<00:01:35.310> upfront<00:01:35.490> about

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.819 
yeah and he's always been upfront about
that<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.060> think<00:01:36.390> that's<00:01:36.509> why<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:37.110> spent<00:01:37.530> nine

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
that I think that's why they spent nine

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.170 
that I think that's why they spent nine
years<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:38.250> Winthrop<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.759> didn't<00:01:38.939> want<00:01:39.090> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
years at Winthrop I didn't want to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.910 
years at Winthrop I didn't want to
uproot<00:01:39.509> their<00:01:39.750> family<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> think<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.710> when

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
uproot their family I think it was when

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
uproot their family I think it was when

against<00:02:07.829> something<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.789> yeah<00:02:09.720> this

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
against something like this yeah this

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.479 
against something like this yeah this
has<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> lot<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.470> ramifications<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489

has a lot of ramifications for the
valley<00:02:11.700> for<00:02:12.180> Wichita<00:02:12.540> State

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
valley for Wichita State

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.590 
valley for Wichita State
you<00:02:14.070> know<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.190> think<00:02:14.550> most<00:02:14.850> Valley<00:02:15.150> programs

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
you know I think most Valley programs

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.060 
you know I think most Valley programs
were<00:02:15.750> already<00:02:16.020> kind<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.380> fighting<00:02:16.590> upstream

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
were already kind of fighting upstream

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.500 
were already kind of fighting upstream
against<00:02:17.340> Wichita<00:02:17.640> State<00:02:18.000> they<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.330> don't

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
against Wichita State they just don't

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.480 
against Wichita State they just don't
have<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.380> combination<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:20.100> resources

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
have the the combination of resources

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.060 
have the the combination of resources
and<00:02:21.150> tradition<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.290> support<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.770> all<00:02:22.860> that

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
and tradition and support and all that

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.190 
and tradition and support and all that
and<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.640> just<00:02:23.820> another<00:02:24.120> sign<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.720> where

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
and this is just another sign of where

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.380 
and this is just another sign of where
Wichita<00:02:25.590> State<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.460> where<00:02:26.910> nine<00:02:27.180> other

people have been concerned about now for

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.650 
people have been concerned about now for
close<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.590> thirty<00:02:35.040> years<00:02:35.520> no<00:02:36.210> football

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
close to thirty years no football

close to thirty years no football
program<00:02:37.200> allows<00:02:38.010> Wichita<00:02:38.880> State<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.540> step<00:02:39.840> up

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
program allows Wichita State to step up

program allows Wichita State to step up
and<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.410> something<00:02:40.830> like<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.010> with<00:02:41.430> their

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
and do something like this with their

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.130 
and do something like this with their
basketball<00:02:42.090> coach<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.510> my<00:02:42.540> opinion

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
basketball coach in my opinion

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.470 
basketball coach in my opinion
definitely<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.340> think<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:44.940> argument

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
definitely I think if that argument

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.050 
definitely I think if that argument
wasn't<00:02:45.660> already<00:02:46.050> finished<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.590> think<00:02:46.800> probably

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
wasn't already finished I think probably

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.390 
wasn't already finished I think probably
whatever<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.330> date<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.750> April<00:02:49.140> 1st<00:02:49.400> 2013

whatever the date of the April 1st 2013

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.100 
whatever the date of the April 1st 2013
kind<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:50.970> finished<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.450> argument<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:51.989> mean

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
kind of finished that argument I mean

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.600 
kind of finished that argument I mean
you<00:02:52.260> don't<00:02:52.350> need<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> football<00:02:52.920> program<00:02:53.160> to

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
you don't need a football program to

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.300 
you don't need a football program to
succeed<00:02:54.360> big<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.230> basketball<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.980> Wichita

think we'll have to let the process play

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.640 
think we'll have to let the process play
out<00:03:11.100> over<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.700> next<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:12.420> guess<00:03:12.780> few<00:03:13.050> weeks<00:03:13.290> and

out over the next I guess few weeks and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.470 
out over the next I guess few weeks and
they'll<00:03:14.160> gather<00:03:14.489> information<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.390> then

point guard I expect him to be back and
not<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:54.540> sure<00:03:54.720> about<00:03:54.750> bake<00:03:55.170> yeah<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.739> would

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
not so sure about bake yeah I would

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.170 
not so sure about bake yeah I would
agree<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.100> think<00:03:56.250> Ron's<00:03:56.610> further<00:03:56.940> down<00:03:57.150> that

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.039 
agree I think Ron's further down that
road

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
road

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.750 
road
he's<00:03:58.290> been<00:03:58.470> here<00:03:58.590> for<00:03:58.830> years<00:03:59.070> he'll<00:03:59.340> graduate

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
he's been here for years he'll graduate

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.699 
he's been here for years he'll graduate
in<00:03:59.880> May<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.060> that's<00:04:00.450> that's<00:04:01.110> one<00:04:01.260> important

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
in May so that's that's one important

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.620 
in May so that's that's one important
factor<00:04:02.130> neither<00:04:02.970> one<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.150> them<00:04:03.299> seem<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.510> be

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
factor neither one of them seem to be

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.330 
factor neither one of them seem to be
first-round<00:04:04.200> locks<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.769> think<00:04:04.950> we<00:04:05.040> can<00:04:05.160> say

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
first-round locks I think we can say

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.250 
first-round locks I think we can say
that<00:04:05.549> so<00:04:05.790> then<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.060> kind<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.750> put<00:04:06.870> yourself<00:04:06.959> in

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
that so then you kind of put yourself in

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.720 
that so then you kind of put yourself in
that<00:04:07.380> second<00:04:07.769> round<00:04:07.950> where<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.430> don't<00:04:08.580> have<00:04:08.670> a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
that second round where you don't have a

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.699 
that second round where you don't have a
guaranteed<00:04:09.180> contract<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.350> that<00:04:10.470> seemed

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
guaranteed contract and and that seemed

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.470 
guaranteed contract and and that seemed
to<00:04:10.799> be<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:10.950> much<00:04:11.100> tougher<00:04:11.310> decision<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:12.000> we'll

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
to be a much tougher decision and we'll

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.759 
to be a much tougher decision and we'll
see<00:04:12.630> what<00:04:12.780> kind<00:04:12.959> of<00:04:12.989> information<00:04:13.110> they<00:04:13.440> gather

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
see what kind of information they gather

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.099 
see what kind of information they gather
