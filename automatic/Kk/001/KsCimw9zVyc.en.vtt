well Kaitlyn and Lucien Abedin lane

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.529 
well Kaitlyn and Lucien Abedin lane
swaps<00:04:23.340> in<00:04:23.490> our<00:04:23.610> bed<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:23.849> pushing<00:04:24.330> lanes

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
swaps in our bed and pushing lanes

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.080 
swaps in our bed and pushing lanes
that's<00:04:25.020> a<00:04:25.169> style<00:04:25.560> so<00:04:25.860> he<00:04:25.950> likes<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.250> your<00:04:26.400> on<00:04:26.550> it

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
that's a style so he likes to your on it

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.530 
that's a style so he likes to your on it
and<00:04:27.590> obviously<00:04:28.590> another<00:04:29.550> issue<00:04:29.730> for<00:04:30.090> us<00:04:30.120> is

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
and obviously another issue for us is

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.600 
and obviously another issue for us is
that<00:04:31.080> we<00:04:31.500> don't<00:04:31.830> really<00:04:31.949> perform<00:04:32.490> in

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
that we don't really perform in

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.550 
that we don't really perform in
teamfights<00:04:32.900> because<00:04:33.900> we're<00:04:34.080> play<00:04:34.260> really

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
teamfights because we're play really

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.379 
teamfights because we're play really
aggressive<00:04:34.949> in<00:04:35.070> teamfights<00:04:35.250> try<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:35.880> dive<00:04:36.120> and

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
aggressive in teamfights try to dive and

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.409 
aggressive in teamfights try to dive and
stuff<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:38.100> obviously<00:04:38.790> is<00:04:38.880> going<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.150> perform

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
stuff so obviously is going to perform

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.090 
stuff so obviously is going to perform
worse<00:04:39.690> on<00:04:39.930> champions<00:04:40.350> that<00:04:40.440> don't<00:04:40.919> have

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
worse on champions that don't have

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.629 
worse on champions that don't have
escapes<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:42.470> others<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.500> do<00:04:43.889> F<00:04:44.040> escapes<00:04:44.430> and

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
escapes and others that do F escapes and

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.340 
escapes and others that do F escapes and
I<00:04:44.729> still<00:04:44.940> in<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.300> game<00:04:45.419> are<00:04:45.720> not<00:04:45.960> really<00:04:46.169> as

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
I still in the game are not really as

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.409 
I still in the game are not really as
powerful<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:46.830> solution<00:04:47.190> or<00:04:47.280> Caitlyn<00:04:47.639> we're

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
powerful a solution or Caitlyn we're

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.790 
powerful a solution or Caitlyn we're
focusing<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.870> lot<00:04:48.990> on<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.229> positive<00:04:49.650> now

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
focusing a lot on the positive now

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.350 
focusing a lot on the positive now
because<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.190> want<00:04:50.370> two<00:04:50.520> games<00:04:50.760> in<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.030> row<00:04:51.060> but

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
because you want two games in a row but

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.719 
because you want two games in a row but
it<00:04:51.479> hasn't<00:04:51.840> been<00:04:51.960> all<00:04:52.430> great<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.550> weeks

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
it hasn't been all great the weeks

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.340 
it hasn't been all great the weeks
before<00:04:53.910> what<00:04:54.479> do<00:04:54.540> you<00:04:54.600> take<00:04:54.810> from<00:04:54.960> this<00:04:55.139> and

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
before what do you take from this and

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.020 
before what do you take from this and
say<00:04:55.470> we<00:04:55.650> did<00:04:55.770> this<00:04:55.949> good<00:04:56.250> but<00:04:56.639> we<00:04:56.760> should<00:04:56.910> do

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
say we did this good but we should do

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.469 
say we did this good but we should do
this<00:04:57.210> better<00:04:57.600> well<00:04:58.590> obviously<00:04:59.010> our<00:04:59.910> rotations

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
this better well obviously our rotations

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.030 
this better well obviously our rotations
were<00:05:00.630> pretty<00:05:00.870> good<00:05:01.050> what<00:05:01.470> we<00:05:01.620> have<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:01.919> do

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
were pretty good what we have to do

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.340 
were pretty good what we have to do
better<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.910> maybe<00:05:03.419> improve<00:05:03.960> our<00:05:04.110> little

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
better is to maybe improve our little

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.010 
better is to maybe improve our little
game<00:05:04.470> laning<00:05:04.830> phase<00:05:05.040> I<00:05:05.970> think<00:05:06.600> even<00:05:06.780> in<00:05:06.870> this

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
game laning phase I think even in this

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.350 
game laning phase I think even in this
game<00:05:07.229> young<00:05:07.440> buck<00:05:07.620> fell<00:05:07.860> behind<00:05:08.400> like<00:05:08.700> 25<00:05:09.120> CS

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
game young buck fell behind like 25 CS

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.000 
game young buck fell behind like 25 CS
because<00:05:09.660> of<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:09.870> lane<00:05:09.990> swap<00:05:10.290> but<00:05:10.740> that<00:05:10.860> was

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
because of the lane swap but that was

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.610 
because of the lane swap but that was
also<00:05:11.190> because<00:05:11.750> Lee<00:05:12.750> Allison<00:05:13.110> records<00:05:13.440> played

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
also because Lee Allison records played

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.830 
also because Lee Allison records played
it<00:05:13.740> very<00:05:13.770> well<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.340> general<00:05:15.300> we<00:05:15.450> have<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.690> be

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
it very well and general we have to be

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.840 
it very well and general we have to be
more<00:05:16.080> cohesive<00:05:16.440> as<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.860> team<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.340> I<00:05:17.550> think<00:05:17.760> we

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
more cohesive as a team and I think we

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.690 
more cohesive as a team and I think we
can<00:05:18.030> manage<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:19.169> make<00:05:19.560> that<00:05:19.680> progress<00:05:19.860> well<00:05:20.669> I

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
can manage to make that progress well I

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.010 
can manage to make that progress well I
want<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:20.910> take<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.060> step<00:05:21.330> back<00:05:21.539> from<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.840> games

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
want to take a step back from the games

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.110 
want to take a step back from the games

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
look at his k as a team they have gotten

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:37.190 
look at his k as a team they have gotten
better<00:06:36.150> and<00:06:36.419> better<00:06:36.510> and<00:06:36.900> the<00:06:36.990> players

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
better and better and the players

better and better and the players
themselves<00:06:37.380> have<00:06:37.830> said<00:06:38.070> we<00:06:38.610> weren't

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100

standings<00:06:56.640> after<00:06:56.760> their<00:06:57.180> somewhat<00:06:57.600> shaky

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
standings after their somewhat shaky

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.600 
standings after their somewhat shaky
start<00:06:58.290> they<00:06:58.680> have<00:06:58.860> improved<00:06:59.280> immensely

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
start they have improved immensely

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.360 
start they have improved immensely
somewhat<00:07:00.510> shaky<00:07:00.930> I<00:07:01.350> think<00:07:02.010> it's<00:07:02.130> a<00:07:02.220> little

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
somewhat shaky I think it's a little

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.880 
somewhat shaky I think it's a little
unfair<00:07:02.640> they<00:07:03.300> began<00:07:03.660> but<00:07:03.840> in<00:07:03.930> week<00:07:04.110> two<00:07:04.410> then

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:04.890 
unfair they began but in week two then

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.410 
unfair they began but in week two then
they<00:07:04.980> had<00:07:05.010> a<00:07:05.160> couple<00:07:05.610> and<00:07:05.880> even<00:07:06.060> weeks<00:07:06.240> but<00:07:06.390> I

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
they had a couple and even weeks but I

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.030 
they had a couple and even weeks but I
think<00:07:06.570> overall<00:07:06.870> rock<00:07:07.170> out<00:07:07.350> they<00:07:07.650> surprised

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.040 
think overall rock out they surprised

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.710 
think overall rock out they surprised
everybody<00:07:08.340> because<00:07:08.910> I<00:07:09.090> personally<00:07:09.570> didn't

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
everybody because I personally didn't

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.850 
everybody because I personally didn't
think<00:07:09.870> they're<00:07:09.990> gonna<00:07:10.080> be<00:07:10.200> as<00:07:10.290> strong<00:07:10.560> as<00:07:10.740> they

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
think they're gonna be as strong as they

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.670 
think they're gonna be as strong as they
are<00:07:11.040> in<00:07:11.280> the<00:07:11.610> LCS<00:07:11.970> yeah<00:07:12.630> and<00:07:12.780> they<00:07:13.260> are<00:07:13.380> at<00:07:13.560> the

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680
