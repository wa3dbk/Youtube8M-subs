the latter these drop crotch pants from

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.059 
the latter these drop crotch pants from
HTM<00:02:27.030> are<00:02:27.239> essentially<00:02:27.900> sweats<00:02:28.469> but<00:02:28.769> they

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
HTM are essentially sweats but they

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.610 
HTM are essentially sweats but they
don't<00:02:29.219> exactly<00:02:29.579> look<00:02:29.969> at<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.840> try<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.439> wear

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
don't exactly look at so I try and wear

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.349 
don't exactly look at so I try and wear
it<00:02:31.650> as<00:02:31.889> much<00:02:32.159> as<00:02:32.189> i<00:02:32.430> can<00:02:32.489> because<00:02:32.879> it's<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.150> so

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
it as much as i can because it's just so

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.539 
it as much as i can because it's just so
comfortable<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.319> think<00:02:34.799> that<00:02:34.950> drop<00:02:35.189> crotch

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
comfortable I think that drop crotch

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.789 
comfortable I think that drop crotch
pants<00:02:36.150> are<00:02:36.450> pretty<00:02:36.870> controversial<00:02:37.439> in<00:02:37.769> the

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
pants are pretty controversial in the

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.420 
pants are pretty controversial in the
first<00:02:38.099> place<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.700> mean<00:02:39.389> there's<00:02:39.870> Justin<00:02:40.799> Bieber

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
first place I mean there's Justin Bieber

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.319 
first place I mean there's Justin Bieber
diapey<00:02:41.790> look<00:02:42.329> and<00:02:42.659> then<00:02:43.409> there's<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:44.329> better

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
diapey look and then there's a better

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.379 
diapey look and then there's a better
drop<00:02:45.930> crotch<00:02:46.260> look<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.950> I'm<00:02:47.040> hoping<00:02:47.969> that<00:02:48.359> I

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
drop crotch look and I'm hoping that I

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.470 
drop crotch look and I'm hoping that I
look<00:02:48.840> towards<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.560> side<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:51.000> guess<00:02:51.269> that

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
look towards that side and I guess that

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.089 
look towards that side and I guess that
this<00:02:51.780> would<00:02:52.019> be<00:02:52.139> the<00:02:52.260> piece<00:02:52.469> that<00:02:52.500> everybody

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
this would be the piece that everybody

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.909 
this would be the piece that everybody
would<00:02:53.250> be<00:02:53.310> like<00:02:53.579> you<00:02:53.909> could<00:02:54.620> throw<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.680> in

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
would be like you could throw that in

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.099 
would be like you could throw that in
the<00:02:55.980> garbage<00:02:56.010> or<00:02:56.609> light<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.269> fire<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.930> I

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109
