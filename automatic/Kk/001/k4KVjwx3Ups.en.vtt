00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.210
 good afternoon with you little constantin we 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.960
 it means we are on the object which we 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.500
 did 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.469
 somewhere 2 or two and a half years ago 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.440
 under the surrender of the statute permanent to our 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:25.369
 the client is still in trouble here 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:29.130
 Here again we are here means to correctly 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:33.030
 flooded such fifth to peel off on anything 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.480
 we will first do naturally 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:41.879
 lifeguards still work very 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:46.829
 neatly need someone like that here 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.850
 stove problem enough places 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.410
 problematic 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:57.920
 let's start first clean all that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:02.039
 exfoliate then we'll go 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.770
 antibacterial bullshit i don't know 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:11.430
 probably the cheapest one bought there 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.140
 every microbial effect pounds at all 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.020
 of course football 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:23.200
 Itself occur then usually until such 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:25.360
 penetrations then we cover 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.100
 acrylic putty why 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.060
 acrylic but because it can be applied 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.030
 very thin layer of guess cleared 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.350
 on not getting enough sleep and accordingly 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:41.440
 painted paint brushes on top paint us 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.470
 will have here a bit from this parapet not 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.970
 the narrowest place to not repaint 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:53.910
 on the ceiling the whole hut 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.910
 Well, here the ceiling is still on the ceiling 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.770
 hall here this here you are on the corridor 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.170
 the kitchen to not see the drop in 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.000
 red tones . 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.950
 but so you probably already understood what to miss 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.110
 cover on the object that we are before 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.870
 did this they seem to be 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.660
 There is our fight of course times and so 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.600
 the same parapet here is true it's time to sing 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.630
 not we did well, in general, it is clear yes 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.040
 first type you really clean 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.410
 antibacterial. walk later 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.350
 usually primer potomac river 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.060
 acrylic filler look there can 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.920
 one layer can two of this 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.640
 I can't say for sure then I painted everything 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.640
 Thanks for attention
