00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
of these parts some of these are for

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.950 
of these parts some of these are for
another<00:06:06.580> project<00:06:06.790> so<00:06:07.390> we're<00:06:07.570> kind<00:06:07.810> of<00:06:07.840> have

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
another project so we're kind of have

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.860 
another project so we're kind of have
like<00:06:07.990> two<00:06:08.260> projects<00:06:08.860> in<00:06:08.950> one<00:06:09.160> here

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
like two projects in one here

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.490 
like two projects in one here
this<00:06:11.870> is<00:06:12.230> a<00:06:12.790> let's<00:06:13.790> see<00:06:14.060> six<00:06:14.780> by<00:06:14.930> six<00:06:14.990> black

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
this is a let's see six by six black

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.010 
this is a let's see six by six black
plate<00:06:16.460> we<00:06:17.180> have<00:06:17.360> some<00:06:17.510> two<00:06:17.690> by<00:06:17.810> two<00:06:17.870> jumpers

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020

plate we have some two by two jumpers
more<00:06:21.020> Technic<00:06:21.470> action<00:06:21.950> we've<00:06:22.730> got<00:06:22.760> some

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
more Technic action we've got some

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.450 
more Technic action we've got some
brackets<00:06:23.330> going<00:06:23.840> on<00:06:23.990> I<00:06:26.860> think<00:06:27.860> that's<00:06:28.010> it<00:06:28.220> so

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460
