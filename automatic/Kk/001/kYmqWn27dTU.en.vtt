well<00:00:04.049> me<00:00:04.500> again<00:00:04.819> this<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:06.000> going<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.240> be<00:00:06.390> my

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
well me again this is going to be my

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.490 
well me again this is going to be my
second<00:00:07.379> test<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.859> my<00:00:08.040> fpv<00:00:08.730> quadrocopter<00:00:09.500> now

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
second test of my fpv quadrocopter now

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.070 
second test of my fpv quadrocopter now
it<00:00:10.800> didn't<00:00:11.099> work<00:00:11.219> out<00:00:11.429> for<00:00:11.490> me<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:12.599> put<00:00:12.809> on<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
it didn't work out for me to put on the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.700 
it didn't work out for me to put on the
camera<00:00:13.590> gimbal<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.540> on<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.020> camera<00:00:16.379> because

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
camera gimbal and on the camera because

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.470 
camera gimbal and on the camera because
it<00:00:16.890> was<00:00:17.010> way<00:00:17.190> too<00:00:17.220> heavy<00:00:17.670> these<00:00:18.449> are<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.900> Kedah

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
it was way too heavy these are the Kedah

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.960 
it was way too heavy these are the Kedah
924<00:00:21.480> kv<00:00:21.900> motors<00:00:22.410> which<00:00:22.800> were<00:00:23.070> way<00:00:23.460> too<00:00:23.490> heavy

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
924 kv motors which were way too heavy

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.950 
924 kv motors which were way too heavy
for<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.650> 1.7<00:00:25.650> kilo<00:00:26.160> flying<00:00:26.820> wait<00:00:27.029> quadrocopter

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
for a 1.7 kilo flying wait quadrocopter

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.730 
for a 1.7 kilo flying wait quadrocopter
so<00:00:29.179> what<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.210> had<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:31.019> trip<00:00:31.260> everything

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
so what I had to do just trip everything

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.799 
so what I had to do just trip everything
and<00:00:31.980> use<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.579> ordinary<00:00:33.360> fpv

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and use it as a ordinary fpv

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.069 
and use it as a ordinary fpv
quadricopter<00:00:34.340> now<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.640> put<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.210> battery

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
quadricopter now I put on the battery

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.490 
quadricopter now I put on the battery
mountain<00:00:37.500> here<00:00:38.600> because<00:00:39.600> my<00:00:39.629> center<00:00:40.260> gravity

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
mountain here because my center gravity

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.490 
mountain here because my center gravity
is<00:00:41.129> has<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> bit<00:00:42.540> forward<00:00:42.840> because<00:00:43.350> of

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
is has to go a bit forward because of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.220 
is has to go a bit forward because of
our<00:00:43.620> geometry<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.690> didn't<00:00:45.960> work<00:00:46.079> out

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
our geometry here so I didn't work out

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.459 
our geometry here so I didn't work out
so<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> forgot<00:00:47.039> my<00:00:47.300> fancy<00:00:48.300> landing<00:00:49.020> gear<00:00:49.260> off

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
so I forgot my fancy landing gear off

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.850 
so I forgot my fancy landing gear off
that<00:00:49.829> same<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.280> know<00:00:50.960> now<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.020> previous<00:00:52.590> was

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
that same you know now the previous was

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.549 
that same you know now the previous was
one<00:00:53.460> point<00:00:53.699> seven<00:00:53.940> kilos<00:00:54.270> all<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> flying<00:00:55.350> way

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
one point seven kilos all a flying way

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.560 
one point seven kilos all a flying way
this<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.820> now<00:00:56.969> 1.1<00:00:57.840> kilos<00:00:58.489> that's<00:00:59.570> gonna

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
this one is now 1.1 kilos that's gonna

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.810 
this one is now 1.1 kilos that's gonna
add<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.930> another<00:01:01.320> another<00:01:01.800> 100<00:01:02.340> grams<00:01:02.579> or

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
add up another another 100 grams or

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.969 
add up another another 100 grams or
something<00:01:03.180> for<00:01:03.449> them<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> FD<00:01:04.860> we

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
something for them for the FD we

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.310 
something for them for the FD we
equipment<00:01:05.489> there<00:01:05.640> now<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.510> props<00:01:06.900> I'm<00:01:07.140> going

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
equipment there now the props I'm going

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.219 
equipment there now the props I'm going
to<00:01:07.409> test<00:01:07.650> these<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.100> from<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> 12<00:01:08.790> inch<00:01:09.229> there

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
to test these are from the 12 inch there

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.510 
to test these are from the 12 inch there
was<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> 12<00:01:10.770> inch<00:01:10.979> x<00:01:11.549> 4.5<00:01:12.420> slow<00:01:13.229> flyer<00:01:13.470> props<00:01:13.799> I

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
was a 12 inch x 4.5 slow flyer props I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.120 
was a 12 inch x 4.5 slow flyer props I
just<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.450> chopping<00:01:15.900> chopping<00:01:15.930> them<00:01:16.439> until<00:01:16.799> 10

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
just was chopping chopping them until 10

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.179 
just was chopping chopping them until 10
inch<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.680> efficiency<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.890> props

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
inch I know the efficiency of the props

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.390 
inch I know the efficiency of the props
is<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.640> good<00:01:20.909> I've<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.860> keen<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.070> try<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
is not good I've just keen to try the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.550 
is not good I've just keen to try the
which<00:01:24.119> way<00:01:24.330> which<00:01:24.750> way<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.439> go

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
which way which way is it going to go

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410 
which way which way is it going to go
which<00:01:25.799> way<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.310> perform<00:01:26.640> with

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
which way is it going to perform with

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:46.300 
which way is it going to perform with
the<00:01:27.450> lightweight<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:30.229> let's<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> go

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:02:25.920 

started<00:01:47.310> drizzling

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:55.100 

you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.660 

well<00:02:56.110> looks<00:02:56.440> like<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.830> one's<00:02:57.070> going<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.280> be<00:02:57.460> a

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
well looks like this one's going to be a

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.400 
well looks like this one's going to be a
bit<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.150> success<00:02:58.600> let's<00:02:58.900> say<00:02:59.080> because<00:02:59.290> it

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
bit of a success let's say because it

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.380 
bit of a success let's say because it
harbors<00:02:59.770> a<00:03:00.040> bit<00:03:00.280> less<00:03:00.490> than<00:03:00.700> fifty<00:03:01.060> percent

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
harbors a bit less than fifty percent

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.640 
harbors a bit less than fifty percent
trouble<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.170> I'll<00:03:03.040> mount<00:03:03.310> efe<00:03:03.790> here<00:03:04.650> start

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
trouble so I'll mount efe here start

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.010 
trouble so I'll mount efe here start
trying<00:03:05.920> again<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.400> do<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.790> fpv<00:03:07.270> see<00:03:07.780> if<00:03:07.900> we're

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
trying again to do the fpv see if we're

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.080 
trying again to do the fpv see if we're
going<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.170> crush<00:03:08.380> this<00:03:08.590> one<00:03:08.800> or<00:03:08.920> not<00:03:09.070> i<00:03:09.280> will

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
going to crush this one or not i will

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.780 
going to crush this one or not i will
probably<00:03:10.470> sooner<00:03:11.470> later<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.600> it
