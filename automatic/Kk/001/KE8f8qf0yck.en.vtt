00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.220
 hello very good to all how were they 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:09.310
 I speak to his friend jccm x 31 and today they 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.750
 I bring you a new video and in 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.750
 this video of good I bring you 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.510
 I come to talk about training 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.510
 4-2-3-1 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.660
 and good 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.350
 this formation the truth I the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.620
 mela 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.829
 and I did it because I saw it very cheap 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.839
 at first 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.739
 in the market I saw it very cheap with the 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:43.629
 players then well I said good I'm going 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.359
 to get me this training is cheap 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.429
 and I'm going to take advantage of that 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.110
 players in which for now they are 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.980
 cheap 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:58.600
 and well I did it and well I try the 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.940
 early version of fifa 13 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.670
 I do some games and I see that this 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.700
 training 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.210
 is well - balanced truth very 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.420
 balanced 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.180
 and then that's because good 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.350
 I'm going to tell you why good first 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.409
 that nothing wants to tell you that 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.650
 this training the truth has been very 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.130
 good for me and I think for me up 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:31.030
 right now the best in the game you would 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.860
 I say well of the best in the game and 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.700
 well then now I can explain why 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.720
 good at attacking the sides 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.080
 they go up they go up here to the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.009
 rise midfield arrives here already here 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.100
 arrives here rafael more or less 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.900
 two 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:57.229
 two or three quarters more of court and good 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.729
 is already there arrives and the truth is that 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.939
 after defending they go back down and 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.940
 arrive at their same positions is 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.870
 amazing because I had not observed anything 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.480
 so in another formation 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.569
 and I think it's very balanced 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.960
 how they get to attack if they go up 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.560
 rather when attacking 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:27.410
 and then when defending they go down and in what 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.540
 good is what I love because I can 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.099
 be with my party will be 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.120
 balanced my players are going to be 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:38.720
 balanced well enough so to speak and 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.750
 like the midfielders 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.180
 midfielders also go up and then 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.849
 down more blades is reached 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.140
 defend up to here until the 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.660
 goal and good is very incredible how 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.480
 you get to defend this training in what 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.730
 I like this training more, I like it 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.830
 because he defends in an incredible way 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.440
 not the way to attack the way that 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.470
 defend the truth I'm not good 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.640
 by defending nothing good they got me goals 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.430
 everywhere in fifa 12 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.490
 with this training and I have tried this 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.520
 time in fifa 3 and the truth that is very 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:21.340
 incredible I do not know anything defend I do not know 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.520
 defend very well and even then they have not 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.770
 I have scored many goals and it's something that has 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.440
 surprised well because good I'm no longer 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.450
 of those who defend as it says as I say 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.940
 I do not understand anything well 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.129
 and as I say the midfield is 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.450
 totally balanced the truth the 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:43.390
 midfield is totally balanced 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.960
 It is very good to know what 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.110
 that go up when attacking and then go down to 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.870
 defend and lower more 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.630
 seen marin who comes to defend up 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.440
 here palaces as I say so far did 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.540
 a couple I think just for this one for this 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.000
 for this part 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.879
 and pretty and good borini and only until the 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.129
 half court but I love that 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:12.590
 training to defend is incredible the 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.660
 I truly recommend it 100% 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.570
 do not 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.330
 not until now not not covered 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.970
 transformation better than this the truth 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.310
 it's amazing if I run out of words 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.370
 with this training 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.680
 and well that's what we came to say 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.150
 because I loved this training 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.210
 I come to recommend you 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.260
 well it's very good as I have already repeated 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.180
 many times 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.520
 that has been everything they only came 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.520
 recommend try tell me how 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.320
 they were with this training and nothing a 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.320
 I greet everyone and see you next time
