00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.300
 Welcome to a trip in time. I and Julian will represent couples. 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.610
 typical of each decade of 1960 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:19.449
 Let us show here how the man and the woman behaved over the years in the 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:20.159
 Brazil 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.159
 the horses got divorced may be they have had 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.070
 we are going to land in 1960 a year at home in a scenario and that of young married couples in civil 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.999
 and in the religious we condemned part of 57 years and 7% of the population 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.150
 by the age of five or more years 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.500
 who stated that she was married to the Cetesb survey here, 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.350
 members 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.730
 according to the 1960 census and this is repeated several times over the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.680
 decades 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.770
 more women denied married at the beginning the fine is the window 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.060
 either they hid their real estate with the newspaper or married more than one 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.020
 fact the data collected by the census are always declaratory 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.060
 based on civil records 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.400
 and moreover to be total or more concerned about being quiet because of the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.680
 blow of 64 because it's meanwhile I took care of 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.740
 6 children 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.630
 as a matter of fact 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.020
 the average number of children per woman at the time 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.909
 was six point 28 and divorce was widely discussed at the beginning of this 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:22.509
 decade 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.520
 only as a comma 3% of the population declared themselves separated 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.750
 in 1970 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.010
 another cup 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.990
 the bio brazil fair public list rodrigo bethlem 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.590
 the scenery has not changed much 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.859
 we are still home 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:42.639
 in the month of December on several websites only now the average per woman falling 5 

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:44.450
 one thousand to eight 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.030
 sadly yes 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.200
 this is due fairly to the introduction of modern efficient methods of 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.410
 contraception 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.530
 but we can not forget that it was in this decade that television 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.420
 colors became popular brazil 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.690
 we started to have other forms of entertainment 1983 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.430
 begins to be part of our reality 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.050
 us to marriages but we decided to have less children in the middle of the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.129
 stay tuned on tv watching the show of xuxa 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.769
 the afternoon newspaper 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.269
 the average number of children dropped to 4 comma press 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.029
 as a reflection of the 1978 law that regulated the dissolution of marriage 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.769
 the decision to divorce increased year by year 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.590
 while the focused option comes from the three-time news program pec ii and listening 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.909
 Michael Jackson 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.239
 is tall with her hair digitized in tears 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.850
 represents the Brazilian woman as the main applicant 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.770
 divorce application are our women who petition for a divorce in the 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.589
 most times 90's 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:53.169
 and in 1991 marrying in the religious was already falling out of fashion in this decade only 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:58.549
 5 comma 20 2% of the population aged 15 years or over to get married in the 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:02:59.299
 church 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.609
 just for you to understand there in 60 before the tri of Brazil 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.959
 to 20 comma 17% 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.479
 if we were to wait for the first episode of a Brazilian precedent 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:15.569
 the Tetra of the selection honoring the itaú senna dead in May of 1994 and 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.259
 we were to get married in 1998 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:23.099
 the average age of the bride would be 23 years 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.970
 nuno melo 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.649
 20 st 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:29.069
 we would have had even fewer children 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.259
 two commas in 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.509
 going over the decade 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:37.899
 from 1990 to 2000, Brazil recorded a decrease in legal marriages from the 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:42.869
 commas 7% here in the Rio Grande do Sul the fall was even greater twenty-five 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.529
 comma 4 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.369
 we arrived in 2000 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:47.309
 on here 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.029
 we joined 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:53.689
 the so-called consensus union in which the spouses do not marry miners if they saw 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.149
 still religious 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:57.809
 is the fastest growing form of union in Brazil 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.499
 and the children follow g1 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:03.849
 after squid four children 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.979
 in this decade we separated 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.879
 living in a city with more than 500 thousand 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.879
 the odds of borges were much higher 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.939
 was what revealed a service 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:19.199
 around nine comma 5% of the populations of this city arrived 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.120
 inside of you is the programmed 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.210
 he stopped 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.680
 the separation was high consensus as the majority of occurrences in this decade 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.960
 in times when they were afraid 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.629
 in 2004 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:32.790
 39 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.789
 6 percent of the taxes granted 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.449
 have been responsible for sales 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:39.319
 granted 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.650
 go to the race 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.620
 I did not waste time 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.620
 the avaí cazenove celebrated with a new woman the penta do brasil 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.999
 do not forget that I asked for the separation 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:56.460
 as the overwhelming majority of cases in 2008 71 07% of separations 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.620
 were asked by space to be able to this action in all enter divorced from 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.729
 1990 to 2001 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.729
 grew 1 211 film 6% 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:08.860
 now anyway 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.710
 in 2009 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:10.860
 of 2010 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.999
 but years later sand 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.189
 I would have 26 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.860
 I would have 29 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.570
 three years to get married compared to 1998 and I like most men 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.370
 wait only 2 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.230
 the tiles 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.210
 less than two to average with one live 8 per woman 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.990
 in 2009 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.330
 the number of registered marriages fell by 2 04% in relation to the previous year 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.770
 interrupting a sequence of increase that had been observed in the 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.969
 last years 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.560
 if we rely on civil registration 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.960
 the rate of legal marriages fell sharply between 1974 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.339
 in 2009 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:53.579
 There were thirteen weddings per thousand inhabitants. 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.869
 but this does not necessarily mean that people are causing less 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.960
 as we said before you use question interviewed you are married 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.340
 if it answers yes it is computed as married regardless if it is the 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.520
 Marriage was registered legally greeted high declaratory 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.780
 people kept getting married 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.770
 but later they separate more easily 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.400
 - humanity and more often 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.930
 and get married again 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.930
 only the children have decreased significantly 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.919
 in 40 years 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:34.629
 from 1960 to 2000 the average number of pro-woman children reduced by nearly 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:36.229
 four children 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.880
 Brazil, I started to have a population replacement rate 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.159
 each generation gives rise to a generation of children of the same size 

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:50.110
 from 2028 to 2050 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.250
 in the projection of the population made by imea jeff the average number of children per 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.490
 woman falls even more will be only the reason is simple 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.990
 and that if we move from 2002 work
