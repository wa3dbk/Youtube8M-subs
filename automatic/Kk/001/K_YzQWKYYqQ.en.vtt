and I got a rapid spin kill me expecting

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.280

do a KO it with the Thunderbolt and now
in<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.229> case<00:04:21.289> scenario<00:04:21.919> he's<00:04:22.400> left<00:04:22.699> over

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:22.819 
in that case scenario he's left over

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:26.830 
in that case scenario he's left over
with<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.479> raptor<00:04:23.840> as<00:04:24.050> well<00:04:24.740> as<00:04:25.039> his<00:04:25.840> fortress

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
with the raptor as well as his fortress

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.350 
with the raptor as well as his fortress
now<00:04:27.259> I<00:04:27.289> should<00:04:27.680> have<00:04:27.970> predicted<00:04:28.970> him<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.270> go

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
now I should have predicted him to go

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.270 
now I should have predicted him to go
for<00:04:29.539> the<00:04:29.569> u-turn<00:04:29.990> I<00:04:30.289> had<00:04:30.620> no<00:04:30.770> idea<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:31.099> thought

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
he goes for the u-turn Justin shorter

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.439 
he goes for the u-turn Justin shorter
and<00:04:44.870> who<00:04:45.020> have<00:04:45.229> enough<00:04:45.860> damage<00:04:46.370> inflicted<00:04:46.910> on

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
to the good job to finish me off so I

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.610 
to the good job to finish me off so I
supposed<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.150> go<00:04:50.360> for<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.750> right<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:51.289> mean<00:04:51.440> I

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
supposed to go for the right I mean I

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.960 
supposed to go for the right I mean I
don't<00:04:51.650> think<00:04:52.039> it<00:04:52.220> would<00:04:52.370> have<00:04:52.430> mattered<00:04:52.490> so

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
don't think it would have mattered so

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.879 
don't think it would have mattered so
much<00:04:53.030> in<00:04:53.479> this<00:04:53.599> case<00:04:53.870> narrow<00:04:54.169> I<00:04:54.380> think<00:04:54.800> his

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
much in this case narrow I think his

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.879 
much in this case narrow I think his
best<00:04:55.069> bet<00:04:55.310> was<00:04:55.669> in<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:56.060> sense<00:04:56.389> to<00:04:56.810> go<00:04:57.650> for<00:04:57.830> the

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
best bet was in a sense to go for the

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.339 
best bet was in a sense to go for the
brave<00:04:58.069> bird<00:04:58.280> anyway<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.849> mean<00:04:59.180> he's<00:04:59.960> doing<00:05:00.259> it

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
brave bird anyway I mean he's doing it

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:01.990 
brave bird anyway I mean he's doing it
for<00:05:00.380> security<00:05:01.009> but<00:05:01.190> I<00:05:01.520> don't<00:05:01.699> think<00:05:01.789> it<00:05:01.940> was

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
for security but I don't think it was

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.309 
for security but I don't think it was
necessary<00:05:02.569> is<00:05:02.690> when<00:05:02.810> I'm<00:05:02.900> trying<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.139> get<00:05:03.259> a
