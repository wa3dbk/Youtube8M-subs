00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
switch to basically long-range mode and

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.240 
switch to basically long-range mode and
deal<00:04:05.080> with<00:04:05.290> enemies<00:04:05.650> if<00:04:05.830> you're<00:04:05.980> in<00:04:06.160> a

it further ranges and of course the

opposite is that you can switch back to

at long ranges now the vex mythic class
is<00:05:17.289> quite<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.590> excellent<00:05:18.190> weapon<00:05:18.370> but<00:05:18.699> the

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
is quite the excellent weapon but the

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.050 
is quite the excellent weapon but the
huge<00:05:19.210> downside<00:05:19.569> is<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.080> its<00:05:20.500> exotic<00:05:21.099> you<00:05:21.819> may

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
huge downside is that its exotic you may

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.300 
huge downside is that its exotic you may
simply<00:05:22.389> want<00:05:22.810> to<00:05:22.960> give<00:05:23.229> your<00:05:23.380> exotic<00:05:23.680> slot<00:05:24.039> to
