teleport onto that ward inside they had

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.609 
teleport onto that ward inside they had
enough<00:00:24.630> people<00:00:24.930> there<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.140> everyone<00:00:25.529> could

enough people there that everyone could
have<00:00:25.710> arrived<00:00:26.010> maybe<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.760> potentially

have arrived maybe but potentially

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
have arrived maybe but potentially
disastrous<00:00:27.599> they<00:00:27.990> would<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.230> been

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
disastrous they would have been
