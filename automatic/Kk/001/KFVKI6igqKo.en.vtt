if I were not using my camera right now
it<00:02:14.140> would<00:02:14.380> stop<00:02:15.180> lag<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:17.320> show<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.740> it's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
it would stop lag to show that it's

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.980 
it would stop lag to show that it's
pretty<00:02:18.310> much<00:02:18.400> charged<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.120> then<00:02:19.570> shut<00:02:19.810> off
