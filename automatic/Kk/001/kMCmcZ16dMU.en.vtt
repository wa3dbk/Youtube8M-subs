00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.790
 Thomas Rail's Plarail Thomas and Percy 's Lapford Station 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.400
 It is a set 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.049
 It is still speaking of Thomas the Tank Engine Knapp Ford of the dome-shaped ceiling 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.080
 It's a station 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:24.360
 I really wanted this and bought it 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.260
 Well then, I think I want to look at the contents 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.770
 Yes it is set contents 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.340
 It's Napford Station 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.770
 Crossing to the question 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.310
 There are two types of point rails . 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.650
 And a straight rail and a half straight line 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:46.090
 And it's a curve rail, it's a curve 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.990
 After that there are Thomas and Percy motives 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.870
 And the extra dvd 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:57.410
 I'm into such a feeling 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.410
 Diaz I would like to assemble Napford Station immediately 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.960
 The Napford Station was completed with the seal assembled. 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.010
 It is good, I feel this way 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:16.190
 It becomes line 1 and 2 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.660
 And properly you're doing Toka role of and notes Nap Ford 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.660
 And this is 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.830
 Well the right 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.580
 Each has become a foreshadowing a stop 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.580
 Will continue 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.640
 If there is this 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:39.860
 It will be a great deal in Thomas 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.150
 Then I think I want to form a diff layout immediately 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.770
 The pneumonia was assembled 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.870
 That's sounds basic game Doki 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.330
 It is a layout 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:54.370
 It is size, but width is 1 meter 65 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.140
 Area also is 73cm 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.570
 It is that the height 13 cm 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.570
 It is small enough to fit in one tatami minute tatami 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:12.620
 Quite so doing to go there is a point I is Dattari foreshadowing 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:20.470
 It is a set you can enjoy running 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.470
 Furthermore , various layouts can be assembled besides this basic encounter 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.220
 I am Thomas 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.550
 It sounds too good to be I set the child is Thomas facial expressions 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.860
 Seems to be different 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.790
 It is here eh 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.100
 Here is the basic set etc. 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:45.010
 This is still head- on 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:48.290
 I'm facing, but now Napford Station's Thomas is a bit 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:54.819
 It feels like you are facing right 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.819
 It is such a feeling that straight eyes are in the right for a while 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.780
 after 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:08.840
 I Basic Set color per this is slightly different guy kinda Watch in light blue-ish 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.840
 Here it has become ish It is a gray color gray 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.350
 About Power c 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.890
 pic too 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.069
 The expression is 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.609
 Compared with other sets of depression is one bound 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.609
 I here 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.770
 It is ts 06 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.980
 It is a Percy of the set called Plarail Percin 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:39.520
 I compare it all the time but I see 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.480
 Percy of the Nap Ford station is such that the top line went slightly to the left 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.620
 It is feeling 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.620
 It's a loop 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.970
 It is ts 17 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.690
 It is Plarail Percy &amp; Plarail Rocky 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.970
 This is astonishing 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.970
 It is completely different because it is a face 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.030
 It looks like this 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:16.400
 It looks like this when stopped at Capford Station 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:21.400
 If you or whatever fun conversation It is the Thomas and Percy will have such a feeling 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 In I think I want to It is immediately Hashida
