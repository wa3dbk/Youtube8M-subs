00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the keyboard on cydia is so slow i will

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.200 
the keyboard on cydia is so slow i will
go<00:00:52.230> ahead<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.680> go<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:54.620> sections<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.210> scroll

trick

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.620 

so<00:01:18.320> tap<00:01:18.710> install<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.640> then<00:01:19.670> confirm<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:22.630> you

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
don't have to go to sections and then

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.749 
don't have to go to sections and then
scroll<00:01:26.330> down<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.720> tweaks<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.259> can<00:01:27.440> just<00:01:27.799> go<00:01:28.729> to

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
scroll down to tweaks you can just go to

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.149 
scroll down to tweaks you can just go to
search<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.240> search<00:01:29.869> for<00:01:29.930> battery<00:01:30.710> control

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
search and search for battery control

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.800 
search and search for battery control
but<00:01:31.430> like<00:01:32.270> i<00:01:32.420> said<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.979> cydia<00:01:34.630> keyboard<00:01:35.630> is

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
but like i said the cydia keyboard is

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.859 
but like i said the cydia keyboard is
very<00:01:36.110> slow<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.040> i<00:01:37.399> will<00:01:38.149> do<00:01:38.330> it<00:01:38.479> this<00:01:38.630> way

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
very slow so i will do it this way

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.320 
very slow so i will do it this way
instead<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:41.690> now<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:43.130> says<00:01:43.369> reloading<00:01:44.119> data

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
instead and now it says reloading data

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.300 
instead and now it says reloading data
so<00:01:45.220> just<00:01:46.220> wait<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.430> few<00:01:46.880> seconds<00:01:47.659> it<00:01:48.649> will<00:01:48.920> be

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
so just wait a few seconds it will be

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.270 
so just wait a few seconds it will be
done<00:01:50.119> in<00:01:50.149> a<00:01:50.420> minute<00:01:50.509> like<00:01:51.050> that<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.530> there

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
done in a minute like that and there

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.590 
done in a minute like that and there
will<00:01:52.399> be<00:01:52.429> a<00:01:52.550> tab<00:01:52.910> at<00:01:53.179> the<00:01:53.240> bottom<00:01:53.979> saying

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
will be a tab at the bottom saying

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.300 
will be a tab at the bottom saying
restart<00:01:56.600> springboard<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:58.580> tap<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.330> and<00:02:00.310> it

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
restart springboard so tap that and it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:13.290 
restart springboard so tap that and it
will<00:02:01.520> load<00:02:01.789> once<00:02:02.119> again

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.910 

like<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:15.640> now<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:17.270> perhaps<00:02:18.020> can<00:02:18.620> see

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
like that and now you perhaps can see

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.660
