little<00:03:22.030> sleeve<00:03:22.450> on<00:03:22.690> them<00:03:22.870> makes<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.890> look<00:03:24.099> nice

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
little sleeve on them makes it look nice

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.690 
little sleeve on them makes it look nice
also<00:03:24.940> adds<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.599> lot<00:03:26.379> of<00:03:26.530> flexibility<00:03:27.220> here<00:03:27.549> in

also adds a lot of flexibility here in

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
one issue I had with these you can see

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.500 
one issue I had with these you can see
watch<00:03:40.540> when<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:40.810> pick<00:03:40.989> this<00:03:41.140> up<00:03:42.239> nothing<00:03:43.239> likes

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
watch when I pick this up nothing likes

watch when I pick this up nothing likes
to<00:03:43.690> change<00:03:44.019> form<00:03:44.500> these<00:03:44.769> cables<00:03:45.370> are<00:03:45.579> stiff

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
to change form these cables are stiff

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.330 
to change form these cables are stiff
they're<00:03:46.390> like<00:03:46.599> a<00:03:46.980> cheap<00:03:47.980> 4<00:03:48.340> gauge<00:03:48.579> cable<00:03:48.910> stiff

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
they're like a cheap 4 gauge cable stiff

they're like a cheap 4 gauge cable stiff
they<00:03:51.340> they<00:03:51.879> just<00:03:52.120> didn't<00:03:52.480> they<00:03:52.569> don't<00:03:52.750> like<00:03:52.900> to

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
they they just didn't they don't like to

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.680 
they they just didn't they don't like to
move<00:03:53.790> like<00:03:54.790> they<00:03:55.030> like<00:03:55.209> I'm<00:03:55.329> putting<00:03:55.480> some

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
move like they like I'm putting some

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.880 
move like they like I'm putting some
pressure<00:03:55.840> too<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.379> can<00:03:56.530> see<00:03:56.709> it's

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
pressure too and you can see it's

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.680 
pressure too and you can see it's
turning<00:03:57.400> into<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:57.610> circle<00:03:58.030> there<00:03:58.180> on<00:03:58.329> its<00:03:58.510> own

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
turning into a circle there on its own

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.309 
turning into a circle there on its own
which<00:03:59.440> means<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.829> doesn't<00:04:00.129> want<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.340> crease

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
which means it doesn't want to crease

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.809 
which means it doesn't want to crease
you<00:04:02.319> can<00:04:02.470> see<00:04:02.680> it's<00:04:02.829> trying<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.190> hold<00:04:03.579> that

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
you can see it's trying to hold that

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.800 
you can see it's trying to hold that
circle<00:04:04.299> um<00:04:05.609> yeah<00:04:06.609> that's<00:04:06.819> that's<00:04:07.299> not<00:04:07.600> that

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
circle um yeah that's that's not that

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.710 
circle um yeah that's that's not that
great<00:04:08.139> um<00:04:09.010> as<00:04:09.370> far<00:04:09.549> as<00:04:09.609> flexibility<00:04:10.269> goes<00:04:10.510> my

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
great um as far as flexibility goes my

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.300 
great um as far as flexibility goes my
cheap<00:04:10.989> ones<00:04:11.200> are<00:04:11.410> way<00:04:11.500> more<00:04:11.530> flexible<00:04:12.160> that

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
cheap ones are way more flexible that

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.660 
cheap ones are way more flexible that
also<00:04:13.440> they<00:04:14.440> probably<00:04:14.739> don't<00:04:15.099> have<00:04:15.280> as<00:04:15.519> much

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
also they probably don't have as much

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.870 
also they probably don't have as much
jacketing<00:04:16.660> protection<00:04:17.380> or<00:04:17.620> whatnot<00:04:17.889> these

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
jacketing protection or whatnot these

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.020 
jacketing protection or whatnot these
being<00:04:19.209> more<00:04:19.750> heavy-duty<00:04:20.169> cables<00:04:21.030> probably

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
being more heavy-duty cables probably

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.750 
being more heavy-duty cables probably
harder<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.720> mess<00:04:23.590> up<00:04:23.800> on<00:04:23.979> the<00:04:24.010> outside<00:04:24.520> but

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
harder to mess up on the outside but

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.969 
harder to mess up on the outside but
here's<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.660> two-channel<00:04:26.110> same<00:04:26.560> kind<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:26.830> deal

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
here's the two-channel same kind of deal

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.480 
here's the two-channel same kind of deal
going<00:04:27.370> on<00:04:27.430> here<00:04:27.729> at<00:04:27.789> the<00:04:27.940> ends<00:04:29.130> these<00:04:30.130> are<00:04:30.340> both

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
going on here at the ends these are both

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.900 
going on here at the ends these are both
I<00:04:30.729> think<00:04:31.830> forget<00:04:32.830> how<00:04:32.950> long<00:04:33.130> I<00:04:33.190> got<00:04:33.370> I<00:04:33.520> think

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
I think forget how long I got I think

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.310 
I think forget how long I got I think
there's<00:04:34.060> three<00:04:34.210> or<00:04:34.389> four<00:04:34.419> meters<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:35.229> only

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
there's three or four meters I only

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.370 
there's three or four meters I only
needed<00:04:35.650> about<00:04:35.710> 9-foot<00:04:36.490> cables<00:04:37.200> since<00:04:38.200> these

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
needed about 9-foot cables since these

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.210 
needed about 9-foot cables since these

straight into the amp I don't know if

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.420 
straight into the amp I don't know if
I'll<00:04:54.880> hear<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.229> difference<00:04:56.229> in<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.620> sound<00:04:56.860> due

I'll hear a difference in the sound due

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.780 
I'll hear a difference in the sound due
to

watching guys um just as a little
interior<00:06:01.630> these<00:06:01.930> are<00:06:02.230> pretty<00:06:02.500> much<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:02.890> mid

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
interior these are pretty much the mid

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.460 
interior these are pretty much the mid
grade<00:06:03.690> rca's<00:06:04.690> I<00:06:04.840> probably<00:06:05.200> should<00:06:05.440> have

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
grade rca's I probably should have

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.320 
grade rca's I probably should have
mentioned<00:06:05.590> this<00:06:05.860> earlier<00:06:06.040> there's<00:06:06.490> a<00:06:06.760> I<00:06:07.060> think

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
mentioned this earlier there's a I think

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.890 
mentioned this earlier there's a I think
an<00:06:07.420> e<00:06:07.630> KS<00:06:08.220> series<00:06:09.220> two<00:06:09.790> different<00:06:10.180> e<00:06:10.270> KS<00:06:10.570> series

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
an e KS series two different e KS series

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.120 
an e KS series two different e KS series
above<00:06:11.260> these<00:06:11.530> and<00:06:11.890> then<00:06:12.820> there<00:06:13.120> is<00:06:13.500> the<00:06:14.500> basics

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
above these and then there is the basics

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.890 
above these and then there is the basics
which<00:06:15.370> are<00:06:15.550> the<00:06:15.670> low<00:06:15.880> line<00:06:17.490> and<00:06:18.720> then<00:06:19.720> there's

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
which are the low line and then there's

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.690 
which are the low line and then there's
two<00:06:20.140> there's<00:06:20.380> two<00:06:20.560> other<00:06:20.740> ones<00:06:21.010> there's<00:06:21.430> three

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
two there's two other ones there's three

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.310 
two there's two other ones there's three
below<00:06:21.970> this<00:06:22.120> and<00:06:22.360> two<00:06:22.480> above<00:06:22.720> it<00:06:22.870> so<00:06:23.080> this<00:06:23.230> is

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
below this and two above it so this is

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.100 
below this and two above it so this is
about<00:06:23.500> dead<00:06:23.940> center<00:06:24.940> mid<00:06:25.150> grade<00:06:25.450> uh<00:06:25.690> bones<00:06:25.900> are

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
about dead center mid grade uh bones are

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.160 
about dead center mid grade uh bones are
a<00:06:26.140> little<00:06:26.410> bit<00:06:26.590> more<00:06:26.620> expensive<00:06:27.690> which<00:06:28.690> goes

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
a little bit more expensive which goes

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.600 
a little bit more expensive which goes
up<00:06:29.440> and<00:06:29.740> then<00:06:29.800> the<00:06:29.920> other<00:06:29.950> ones<00:06:30.310> are<00:06:30.550> cheaper

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
up and then the other ones are cheaper

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.900 
up and then the other ones are cheaper
of<00:06:31.240> course<00:06:31.510> when<00:06:31.810> they<00:06:31.930> go<00:06:32.050> down<00:06:32.080> so<00:06:32.910> that

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
of course when they go down so that

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.310 
of course when they go down so that
about<00:06:34.150> wrap<00:06:34.330> it<00:06:34.450> up<00:06:34.570> guys<00:06:34.600> thanks<00:06:35.200> for
