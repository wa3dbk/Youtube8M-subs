00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hi friends from youtube i am anibal pro and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.140
 I bring you another video is about the 7 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.769
 most terrifying games of the good world 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.019
 active the 7 prohibited games exist 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.030
 in the world different games that many 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.430
 children dare or people dare to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.500
 perform but they are very dangerous as 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.600
 again I insist this material 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.730
 it requires discretion and a mature mind and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.769
 conscious to understand I do not do 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.820
 responsible for damages and losses to 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.859
 third persons 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.140
 if you are here it is because you are a person 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.120
 conscious and rational to understand and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.880
 look for answers to your concerns in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.860
 that in this world you will not find good 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.600
 how is the title there are different 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.579
 games that many have done or 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.500
 they make through their lives games that 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.230
 they can be dangerous if they are not played 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.300
 with due discretion and respect this is not 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.520
 It's a tutorial for you to practice these 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.160
 games but an explanation and help if 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.500
 you've done it before I reiterate 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.280
 this is not a game is dangerous so 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.260
 do not try number 1 the peg the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.180
 Peg is a means by which it is a way 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.799
 to establish a contact with spirits 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.780
 beyond the usually 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.090
 entities that are presented there are 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.460
 this is a game that is a table with 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.250
 alphabet letters and numbers and with the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.170
 words if there is no goodbye and you have a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.150
 triangular planch with which 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.159
 they support people's fingers and touch 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.920
 gently that planchita so that the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.780
 plancheta will begin to move alone this 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.090
 is a very dangerous game because if the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.770
 person is very susceptible or has a lot 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.170
 fear that entity may take 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.750
 control over him feeding on his 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.280
 fears instead if a person is 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.110
 aware of herself and has a 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.479
 respect towards this game nothing will happen 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.490
 as you remember everyone is aware 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.410
 of his body and his movements no 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.300
 zero entity will take your body if your 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.940
 you are aware of yourself and your surroundings 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.800
 remember to dismiss that entity and never 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.960
 separate the fingers at any time from 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.729
 the plancheta if they do not dismiss that one 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.100
 entity can lead to bad consequences 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.470
 because that entity will stay there and it 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.450
 Angers the spirits are like us 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.399
 they have feelings and they will feel 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.380
 happy to talk to someone 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.270
 But if you miss them, they will feel bad and 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.030
 frustrate and could tie you because it 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.280
 they will feel misunderstood they are like 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.079
 we think if someone gives you 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.920
 your back and it does not listen to you and you what 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.080
 more you want is 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.060
 that person gets frustrated and 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.160
 you start saying inside because 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.590
 do not listen to me or start saying ah give me 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.200
 the same thing that person or say doodles 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.060
 in the mind towards that person so 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.319
 feel a spirit that only wants to be 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.510
 included number 2 the good red book 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.670
 This game is played using a book 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.830
 old hardcover and red and a candle 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.989
 red leaning on the game table 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.970
 players begin to say red book 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.220
 red book and they ask the question that 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.260
 want and at the time of asking close 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.390
 the eyes and with the hands put in the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.190
 book then they start to run the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.470
 pages with the left hand in 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.390
 any random page and with your hand 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.280
 right to indicate any point on the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.950
 book and the response of the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.630
 question sometimes asked at the beginning 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.430
 the answers will be wrong or 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.380
 simply meaningless is because 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.420
 no entity has presented the 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.370
 game you must finish it in the same way 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.019
 that the ouija must fire the spirit 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.910
 when he says goodbye, it's better 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.799
 close the book and keep it as if 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.810
 you do not do it another entity could be 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.350
 playing with you and it may not be what 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.490
 what did you expect 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.560
 3 Russian roulette the Russian roulette was played 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.600
 formerly by soldiers of times 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.370
 old ones in which with a revolver 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.560
 put a bullet was turning the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.420
 tourniquet and placed on the temple the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.400
 gun and if it did not fire it followed 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.960
 playing the game ended when a 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.180
 player died and took the 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.200
 belongings of the other player who bet 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.030
 number 4 the game of the cup is the same 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.480
 that the ouija only that a 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.720
 cup instead of a plate number 5 the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.790
 Devil in the mirror plays a 25 of 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.950
 December one Holy Friday- dates 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.260
 recognized by all by birth or 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.660
 death of jesus in which the devil 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.580
 take advantage of that Jesus is not a 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.130
 Devil's mockery mode in which the 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.200
 devil has dominion the earth is going 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.150
 candles are placed in a bathroom mirror 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.130
 turn off the light and in a span you will see the 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.280
 Devil the time to do it is at 3 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.410
 in the morning or at the time of day this is 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.840
 a mockery since Jesus died at 3 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.180
 there are few known cases in the afternoon 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.570
 but it's better not to try to challenge with 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.670
 the unknown number 6 the game of 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.550

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.470
 in front of a mirror and the spirit does not 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.890
 will leave you calm until you kill number 7 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.260
 the game do not look back this game is 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.940
 it does in some old house I say old 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.980
 because there are more chances that 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.990
 spirits are hovering around that house 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.670
 you must place papers with invitations 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.800
 at each door of the house typing 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.540
 I invite you to my world and indicating the 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.700
 start time and the end time of 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.710
 that game do not take too much time anymore 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.900
 that despair and madness will end 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.390
 with you apart from something you can never 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.460
 tell then you must choose a space that 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.380
 you like it and remove all the mirrors from 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.300
 that place when you're about to start 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.520
 the game you must stand in front 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.200
 of some wall chosen through 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.820
 that room chosen without the 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.130
 mirrors and looking towards the wall 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.870
 start to close your eyes and you'll start 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.850
 to hear how your spirits roam 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.220
 around them they will take control of the 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.260
 things or say noises things that fall 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.330
 but you should not feel afraid because if not 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.490
 You look back and you keep off anything you 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.350
 will occur when the time of the 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.849
 game you can march in peace and the game 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.860
