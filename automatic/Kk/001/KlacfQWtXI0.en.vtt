00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.450
 launched in 2012 the model remains for 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.710
 the moment the only model of the range 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.230
 tesla but sees his technical sheet 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.540
 evolves with the arrival of models 85 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.340
 the hi fi signs of evil like two 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.160
 engines one in the front and one in the back 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.439
 the s 85 models of the four-wheeled probes 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.939
 peace motives being distinguished from the 85 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.269
 tout court by his power over 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.580
 high 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.740
 it offers the equivalent of 700 horses 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.330
 and a maximum torque of 930 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.859
 newtons-meters it's simply the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.480
 best-performing series sedan 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.520
 with a 0 to 100 advertised in three 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.559
 seconds 4 is still of course without 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.149
 a drop of gasoline inside 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.010
 the 17-inch center screen 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.670
 spectacular remains a record in the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.710
 automotive world 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.390
 it controls most of the functions of 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.070
 the sunroof car at the settings 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.039
 from the engine brake through the mode 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 literally mad insane giving access 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.610
 to all the power 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.469
 we recognize some komodo mercedes that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.730
 and there the finish is correct but 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.280
 less neat than that of a series 5 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.050
 for example the model s out passage 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.699
 to be an excellent family with a 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.100
 remarkable rear habitability for 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.630
 passengers and more than 700 decimetres 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 cubes for luggage with chests 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.740
 front and back tesla requires start 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.200
 silently but quickly we want to 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.280
 find out if the 700 horsepower and 939 omits from 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.950
 cup are there after having 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.330
 selected the mode intentionally verdict 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.770
 instant with a push 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.830
 impressive equivalent to that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.810
 of a 911 turbo petrol have except 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.189
 some aerodynamic noises the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.930
 motor skills are impeccable and we feel a 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.060
 preponderant torque distribution on 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.560
 the back despite more than two tons 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.570
 two sets and this remains surprisingly 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.579
 dynamic thanks to 60 of very low gravity 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.409
 and his direct direction of even a 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.780
 feeling of agility alone braking 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.070
 lack of bite 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.420
 another surprise with comfort all to 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.860
 makes decent on the small roads 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.119
 degraded from another and this is our 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.640
 model's was surprisingly 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.619
 considerate brief we go from surprises in 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.850
 surprises with this p 85 of which 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.590
 simply becomes the sedan the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.299
 world's best performer by being 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.829
 also one of the most livable very 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.240
 high tech with more updates 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.610
 like that of your smartphone that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.350
 adds new features 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.000
 let's say it bluntly this p 85 of and 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.950
 bluffing in more ways than one 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.350
 at one hundred thousand euros it seems almost 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.590
 reasonable especially as m5 or e63 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.979
 amg are 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.979
 a more expensive
