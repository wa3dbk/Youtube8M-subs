00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
quality starter kit is because we like

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.779 
quality starter kit is because we like
to<00:00:26.320> think<00:00:26.470> that<00:00:26.650> you're<00:00:26.769> going<00:00:26.920> to<00:00:27.039> continue

don't get so a nightmare because they
have<00:00:54.969> so<00:00:55.329> many<00:00:55.570> components<00:00:55.870> that<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:57.309> need<00:00:57.550> to

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
have so many components that you need to

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.040 
have so many components that you need to
set<00:00:58.239> down<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:58.570> play

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
set down and play

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.200

so we'll just talk about a few features

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.590 
so we'll just talk about a few features
that<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:07.479> have<00:01:07.510> on<00:01:07.869> a<00:01:07.900> kit<00:01:08.229> this<00:01:08.560> level<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.330> our

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
that we have on a kit this level the our

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.690 
that we have on a kit this level the our
kits<00:01:10.960> twenty<00:01:11.530> thirty<00:01:11.770> quid<00:01:12.040> cheaper<00:01:12.100> than

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
kits twenty thirty quid cheaper than

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.630 
kits twenty thirty quid cheaper than
certain<00:01:13.060> kits<00:01:13.240> that<00:01:13.330> we<00:01:13.510> would<00:01:13.689> do<00:01:13.900> but<00:01:14.490> why<00:01:15.490> we

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
certain kits that we would do but why we

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.090 
certain kits that we would do but why we
don't<00:01:15.760> touch<00:01:15.970> them<00:01:16.210> as<00:01:16.360> mainly<00:01:16.689> because

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
don't touch them as mainly because

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.170 
don't touch them as mainly because
component<00:01:18.100> parts<00:01:18.430> are<00:01:18.549> made<00:01:18.729> in<00:01:18.880> different

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
component parts are made in different

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.719 
component parts are made in different
factories<00:01:20.140> they're<00:01:20.680> not<00:01:20.890> as<00:01:21.009> good<00:01:21.040> quality

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
factories they're not as good quality

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.070 
factories they're not as good quality
they're<00:01:22.380> assembled<00:01:23.380> one<00:01:23.920> year<00:01:24.810> sound<00:01:25.810> phrase

they're assembled one year sound phrase
level<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.770> then<00:01:26.979> next<00:01:27.220> again<00:01:27.369> year<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:27.820> use

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
level and then next again year that use

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.510 
level and then next again year that use
different<00:01:28.299> parts<00:01:28.509> again<00:01:28.900> this<00:01:29.350> way<00:01:29.590> we<00:01:30.220> always

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
different parts again this way we always

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.420 
different parts again this way we always
have<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> good<00:01:31.000> consistent<00:01:31.810> drum<00:01:32.710> kit<00:01:33.009> which<00:01:33.250> we
