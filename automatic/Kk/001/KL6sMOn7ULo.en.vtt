so<00:01:10.119> this<00:01:10.330> was<00:01:10.630> one<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:10.840> my<00:01:11.380> very<00:01:11.409> first<00:01:12.009> pieces

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
so this was one of my very first pieces

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.700 
so this was one of my very first pieces
around<00:01:13.900> six<00:01:14.590> years<00:01:14.950> ago<00:01:15.100> and<00:01:15.970> um<00:01:16.900> it<00:01:17.650> was

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
around six years ago and um it was

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.050 
around six years ago and um it was
really<00:01:18.119> influenced<00:01:19.119> by<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.960> spiders<00:01:20.590> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
really influenced by the spiders the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.570 
really influenced by the spiders the
sculpture<00:01:22.060> of<00:01:22.090> my<00:01:22.330> mom<00:01:22.509> that<00:01:22.869> was<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.140> huge

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
sculpture of my mom that was a huge

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.840 
sculpture of my mom that was a huge
influence<00:01:24.580> on<00:01:24.850> me<00:01:25.420> because<00:01:25.869> of<00:01:26.580> spiders<00:01:27.580> and

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
influence on me because of spiders and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.389 
influence on me because of spiders and

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
weaving so I did a lot of hand crochet

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:48.240 
weaving so I did a lot of hand crochet
and<00:01:30.670> work<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.539> into<00:01:31.750> dresses<00:01:46.830> what<00:01:47.830> I<00:01:47.860> really

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
and work that into dresses what I really

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.540 
and work that into dresses what I really
love<00:01:48.399> about<00:01:48.429> her<00:01:48.850> work<00:01:49.090> is<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:50.550> textile

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
inside the metal cages like her cell

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.410 
inside the metal cages like her cell
series<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.709> really<00:02:33.120> thought<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.180> was

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
series and I really thought that was

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.150 
series and I really thought that was
really<00:02:34.780> exciting<00:02:35.260> because<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.500> think<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.950> gave

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
really exciting because I think it gave

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.160 
really exciting because I think it gave
clothes<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.239> fashion<00:02:37.450> real<00:02:38.310> content<00:02:39.310> this
