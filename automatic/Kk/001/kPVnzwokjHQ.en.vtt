00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
actually enhance the curl but this book

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.670 
actually enhance the curl but this book
right<00:02:25.150> here<00:02:25.230> definitely<00:02:26.230> turned<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.620> around

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
right here definitely turned that around
