00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.970
 became well as landscapes so I 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.620
 am explaining in love 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.540
 how do we make dishes ben there 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.700
 minimal maintenance when doing a 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.320
 flower bed when we have prepared the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.219
 flower bed all that is fantastic and 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.640
 for many weeds that 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.980
 push one puts from the country but often to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.690
 grass edge level that goes 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.330
 get into the flatbed then we 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.030
 can use a plastic lined 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.070
 good quality that's a strategy 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.350
 however at the aesthetic level of times 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.289
 it's a little less interesting and 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.699
 the other technique is really 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:41.940
 dig a trench to impose flood 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:46.679
 so we believed 5 inches of flood and by the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.850
 next we 're going to put some going 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.089
 equalize instruct 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.249
 by then a lot of clay so we go 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.890
 face and we will put the country back on 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:01:01.499
 two fake ones so we have a 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.850
 two minimum breaks from huy hÃ  where there is 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.350
 really no way that healing 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.270
 can go in because you have to compensate 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.760
 that gas made 2 inch reasons 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.340
 hollow it is more than 2 inches is 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.290
 sure but of the country tied with the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.420
 border well we'll have the grass that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.690
 will go into the skin god in the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.670
 country 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.560
 then do not have the grass that misses 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.630
 in one case or in reaching his 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.830
 wife does not ask to pay why that is 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.320
 weeds that poses in the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.240
 boarder and two positions where we 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:39.320
 why what horizon more to enter nor 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:39.320
 internet is that it will come back 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:53.020
 yes no can equalize in the mood for 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.510
 help here is good but we'll see 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.780
 his italy it was rameal wood which 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.880
 is very good rameal wood is a little 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.500
 least had carved black but seine 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:10.710
 it's much more efficient for the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.710
 soil fertility to be two bumps 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.900
 of which twenty two breaks two countries 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.850
 have this not a little more 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.310
 that's not bad that yeah because 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.910
 it is a food more than alone here it is 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.910
 we're going to put a little
