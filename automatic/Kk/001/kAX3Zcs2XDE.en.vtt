it five four three two one
and<00:02:06.329> take<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> break<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> more

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
and take a break so this is a more

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.279 
and take a break so this is a more
advanced<00:02:08.580> exercise<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.509> our<00:02:09.690> level<00:02:10.080> two

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
for time-saving workout so a lot of

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.280 
for time-saving workout so a lot of
times<00:02:20.310> we<00:02:20.459> don't<00:02:20.549> have<00:02:20.819> more<00:02:21.060> than<00:02:21.120> 45<00:02:21.989> minutes

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290

and<00:02:28.290> looks<00:02:28.560> great<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:29.400> would<00:02:29.730> do<00:02:29.879> about<00:02:30.000> 10<00:02:30.239> reps

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
and looks great I would do about 10 reps

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.809 
and looks great I would do about 10 reps
on<00:02:30.629> each<00:02:30.660> side<00:02:30.890> it's<00:02:31.890> also<00:02:32.129> an<00:02:32.340> example<00:02:32.430> of

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
on each side it's also an example of

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.880 
on each side it's also an example of
unilateral<00:02:33.299> training<00:02:33.810> another<00:02:34.290> technique<00:02:34.799> I

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
unilateral training another technique I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.280 
unilateral training another technique I
use<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.250> many<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.580> my<00:02:35.610> clients<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.840> way<00:02:37.049> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
use with many of my clients this way the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.930 
use with many of my clients this way the
your<00:02:37.379> core<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.769> active<00:02:38.310> you're<00:02:38.760> really

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
your core is active you're really

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.380 
your core is active you're really
squeezing<00:02:39.150> your<00:02:39.480> glutes<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:40.079> stay<00:02:40.319> stable<00:02:40.860> and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
squeezing your glutes to stay stable and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.119 
squeezing your glutes to stay stable and
overall<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.659> great<00:02:42.810> burn<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.950> about

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
overall it's a great burn and it's about

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.410 
overall it's a great burn and it's about
the<00:02:44.340> leg<00:02:44.489> so<00:02:44.670> if<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.849> really<00:02:45.120> want<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.329> get

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
the leg so if you really want to get

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.449 
the leg so if you really want to get
calorie<00:02:45.870> burn<00:02:46.079> so<00:02:46.440> now<00:02:46.680> what<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.950> would<00:02:47.069> do<00:02:47.280> is

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
calorie burn so now what I would do is

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.550 
calorie burn so now what I would do is
go<00:02:47.610> back<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.819> my<00:02:48.030> cardio<00:02:48.510> segment<00:02:48.810> another

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
go back to my cardio segment another

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.309 
go back to my cardio segment another
circuit<00:02:50.150> cardio<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.450> then<00:02:51.629> finish<00:02:51.900> with<00:02:51.930> core

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
circuit cardio and then finish with core

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.410 
circuit cardio and then finish with core
on<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.560> floor<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.519> last<00:02:53.790> segment<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.390> a

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
on the floor so the last segment is a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.180 
on the floor so the last segment is a
core<00:02:54.780> segment<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.500> always<00:02:55.709> like<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.069> work

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
core segment and I always like to work

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.979 
core segment and I always like to work
the<00:02:56.370> transverse<00:02:56.910> during<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.540> part<00:02:57.810> but

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
the transverse during that part but

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.930 
the transverse during that part but
there's<00:02:58.200> lots<00:02:58.379> of<00:02:58.500> variation<00:02:59.129> on<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.700> plank

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
there's lots of variation on the plank

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.330 
there's lots of variation on the plank
which<00:03:00.569> is<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.720> great<00:03:00.959> exercise<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:01.650> its<00:03:01.859> own<00:03:02.099> and

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
which is a great exercise on its own and

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.849 
which is a great exercise on its own and
let's<00:03:03.000> try<00:03:03.209> dolphin<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.410> now<00:03:04.560> what<00:03:04.739> you're

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
let's try dolphin so now what you're

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.339 
let's try dolphin so now what you're
gonna<00:03:04.920> do<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.340> you're<00:03:05.519> gonna<00:03:05.609> push<00:03:05.910> back<00:03:06.349> from

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
gonna do is you're gonna push back from

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.319 
gonna do is you're gonna push back from
plank<00:03:07.709> into<00:03:08.040> your<00:03:08.190> heels<00:03:08.370> great<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.060> then

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
plank into your heels great and then

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.580 
plank into your heels great and then
you're<00:03:09.450> gonna<00:03:09.540> come<00:03:09.780> forward<00:03:10.170> again

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
you're gonna come forward again

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.440 
you're gonna come forward again
now<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.459> really<00:03:11.790> works<00:03:12.000> your<00:03:12.120> rectus

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
now that really works your rectus

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.930 
now that really works your rectus
abdominus<00:03:12.599> as<00:03:13.200> well<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.950> muscles<00:03:14.790> that

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
abdominus as well the muscles that

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.360 
abdominus as well the muscles that
really<00:03:15.180> show<00:03:15.510> some<00:03:15.540> definitions<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.680> another

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
really show some definitions and another

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.809 
really show some definitions and another
variation<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:18.359> twisting<00:03:19.019> plank<00:03:19.519> so<00:03:20.519> this<00:03:20.669> one

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
variation is twisting plank so this one

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.699 
variation is twisting plank so this one
you're<00:03:20.940> gonna<00:03:21.030> drop<00:03:21.329> your<00:03:21.569> hip<00:03:21.720> right<00:03:22.049> and

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
you're gonna drop your hip right and

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.069 
you're gonna drop your hip right and
then<00:03:22.919> left<00:03:23.130> great<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:24.120> this<00:03:24.599> is<00:03:24.660> gonna<00:03:24.900> work

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
then left great and this is gonna work

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.050 
then left great and this is gonna work
