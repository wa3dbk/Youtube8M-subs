00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.610
 so hello we'll see 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.490
 since 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.770
 six bridges for 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:24.730
 alex moos version 2 0 b3 that I have here 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:28.840
 on the sony nex on a nacelle with 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.490
 dy motor is what I bought so 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.879
 on the internet that you will be able to 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.900
 find everywhere with a map 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:41.769
 hershey timer in which I inserted 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.050
 so the firm alex moos then everything 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:48.489
 first what to do absolutely 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.620
 so it's balancing the maximum basket 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:55.089
 finally the device on the maximum platform 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:59.799
 for it takes no effort here 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:03.040
 everything is well balanced so then 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:07.090
 for calibration in six points it is necessary 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.010
 so well fixed the ime so I have 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 of course fixed the components below 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.740
 and the little card to the left 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.100
 I will show you 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:23.469
 in fact I fixed property because he 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.899
 therefore the mm lle mu 6 below 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.630
 well fixed to limit vibrations 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.270
 of course I put a little moss 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.249
 adhesives found on, for example, 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.429
 the giraud helicopters all for 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:38.909
 what they do but nicolas especially well 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:44.079
 there set to limit the vibrations 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.560
 then here I show you I opened 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.560
 the gala 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.640
 it will be the same in all the tours 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.160
 in all guides this is either 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.480
 which firm will be the same 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.670
 so if that's it for the calibration 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.320
 so let's anticipate when you will 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.870
 necessarily plug your car that goes 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.070
 must be well detected here we have you 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.250
 clicked on connect 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.300
 otherwise it will connect after the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.970
 six-point calibration 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.310
 it's very simple we do not write sure 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.360
 write especially we do not click sure is 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:27.550
 clear the calibration in six points here is 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.440
 the six points are spotted by the walls 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.910
 here is 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.990
 monkey and here I am here this is the first 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.980
 point you have the second point with 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:44.980
 the map so that will give 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.060
 z on the right and x in water must not be forgotten 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.690
 every time you change the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.020
 position the position camera from 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.570
 change at the same time the axes so you 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.400
 find out in which direction will sort 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:04.150
 better is where you are 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.080
 put up so haxo x and right 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.000
 z here and there you click on caliber 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.930
 axis for the accelerometer 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.060
 that's it and you do that so with the six 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:21.100
 years so here I put them like that 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.360
 I put the jets locate the axes I 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.620
 changed the axes bangui I clicked on 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.540
 caliber and hop you change position 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.330
 on the other side you locate the axes 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.830
 same you change the axes here in mp 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.850
 had access to you have a choice between 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.550
 so kill 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.260
 the three axes more and less so 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.690
 you spot well you are wrong 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.360
 especially if it will distort the calibration 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.870
 and you will have to start over 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.870
 and the same for the right side so xyz 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.930
 x months and greek months and z months 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.770
 make your selection according to position 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:07.870
 you gave him here so you do not have to 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.460
 forget so that's 1 2 3 after you 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.620
 like that 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:17.470
 4 5 and after another position see 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.590
 of course upside down here are in the six 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.340
 points but you do the same at each 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.880
 position 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.070
 and when you finish the six but if 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.710
 calibration of course between each 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.680
 calibration you have to wait about 3 4 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.480
 seconds and when you finish the six 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.960
 calibration there you can click on 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.760
 write and at that moment your nas she 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.060
 is very well calibrated 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.420
 that's what gives expect i'm going 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.420
 stumble 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:57.169
 I would of course make you a later 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:05:01.449
 little test of mirrors this is the only 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.449
 rock we could see 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:20.639
 so here I will put you so 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:26.159
 the epide for what they are worth absolutely 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.960
 to see pids and all that stuff 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.370
 that they would have bought exactly the 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.759
 same date to her with the same betting 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.819
 photo of course it will surely move 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.289
 a little the values ​​because we can not 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.499
 never have twice the same values 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.409
 sure the same on the same date l but 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:45.389
 you will have something really 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:48.110
 great here I thank you 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.110
 see you soon
