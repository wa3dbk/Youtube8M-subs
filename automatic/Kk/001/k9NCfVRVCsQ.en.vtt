you've probably already seen in other
tutorials<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.619> want<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> imagine<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
tutorials that you want to imagine a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
tutorials that you want to imagine a
line<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.270> extends<00:01:24.689> from<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> outer<00:01:25.110> corner

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
line that extends from the outer corner

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.350 
line that extends from the outer corner
of<00:01:25.650> your<00:01:25.680> eye<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> end<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.700> your<00:01:26.759> brow<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
of your eye to the end of your brow and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.230 
of your eye to the end of your brow and
while<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.470> easy<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.100> visualize<00:01:29.759> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
while that can be easy to visualize it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.149 
while that can be easy to visualize it
sometimes<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.229> rather<00:01:31.439> difficult<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
sometimes can be rather difficult to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.580 
sometimes can be rather difficult to
draw<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.570> found<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.049> using<00:01:34.320> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
draw but I have found that using a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.920 
draw but I have found that using a
business<00:01:34.950> card<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> guide<00:01:35.820> makes<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.509> easy

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
business card as a guide makes it easy

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.380 
business card as a guide makes it easy
and<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.890> straight<00:01:38.250> line<00:01:38.520> every<00:01:39.060> single

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and it's a straight line every single

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.719 
and it's a straight line every single
time<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> business<00:01:41.040> card<00:01:41.310> you're<00:01:41.549> not

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
time and with a business card you're not

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.749 
time and with a business card you're not
gonna<00:01:41.909> get<00:01:42.360> any<00:01:42.630> wiggly<00:01:43.409> lines<00:01:43.680> at<00:01:44.040> all<00:01:44.070> it's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
gonna be straight every single time

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.120 
gonna be straight every single time
once<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.689> base<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> wing<00:01:49.590> drawn

once you have the base of the wing drawn

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.550 
once you have the base of the wing drawn

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.109 
you want to connect it back to the lash
line<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.219> you're<00:01:53.369> doing<00:01:53.700> more<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:53.969> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
line so you're doing more of a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.319 
line so you're doing more of a
triangular<00:01:54.750> pattern<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.789> connect<00:01:57.149> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
triangular pattern here to connect it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.139 
triangular pattern here to connect it
back<00:01:57.740> when<00:01:58.740> you're<00:01:58.890> connecting<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.549> line<00:01:59.850> of

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
back when you're connecting that line of

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.380 
back when you're connecting that line of
the<00:02:00.329> wing<00:02:00.539> back<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.009> lash<00:02:02.250> line<00:02:02.390> from

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the wing back on to the lash line from

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.539 
the wing back on to the lash line from
my<00:02:03.600> personal<00:02:04.049> experience<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:05.070> found<00:02:05.100> that

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
my personal experience I have found that

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.460 
my personal experience I have found that
if<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.850> start<00:02:06.210> about<00:02:06.569> a<00:02:06.600> quarter<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.319> way

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
if you start about a quarter of the way

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.680 
if you start about a quarter of the way
down<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:08.039> line<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.610> drag<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.179> from<00:02:09.450> there

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
down that line and drag it in from there

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.410 
down that line and drag it in from there
it<00:02:09.929> makes<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.649> line<00:02:10.860> more<00:02:11.160> fluid<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.910> then

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
it makes the line more fluid and then

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.020 
it makes the line more fluid and then
but<00:02:13.140> if<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.380> start<00:02:13.709> at<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> very<00:02:14.220> tip<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
but if you start at the very tip of the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.660 
but if you start at the very tip of the
end<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.140> wing<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.800> start<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.160> drag<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.580> in

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
end of the wing and start to drag it in

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.630 
end of the wing and start to drag it in
from<00:02:17.880> there<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.900> can<00:02:19.170> make<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.799> wing<00:02:20.069> very

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
from there this can make that wing very

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.000 
from there this can make that wing very
chunky<00:02:21.000> very<00:02:21.900> quickly<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.620> then<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.860> just

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
chunky very quickly and then it just

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.789 
chunky very quickly and then it just
becomes<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.519> big<00:02:23.549> old<00:02:23.849> mess<00:02:24.380> another<00:02:25.380> technique

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
becomes a big old mess another technique

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.100 
becomes a big old mess another technique
you<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.099> try<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.670> use<00:02:27.180> eyeshadow<00:02:27.780> instead

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
you can try is to use eyeshadow instead

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.530 
you can try is to use eyeshadow instead
of<00:02:28.440> gel<00:02:28.739> liner<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.549> why<00:02:29.819> this<00:02:29.880> works<00:02:30.360> is

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
of gel liner and why this works is

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.690 
of gel liner and why this works is
because<00:02:30.739> eyeshadow<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> lot<00:02:32.160> easier<00:02:32.519> to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
because eyeshadow is a lot easier to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.240 
because eyeshadow is a lot easier to
correct<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.900> lot<00:02:34.049> softer<00:02:34.349> so<00:02:35.010> if<00:02:35.160> you

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
correct and it's a lot softer so if you

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.280 
correct and it's a lot softer so if you
do<00:02:35.459> make<00:02:35.700> any<00:02:35.970> mistakes<00:02:36.510> when<00:02:36.930> you're<00:02:37.049> first

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
do make any mistakes when you're first

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.500 
do make any mistakes when you're first
starting<00:02:37.440> out<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.519> a<00:02:38.640> lot<00:02:38.730> easier<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.269> hide

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
starting out it's a lot easier to hide

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.120 
starting out it's a lot easier to hide
them<00:02:39.780> with<00:02:40.019> eyeshadow<00:02:40.650> than<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:40.950> would<00:02:41.099> be

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
them with eyeshadow than it would be

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.839 
them with eyeshadow than it would be
with<00:02:41.400> gel<00:02:41.670> liner<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:43.160> in<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> event<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.700> you

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
with gel liner and in the event that you

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.479 
with gel liner and in the event that you
get<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.150> dreaded<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.049> even<00:02:46.500> wings<00:02:47.010> don't

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
get the dreaded on the even wings don't

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.550 
get the dreaded on the even wings don't
rush<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:48.000> wash<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.390> off<00:02:48.510> because<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.079> can<00:02:49.260> fix

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
rush to wash it off because you can fix

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.400 
rush to wash it off because you can fix
it<00:02:49.829> all<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.849> need<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.359> your<00:02:51.660> concealer<00:02:52.079> a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
it all you need is your concealer a

concealer brush and a paper towel so

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.780 
concealer brush and a paper towel so
what<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.200> typically<00:02:55.680> do<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.250> take<00:02:56.549> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
what I typically do is take the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.270 
what I typically do is take the
concealer<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.480> apply<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.769> edges<00:02:59.250> of

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
concealer and apply it on the edges of

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.069 
concealer and apply it on the edges of
the<00:02:59.730> wing<00:03:00.030> where<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.420> feel<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.900> got<00:03:01.019> a

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
the wing where I feel like it got a

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.379 
the wing where I feel like it got a
little<00:03:01.319> bit<00:03:01.440> too<00:03:01.620> chunky<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.280> then<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.030> will

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
little bit too chunky and then I will

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.720 
little bit too chunky and then I will
thin<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.780> out<00:03:04.079> with<00:03:04.139> the<00:03:04.560> concealer<00:03:05.040> first<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
thin it out with the concealer first and

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.330 
thin it out with the concealer first and
go<00:03:05.850> back<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.299> Pat<00:03:06.569> over<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.739> soak<00:03:08.010> up<00:03:08.190> any

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
go back and Pat over it to soak up any

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.250 
go back and Pat over it to soak up any
of<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.639> excess<00:03:09.000> concealer<00:03:09.690> with<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> paper

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
of the excess concealer with a paper

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.080 
of the excess concealer with a paper
towel<00:03:12.829> and<00:03:13.829> when<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.040> do<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.700> may<00:03:14.910> need

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
towel and when you do this you may need

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.449 
towel and when you do this you may need
to<00:03:15.239> do<00:03:15.389> a<00:03:15.420> few<00:03:15.720> passes<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:17.069> same

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
to do a few passes of this same

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.180 
to do a few passes of this same
technique<00:03:18.329> to<00:03:18.569> get<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.260> thin<00:03:19.560> out<00:03:19.859> and

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
technique to get it to thin out and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.220 
technique to get it to thin out and
match<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.730> other<00:03:20.880> side<00:03:20.970> for<00:03:21.930> me<00:03:22.019> personally

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
match the other side for me personally

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.349 
match the other side for me personally
when<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.709> have<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.069> correct<00:03:23.340> wings<00:03:23.670> like<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.150> I

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
when I have to correct wings like this I

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.330 
when I have to correct wings like this I
usually<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.200> do<00:03:25.290> about<00:03:25.530> five<00:03:25.920> or<00:03:26.160> eight

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
usually have to do about five or eight

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.059 
usually have to do about five or eight
passes<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.239> this<00:03:27.930> technique<00:03:28.440> before<00:03:28.889> I<00:03:28.920> get

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
passes of this technique before I get

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.690 
passes of this technique before I get
the<00:03:29.190> desired<00:03:29.519> results<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.150> I'm<00:03:30.239> after<00:03:31.700> but

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
the desired results that I'm after but

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.629 
the desired results that I'm after but
it's<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.329> lot<00:03:33.480> easier<00:03:33.900> than<00:03:34.079> going<00:03:34.230> back<00:03:34.530> and

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
it's a lot easier than going back and

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.590 
it's a lot easier than going back and
washing<00:03:35.639> it<00:03:35.730> off<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.090> starting<00:03:36.450> all<00:03:36.569> over

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
washing it off and starting all over

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.539 
washing it off and starting all over
again<00:03:36.900> because<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.590> know<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.889> frustration

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
again because you know the frustration

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:54.210 
again because you know the frustration
