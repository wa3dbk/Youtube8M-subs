to give you a lot of when combined with

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.690 
to give you a lot of when combined with
the<00:01:49.719> box<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:50.770> will<00:01:50.859> leave<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.250> custom<00:01:51.579> weave

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
the box you will leave the custom weave

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.849 
the box you will leave the custom weave
on<00:01:51.850> here<00:01:52.090> you're<00:01:52.960> going<00:01:53.109> to<00:01:53.170> get<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.289> lot<00:01:53.350> of

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
on here you're going to get a lot of

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.560 
on here you're going to get a lot of
torsional<00:01:54.460> rigidity<00:01:54.609> so<00:01:55.270> it's<00:01:55.390> going<00:01:55.509> to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
torsional rigidity so it's going to

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.529 
torsional rigidity so it's going to
transfer<00:01:56.020> energy<00:01:56.200> edge<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:57.219> edge<00:01:57.340> very<00:01:58.240> very

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
transfer energy edge to edge very very

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.090 
transfer energy edge to edge very very
quickly<00:01:58.840> so<00:01:59.469> you're<00:01:59.590> going<00:01:59.679> to<00:01:59.770> get<00:01:59.859> a<00:01:59.920> lot<00:02:00.070> of

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
quickly so you're going to get a lot of

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.980 
quickly so you're going to get a lot of
maneuverability<00:02:00.549> out<00:02:00.969> of<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:01.119> board<00:02:01.420> so

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
maneuverability out of this board so

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.349 
maneuverability out of this board so
combine<00:02:02.320> that<00:02:02.469> you<00:02:02.829> got<00:02:02.979> carbon<00:02:03.359> traditional

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
combine that you got carbon traditional

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.419 
combine that you got carbon traditional
camber<00:02:04.689> really<00:02:05.590> good<00:02:05.710> by<00:02:05.859> our<00:02:05.979> steel<00:02:06.219> weave

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
camber really good by our steel weave
