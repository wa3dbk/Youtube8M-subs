00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and so it's one of the few guns in this

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.130 
and so it's one of the few guns in this
game<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.489> actually<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> customized

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
game that actually have a customized

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.660 
game that actually have a customized
title<00:00:40.590> once<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.920> put<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.430> certain

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
title once you put in a certain

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.240 
title once you put in a certain
attachment<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.680> yeah<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> makes<00:00:44.100> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
attachment on it and so yeah it makes it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.979 
attachment on it and so yeah it makes it
kind<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.520> unique<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.090> kind<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.360> cool<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:45.870> as

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
kind of unique are kind of cool but as

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.830 
kind of unique are kind of cool but as
you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.289> see<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.610> pretty<00:00:47.840> devastating

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
you can see it's a pretty devastating

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.200 
you can see it's a pretty devastating
short<00:00:49.140> range<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:50.100> only<00:00:50.219> has<00:00:50.399> 20<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> clip

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
short range it only has 20 in the clip

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.660 
short range it only has 20 in the clip
but<00:00:51.420> that's<00:00:51.570> kind<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.590> standard<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
but that's kind of the standard for a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.779 
but that's kind of the standard for a
lot<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> SMGs<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.170> game<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.430> it's

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
lot of the SMGs in this game and so it's

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.849 
lot of the SMGs in this game and so it's
actually<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.660> could<00:00:57.780> actually<00:00:57.930> bear<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.710> in

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
actually you could actually bear with in

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.670 
actually you could actually bear with in
with<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.399> weapon<00:00:59.609> for<00:01:00.030> some<00:01:00.180> butt<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.320> some

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
with this weapon for some butt or some

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.020 
with this weapon for some butt or some
other<00:01:01.800> weapons<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.340> kind<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.579> hard<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> use

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
other weapons it's kind of hard to use

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.649 
other weapons it's kind of hard to use
oh<00:01:03.239> god<00:01:03.780> I'm<00:01:03.930> screwed<00:01:04.320> oh<00:01:04.549> there<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.700> 60<00:01:06.299> just

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.780 
oh god I'm screwed oh there are 60 just
ran<00:01:06.990> right<00:01:07.020> into<00:01:07.470> me<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.010> could<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
ran right into me and I could not do a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.370 
ran right into me and I could not do a
thing<00:01:09.740> it's<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.250> i'm<00:01:11.520> using<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> PM<00:01:12.090> 63<00:01:13.080> like

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
thing it's so i'm using the PM 63 like

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.789 
thing it's so i'm using the PM 63 like
I've<00:01:13.560> said<00:01:13.860> about<00:01:14.010> 20<00:01:14.670> times<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.689> being<00:01:16.590> kind

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
I've said about 20 times and being kind

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.560 
I've said about 20 times and being kind
of<00:01:16.890> repetitive<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.820> that's<00:01:18.240> what<00:01:18.450> this

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
of repetitive there but that's what this

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.749 
of repetitive there but that's what this
day<00:01:18.750> play<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:18.990> about<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.630> gun<00:01:22.380> has<00:01:22.759> not

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
day play is about so this gun has not

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
day play is about so this gun has not
that<00:01:24.000> much<00:01:24.150> recoil<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> submachine<00:01:25.530> gun<00:01:25.740> if

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that much recoil for a submachine gun if

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
that much recoil for a submachine gun if
you<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> gun<00:01:26.880> shooting<00:01:27.270> while<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> mean

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
you see the gun shooting while I mean

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.719 
you see the gun shooting while I mean
while<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> am<00:01:28.500> aiming<00:01:28.770> down<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> sights<00:01:29.250> it's

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
while I am aiming down the sights it's

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
while I am aiming down the sights it's
actually<00:01:30.150> moving<00:01:30.329> back<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.869> forth<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
actually moving back and forth and so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.160 
actually moving back and forth and so
that<00:01:32.009> makes<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.540> recoil<00:01:33.540> very<00:01:33.750> manageable

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that makes the recoil very manageable

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.830 
that makes the recoil very manageable
and<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:35.520> makes<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.180> pretty<00:01:36.390> decent

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and it actually makes it a pretty decent

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.859 
and it actually makes it a pretty decent
submachine<00:01:37.409> gun<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.340> used<00:01:38.869> whatsoever

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
submachine gun it's not used whatsoever

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.690 
submachine gun it's not used whatsoever
in<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.290> call<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> duty<00:01:41.400> matchmaking<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:42.240> or

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
what I've seen in the multiplayer on

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.420 
what I've seen in the multiplayer on
xbox<00:01:47.399> live<00:01:47.640> I'm<00:01:47.970> pretty<00:01:48.270> sure<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.780> same<00:01:49.140> way

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
xbox live I'm pretty sure the same way

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.420 
xbox live I'm pretty sure the same way
beyond<00:01:50.479> it<00:01:51.479> would<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.810> same<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.439> PSN<00:01:53.189> or

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
beyond it would be the same on PSN or

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.090 
beyond it would be the same on PSN or
playstation<00:01:54.090> network<00:01:54.680> this<00:01:55.680> gun<00:01:55.920> isn't
