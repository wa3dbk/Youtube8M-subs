 if possible to come back 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.030
 there is a very large waterfall that offers 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.240
 since progressed from sap is in some 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.240

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:25.530
 arrived this morning around 10 am already 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:28.260
 binoculars and I do not pop up to be 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:34.050
 back to the chest 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.800
 it's the same chance to spot 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.810
 it was wonderful 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.210
 in general and that I see even antier 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.830
 way of the vulture 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.140
 so we are in the right direction 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.560
 we have also seen gentlemen I saw 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.030
 a lot of your turns then seemed to me 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.030
 to see a golden eagle too 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.530
 precisely the also a company of a 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.250
 tawny vulture is a bit like the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:14.170
 Griffon vulture's wingspan ranges from 2 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.680
 meters 45 admit 85 since the end of 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.830
 1980s it is the subject of a 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.860
 the reintroduction program 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.799
 main massive flush and I have to 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.640
 to say that we have more and more luck 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:33.569
 to dig one during walks that there 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.569
 a few years ago 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.599
 that's how that ended 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 first day in gavarnie nice 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.680
 I chose one with a large 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.920
 easy to park my camper 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.299
 not only these rules to travel or 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.160
 his pikes several times the law 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.160
 that's cheaper 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:13.400
 gold a press and even if like all that 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:17.359
 it will be the circus of gavarnie is a 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.170
 site that natural glacial type located 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.670
 in the mountains of the Pyrenees 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.709
 the highest village of gavarnie 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.349
 village of the department and its population 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.349
 and about 150 inhabitants 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.540
 after I got after knowing that 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.219
 do with my material were looted 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.359
 simply that they like to stop 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:48.980
 often it is part of the national park 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:52.419
 Pyrenees was classified in 1997 as 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.419
 World Heritage 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:18.840
 before attacking the climb we go 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.840
 to moralize this fight 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:28.370
 the drop took it that would show malawi 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.770
 that he was entitled to the spared crisis 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:36.110
 there I have not long after but we end 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.550
 by getting there we always think we're going 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:49.740
 arrive at the waterfall but in fact its 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:52.310
 calender and rider winemaker whose m 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.310

 an insulator saw during this time 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.960
 until the summer insistently the walls 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.330
 rocky with the chance to see it 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.550
 some izard and after many 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.100
 research I finally get rewarded 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:26.870
 but with everyone who will come 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.460
