00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.719
 let's cook another very rich option 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:17.010
 for Christmas or New Year's dinner and 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:20.740
 today we are going to cook a rich 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.440
 achiote chicken 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.900
 if you like what can be elaborated 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.130
 same way with potatoes I'm going to 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.920
 need a large chicken without viscera 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.280
 what is without head without legs without anything 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.010
 of 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.060
 of viscera I will also need three 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.870
 orange juice cups 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.910
 three quarters of a cup of white vinegar 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.340
 Salt 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.260
 half butter bar of 90 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.480
 grams half 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.210
 a handful of green beans 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.150
 some are being as 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.300
 200 grams 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.559
 three cloves two peppers two 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.540
 bars 17 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.520
 of 100 grams 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.630
 a clove of garlic 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.320
 6 chilitos habaneros 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.659
 some oregano ground or whole and 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.490
 we're going to need a grater because 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.369
 to scratch the achiote because many 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 Sometimes it is hard and if it is hard it is not 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.110
 easy to process the blender 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.789
 then we can grate it with a 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:37.179
 grater we are going to need 150 grams of 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:41.130
 bacon a large purple onion in 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:43.830
 not very large pieces not very small 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.210
 perfectly good chicken 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.210
 and we are going to reserve it 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.930
 in 7 we're going to scratch it and we're going to 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.870
 Reserve 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.300
 Now I'm telling you what we're going to do here 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.320
 right away, the chiles habaneros I'm going to 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.810
 remove the leg and I'm going to wash them 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.140
 the children, the beans, I'm going to 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.970
 remove what is the little foot and I'm going to 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.970
 split in half so long 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.959
 it was not necessary to scratch the ayote 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.159
 since it went smooth and ximo then what 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.269
 what I'm going to do is that I'm going to add 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.269
 here in the glass of the blender 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.700
 along with the juice of the orange 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.470
 and together with the vinegar 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.520
 I will also add 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.170
 garlic 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.170
 the clove the pepper 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.780
 a small piece of onion 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.830
 the chiles 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.890
 and I'm going to add the oregano and also 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.120
 I'm going to add salt and all this I'm going 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:02.150
 to grind neither very ground nor very whole 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.569
 and here to the chicken 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.420
 I'll be putting salt for him to go 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.269
 concentrating a little the flavor while 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.180
 the taste and salt is concentrated with the 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.360
 chicken and my flight then the others 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.060
 ingredients that I charitÃ© to the blender 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.750
 I'm going to prepare the wood to place the 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.770
 chicken marina 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.900
 and since we did all this what we 're going 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.920
 to do is add well inside and 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.130
 on the outside all that we liquefy and what 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.770
 let's leave marinated 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.860
 if possible from one day to the next for 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.550
 that the flavor is better concentrated and if not 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.480
 at least four to five hours 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.480
 here we will let it rest 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.470
 24 hours I'm going to put the refrigerator 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.770
 and already tomorrow to take it out 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.520
 I'm going to tell you that you follow me here and so 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:07.220
 now we are going to put it to bake 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:11.010
 at 200 degrees centigrade for 50 minutes 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.600
 whether we cover if nothing else 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.420
 we want to cook and if we want 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.150
 doradito then we leave it uncovered and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.940
 let's go see the same marinade every 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.010
 10 or 15 minutes 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.230
 Now what I'm going to do is introduce 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.620
 the chicken the next step to follow is 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:35.360
 that we are going to chop the 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.360
 the bacon and so on strips or squares 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.340
 let's prepare the garnish with the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.900
 that we are going to accompany the chicken I'm going to 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.600
 put here the half bar of 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.390
 Butter 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.130
 so that it is melting 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.060
 to avoid burning what we can 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.500
 do is add a splash of oil 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.919
 to avoid burning in the 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.919
 Butter 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.330
 since the butter melted what 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.290
 we're going to do is add more of the 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.290
 tosino to fry 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:13.570
 They are moving until they call you 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:15.180
 fried to immediately add what the 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.330
 eyes 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.370
 since it's cold here really what 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.569
 we are going to do is that I leave them 3 already 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:28.939
 the party veils and I will add them here 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.939
 to fry them with bacon 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.060
 I 'm not going to add salt like the 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.890
 Bacon made a little longer because saladito 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.010
 put this is going to have but if you guys 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:45.480
 like a little more salty as they can 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:48.660
 be added here be moving 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.260
 every three or four minutes to avoid 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:55.940
 burn and so the deposits are 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.940
 go flowing 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:03.690
 very slowly with the bacon the fire what 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.350
 I have medium heat, I do not have it high 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.710
 neither low 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.770
 if they like they can cover it and if they can not 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.120
 keep moving 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:18.780
 since the bacon is cold with the green bean 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:22.540
 the green bean is almost ready, let's go 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:26.810
 add what onion is 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:29.090
 that we apply it in large 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.479
 and in the same way here we are going to leave 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.660
 what 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:38.840
 Season a little 4 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:41.030
 with the green beans and the bacon and if you like it 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.340
 the cilantro we can add the 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:48.020
 chopped cilantro and if there is no problem 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:51.770
 so nothing else without good cilantro here already 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.320
 the green bean was well cooked onion and 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.750
 is 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.070
 right here I will add what is the 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.680
 joint 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:03.120
 singh like it if you can not skip it 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:08.820
 that's why I did not mention it to you at the beginning 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:11.580
 I'm going to give you a little visit, nothing more 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:15.020
 and I'm going to pay it and I'm going to book it 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.020

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.600
 fry with the butter and I'm the web

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.410
