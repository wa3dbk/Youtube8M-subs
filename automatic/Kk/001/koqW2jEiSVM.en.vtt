be<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.120> fun<00:02:36.750> idea<00:02:36.980> now<00:02:37.980> when<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:39.000> use<00:02:39.239> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
be a fun idea now when you use the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.900 
be a fun idea now when you use the
teacup<00:02:39.930> what<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:40.920> did<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.489> found<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.850> I

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
teacup what I did is I found that I

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.330 
teacup what I did is I found that I
wanted<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.300> glue<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.959> on<00:02:43.170> there<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.620> bad<00:02:43.830> when

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
wanted to glue that on there so bad when

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.000 
wanted to glue that on there so bad when
they<00:02:44.520> pick<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.880> up<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.209> all<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.080> piece<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
they pick it up is all in one piece the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.400 
they pick it up is all in one piece the
best<00:02:47.280> thing<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.700> found<00:02:48.090> was<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.900> epoxy

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
best thing that I found was this epoxy

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.220 
best thing that I found was this epoxy
glue<00:02:49.849> it's<00:02:50.849> one<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.630> two-part<00:02:52.080> you

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
glue it's one that it's a two-part you

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.160 
glue it's one that it's a two-part you
have<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.500> actually<00:02:52.680> mix<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.700> if<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.810> wanna

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
have to actually mix it and if you wanna

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.440 
have to actually mix it and if you wanna
go<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.890> going<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.220> dry<00:02:56.459> clear<00:02:56.970> as<00:02:57.180> well

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
go that is going to dry clear as well

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.030 
go that is going to dry clear as well
you<00:02:57.660> don't<00:02:57.870> want<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.080> use<00:02:58.230> like<00:02:58.470> glue<00:02:58.739> from<00:02:58.890> a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
you don't want to use like glue from a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.850 
you don't want to use like glue from a
glue<00:02:59.220> gun<00:02:59.459> super<00:03:00.269> glue<00:03:00.450> doesn't<00:03:00.660> always<00:03:01.500> hold

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
glue gun super glue doesn't always hold

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.840 
glue gun super glue doesn't always hold
enough<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.940> very<00:03:03.269> basically<00:03:03.840> put<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.350> on<00:03:04.850> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
enough so very basically put it on the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.600 
enough so very basically put it on the
base<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.690> cup<00:03:06.930> set<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.769> there<00:03:07.980> now<00:03:08.400> it

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
base of the cup set it in there now it

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.670 
base of the cup set it in there now it
does<00:03:08.790> say<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.420> want<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.780> allow<00:03:09.989> for<00:03:10.019> 60

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
does say you want to allow for 60

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.710 
does say you want to allow for 60
minutes<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.190> dry<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:11.790> very<00:03:12.060> important<00:03:12.690> that

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
minutes to dry it's very important that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.330 
minutes to dry it's very important that
you<00:03:12.810> don't<00:03:13.019> start<00:03:13.380> working<00:03:13.739> with<00:03:13.920> us<00:03:14.100> right

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
you don't start working with us right

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.000 
you don't start working with us right
away<00:03:14.370> because<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.360> can<00:03:15.510> lose<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.989> set<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.830> way

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
away because it can lose it set that way

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.809 
away because it can lose it set that way
so<00:03:17.549> what<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.880> great<00:03:18.239> idea<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:19.200> now<00:03:19.860> adding<00:03:20.730> a

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
so what a great idea that now adding a

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.940 
so what a great idea that now adding a
plant<00:03:21.120> or<00:03:21.510> flowers<00:03:22.049> things<00:03:22.530> like<00:03:22.739> that<00:03:22.890> you
