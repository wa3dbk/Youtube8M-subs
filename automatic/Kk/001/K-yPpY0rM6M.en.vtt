00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
but we're a real threat going forward as

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.860 
but we're a real threat going forward as
well<00:03:07.280> which<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.459> what<00:03:07.670> we<00:03:07.760> wanted<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.000> be<00:03:08.180> we

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
well which is what we wanted to be we

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.000 
well which is what we wanted to be we
didn't<00:03:09.020> just<00:03:09.140> want<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.380> go<00:03:09.530> there<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:09.830> just

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
didn't just want to go there and just

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.890 
didn't just want to go there and just
sit<00:03:10.130> back<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.310> defend<00:03:10.640> we<00:03:11.390> certainly<00:03:11.660> didn't

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
sit back and defend we certainly didn't

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.440 
sit back and defend we certainly didn't
do<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.760> it's<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.850> pity<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.150> we<00:03:14.269> actually

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
do that and it's a pity that we actually

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.240 
do that and it's a pity that we actually
didn't<00:03:14.720> win<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.930> game<00:03:14.959> we<00:03:15.709> probably<00:03:15.800> deserved

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
didn't win the game we probably deserved

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
to win it particularly in the second

half<00:03:17.480> we<00:03:17.660> had<00:03:17.780> two<00:03:18.290> or<00:03:18.410> three<00:03:18.440> glorious

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
half we had two or three glorious

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160 
half we had two or three glorious
opportunities<00:03:19.970> cleared<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:20.930> around<00:03:21.110> the
