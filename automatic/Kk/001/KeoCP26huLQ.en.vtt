 even the destruction of a good post for 2 for 1 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.510
 turn on the other side a little more 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.050
 supports current under the paper and then just 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.340

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:16.560
 everything will be dried very well 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:20.160
 turn over and again for ten minutes 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.160
 under cardboard 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.320
 we mine 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:31.280
 he drives them there already 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.639

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.270

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.069
 So who wants to hold out 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:52.529
 leave for 10 minutes has passed 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:55.169
 look at our creativity there is no longer 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:57.770
 because oil is good 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.529
 missing us inside now our task 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:04.860
 bring it but the presentation is good 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:07.979
 get reddened and take just linguists 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.430

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.930

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.900
 gauging avignon other 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.650
 but you can reduce 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.960
 now the supply is somehow marketable 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.960
 kind of zazharka 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.520
