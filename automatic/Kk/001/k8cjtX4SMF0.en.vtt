00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.480 

what's<00:00:15.260> up<00:00:15.380> this<00:00:15.500> is<00:00:15.559> b-boy<00:00:15.860> we've<00:00:16.010> insanity

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
what's up this is b-boy we've insanity

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.859 
what's up this is b-boy we've insanity
and<00:00:16.610> today<00:00:16.820> we're<00:00:17.000> going<00:00:17.090> to<00:00:17.150> learn<00:00:17.300> the<00:00:17.600> three

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
and today we're going to learn the three

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.350 
and today we're going to learn the three
step<00:00:18.110> so<00:00:18.890> three<00:00:19.189> step<00:00:19.369> is<00:00:19.490> a<00:00:19.520> foundational<00:00:20.119> for

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
step so three step is a foundational for

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.630 
step so three step is a foundational for
step<00:00:20.660> that<00:00:20.810> involves<00:00:21.080> three<00:00:21.650> steps<00:00:21.680> we're

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
step that involves three steps we're

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.120 
step that involves three steps we're
gonna<00:00:22.730> learn<00:00:22.910> it<00:00:23.060> to<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:23.300> left<00:00:23.890> because<00:00:24.890> ask

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
gonna learn it to the left because ask

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.560 
gonna learn it to the left because ask
the<00:00:25.279> way<00:00:25.400> I<00:00:25.430> do<00:00:25.550> my<00:00:25.670> footwork<00:00:26.060> but<00:00:26.360> if<00:00:26.450> you're

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
the way I do my footwork but if you're

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.390 
the way I do my footwork but if you're
right-handed<00:00:26.779> you<00:00:27.230> could<00:00:27.470> also<00:00:27.710> do<00:00:28.009> it<00:00:28.130> the

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
right-handed you could also do it the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.890 
right-handed you could also do it the
opposite<00:00:28.759> way<00:00:28.820> which<00:00:29.150> is<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.300> same<00:00:29.599> exact

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
opposite way which is the same exact

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.389 
opposite way which is the same exact
step<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:30.410> when<00:00:30.529> we<00:00:30.619> learned<00:00:30.800> our<00:00:30.919> three<00:00:31.130> steps

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
step so when we learned our three steps

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.979 
step so when we learned our three steps
we're<00:00:31.610> gonna<00:00:31.730> keep<00:00:32.000> it<00:00:32.149> in<00:00:32.270> a<00:00:32.390> square

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
we're gonna keep it in a square

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.960 
we're gonna keep it in a square
meaning<00:00:33.380> you<00:00:33.649> either<00:00:33.800> gonna<00:00:33.980> face<00:00:34.340> this<00:00:34.700> way

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
meaning you either gonna face this way

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.650 
meaning you either gonna face this way
the<00:00:35.630> front<00:00:35.960> this<00:00:36.649> way<00:00:36.860> or<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.610> back<00:00:37.790> just<00:00:38.600> to

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
the front this way or the back just to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.030 
the front this way or the back just to
keep<00:00:38.809> it<00:00:38.960> organized<00:00:39.380> so<00:00:39.770> we're<00:00:39.890> going<00:00:39.980> to

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
keep it organized so we're going to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.440 
keep it organized so we're going to
start<00:00:40.219> off<00:00:40.370> in<00:00:40.579> a<00:00:40.700> push-up<00:00:40.910> position

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
start off in a push-up position

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.479 
start off in a push-up position
like<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:42.829> step<00:00:43.070> out<00:00:43.160> with<00:00:43.340> your<00:00:43.430> left

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
like this you step out with your left

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.079 
like this you step out with your left
foot<00:00:43.760> and<00:00:44.059> face<00:00:44.540> this<00:00:44.690> way<00:00:44.899> one<00:00:45.820> from<00:00:46.820> here

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
foot and face this way one from here

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.750 
foot and face this way one from here
you're<00:00:47.329> going<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.480> switch<00:00:47.690> your<00:00:47.719> legs<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:48.760> and

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
you're going to turn over it to a

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.189 
you're going to turn over it to a
push-up<00:00:51.019> position<00:00:51.309> left<00:00:52.309> hand<00:00:52.550> three<00:00:53.359> you're

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
push-up position left hand three you're

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.930 
push-up position left hand three you're
going<00:00:54.320> to<00:00:54.379> repeat<00:00:54.589> that<00:00:54.649> four<00:00:55.129> times<00:00:55.370> you're

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
going to repeat that four times you're

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
you're gonna want to practice a step a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.200 
you're gonna want to practice a step a
lot<00:01:13.070> it's<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.370> little<00:01:13.610> bit<00:01:13.729> awkward<00:01:13.880> at<00:01:14.180> first

gonna<00:01:22.490> step<00:01:22.730> out<00:01:22.910> here<00:01:23.330> get<00:01:23.870> a<00:01:23.900> top<00:01:24.170> rock<00:01:24.440> we're

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
gonna step out here get a top rock we're

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.130 
gonna step out here get a top rock we're
gonna<00:01:25.520> go<00:01:25.790> down<00:01:26.410> one

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
gonna go down one

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.200 
gonna go down one
one

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
one

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:40.959 
one
one<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.460> is<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.940> three-step

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.550 

all<00:01:41.969> right<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.359> can<00:01:42.479> also<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.109> step

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
all right so you can also do this step

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.849 
all right so you can also do this step
with<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.039> kick<00:01:44.429> so<00:01:45.149> instead<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.079> keeping<00:01:46.500> both

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
with a kick so instead of keeping both

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.830 
with a kick so instead of keeping both
feet<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.219> ground<00:01:47.310> you're<00:01:47.850> gonna<00:01:47.909> kick<00:01:48.299> so

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
feet on the ground you're gonna kick so

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.319 
feet on the ground you're gonna kick so
they<00:01:49.109> go<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.950> two<00:01:51.859> one<00:01:52.859> two<00:01:54.259> one<00:01:55.259> two<00:01:55.560> kick<00:01:56.399> one

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
they go one two one two one two kick one

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.100 
they go one two one two one two kick one
kick<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:59.399> looks<00:01:59.789> like<00:01:59.909> this

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.390 

now<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.170> three<00:02:05.530> steps<00:02:05.770> if<00:02:05.980> you're<00:02:06.130> interested

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400
