00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.780

and<00:01:07.300> they<00:01:07.480> run<00:01:07.690> close<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.370> without<00:01:09.370> touching

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.880 
about one millimeter two millimeters gap
this<00:01:13.030> antenna<00:01:13.390> is<00:01:13.750> then<00:01:13.930> wired<00:01:14.200> on<00:01:14.410> to<00:01:14.770> the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
this antenna is then wired on to the

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.230 
this antenna is then wired on to the
electronics<00:01:15.850> in<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.600> body<00:01:16.780> of<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:16.960> sensor

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
electronics in the body of the sensor

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.899 
electronics in the body of the sensor
so<00:01:19.869> you<00:01:19.930> have<00:01:20.110> power<00:01:20.439> in<00:01:20.530> less<00:01:21.520> than<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.759> milli

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
so you have power in less than a milli

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.450 
so you have power in less than a milli
watts<00:01:22.149> at<00:01:23.079> that<00:01:23.290> point<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.799> creates<00:01:24.250> a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
watts at that point that creates a

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.450 
watts at that point that creates a
resonance<00:01:24.970> in<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.750> saw<00:01:25.899> devices<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.189> very

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460

precise<00:01:28.000> frequency

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
precise frequency

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.149 
precise frequency
when<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.820> sense<00:01:31.060> is<00:01:31.270> strained<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.799> frequency

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
when the sense is strained the frequency

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.580 
when the sense is strained the frequency
that<00:01:33.400> comes<00:01:33.759> back<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.390> different<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.530> has

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
that comes back is different it has

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.149 
that comes back is different it has
changed<00:01:36.159> by<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.400> certain<00:01:37.330> amount<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:38.710> use<00:01:38.890> two

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
changed by a certain amount we use two

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.889 
changed by a certain amount we use two
senses<00:01:40.080> one<00:01:41.080> working<00:01:41.580> at<00:01:42.580> one<00:01:42.850> frequency<00:01:43.030> and

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
senses one working at one frequency and

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.060 
senses one working at one frequency and
one<00:01:44.110> working<00:01:44.470> at<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.590> slightly<00:01:44.950> higher

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
one working at a slightly higher

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.719 
one working at a slightly higher
frequency<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:47.470> look<00:01:47.649> at<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:48.250> difference

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
frequency we look at the difference

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.190 
frequency we look at the difference
between<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.539> two<00:01:49.720> senses<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:51.250> you<00:01:51.430> apply<00:01:51.610> talk

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
between the two senses as you apply talk

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.350 
between the two senses as you apply talk
one<00:01:53.200> will<00:01:53.380> increase<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.890> frequency<00:01:54.149> one<00:01:55.149> will

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
one will increase the frequency one will

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.350 
one will increase the frequency one will
decrease<00:01:56.200> frequency<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:57.970> did<00:01:58.119> in<00:01:58.240> the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
decrease frequency if you did in the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.690 
decrease frequency if you did in the
other<00:01:58.479> direction<00:01:58.770> they<00:01:59.770> will<00:01:59.920> swap<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.549> other

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700

one

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
one

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.270 
one
that<00:02:01.900> means<00:02:02.110> of<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.380> difference<00:02:02.650> between

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
that means of that difference between

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
the two of them the difference frequency

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.200 
the two of them the difference frequency
which<00:02:04.900> is<00:02:05.020> normally<00:02:05.409> one<00:02:05.740> megahertz<00:02:06.210> we

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
which is normally one megahertz we

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.859 
which is normally one megahertz we
increase<00:02:07.750> if<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.410> apply<00:02:08.619> clockwise<00:02:09.130> talk

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
increase if you apply clockwise talk

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.180 
increase if you apply clockwise talk
decrease<00:02:10.869> if<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.170> apply<00:02:11.440> anti-clockwise

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
decrease if you apply anti-clockwise

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.990

talk

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.740 

you<00:02:15.510> didn't<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:16.170> simple<00:02:16.950> speed<00:02:17.220> encoder

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
you didn't have a simple speed encoder

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.060 
you didn't have a simple speed encoder
optical<00:02:18.750> speed<00:02:18.930> encoder<00:02:19.230> fitted<00:02:19.620> onto<00:02:19.740> here

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
optical speed encoder fitted onto here

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.280 
optical speed encoder fitted onto here
and<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.390> electronics<00:02:21.990> there<00:02:22.200> is

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
and so that in the electronics there is

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.650 
and so that in the electronics there is
an<00:02:22.380> obstacle<00:02:22.500> speed<00:02:22.980> pick<00:02:23.400> off<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.390> have<00:02:24.630> a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
an obstacle speed pick off so you have a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.020 
an obstacle speed pick off so you have a
sensitive<00:02:25.170> measures<00:02:25.680> torque<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.250> speed

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
sensitive measures torque and speed

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.150 
sensitive measures torque and speed
which<00:02:27.510> then<00:02:28.140> allows<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.740> compute<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
which then allows you to compute the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
power that's a three are interrelated

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.250 
power that's a three are interrelated
there<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.030> also<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.980> temperature<00:02:34.980> sensor

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
there is also a temperature sensor

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.690 
there is also a temperature sensor

further compensation for temperature
changes<00:02:46.189> because<00:02:46.519> as<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.819> temperature<00:02:47.329> changes

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099
