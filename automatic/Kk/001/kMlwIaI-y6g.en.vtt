00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.610
 many of the resident fans and 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.099
 bolt are still in shock after the 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.950
 announcement of that official remake of 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.050
 resident and bulldog that gives us backup with 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.639
 precisely last week well then 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.170
 attention because many people have been 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.320
 asked what will happen now then 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.329
 with that unofficial remake they were 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.669
 developing the guys of inverter 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.319
 games a title of truth that I had 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.319
 quite good looking especially for 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:31.329
 be developed by amateurs by 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:35.380
 so to say it to not be a project 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:38.020
 professional the truth is that the title 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.850
 quality was everywhere, there was 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.680
 many downloads in its first levels 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.470
 the title must be remembered that I was not 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.360
 finished and attention because invite der 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.910
 games the fan studio that was 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.740
 preparing resident and bulldog report 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.320
 that's what this remake was called 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.510
 official of this installment of the saga good 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.190
 It seems that it announced that the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.710
 project has been canceled after the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.710
 Resident and bulldog ad remake 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.509
 capcom has invited the fans behind 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.609
 this project to hold meetings with 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.330
 the developers of the official remake 

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:10.000
 for it 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.130
 in its good realization I believe that they 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.020
 has touched the lottery the big ones that 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.770
 it has to be a real prize for 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.020
 they 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.170
 and an eye deserved because I think that after 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.030
 this work they deserve it because let's say 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.880
 the fact that capcom call them and they 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.520
 let participate in the official remake of 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.410
 resident and vol 2 I think the company 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.350
 it has not been silly I think that capcom 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.870
 he knows precisely what he does and good 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.880
 Well, let's keep the statement 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.830
 they launched because they said capcom us 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.450
 asked us to cancel the project before 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.130
 the announcement occurred since 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.350
 they had long-term plans for 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.240
 residents and bulldog remake have us 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.430
 invited to a meeting with them to 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.710
 debating ideas is what the 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.780
 guys from invader games in a statement 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.670
 they also said even though we can not 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.450
 complete the project we are very 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.800
 happy with what we have taught and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.810
 let's say we have achieved the 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.910
 consent of the fans of all the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.400
 world and that has drawn attention 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.590
 from the capcom itself we promise that the 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.240
 work done so far will be useful for 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.220
 future projects so no 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.310
 we will disappoint you 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.780
 nor our expectations until the 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.180
 At the moment there are no details of 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.580
 resident and boldos remake we do not know if 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.310
 is going to have the style of the remakes 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.020
 good from the remake of the first resident and 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.480
 bull that the truth that I hope you have that 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.100
 style we do not know if it will have a camera 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.860
 behind as we are seeing now in this 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.930
 unofficial remake the truth is that I 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.050
 I hope that I do not prefer a little more 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.880
 the other style but well this is already a 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.710
 little opinion of purist of the saga 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.470
 ball resident and we'll see what 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.930
 we meet but we already know that 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.180
 these cracks that made the remake not 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.020
 rostre level 2 official are also going to 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.390
 be behind the official remake of this 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.870
 sequel of resident and ball that so much 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.870
 like 2
