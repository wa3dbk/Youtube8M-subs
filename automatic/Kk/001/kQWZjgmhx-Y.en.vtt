on his feet now as you can see on screen
right<00:00:58.829> now<00:00:58.890> seven<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.730> refinishing<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.780> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
right now seven if refinishing I have to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.209 
right now seven if refinishing I have to
disagree<00:01:01.079> with<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.379> he's<00:01:01.559> finishing<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.100> me

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
disagree with that he's finishing for me

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.160 
disagree with that he's finishing for me
was<00:01:02.640> actually<00:01:02.820> pretty<00:01:03.149> good<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.899> felt<00:01:04.049> that

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
was actually pretty good and I felt that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719 
was actually pretty good and I felt that
he<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.320> scoring<00:01:04.589> goals<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.430> really

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
he was scoring goals I really really

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.100 
he was scoring goals I really really
shouldn't<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.090> he<00:01:06.750> hasn't<00:01:06.960> got<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
shouldn't have he hasn't got the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.330 
shouldn't have he hasn't got the
Freestyle<00:01:07.470> weak<00:01:07.590> foot<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.010> wouldn't<00:01:08.250> really

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
Freestyle weak foot so I wouldn't really

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.010 
Freestyle weak foot so I wouldn't really
advise<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.850> his<00:01:09.030> left<00:01:09.210> foot<00:01:09.330> too<00:01:09.479> much<00:01:09.689> but

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
advise you of his left foot too much but

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
advise you of his left foot too much but
it's<00:01:10.140> right<00:01:10.320> foot<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:10.710> decent<00:01:11.189> now<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
it's right foot was decent now is a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.830 
it's right foot was decent now is a
shame<00:01:11.760> about<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.030> freestyle<00:01:12.479> weak<00:01:12.630> foot

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
shame about that freestyle weak foot

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.690 
shame about that freestyle weak foot
because<00:01:13.409> I'm<00:01:13.590> cutting<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.130> from<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> right

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
because I'm cutting in from the right

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.039 
because I'm cutting in from the right
side<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.330> probably<00:01:15.659> would<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.780> been<00:01:15.869> better

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
side it probably would have been better

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.570 
side it probably would have been better
for<00:01:16.140> him<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> leave<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.560> left-footed<00:01:17.040> I'll<00:01:17.250> have

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580

a<00:01:26.790> few<00:01:26.970> headers<00:01:27.240> which<00:01:27.360> obviously<00:01:27.600> was<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.170> bit

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
a few headers which obviously was a bit

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.810 
a few headers which obviously was a bit
pleasing<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:28.829> probably<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> best<00:01:29.430> girl<00:01:29.640> well

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820

was<00:01:31.829> actually<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.220> next<00:01:32.579> assist<00:01:32.909> i<00:01:33.030> think<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
was actually this next assist i think it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.850 
was actually this next assist i think it
is<00:01:33.360> from<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> corner<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.439> because<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.740> how

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
is from the corner just because of how

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
is from the corner just because of how
the<00:01:34.920> ball<00:01:35.220> goes<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> back<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.329> you

pretty

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
pretty

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.400 
pretty
if<00:02:13.330> I'm<00:02:13.420> honest<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.840> when<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.170> comes<00:02:14.230> to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
if I'm honest and when it comes to

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.990 
if I'm honest and when it comes to
passing<00:02:14.590> its<00:02:14.860> link<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.220> was<00:02:15.340> good<00:02:15.610> he's

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
passing its link it was good he's

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.880 
passing its link it was good he's
crossing<00:02:16.390> degree<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.230> no<00:02:17.440> complaints<00:02:17.800> there

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
crossing degree so no complaints there

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.340 
crossing degree so no complaints there
overall<00:02:18.490> he's<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.000> great<00:02:19.420> winger<00:02:19.810> he<00:02:19.990> really

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
overall he's a great winger he really

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.810 
overall he's a great winger he really
really<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.740> first<00:02:20.890> price<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.490> had<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.640> think

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
really is on first price I had to think

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.550 
really is on first price I had to think
his<00:02:21.970> worth<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.540> because<00:02:22.990> he's<00:02:23.110> already<00:02:23.350> is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
his worth it and because he's already is

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.860 
his worth it and because he's already is
minimum<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:24.040> his<00:02:24.130> price<00:02:24.340> range<00:02:24.370> ear<00:02:25.360> probably

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
minimum of his price range ear probably

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.510 
minimum of his price range ear probably
all<00:02:25.960> of<00:02:26.080> their<00:02:26.260> product<00:02:26.560> ranges<00:02:26.830> I'm<00:02:27.010> making

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
all of their product ranges I'm making

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.650 
all of their product ranges I'm making
much<00:02:27.670> cheaper<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.150> probably<00:02:28.360> wait<00:02:28.630> until

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
much cheaper so I probably wait until

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.540 
much cheaper so I probably wait until
his<00:02:29.020> price<00:02:29.170> ranges<00:02:29.470> been<00:02:29.620> lowered<00:02:29.950> but<00:02:30.310> still

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
his price ranges been lowered but still

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.280 
his price ranges been lowered but still
definitely<00:02:31.209> worth<00:02:31.300> picking<00:02:31.360> up<00:02:31.720> in<00:02:31.900> my

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
definitely worth picking up in my

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.630 
definitely worth picking up in my
opinion<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.680> negative<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.130> me<00:02:33.160> was<00:02:33.610> that

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
opinion a negative to me was that

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.580 
opinion a negative to me was that
