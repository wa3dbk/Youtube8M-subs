00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.400
 beautiful 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.090
 hello people welcome to week 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.939
 two and follow three men reach 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.379
 challenge the second week was honest 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.970
 said a bit of a hangover week 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.850
 I had actually planned myself 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.720
 More on this seal before getting fit 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.670
 enter into 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.170
 unfortunately that is a bit in the pants 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.730
 gone by the fact that I have a cold 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.019
 he already in the middle of the first week 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.699
 had gotten and that has unfortunately 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.519
 but until thursday friday like that 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.199
 I always pulled around and in the evening I always 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.250
 yet coughing fits ours 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.739
 now also on the weekend 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.900
 That's why I write first 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.239
 Tomorrow has the third week from Monday 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.159
 healthy again that's back 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.290
 Sports can start with one should also 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.580
 make no sport when you're sick 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.809
 all things not so endurance sports and 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.250
 so if somehow I run there 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.450
 constantly coughing as he does 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.100
 what is really stupid, really? 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.229
 what I am all the time 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.170
 Nevertheless, of course, it has been kept 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.759
 rescue plan there is nothing against the way 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.130
 to stick to the eating plan only 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.620
 because you have a cold but I have 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.240
 Not quite as many weekly news reports 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.620
 shot so many blogs full of irony 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.930
 That's why we have to look for this 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.490
 The content will be filled today and there 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.700
 I thought up a lot of things and 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.440
 Although we look, among other things 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.440
 wonderful food storage 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.700
 transport boxes for on the way to as 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.770
 you have to challenge a lot 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 preparatory work what to eat 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.700

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.330

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.770
 I honestly say to others 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.650

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.930
 happy and where I here just a 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.370
 Request also falls to me directly on it must 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.420
 not always be expensive that does not have to 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.250
 always be a brand 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.619
 but then we will come to that in a moment 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.720
 So too if everyone suits you 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.770
 event stay tuned and we look 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.270

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.360
 We will become the interlocutor now 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.880

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.190
 week and there, of course, look us here 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.290
 with statistical interim results 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.910
 So how my bmi already changed 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.170
 has how the fat content of the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.560
 Muscle content and water content 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.910
 whereby I have thereby changed that 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.190
 I could not do any sport 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.260
 I am so satisfied but it has become 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.970
 but I would not have done anything 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.950
 thought I would not have expected the 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.830
 actually so strong with the diet 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.810
 how are they related? 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.000
 with the composition of the body so 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.500
 stay tuned then we have 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.770
