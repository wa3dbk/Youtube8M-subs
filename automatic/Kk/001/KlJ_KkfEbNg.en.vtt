way I know when the whole section has

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.920 
way I know when the whole section has
warmed<00:02:18.860> doing<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.640> ends<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.120> way<00:02:20.360> will<00:02:20.600> also

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
warmed doing the ends this way will also

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.630

edge<00:02:22.940> where<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.750> whole<00:02:23.930> hair<00:02:24.170> is<00:02:24.320> curled<00:02:24.680> but

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
edge where the whole hair is curled but

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.460 
edge where the whole hair is curled but
the<00:02:25.070> end<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.400> not<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:26.450> want<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.720> wait<00:02:26.870> about<00:02:27.020> 30

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470

seconds<00:02:28.100> sometimes<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.760> minute<00:02:29.060> depending<00:02:29.510> on

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
seconds sometimes a minute depending on

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.930 
seconds sometimes a minute depending on
how<00:02:29.840> hot<00:02:30.110> your<00:02:30.140> iron<00:02:30.530> is<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.580> should<00:02:31.790> know

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
how hot your iron is you should know

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.610 
how hot your iron is you should know
because<00:02:32.150> your<00:02:32.570> finger<00:02:32.900> will<00:02:33.080> get<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.440> little

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
because your finger will get a little

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.420 
because your finger will get a little
bit<00:02:33.800> too<00:02:34.070> warm<00:02:35.290> it's<00:02:36.290> very<00:02:36.620> important<00:02:37.220> to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
bit too warm it's very important to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.340 
bit too warm it's very important to
leave<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.760> curl<00:02:38.000> alone<00:02:38.360> after<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:39.050> release

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
leave the curl alone after you release

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.979 
leave the curl alone after you release
it<00:02:39.590> from<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.800> crowing<00:02:40.100> line<00:02:40.430> this<00:02:41.209> way<00:02:41.510> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
it from the crowing line this way the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.140 
it from the crowing line this way the
curl<00:02:42.290> will<00:02:42.440> cool<00:02:42.739> in<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.160> exact<00:02:43.550> position

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
curl will cool in the exact position

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.510 
curl will cool in the exact position
that<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.450> love<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.650> when<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.130> allow<00:02:46.250> it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
that you love it and when you allow it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.000 
that you love it and when you allow it
to<00:02:46.550> cool<00:02:46.820> that<00:02:47.060> way<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.900> ensures<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.860> will

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
to cool that way it ensures that it will

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.940 
to cool that way it ensures that it will
stay<00:02:49.190> that<00:02:49.220> way<00:02:49.550> all<00:02:49.880> day<00:02:50.239> long<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:51.440> repeat

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
stay that way all day long so repeat

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.830 
stay that way all day long so repeat
this<00:02:51.980> process<00:02:52.370> all<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.270> way<00:02:53.300> around<00:02:53.690> your
