when you disassemble it really easy and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.419 
when you disassemble it really easy and
just<00:02:05.340> one<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.420> final<00:02:06.750> detail<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.799> make

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
just one little final detail to make

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.199 
just one little final detail to make
this<00:02:08.909> whole<00:02:09.149> installation<00:02:09.450> goes<00:02:09.810> really<00:02:10.019> well

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
this whole installation goes really well

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.240 
this whole installation goes really well
the<00:02:12.209> next<00:02:12.480> step<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.870> remove<00:02:13.500> these<00:02:13.650> rather

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
the next step is remove these rather

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.459 
the next step is remove these rather
large<00:02:14.519> standoffs<00:02:15.079> there's<00:02:16.079> four<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.349> them

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
large standoffs there's four of them

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.610 
large standoffs there's four of them
four<00:02:16.859> screws<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:18.719> need<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.989> install<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
four screws and we need to install the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.720 
four screws and we need to install the
mono<00:02:19.950> tech<00:02:20.159> LCD<00:02:20.579> and<00:02:21.290> basically<00:02:22.290> put<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.370> LCD
