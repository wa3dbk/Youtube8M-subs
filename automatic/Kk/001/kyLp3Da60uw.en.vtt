here's a quick video addressing the hot

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.420 
here's a quick video addressing the hot
spots<00:00:02.580> on<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.060> TD<00:00:03.360> 20<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.810> td-30<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:05.069> snare

snare toms everything they have a cone

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.250 
snare toms everything they have a cone
inside<00:00:17.250> them<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.840> this<00:00:18.840> needs<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.170> be

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
inside them and this needs to be

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.439 
inside them and this needs to be
replaced<00:00:19.560> I've<00:00:19.890> tried<00:00:20.189> changing<00:00:20.490> my

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
replaced I've tried changing my

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.630 
replaced I've tried changing my
compression<00:00:22.109> settings<00:00:22.560> I've<00:00:22.920> tried<00:00:23.160> changing

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
compression settings I've tried changing

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.660 
compression settings I've tried changing
my<00:00:23.880> my<00:00:24.359> V<00:00:24.539> curves<00:00:24.869> I've<00:00:25.710> tried<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
my my V curves I've tried the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.390 
my my V curves I've tried the
sensitivity<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.779> here's<00:00:28.590> here's<00:00:29.010> an<00:00:29.099> example

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
sensitivity and here's here's an example

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.620 
sensitivity and here's here's an example
of<00:00:29.580> what's<00:00:29.789> actually<00:00:29.910> happened<00:00:30.449> when<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.570> hit

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
of what's actually happened when I hit

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.510 
of what's actually happened when I hit
the<00:00:30.840> snare<00:00:31.019> drum<00:00:31.230> you'll<00:00:31.800> see<00:00:32.009> when<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.250> stick

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the snare drum you'll see when my stick

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.850 
the snare drum you'll see when my stick
is<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.790> center<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.930> much<00:00:34.200> more<00:00:34.380> sensitive

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
is the center it's much more sensitive

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.979 
is the center it's much more sensitive
than<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.280> outside<00:00:36.030> I'm<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> go<00:00:36.899> across

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
than the outside I'm going to go across

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.680 
than the outside I'm going to go across
the<00:00:37.320> snare<00:00:37.530> drum<00:00:37.770> doing<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> same<00:00:38.690> velocity

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the snare drum doing the same velocity

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:54.660 
the snare drum doing the same velocity
for<00:00:40.110> every<00:00:40.290> hit

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.069 

now<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:55.760> should<00:00:55.940> be<00:00:55.970> slightly<00:00:56.210> more<00:00:56.600> sensitive

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
now it should be slightly more sensitive

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.439 
now it should be slightly more sensitive
in<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.290> center<00:00:57.650> due<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.640> positional

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
in the center due to the positional

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.110 
in the center due to the positional
sensing<00:00:59.870> but<00:01:00.590> right<00:01:01.250> here<00:01:01.280> if<00:01:01.579> I<00:01:01.670> hit<00:01:01.820> the

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
sensing but right here if I hit the

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.760 
sensing but right here if I hit the
exact<00:01:02.420> center<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:06.080> can't<00:01:06.290> see<00:01:06.440> it<00:01:06.530> right<00:01:06.560> now

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
exact center you can't see it right now

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.219 
exact center you can't see it right now
but<00:01:06.890> on<00:01:07.009> my<00:01:07.100> module<00:01:07.840> there's<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.960> thing<00:01:09.110> that

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
but on my module there's the thing that

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.410 
but on my module there's the thing that
says<00:01:09.410> trigger<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:09.979> it<00:01:10.040> shows<00:01:10.310> how<00:01:11.240> hard

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
says trigger and it shows how hard

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.330

even a quarter of the way up so that
that<00:01:20.840> is<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:22.780> hot<00:01:23.780> spot<00:01:23.960> right<00:01:24.259> there<00:01:24.320> I'm

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
that is the hot spot right there I'm

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.090 
that is the hot spot right there I'm
going<00:01:25.910> to<00:01:25.970> show<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.149> how<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.330> change<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.720> cone

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
going to show you how to change the cone

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.820 
going to show you how to change the cone
here's<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.160> quick<00:01:28.399> example<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:30.500> one<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.740> the

here's a quick example of one of the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.350 
here's a quick example of one of the
cones<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.340> I've<00:01:31.520> received<00:01:31.729> in<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.180> mail

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
cones that I've received in the mail

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.529 
cones that I've received in the mail
from<00:01:32.899> Roland<00:01:33.350> they're<00:01:34.100> about<00:01:34.340> ten<00:01:35.179> bucks<00:01:35.420> a

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
from Roland they're about ten bucks a

pop maybe not even about five of them to
do<00:01:39.380> five<00:01:40.039> of<00:01:40.070> my<00:01:40.340> drums<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:42.789> one<00:01:43.789> second

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
do five of my drums and one second

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.410 
do five of my drums and one second
there's<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.440> cone<00:01:45.649> right<00:01:45.679> there<00:01:46.270> it's<00:01:47.270> got<00:01:47.390> a

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
there's the cone right there it's got a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.910 
there's the cone right there it's got a
sticky<00:01:47.810> pad<00:01:48.020> on<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.350> bottom<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:50.710> we'll<00:01:51.710> go

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
sticky pad on the bottom and we'll go

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.280 
sticky pad on the bottom and we'll go
I'll<00:01:52.220> take<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.030> mesh<00:01:53.180> head<00:01:53.360> off<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:54.049> probably

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
I'll take the mesh head off you probably

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.050 
I'll take the mesh head off you probably
don't<00:01:54.439> need<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.590> watch<00:01:54.770> this<00:01:54.950> part<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:55.520> I'll

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
don't need to watch this part so I'll

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.670 
don't need to watch this part so I'll
leave<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.299> put<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.509> in<00:01:56.600> fast-forward<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.350> I'll

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
alright I'll show you here just take the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.730 
alright I'll show you here just take the
six<00:02:24.060> lugs<00:02:24.300> off<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.900> regular<00:02:25.200> signal<00:02:25.620> most

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
six lugs off just a regular signal most

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.800 
six lugs off just a regular signal most
like<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> regular<00:02:26.040> drums<00:02:26.370> get<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.760> head<00:02:26.880> we'll

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
like a regular drums get in a head we'll

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.600 
like a regular drums get in a head we'll
set<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.050> down<00:02:28.320> for<00:02:28.560> now<00:02:28.710> as<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.460> can<00:02:29.550> see

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
set that down for now as you can see

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.960 
set that down for now as you can see
inside<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.330> drum<00:02:30.510> here<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.860> your<00:02:32.700> cone

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
inside the drum here you have your cone

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.590 
inside the drum here you have your cone
and<00:02:33.770> your<00:02:34.770> input<00:02:34.950> now<00:02:35.850> if<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.120> look<00:02:36.270> at<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
and your input now if you look at the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.140 
and your input now if you look at the
cones<00:02:36.810> here<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.710> fairly<00:02:37.890> solid<00:02:38.190> piece<00:02:38.580> now

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
cones here it's a fairly solid piece now

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.760 
cones here it's a fairly solid piece now
if<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.450> feel<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:39.840> one<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.350> actually<00:02:40.470> tell

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
if I feel this one I can actually tell

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.450 
if I feel this one I can actually tell
it's<00:02:41.090> it's<00:02:42.090> not<00:02:42.780> as<00:02:42.960> firm<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:43.620> drier<00:02:44.040> it's

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
it's it's not as firm it's drier it's

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.600 
it's it's not as firm it's drier it's
dried<00:02:44.760> out<00:02:44.910> over<00:02:45.180> time<00:02:45.390> it's<00:02:46.230> softer<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:47.010> can

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
dried out over time it's softer I can

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.920 
dried out over time it's softer I can
squish<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> lot<00:02:48.150> easier<00:02:48.390> than<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.690> squish

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
squish it a lot easier than I can squish

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.110 
squish it a lot easier than I can squish
that<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.860> they<00:02:49.980> do<00:02:50.040> degrade<00:02:50.850> over<00:02:50.880> time

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
that one so they do degrade over time

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.850 
that one so they do degrade over time
just<00:02:51.540> being<00:02:52.080> exposed<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.590> air<00:02:52.710> and
