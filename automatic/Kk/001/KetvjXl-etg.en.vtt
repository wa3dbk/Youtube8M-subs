00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
about the Large Hadron Collider or being

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.799 
about the Large Hadron Collider or being
turned<00:00:08.189> on<00:00:08.340> tomorrow<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.120> possibility

the<00:00:13.650> earth<00:00:13.769> whoa<00:00:14.219> that's<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.910> big<00:00:15.389> Collider

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
the earth whoa that's the big Collider

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.500 
the earth whoa that's the big Collider
that<00:00:16.199> dr.<00:00:16.980> Kaku<00:00:17.520> was<00:00:17.699> talking<00:00:18.119> about<00:00:18.180> what's

tomorrow and it could just turn the
whole<00:00:22.410> fucking<00:00:23.039> planet<00:00:23.330> into<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> big<00:00:24.570> black

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
whole fucking planet into a big black

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.509

our<00:00:26.699> universe<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.449> know<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.949> how<00:00:28.949> cool

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
our universe as we know it how cool

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.960 
our universe as we know it how cool
would<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.490> be

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970

wait so there's a possibility of this

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650 
wait so there's a possibility of this
and<00:00:32.040> they're<00:00:32.160> allowing<00:00:32.489> him<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.880> tart<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.480> up

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
and they're allowing him to tart it up

and they're allowing him to tart it up
turn<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> switch<00:00:35.420> let<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.660> switch

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
turn on the switch let the switch

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.130 
turn on the switch let the switch
possibility<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.270> they're<00:00:39.480> still<00:00:39.809> saying

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
possibility and they're still saying

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.470 
possibility and they're still saying
yeah<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.680> ahead<00:00:40.920> turn<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.730> well<00:00:41.940> where<00:00:42.300> is

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
yeah go ahead turn it on well where is

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.639 
yeah go ahead turn it on well where is
the<00:00:42.629> collider<00:00:42.960> carmine<00:00:45.530> Switzerland<00:00:46.530> it's

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the collider carmine Switzerland it's

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.840 
the collider carmine Switzerland it's
like<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> border<00:00:47.340> between<00:00:47.460> Switzerland

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
like on the border between Switzerland

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.389 
like on the border between Switzerland
France<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.840> they're<00:00:48.960> saying<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:50.190> it

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
France and they're saying that if it

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
France and they're saying that if it
does<00:00:50.579> occur<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.239> would<00:00:51.390> take<00:00:51.600> 50<00:00:52.050> months

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
does occur it would take 50 months

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.950 
does occur it would take 50 months
between<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.860> time<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.219> these<00:00:53.520> small<00:00:53.969> black

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
holes appear and and the time that

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.819 
holes appear and and the time that
they're<00:00:57.360> large<00:00:57.570> enough<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.050> swallow<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
they're large enough to swallow the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.279 
they're large enough to swallow the
earth<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> math<00:00:59.969> 50<00:01:00.899> months

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
thing is it's it's certain to kill us

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.870 
thing is it's it's certain to kill us
all<00:02:06.360> that's<00:02:06.810> all

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
all that's all

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.940 
all that's all
it's<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:10.000> giant<00:02:10.330> collider<00:02:10.960> it<00:02:11.530> would<00:02:11.650> take<00:02:11.800> like

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
it's a giant collider it would take like

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.310 
it's a giant collider it would take like
four<00:02:12.250> years<00:02:12.280> for<00:02:12.730> us<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.820> even<00:02:13.090> know<00:02:13.290> yes<00:02:14.290> I

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
four years for us to even know yes I

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.070 
four years for us to even know yes I
think<00:02:14.980> they'll<00:02:15.160> know<00:02:15.340> right<00:02:15.370> away<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.420> why<00:02:16.720> are

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
think they'll know right away so why are

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
think they'll know right away so why are
they<00:02:17.260> giving<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.950> okay<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:20.560> case<00:02:20.770> tomorrow

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
they giving the okay in case tomorrow

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.530 
they giving the okay in case tomorrow
yeah<00:02:21.610> wait<00:02:21.970> wait

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
yeah wait wait

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.150 
yeah wait wait
what<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.050> collider<00:02:23.350> doing<00:02:23.650> with<00:02:23.800> Adams

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
what is it collider doing with Adams

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.490 
what is it collider doing with Adams
it's<00:02:24.430> testing<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.030> Big<00:02:25.210> Bang<00:02:25.420> Theory<00:02:25.720> they

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
it's testing the Big Bang Theory they

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.650 
it's testing the Big Bang Theory they
take<00:02:29.160> they<00:02:30.160> take<00:02:30.190> an<00:02:30.520> atomic<00:02:30.970> particle<00:02:31.480> and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
take they take an atomic particle and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.410 
take they take an atomic particle and
fire<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:33.340> about<00:02:33.580> at<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.820> speed<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.210> light

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
fire it just about at the speed of light

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.410 
fire it just about at the speed of light
this<00:02:35.050> thing<00:02:35.110> smacks<00:02:35.800> into<00:02:36.160> something<00:02:36.730> and

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
this thing smacks into something and

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.050 
this thing smacks into something and
then<00:02:37.900> they<00:02:38.020> look<00:02:38.200> at<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:38.440> what<00:02:38.740> is<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.790> hits

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
then they look at it what is it it hits

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.300 
then they look at it what is it it hits
us<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.570> particle<00:02:41.050> that's<00:02:41.170> not<00:02:41.350> supposed<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.860> be

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
us a particle that's not supposed to be

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.680 
us a particle that's not supposed to be
splitting<00:02:42.610> out<00:02:42.820> like<00:02:42.970> right<00:02:43.180> right<00:02:43.540> well

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
splitting out like right right well

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.940 
splitting out like right right well
nobody's<00:02:43.960> ever<00:02:44.020> splitted<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.800> they're

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
nobody's ever splitted so they're

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.610 
nobody's ever splitted so they're
splitting<00:02:45.220> subatomic<00:02:45.700> particles<00:02:46.540> yeah<00:02:46.840> how

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
splitting subatomic particles yeah how

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.620 
splitting subatomic particles yeah how
do<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.740> know<00:02:47.800> if<00:02:48.040> it's<00:02:48.310> split<00:02:48.820> yeah<00:02:49.360> because

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
do you know if it's split yeah because

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.100 
do you know if it's split yeah because
you<00:02:50.080> know<00:02:50.110> what<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.710> do<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.010> look<00:02:51.280> up<00:02:51.430> know

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
you know what you do is you look up know

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.990 
you know what you do is you look up know
look<00:02:53.110> at<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.560> like<00:02:53.740> close<00:02:54.010> one<00:02:54.310> eye<00:02:54.340> yeah

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
look at it you like close one eye yeah

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.180 
look at it you like close one eye yeah
how<00:02:58.000> do<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.180> not<00:02:58.360> miss<00:02:58.630> they're<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.440> small<00:02:59.800> has

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
how do you not miss they're so small has

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.320 
how do you not miss they're so small has
that<00:03:00.400> kind<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.760> aim<00:03:02.670> Tomic<00:03:03.670> particle<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.330> can't

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
that kind of aim Tomic particle I can't

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.300 
that kind of aim Tomic particle I can't
it<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.420> amazing<00:03:08.170> when<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.440> think<00:03:08.470> about<00:03:08.800> it

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
it is amazing when you think about it

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.040 
it is amazing when you think about it
as<00:03:09.400> humans<00:03:09.880> we<00:03:10.000> take<00:03:10.240> way<00:03:10.480> too<00:03:10.540> much<00:03:10.870> for

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
as humans we take way too much for

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.110 
as humans we take way too much for
granted<00:03:11.080> don't<00:03:11.800> stop<00:03:12.459> they<00:03:12.760> don't<00:03:12.910> need<00:03:13.000> to

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
granted don't stop they don't need to

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.850 
granted don't stop they don't need to
know<00:03:13.270> what<00:03:13.480> they<00:03:13.810> thought<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.380> same<00:03:14.590> thing<00:03:14.620> is

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
know what they thought the same thing is

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.110 
know what they thought the same thing is
gonna<00:03:15.010> have<00:03:15.160> when<00:03:15.310> they<00:03:15.400> set<00:03:15.550> off<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.820> atom

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
gonna have when they set off the atom

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.400 
gonna have when they set off the atom
bomb<00:03:16.270> they<00:03:16.420> thought<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.690> chain<00:03:16.900> reaction<00:03:17.320> was

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
bomb they thought the chain reaction was

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.560 
bomb they thought the chain reaction was
gonna<00:03:17.500> take<00:03:17.800> all<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.220> atomic<00:03:19.060> particles<00:03:19.420> in

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
gonna take all the atomic particles in

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.180 
gonna take all the atomic particles in
the<00:03:19.690> atmosphere<00:03:19.900> right<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.739> set<00:03:20.980> them<00:03:21.160> on

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
the atmosphere right and set them on

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.070 
the atmosphere right and set them on
fire<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.700> start<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:21.970> big<00:03:22.090> reaction<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.720> they

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
fire and start a big reaction and they

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.979 
fire and start a big reaction and they
honestly<00:03:23.830> didn't<00:03:24.459> really<00:03:24.850> know<00:03:25.060> until<00:03:25.840> they

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
honestly didn't really know until they

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.780 
honestly didn't really know until they
did<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.350> but<00:03:26.500> well<00:03:26.650> since<00:03:26.800> a<00:03:26.980> huge<00:03:27.400> war<00:03:27.640> was

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
did it but well since a huge war was

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.340 
did it but well since a huge war was
going<00:03:28.000> on<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.150> figured<00:03:28.270> fuck<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.750> when<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.170> was

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
going on I figured fuck it when I was

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.590 
going on I figured fuck it when I was
growing<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:29.709> shot<00:03:30.130> when<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.060> was<00:03:31.209> growing<00:03:31.390> up

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
growing that shot when I was growing up

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.940 
growing that shot when I was growing up
and<00:03:31.720> we<00:03:31.810> did<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.050> moon<00:03:32.200> landing<00:03:32.560> thing<00:03:32.770> and

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
and we did the moon landing thing and

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.740 
and we did the moon landing thing and
they<00:03:33.010> brought<00:03:33.220> stuff<00:03:33.520> back<00:03:33.790> I'm<00:03:33.970> like<00:03:34.060> why<00:03:34.360> are

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
they brought stuff back I'm like why are

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.720 
they brought stuff back I'm like why are
you<00:03:34.900> just<00:03:35.110> bringing<00:03:35.350> stuff<00:03:35.890> back<00:03:35.950> from<00:03:36.340> the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
you just bringing stuff back from the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.699 
you just bringing stuff back from the
moon<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.209> assuming<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:37.870> not<00:03:37.989> gonna<00:03:38.140> kill<00:03:38.500> us

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
moon and assuming it's not gonna kill us

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.580 
moon and assuming it's not gonna kill us

on<00:03:46.150> earth<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.630> I<00:03:52.950> was<00:03:53.950> in<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.190> when<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:55.150> was<00:03:55.239> in

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
on earth and I was in a when I was in

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.259 
on earth and I was in a when I was in
England<00:03:55.690> just<00:03:55.840> now<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.560> went<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.430> also<00:03:57.820> France
