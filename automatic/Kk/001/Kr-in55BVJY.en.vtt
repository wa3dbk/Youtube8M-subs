00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.129
 very good maca more I am from the rumba that 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.469
 in my first video before I start with 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:14.080
 the theories of today I would like to speak a 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.119
 little about the channel the main theme 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.580
 of the channel will theorize about the series 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.350
 one piece and from that I will try 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.230
 go evolve the channel and see up 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.120
 where we arrived hehehe finally only me 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.340
 I would like to clarify that all the information 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.080
 that goes out in the different 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.330
 videos is not all mine just in case 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.180
 I will leave the sources of information in the 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.340
 description I already rolled up let's start 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.350
 with today's theory for the first 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.989
 video I've decided to make a theory about 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.420
 one of the most talked about topics the new 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.160
 cis and look for the first candidate is the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.230
 supernova heuer reads bonh and from which 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.450
 we know that she was defeated by Kurt today and 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.940
 after rejecting the offer to be his wife 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.649
 and then captured by the navy the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.420
 base on which this is based 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.850
 theory is that after a period of 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.860
 inactivity now lets us see jewel and 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.260
 hidden behind a raincoat in freedom 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.940
 that makes you think that you could have done 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.369
 a deal with the world government 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.319
 becoming sitges and booker and with 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.690
 the information that we now have we can 

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:12.790
 discard this theory since when 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.280
 marines go to the seventh they say to 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.170
 man of whom I already told you apart 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.210
 heuer reads bonh and has not done anything so 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.760
 that the other pirates have respect 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.620
 the reason why he jewel and is not in 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.140
 imp the down captured is still a 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.910
 mystery the next one is where is the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.250
 preferred candidate from around the world 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.050
 has one of the most powerful lodges and 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.150
 now he said that if he were in the great 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.310
 line would have neither more nor less than a 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.380
 reward of 500 million berries 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.840
 a figure that would give him the respect 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.970
 necessary to be sexy bucay that in him 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.980
 out the seventh would also explain by 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.140
 what in the meeting of the navy your poster 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.090
 it does not appear because, as the 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.070
 life in the clouds in both directions 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.170
 those of the navy do not have any 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.210
 photography but if we remember the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.100
 character in the in skype we'll see 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.990
 that he did not like receiving orders 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.390
 from nobody and if you have not changed your way 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.670
 of being I do not see it very capable too 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.800
 it could be that when I have seen that there is 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.990
 pirates much stronger than him by 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.570
 example the yuncos is mentalized 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.700
 In any case I'm sure a hundred per 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.500
 one hundred that we will see in him again 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.780
 social networks also sounds the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.880
 frame name the phoenix 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.040
 in my opinion I see that frames can not 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.780
 it comes together with here and not that it almost kills so 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.150
 I said and he has done a lot of damage to his 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.130
 crew on frame I think not 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.530
 will replace the post if it follows and 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.870
 that we will also see it again, be alone 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.670
 with his crew then we have the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.620
 supernova x trek 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.480
 in my opinion it fits quite well with the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.489
 profile but I do not think the Navy what 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.380
 choose since it was he himself who left 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.170
 the navy in the past and I do not think that 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.239
 trust him a lot apart from that already 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.220
 is busy with all the decayed roll 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.290
 the last theory is that of the new 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.209
 character that personally is the one 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.160
 I see more possible since oda does not 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.220
 would bother hiding characters so 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.110
 recent if he is a known character 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.000
 it has to be for example an enemy 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.920
 weak that has become strong after 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.110
 of time and that when it comes out 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.660
 totally unexpected but that in the end 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.269
 it seems good to us if the character is 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.459
 totally new can be a newbie with 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.650
 prodigious skills and who do not want 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.780
 publicize still as a weapon 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.310
 secret or what do I know later may not 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.739
 be a pirate that is a 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.140
 bounty hunter or something like that 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.990
 would explain why nobody knows him or salt 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.880
 on posters and those things in summary that 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.920
 if it's a new character it has to be 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.110
 very strong there is a fact that reinforces 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.540
 quite the theory of the new character 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.100
 and is that now reveals in a conference 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.590
 that there will be a very powerful new enemy 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.990
 that will be important in the future of the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.390
 series this makes think that that new 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.580
 character will be the seventh and I share 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.380
 this opinion good nothing more up here 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.020
 today's video I hope you have them 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.880
 liked like for more theories subscribe 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.880
 and see you in the next video
