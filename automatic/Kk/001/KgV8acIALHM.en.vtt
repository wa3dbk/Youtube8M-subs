00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
this gave me the opportunity to to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.459 
this gave me the opportunity to to
create<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> piece<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.689> has<00:02:00.689> many<00:02:01.049> little

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.160 

it's<00:02:20.990> mostly<00:02:22.150> balcan<00:02:23.150> music<00:02:23.540> for<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:23.870> piece

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
it's mostly balcan music for this piece

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.030 
it's mostly balcan music for this piece
because<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.040> find<00:02:25.570> Balcom<00:02:26.570> music<00:02:26.900> has<00:02:27.080> many

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
because I find Balcom music has many

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.840 
because I find Balcom music has many
many<00:02:28.310> different<00:02:28.730> colors<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:31.250> also<00:02:31.430> tells

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
many different colors and it also tells

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.580 
many different colors and it also tells
a<00:02:32.120> lot<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.600> stories<00:02:34.330> title<00:02:35.330> of<00:02:35.600> bloom<00:02:35.960> came

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
a lot of stories title of bloom came

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.220 
a lot of stories title of bloom came
about<00:02:36.920> through<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.400> idea<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.570> tree<00:02:38.870> and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
about through the idea of of a tree and

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.430 
about through the idea of of a tree and
when<00:02:39.890> it's<00:02:40.070> covered<00:02:40.820> in<00:02:40.880> blossom<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:42.050> has<00:02:42.290> this

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
when it's covered in blossom it has this

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.770 
when it's covered in blossom it has this
magnificence<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:44.030> beauty<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.690> the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
magnificence and this beauty and the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.560 
magnificence and this beauty and the
splendor<00:02:45.380> but<00:02:45.980> ultimately<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.820> blossom<00:02:47.480> is

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
splendor but ultimately the blossom is

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.360 
splendor but ultimately the blossom is
something<00:02:47.930> very<00:02:48.050> very<00:02:48.290> fragile<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.220> very

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
something very very fragile and very

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.440 
something very very fragile and very
temporary<00:02:50.210> and<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:52.580> actually<00:02:52.790> covers<00:02:53.270> up<00:02:53.420> the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
temporary and it actually covers up the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.510 
temporary and it actually covers up the
real<00:02:53.810> essence<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.709> strength<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
real essence and the strength of the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.120 
real essence and the strength of the
tree<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:55.970> what<00:02:56.150> lies<00:02:56.360> beneath<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:57.130> that

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
tree of what lies beneath and that
