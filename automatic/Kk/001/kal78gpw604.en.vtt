00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Mr. Doctor Reisinger what can ozone 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.230
 actually in dentistry ours 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.469
 Medical ozone can be very much 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.610
 cause as one of the very few 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.440
 We offer dental surgeries in Austria 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.269
 for some time our patients the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.460
 ozone therapy with success 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.270
 We use ozone wherever it is 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.769
 is considered bacteria viruses or fungi 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.439
 reliable fast and above all for 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.539
 to remove the patient painlessly 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.699
 There is now a savings 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.529
 in modern dentistry where the ozone 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.480
 not used meaningful there I would be 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.059
 think here in particular anti caries 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.370
 Therapy including the therapy of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.200
 Milk tooth caries where we are about to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.570
 the life of a new census to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.920
 combat prepared dentistry and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.410
 therefore the desired sterility 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.059
 reach so that we can exclude 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.550
 that under a new leadership again 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.590
 chaos arises we use the ozone 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.690
 further done with amazing in 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.039
 the treatment of periodontal disease in the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.920
 inflammatory many diseases 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.020
 And last but not least, we can also go out 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.739
 of the maxillofacial surgery no longer the ozone 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.690
 wegdenken 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.970
 we lead in our practice partly very 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.189
 extensive jaw critical operations 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.570
 through and also pay for implantations 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.790
 we finally reach the desired 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.590
 germ-free implant will be a whole 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.150
 essential factor for the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.439
 trouble-free and reliable 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.220
 compliance of our artificial 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.220
 is tooth roots 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.500
 during our hectic sealing 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.540
 First, let's do a professional 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.630
 Teeth cleaning of the teeth to be sealed 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.910
 by subsequently we create for 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.490
 every tooth a reader fluorescence 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.320
 Measurement to ensure that not in 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.690
 the depth of the tooth or enter deep 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.280
 The hairstyle collections of caries 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.550
 Bacteria or what is much worse 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.920
 would be already paris lesions are present 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.900
 then we go with pink on it 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.580
 achieve the desired 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.120
 germ-free and are therefore safe 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.130
 Sterile teeth to seal 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.290
 Then there is still a rarity and 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.390
 this package guarantees the patient 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.710
 with appropriate care that this 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.710
 dental caries remains free
