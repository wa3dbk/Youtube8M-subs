00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
for a nice front cover on the back it's

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.040 
for a nice front cover on the back it's
not<00:04:43.940> as<00:04:44.090> good<00:04:44.240> as<00:04:44.389> even<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.560> Sin<00:04:45.800> City<00:04:46.040> won

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
not as good as even the Sin City won

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.370 
not as good as even the Sin City won
lots<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.230> lots<00:04:48.350> of<00:04:48.440> German<00:04:48.740> writing<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:50.380> too

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
lots and lots of German writing and too

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.870 
lots and lots of German writing and too
much<00:04:51.530> information<00:04:51.860> at<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.280> bottom<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.700> would

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
much information at the bottom I would

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.370 
much information at the bottom I would
have<00:04:52.970> liked<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.270> nice<00:04:53.600> clean<00:04:53.900> picture<00:04:54.139> of<00:04:54.290> the

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
have liked a nice clean picture of the

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.129 
have liked a nice clean picture of the
back<00:04:54.560> which<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:56.240> know<00:04:56.360> just<00:04:56.570> basically<00:04:56.840> this

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
back which you know just basically this

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.890 
back which you know just basically this
or<00:04:57.440> something<00:04:57.860> else<00:04:58.100> but<00:04:58.570> you<00:04:59.570> know<00:04:59.690> all<00:04:59.810> this

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
or something else but you know all this

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.270 
or something else but you know all this
could<00:05:00.110> have<00:05:00.139> been<00:05:00.230> Porton<00:05:00.530> a<00:05:00.590> card<00:05:00.830> and<00:05:01.040> been

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
could have been Porton a card and been

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.909 
could have been Porton a card and been
removed<00:05:01.610> so<00:05:01.820> it's<00:05:01.910> a<00:05:01.970> bit<00:05:02.090> disappointing<00:05:02.919> but

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
removed so it's a bit disappointing but

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.340 
removed so it's a bit disappointing but
it<00:05:03.980> does<00:05:04.310> make<00:05:04.490> up<00:05:04.700> for<00:05:04.910> it<00:05:04.970> a<00:05:05.000> little<00:05:05.350> the

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
it does make up for it a little the

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.550 
it does make up for it a little the
artwork<00:05:06.530> goes<00:05:07.220> around<00:05:07.460> as<00:05:07.700> you<00:05:07.790> can<00:05:07.910> see
