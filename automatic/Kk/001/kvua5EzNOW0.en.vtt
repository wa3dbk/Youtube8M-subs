it helps getting the kills with the
sandstorm<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.789> that<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.030> kind<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.420> necessary

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
sandstorm and that is kind of necessary

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.560 
sandstorm and that is kind of necessary
for<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> set<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> work<00:00:58.800> effectively<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.760> all

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
for the set to work effectively so all

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.130

has<00:01:04.470> come<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:05.850> Aaron<00:01:06.450> can

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
has come up here but I think Aaron can

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.800 
has come up here but I think Aaron can
take<00:01:06.930> azumarill<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.740> right<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.330> think<00:01:09.570> you

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
take azumarill on right so I think you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
take azumarill on right so I think you
know<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.549> going

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
know what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.520 
know what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to leave tita and bring Aaron and then

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.730 
to leave tita and bring Aaron and then
the<00:01:17.490> question<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.600> bring<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740

thunderous<00:01:20.310> maybe<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> think<00:01:21.420> that

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
thunderous maybe because I think that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080 
thunderous maybe because I think that
that<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.799> broken<00:01:23.070> ass<00:01:23.340> thing<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.880> kill

bullet<00:03:38.500> punch<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.920> thing<00:03:39.360> so<00:03:40.360> maybe<00:03:40.660> he'll

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
bullet punch is a thing so maybe he'll

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.480 
bullet punch is a thing so maybe he'll
do<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.380> he<00:03:41.470> actually<00:03:41.620> might<00:03:41.860> be<00:03:42.010> faster

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
do that and he actually might be faster

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.890 
do that and he actually might be faster
i'm<00:03:42.580> not<00:03:42.730> quite<00:03:42.880> sure<00:03:42.910> actually<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.810> know

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
i'm not quite sure actually you know

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.440 
i'm not quite sure actually you know
what<00:03:44.110> i<00:03:44.140> am<00:03:44.260> running<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.770> sassy<00:03:45.190> guitar<00:03:45.640> because

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
what i am running a sassy guitar because

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.370 
what i am running a sassy guitar because
of<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.530> focus<00:03:48.280> punch<00:03:48.670> sex<00:03:49.300> is<00:03:49.630> generally<00:03:50.110> it

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
of the focus punch sex is generally it

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.650 
of the focus punch sex is generally it
runs<00:03:50.620> like<00:03:50.710> a<00:03:50.830> negative<00:03:51.130> speed<00:03:51.670> nature

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
runs like a negative speed nature

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.600 
runs like a negative speed nature
because<00:03:52.900> it's<00:03:53.020> going<00:03:53.200> mixed<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.430> kind

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
because it's going mixed and that kind

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.490 
because it's going mixed and that kind
of<00:03:54.640> thing<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.600> he'll<00:03:55.780> probably<00:03:55.960> faster<00:03:56.380> and

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
of thing so he'll probably faster and

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.680 
of thing so he'll probably faster and
meteor<00:03:56.710> mash<00:03:56.860> me<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.130> kill<00:03:57.250> me<00:03:57.280> but<00:03:57.600> worry<00:03:58.600> not

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
meteor mash me and kill me but worry not

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
to be faster than me so that's fine cool

meditours<00:04:16.900> out<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.230> way<00:04:17.320> which<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.530> good

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
meditours out the way which is good

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.229 
meditours out the way which is good
because<00:04:18.310> that's<00:04:18.520> one<00:04:18.820> thing<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.060> actually

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
because that's one thing that actually

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.810 
because that's one thing that actually
wouldn't<00:04:19.690> die<00:04:19.810> Jay<00:04:19.989> sandstorm<00:04:20.730> using<00:04:21.730> the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
wouldn't die Jay sandstorm using the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.000 
wouldn't die Jay sandstorm using the
iron<00:04:21.970> technique<00:04:22.570> now<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.440> i<00:04:23.530> think<00:04:23.560> about<00:04:23.830> it

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
iron technique now that i think about it

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.710 
iron technique now that i think about it
just<00:04:24.640> should<00:04:24.760> be<00:04:24.850> thinking<00:04:25.120> about<00:04:25.180> because

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
just should be thinking about because

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.950 
just should be thinking about because
that's<00:04:26.140> kind<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.530> necessary<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.370> entire

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
that's kind of necessary to the entire

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.040 
that's kind of necessary to the entire
premise<00:04:28.960> going<00:04:29.410> on<00:04:29.530> here<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:30.460> there<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.090> go<00:04:31.150> um

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
premise going on here so there you go um

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.080 
premise going on here so there you go um
I<00:04:32.110> didn't<00:04:32.980> always<00:04:33.070> final<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.640> gonna<00:04:33.790> be<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.000> we
