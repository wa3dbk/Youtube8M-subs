charging<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.450> soon<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> put<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> load

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
charging but as soon as you put a load

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.529 
charging but as soon as you put a load
on<00:00:46.469> those<00:00:46.680> are<00:00:46.890> dropping<00:00:47.340> off<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.300> can't

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
on those are dropping off so you can't

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.630 
on those are dropping off so you can't
just<00:00:48.690> start<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.050> car<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:49.949> let<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.399> idle

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
just start a car and then let it idle

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.529 
just start a car and then let it idle
and<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:52.579> check<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> voltage<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.270> coming

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and and check the voltage just coming

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.189 
and and check the voltage just coming
out<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.789> got<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.239> easy<00:00:57.809> way<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
out of it so you got to do easy way to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.990 
out of it so you got to do easy way to
do<00:00:58.410> without<00:00:58.649> any<00:00:58.829> special<00:00:59.219> tools<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.820> size

the<00:03:12.829> voltage<00:03:13.190> back<00:03:13.400> into<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.880> battery<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.510> lot

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
the voltage back into the battery a lot

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.380 
the voltage back into the battery a lot
of<00:03:15.349> these<00:03:15.440> you'll<00:03:15.590> see<00:03:15.620> they'll<00:03:16.069> be<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.329> 13-8

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
of these you'll see they'll be a 13-8

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.690 
of these you'll see they'll be a 13-8
right<00:03:17.989> now<00:03:18.140> it's<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.069> 13-9<00:03:19.519> maybe<00:03:20.180> even<00:03:20.360> 14<00:03:21.700> and

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
right now it's a 13-9 maybe even 14 and

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.370 
right now it's a 13-9 maybe even 14 and
you'll<00:03:23.060> sit<00:03:23.269> there<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.480> let<00:03:23.660> them<00:03:23.720> go<00:03:24.079> and

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
you'll sit there and let them go and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.289 
you'll sit there and let them go and
they<00:03:24.440> just<00:03:25.160> can't<00:03:25.430> keep<00:03:25.670> up<00:03:25.880> with<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.090> load

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
they just can't keep up with the load

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.410 
they just can't keep up with the load
and<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:26.989> is<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.319> really<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.950> best<00:03:28.430> way<00:03:28.730> I've

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
and this is the really the best way I've

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.569 
and this is the really the best way I've
found<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.989> load<00:03:30.319> tested<00:03:30.769> without<00:03:30.829> any<00:03:31.160> special

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
found to load tested without any special

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.300 
found to load tested without any special
tools<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.840> comes<00:03:33.079> out<00:03:33.260> fine<00:03:33.709> every<00:03:34.099> time

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
tools and it comes out fine every time

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.330 
tools and it comes out fine every time
as<00:03:34.610> far<00:03:35.480> as<00:03:35.540> identifying<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.950> weak

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
as far as identifying a a weak

as far as identifying a a weak
alternator<00:03:38.060> not<00:03:38.780> up<00:03:38.959> not<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.910> alternator

alternator not up not a alternator
that's<00:03:41.150> not<00:03:41.329> working<00:03:41.569> at<00:03:41.660> all<00:03:41.750> it's<00:03:41.930> it's<00:03:42.139> the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
that's not working at all it's it's the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.720 
that's not working at all it's it's the
weak<00:03:42.769> alternators<00:03:43.400> that<00:03:43.609> get<00:03:43.850> ya<00:03:44.319> so<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:46.489> flies

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
weak alternators that get ya so it flies

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.610 
weak alternators that get ya so it flies
loads<00:03:47.030> on<00:03:47.269> weight<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.810> three<00:03:48.019> minutes<00:03:48.350> or<00:03:48.440> so

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
loads on weight to three minutes or so

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.500 
loads on weight to three minutes or so
and<00:03:48.859> you'll<00:03:49.160> see<00:03:49.489> like<00:03:49.760> this<00:03:49.970> once<00:03:50.239> it's

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
and you'll see like this once it's

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.180 
and you'll see like this once it's
holding<00:03:50.810> just<00:03:51.079> fine<00:03:51.290> fourteen<00:03:51.859> point<00:03:52.160> one

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190

eight fourteen point two it can it can

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.770 
eight fourteen point two it can it can
handle<00:03:55.549> just<00:03:55.970> fine<00:03:56.180> when<00:03:56.480> it's<00:03:56.569> perfectly

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
handle just fine when it's perfectly

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.500 
handle just fine when it's perfectly
fine<00:03:57.250> but<00:03:58.250> you'll<00:03:58.400> see<00:03:58.730> solving<00:03:59.239> they'll<00:03:59.359> be<00:03:59.480> a

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
fine but you'll see solving they'll be a

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.470 
fine but you'll see solving they'll be a
thirteen<00:04:00.079> point<00:04:00.380> eight<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:01.060> in<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.359> no

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
instead of just checking that voltage on

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.310 
instead of just checking that voltage on
there<00:04:57.680> so<00:04:58.460> I<00:04:58.520> hope<00:04:58.700> this<00:04:58.820> helps<00:04:59.270> see<00:05:00.080> you<00:05:00.170> guys
