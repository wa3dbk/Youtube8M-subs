00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.770
 I'm attacked from nothing 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.199
 No one has been completely surprised 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.480
 warning nothing 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.280
 I did not expect that 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.230
 Have a nice evening in the restaurant and 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.820
 wanted a bit more stable 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.820
 and completely 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.420
 it was supposed to have parades in conversation 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.520
 we separated so a bit bit 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.930
 and I was so much preferred 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.030
 a bit retarded 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.100
 That's why I was in the moment because he was 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.100
 alone the team on 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.790
 are you looking like that? 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.790
 to process that and with the whole 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.880
 situation to get along since I 'm real 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.750
 long for used has a lot of time 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.760
 needed and it was also a heavy one 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.550
 Time 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.790
 So what really helped me was the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.310
 whole story was to process that 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.080
 I found the sport school cologne 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.080
 and start training there 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.140
 So luta livre is Brazilian 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.140
 wrestling 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.290
 my name is andreas schmidt i am 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.160
 graduate sports scientist and lead 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.160
 the sports school kwak 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 if you are facing violent situations 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.069
 First of all , you have to protect 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.560
 First, train the perception 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.510
 you have to have the ability 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.650
 to perceive which situations 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.890
 are dangerous for me 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.230
 where do I have to take special care what can 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.130
 I possibly do 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.360
 the next step would actually be 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.310
 then the scan that you really tried 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.290
 find out what options have 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.830
 I withdraw from the situation 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.910
 how can i get help how can i 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.130
 which items i can maybe 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.930
 use what can be of use to me here 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.489
 how can I sit the local what 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.900
 always the last step and 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.819
 of course, the step of why once 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.580
 the most self-confidence exists 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.950
 of course if you can fight and yourself 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.320
 can defend and at the moment where 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.750
 Of course, you master that and under 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.630
 trained in the appropriate conditions 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.200
 then you can safely 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.850
 be that this automated movement 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.760
 at the right moment too 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.070
 So the training is off with me 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.190
 Does that really please me ? 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.709
 even I know what I can do 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.820
 which abilities I did not trust 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:28.229
 me more and I can do better 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.690
 assess who is dangerous and 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.970
 which situations are dangerous and 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.280
 when I have to take care and a little 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.860
 when i stay relaxed too 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.230
 So it does not matter in every situation 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.820
 where I am where I can always situations 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.480
 evaluate very well and for me one 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.480
 self confident 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:04.240
 which of course also contributes to this 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.060
 is that we supplement on functional 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.469
 doing fitness training is just that 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:15.129
 helps the whole posture that makes 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:17.110
 straighten your back and thereby warm you 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.300
 sometimes know his body differently and know 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.050
 knows every muscle and medicine then 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.330
 function 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.560
 that is for the whole appearance 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:30.550
 again different if you just 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.949
 feels better and more active you stop 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.560
 feeling if you can be more active and 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.419
 the joints do not hurt and you feel 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.650
 just cool and confident 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.650
 then you shine out 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:15.200
 toxic barrel perfectly supplements 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.890
 capable and skilled for fighting 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.440
 through this functional fitness training 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:25.490
 the body is erected that is 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.050
 the attitude with knife and clear itself 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.550
 the self- confidence will strengthen that 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.210
 I also strengthened by that 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.680
 of course, gets more power 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.120
 I already need cologne want her 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.160
 I 've got a little bit foal 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.450
 I 've been around a bit and 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.300
 trying to get something out over 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:44.000
 self-defense and become what if he 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.620
 good is who knows and then 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.620
 the sport shoes cologne were recommended 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.740
 if you are here in the sport school cologne 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.510
 you can do a rehearsal training 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.780
 Just let me know 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.940
 and can just join in 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:03.510
 So I just want to go there 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.940
 on the phone want to say nice woman come 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.510
 over and i was media i was real 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.420
 nervous 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:12.570
 It was all new and then I came in 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.280
 welcomed directly and the friendly 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.890
 was his panic felt well 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.200
 and dirt and not first 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.270
 to watch but carry was with it 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.400
 everyone was super happy to hear it was 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.110
 really cool 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.850
 I have been training for two years now 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:31.020
 sportschule can in under prefer 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.340
 and it has a positive overall 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.970
 had an influence on my life 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:38.390
 So, of course, I got it 

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.390
 have decreased 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.680
 I just feel more confident 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.330
 and not only in situations in 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.560
 physical situation with violence 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:51.360
 but also people are approaching new ones 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.190
 to address people of strangers 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.010
 somehow contact them 

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:59.690
 that's a lot easier for me today than 

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.690
 two years ago
