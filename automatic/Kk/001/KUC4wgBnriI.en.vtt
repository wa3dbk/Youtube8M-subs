00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.670
 When a jam jam occurs 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.770
 paper immediately on the display will 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.990
 it tells us paper jammed in the 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.850
 printer there is even an option to 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:22.320
 help where he gives us a menu where we 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.710
 help the machine and see how we can 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.119
 highlight or unclog that leaf we open 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.119
 machine 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 we have to remove this piece between 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.800
 fingers 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.540
 and placing is very important this place 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.540
 this piece in this place on top of 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.530
 automatic feeder of originals and 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.000
 we can appreciate the leaf, which is 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.350
 is going to make it difficult because there is another piece 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.350
 that we will have to withdraw 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.090
 here are some green guides the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.090
 which we take 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.760
 we place 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.530
 and then we have to grab 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.280
 the sheet 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.750
 and little by little withdraw it as if 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.659
 I was processing 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.950
 and shut up 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.230
 we proceed to place the pieces in their 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.330
 place 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.680
 it is an extremely procedure 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.530
 simple very easy on good rails 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.659
 there we even feel when in bona 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.040
 once in nothing of that part with much 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.560
 watch out 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.610
 we take this part 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.610
 and we put it 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.990
 we close 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.900
 and at that moment will process the copy 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.900
 that did not finish processing halal 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.459
 and finish processing our copy in 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.110
 the rare case that it gets stuck 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.190
 an original in the automatic feeder 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.470
 of originals just as is the 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.530
 case as you can see it is stuck 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.640
 it is not advisable to remove it 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.360
 against the direction of travel of 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.080
 feeder in this way no 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.840
 it is simply open 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.200
 here we can see that there is the sheet 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.970
 stuck 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.170
 it is nothing else to walk 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.170
 very carefully 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.300
 pull it 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.270
 and that the whole sheet of our 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.190
 original 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.980
 At that time, the panel of 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.800
 original place operation and press 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.400
 start we will not place our 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.400
 original 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.940
 recognizes the display 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.159
 and re- read the 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.900
 originals to process the copy or 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.900
 do the document scan
