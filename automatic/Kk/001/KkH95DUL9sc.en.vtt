00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:16.040
 man day of minds new fashion 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.830
 which sumann cup italia as a summer all 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.230
 well i hope so too for you what 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.710
 I wanted to tell you what I wanted to show you 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.630
 this day I show you a mod that a 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.580
 apparently in the next mine version 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.070
 which will be implemented in the main cra 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.340
 vanilla that is in the 1.9 therefore this 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.579
 fashion will still last a little as it seems is 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.460
 this mode is the fashion road blocks 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.770
 let's look at what this does right away 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.660
 simple fashion almost all yours 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.489
 materials thanks to a system of 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.770
 crafting that I will show you in now 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.680
 bottom as you can see they will become 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.559
 real street movements 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.880
 something that I noticed above all 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.489
 you can do with almost any material 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.219
 that exist in minecraft i guess not 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.429
 miss anyone could round gtb woods 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.469
 all the sand as serious and get them 

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:08.149
 this clever thing but before 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.789
 show you how to make them I want to show you 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.999
 a little curiosity when you run 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.209
 or walk on any block 

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:18.889
 this is normal here too 

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.990
 I also show this cobb here 

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:23.509
 stone went a certain speed running 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.429
 a higher speed but that when 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.579
 you instead walk on the road blocks 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:31.039
 you will go faster look here normal 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.340
 now we train here beautiful belle taac 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.529
 takes more speed so not only are they 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.139
 aesthetically nicer to see but 

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:41.149
 help a lot in case of escape put 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:44.419
 that we have behind the evil mob 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.429
 behind you run on rob lox casta cloth 

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:49.340
 immediately already thrown on the ground and 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.859
 everything will save them how to build these 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.719
 rob lowe now I'll show you how 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.090
 you can use almost all of them 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.649
 materials with which there are examples 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.899
 you can even do Islam 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.890
 to that I'll show you later how 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.110
 crafting 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.770
 then first all you have to equip yourself with 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.899
 kobe ​​stone that after will be cooked and you will do 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.420
 the story with the stone what you do fairies 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.819
 the stop brics 4 in this case then 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.630
 with the stop breathe fairies of the slides of 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.850
 tom ricks take 4 and make a 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.709
 square in turn will create the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.170
 roadblock this rob lowe pro 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.880
 positioned in the crafting and put a 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.110
 any block that I live in mind 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.200
 I take the couple in this example 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.380
 I put it in the crafting and I will stay on 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:39.140
 co briton roadblock we take it 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:41.600
 we put on the ground look at me from galan mi 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.970
 he made a kobe ​​with red block 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.590
 to make them slab you can also do them 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.840
 slide of the cobol son rob lowe that 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.500
 now I need a bit in the kraft 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.420
 stop 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.130
 i watched take from kobe ​​sun red block e 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.200
 cards like normal slams 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.130
 when you put them on the ground it won't be 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.450
 like the normal clubs you use 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.030
 in fact now I'll show you how one 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:08.810
 normal slam also note the change d 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:12.890
 shadow as well as kraft universe the shadow 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.810
 change see here it goes to the same 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.549
 speed of almost normal blocks 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.299
 written away right at the speed of 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.010
 light we note that even lower than 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.420
 very few facts see if you take to the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:29.600
 line this line is not there in the 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.480
 Slavic side so in a nutshell yes 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.700
 lowers its own nothingness of a 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.489
 cube I don't know how to explain it why not 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.400
 there is a measure on minecraft for this 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.970
 what is not this line above ours 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.700
 slam or the same thing as cubes because if 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.920
 we show with copley cubes 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.630
 son roadblock there is always the small one 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.610
 linetta that lacks that instead already in the 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.940
 normal cubes and therefore there is no here 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.859
 it is a small thing but pv 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.720
 to give an advantage both aesthetically 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.019
 in the construction of villages I mentioned 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.470
 other things that we will then see 11.9 why 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.420
 will apparently be introduced a 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.800
 a very high probability but 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.060
 especially driving this little one 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.980
 speed advantage that I like 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.440
 so go fast on minecraft gives me 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.900
 a nausea going very slow on minecraft 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.609
 so you can't imagine anything 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.000
 this was the fashion of today I hope you 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.010
 I liked these last two ways 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.530
 had to do her a bit so all us burberry 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.180
 because I am traveling now and then 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.340
 from next Thursday we can start 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.860
 some way more substantial with many 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.720
 projects and maybe you recommend me 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.790
 below I recommend nothing much 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.430
 techniques because I am not capable of 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.080
 explaining them is not technical 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.780
 quite capable I'm slowly 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.210
 learning some basic ftv though 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.430
 do not ask mo technical stoppage techniques 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.460
 later there will be a staff because 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.550
 will be chosen on purpose that will review nemo 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.740
 techniques but much later we talk about 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.940
 mid-summer end, though, that by way of 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.430
 today I liked you please 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.930
 comment below by proposing a fad that 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.820
 could be affected next Thursday 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.740
 I recommend you subscribe to the channel and never 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.360
 serious size if you want to sign up too 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.919
 to my channel below in description 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.180
 leave as always many lay people 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.220
 because what is good and right in this 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.580
 period when youtube hurts because 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.050
 videos do not start for obscure reasons 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.210
 data g20 and the stop of minecraft italia 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.720
 I greet you all and thank you 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.720
 we are all
