 commuter lives one every day 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.230
 sort of punishment from Dante's hell in which

 being able to start a long day of 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.809
 about 3 million Italians work 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.559
 that every day they move for work or

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.850
 since 2007 they have increased by 20 percent 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.340
 with the crisis funding cuts

 state and major travel reductions e 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.230
 training different regions and concomitant 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.390
 increase in tickets and season tickets 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.940
 meanwhile the offer on the high ironically

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.100
 percent 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.920
 and to say that the commuter has a dream 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.600
 simple and modest a new comfortable train 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.600

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.690
 timely and convenient fast clean ago 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.040
 his first race in the presence of 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.830
 press authority of the associations 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.390
 of the commuters and of the many curious who is 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.100
 happening 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.590
 we understand that this is not one but 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.330
 12 trains the last of a fleet of 34 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.009
 new trains that the Emilia region 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.660
 romagna has managed to put in 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.450
 arrangement of the local network with a 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.100
 extraordinary investment plan 400 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.840
 million to upgrade and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.850
 improve trains , structures i 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.550
 services which problems must be solved 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.320
 problems of overcrowding problems 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.600
 quality of service 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.000
 problems of better punctuality because 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.250
 obviously newer engines more 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.259
 functional we hope they break us less 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.429
 of those who have 30 and 40 years 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.429
 currently they are still in circulation 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.289
 are trains of the latest generation trains 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.989
 who have access to satin for which it is 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.420
 easily accessible even by 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.180
 disabled people who have toilets e 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.650
 and dedicated spaces that have a high 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.090
 security system are four 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.440
 cameras in every train there is a system 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.320
 of diffusion both audio and video 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.930
 inside are very spacious trains e 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.780
 without architectural barriers another 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.650
 feature is given by the 18 hooks for 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.650
 train for bicycles 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.909
 who every day goes from 23 hours up 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.640
 public transport obviously matters 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.599
 much comfort but also counts therefore 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.580
 resent a situation 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.810
 reliable reliable is obviously of 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.940
 quality 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.319
 this also means betting on 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.840
 possibility of this system of 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.970
 attract new users to conquer 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.440
 also citizens who until now do not 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.870
 have never looked at the ferraro service 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.670
 because they are used to thinking of it as a 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.670
 something old and unreliable 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.950
 their start to the day is not 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.599
 changed they wake up very early and with 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.340
 any time they are there in the usual 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.220
 station with the usual companions ad 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.470
 wait for a train some wait now 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.400
 a nicer train is not a difference 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.500
 recently 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.180
 after all, it is a bit like life more 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.319
 that the departure or destination 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.319
 what matters is the journey
