00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.019
 the whole way I do 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.789
 normally work is a lot 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.750
 static under becomes such a picture quasi 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.750
 constructed 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.870
 and here it is really like that 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.290
 actually in passing motifs 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.290
 captures 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.960
 moment you can lose even if 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.960
 Do not be such a flexible system 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.080
 if I now mean a professional 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.550
 look at photography then that's what 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.620
 I really did a lot here 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.900
 emotional because I'm on every photo 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.890
 show people because the pictures all 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.780
 to have his certain softness 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.940
 that is not here in Sicily 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.990
 not on the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.820
 himself then 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.070
 yes, so that you often in the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.050
 Everyday something out of the corner of our eyes 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.000
 discovered and in the reason so in 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.470
 memory freezes and like that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.120
 you would not have photographed it 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.950
 made 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.710
 the faster his camera is ready for use 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.710
 the closer you are to life 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.479
 the picture quality is tremendous sharpening 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.500
 Uncertainty equivalent 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.460
 really the professional 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.460
 reflex camera 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.270
 What fascinates me is that the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.900
 camera actually two people 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.900
 bring together 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.270
 and that's how it develops 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.270
 personal conversation 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.090
 a part of this personal conversation 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.090
 I'll take the photo home 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.290
 I want more about it in the future 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.950
 think about what I photograph instead 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.950
 as I sell it
