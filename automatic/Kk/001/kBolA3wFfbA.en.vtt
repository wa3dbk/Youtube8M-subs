00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
what else

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.310 
what else
strategy-wise<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.750> really<00:02:16.019> do<00:02:16.200> with

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
strategy-wise you can really do with

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.900 
strategy-wise you can really do with
Sparta<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.830> even<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.310> risky<00:02:17.730> because

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
Sparta and even this is risky because

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.580 
Sparta and even this is risky because
yeah<00:02:18.630> I've<00:02:18.750> got<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.959> ton<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.170> slingers

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
yeah I've got a ton of slingers

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.210 
yeah I've got a ton of slingers
fantastic<00:02:20.370> but<00:02:20.970> they're<00:02:21.540> not<00:02:21.630> very<00:02:21.690> good<00:02:22.220> so

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
fantastic but they're not very good so

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.910 
fantastic but they're not very good so
they're<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.510> helots<00:02:25.170> slingers<00:02:25.620> with<00:02:25.799> only

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
they're just helots slingers with only

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.240 
they're just helots slingers with only
16<00:02:26.430> attack<00:02:26.760> royal<00:02:27.540> spartans<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.010> cost

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
16 attack royal spartans for the cost

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.289 
16 attack royal spartans for the cost
they're<00:02:29.580> really<00:02:29.790> not<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.060> good<00:02:30.269> either

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
they're really not that good either

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.010 
they're really not that good either
because<00:02:30.870> they<00:02:30.989> have<00:02:31.019> the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
because they have the

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.230 
because they have the
so<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.340> probably<00:02:33.640> should<00:02:33.850> have<00:02:33.880> just<00:02:34.060> brought

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
so I probably should have just brought

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.970 
so I probably should have just brought
some<00:02:34.480> standard<00:02:34.960> smart<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.410> hot<00:02:35.560> lights<00:02:35.800> it

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
some standard smart and hot lights it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.200 
some standard smart and hot lights it
would<00:02:36.070> have<00:02:36.160> been<00:02:36.250> more<00:02:36.370> cost-effective<00:02:37.150> but

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
would have been more cost-effective but

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.340 
would have been more cost-effective but
whatever<00:02:37.510> else<00:02:37.720> like<00:02:37.840> I'll<00:02:37.960> bring<00:02:38.110> royal

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
whatever else like I'll bring royal

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.720 
whatever else like I'll bring royal
Spartans<00:02:38.800> because<00:02:38.950> they<00:02:39.070> can<00:02:39.220> support<00:02:39.550> the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
Spartans because they can support the

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.090 
Spartans because they can support the
corral<00:02:40.030> these<00:02:40.390> pikemen<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.710> these<00:02:41.830> are<00:02:41.950> just

corral these pikemen and these are just

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.770 
corral these pikemen and these are just
these<00:02:42.580> are<00:02:42.640> Spartan<00:02:43.120> pikemen<00:02:43.480> not<00:02:43.630> the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
these are Spartan pikemen not the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.750 
these are Spartan pikemen not the
perioikoi<00:02:44.020> pikemen<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:45.310> these<00:02:45.490> are<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.670> little

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
perioikoi pikemen so these are a little

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.250 
perioikoi pikemen so these are a little
better<00:02:46.060> these<00:02:46.270> are<00:02:46.330> kind<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.750> similar<00:02:47.230> in

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
better these are kind of similar in

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.710 
better these are kind of similar in
strength<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:48.010> African<00:02:48.430> pikes<00:02:48.670> but<00:02:49.000> cheaper<00:02:49.390> I

distance thinking that it would happen

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.820

easily<00:02:55.480> but<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.930> ballistas<00:02:56.350> themselves

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
easily but the ballistas themselves

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.560 
easily but the ballistas themselves
actually<00:02:57.160> act<00:02:57.430> as<00:02:57.610> kind<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:58.000> missile<00:02:58.330> shield

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.690 
actually act as kind of a missile shield
because<00:02:59.140> men<00:02:59.470> don't<00:02:59.680> get<00:02:59.890> killed<00:03:00.160> very<00:03:00.250> quick

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700

them<00:03:16.030> headlong<00:03:16.330> into<00:03:16.540> pikes<00:03:16.780> but<00:03:17.050> I'll<00:03:17.170> show

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
them headlong into pikes but I'll show

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.910 
them headlong into pikes but I'll show
you<00:03:17.350> what<00:03:17.530> happens<00:03:17.890> when<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.220> happens<00:03:19.920> yeah

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
you what happens when that happens yeah

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.840 
you what happens when that happens yeah
that's<00:03:21.460> some<00:03:21.850> dead<00:03:22.030> elephants

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
that's some dead elephants

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.610 
that's some dead elephants
and<00:03:23.940> look<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.690> brought<00:03:24.870> up<00:03:25.020> my<00:03:25.110> second<00:03:25.470> line<00:03:25.590> of

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
and look I brought up my second line of

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.260 
and look I brought up my second line of
pike<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.220> if<00:03:26.280> he<00:03:26.370> did<00:03:26.550> pierce<00:03:26.850> through<00:03:27.060> he

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
pike so that if he did pierce through he

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.840 
pike so that if he did pierce through he
gets<00:03:27.420> killed<00:03:27.660> on<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.900> second<00:03:28.290> line<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.760> in

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
gets killed on the second line so in

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.490 
gets killed on the second line so in
case<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.180> were<00:03:30.270> wondering<00:03:30.500> charging

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
case you were wondering charging

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.900 
case you were wondering charging
elephants<00:03:31.860> dead-on<00:03:32.160> into<00:03:32.400> pikes<00:03:32.640> and

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
elephants dead-on into pikes and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.420 
elephants dead-on into pikes and
skirmish<00:03:33.330> fire<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.930> bad<00:03:34.200> idea<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.920> my

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
skirmish fire is a bad idea so my

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.370 
skirmish fire is a bad idea so my
opponent<00:03:35.640> right<00:03:36.180> there<00:03:36.450> alone<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:37.140> lost
