00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
half miles of woods before it opens up

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.580 
half miles of woods before it opens up
at<00:02:22.550> molera<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.210> we're<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.380> now<00:02:24.530> getting

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
at molera and we're just now getting

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.400 
at molera and we're just now getting
ready<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.420> depart<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.540> redwoods<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.260> one

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
ready to depart the redwoods this is one

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.920 
ready to depart the redwoods this is one
of<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.560> last<00:02:27.740> groves<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:29.060> we<00:02:29.180> go<00:02:29.360> through<00:02:29.660> on

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
of the last groves that we go through on

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.500 
of the last groves that we go through on
the<00:02:30.290> course<00:02:30.500> now<00:02:31.310> we're<00:02:31.910> coming<00:02:32.090> out<00:02:32.330> on

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
the course now we're coming out on

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.530 
the course now we're coming out on
molera<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.830> where<00:02:34.070> we<00:02:34.220> open<00:02:34.460> up<00:02:34.790> out

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
molera so this is where we open up out

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.110 
molera so this is where we open up out
of<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.840> redwoods<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.280> when<00:02:38.090> we

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
of the redwoods and this is when we

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.730 
of the redwoods and this is when we
determine<00:02:38.750> whether<00:02:38.900> we're<00:02:39.140> gonna<00:02:39.230> have<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.500> lot

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
determine whether we're gonna have a lot

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.780 
determine whether we're gonna have a lot
of<00:02:39.770> wind<00:02:40.070> or<00:02:40.280> not

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
of wind or not

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.780 
of wind or not
so<00:02:41.750> molera<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.320> at<00:02:42.500> Mile<00:02:42.680> 5<00:02:42.710> come<00:02:43.460> here<00:02:43.640> you've

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
so molera is at Mile 5 come here you've

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.460 
so molera is at Mile 5 come here you've
got<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:43.970> couple<00:02:44.210> more<00:02:44.480> miles<00:02:44.720> until<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.290> road

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
got a couple more miles until the road

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.630 
got a couple more miles until the road
turns<00:02:45.800> north<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.430> heads<00:02:46.700> up<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.300> coast<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:49.310> we

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
turns north and heads up the coast as we

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.010 
turns north and heads up the coast as we
come<00:02:49.820> out<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.150> turn<00:02:50.420> here<00:02:50.720> we're<00:02:50.930> gonna

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
come out of this turn here we're gonna

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.540 
come out of this turn here we're gonna
see<00:02:51.350> this<00:02:52.330> two-mile<00:02:53.590> straight<00:02:54.590> stretch<00:02:55.040> there

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
see this two-mile straight stretch there

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.170 
see this two-mile straight stretch there
it<00:02:55.730> is

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
it is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.600 
it is
so<00:02:56.600> from<00:02:57.200> back<00:02:57.440> behind<00:02:57.710> me<00:02:58.100> here<00:02:58.340> that's

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
so from back behind me here that's

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.850 
so from back behind me here that's
roughly<00:02:58.910> mile<00:02:59.180> six<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.930> we<00:03:00.350> have<00:03:00.380> now<00:03:00.830> a

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
roughly mile six and we have now a

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.190 
roughly mile six and we have now a
two-mile<00:03:01.670> stretch<00:03:02.120> that's<00:03:02.570> absolutely

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
two-mile stretch that's absolutely

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.860 
two-mile stretch that's absolutely
straight<00:03:03.710> this<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.460> a<00:03:04.640> steady<00:03:05.000> climb<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.750> a

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
straight this is a steady climb of a

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.420 
straight this is a steady climb of a
couple<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.290> percent<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:06.800> it's<00:03:06.950> not<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.160> very

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
couple of percent so it's not a very

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.430 
couple of percent so it's not a very
steep<00:03:07.670> grade<00:03:08.000> you're<00:03:08.480> slightly<00:03:08.870> leaning

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
steep grade you're slightly leaning

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.710 
steep grade you're slightly leaning
forward<00:03:09.860> into<00:03:10.040> into<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.730> run<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.420> this<00:03:11.540> is

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
forward into into the run and this is

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.210 
forward into into the run and this is
what<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:11.900> think<00:03:12.170> most<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.650> runners<00:03:13.010> have

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
what I think most of the runners have

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.680 
what I think most of the runners have
some<00:03:13.430> of<00:03:13.550> their<00:03:13.640> fastest<00:03:14.090> miles<00:03:14.360> on<00:03:14.600> the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
some of their fastest miles on the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.320 
some of their fastest miles on the
course<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:15.740> from<00:03:16.010> here<00:03:16.220> also<00:03:16.400> we<00:03:17.000> look<00:03:17.210> up

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
course and so from here also we look up

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.000 
course and so from here also we look up
along<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.930> backside<00:03:18.320> of<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.530> mountain<00:03:18.680> we

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
along the backside of the mountain we

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.760 
along the backside of the mountain we
see<00:03:19.190> pico<00:03:19.489> blanco<00:03:19.940> up<00:03:20.090> above<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:21.530> green

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
see pico blanco up above and the green

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.470 
see pico blanco up above and the green
hillsides<00:03:22.280> along<00:03:22.610> here<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.060> it's<00:03:23.209> just<00:03:23.270> a

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
hillsides along here so it's just a

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.370 
hillsides along here so it's just a
beautiful<00:03:23.780> view<00:03:24.170> as<00:03:24.320> we<00:03:24.470> head<00:03:24.650> up<00:03:24.770> along<00:03:26.380> so

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
beautiful view as we head up along so

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.710 
beautiful view as we head up along so
there's<00:03:27.590> usually<00:03:28.330> cattle<00:03:29.330> that<00:03:29.480> are<00:03:29.600> out<00:03:29.690> on

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
there's usually cattle that are out on

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.110 
there's usually cattle that are out on
the<00:03:29.900> field<00:03:30.020> over<00:03:30.590> here<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.790> guess<00:03:32.000> you

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
the field over here and I guess you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.080 
the field over here and I guess you
could<00:03:32.330> call<00:03:32.480> them<00:03:32.660> spectators<00:03:33.850> but<00:03:34.850> that's

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
could call them spectators but that's

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.810 
could call them spectators but that's
about<00:03:35.360> it<00:03:35.600> on<00:03:35.810> years<00:03:36.380> when<00:03:37.040> we<00:03:37.250> have<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.430> lot<00:03:37.700> of

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
about it on years when we have a lot of

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.420 
about it on years when we have a lot of
wind<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.660> turns<00:03:38.989> out<00:03:39.230> that<00:03:39.440> this<00:03:39.620> highway<00:03:40.160> is

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
wind it turns out that this highway is

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.410 
wind it turns out that this highway is
aimed<00:03:40.850> directly<00:03:41.420> into<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.500> wind<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:43.580> you're

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
aimed directly into the wind so you're

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.600 
aimed directly into the wind so you're
running<00:03:44.890> right<00:03:45.890> into<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.880> teeth<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.450> wind

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
running right into the teeth of the wind

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.920 
running right into the teeth of the wind
at<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.760> end<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.060> straightaway<00:03:51.360> you're

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
at the end of the straightaway you're
