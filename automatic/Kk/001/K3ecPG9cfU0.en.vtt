00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.260 
people leave the game with fourth tier
killstreaks<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.220> that's<00:03:07.340> why<00:03:07.460> I<00:03:07.520> have<00:03:08.030> like<00:03:08.240> a

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
killstreaks and that's why I have like a

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.940 
killstreaks and that's why I have like a
