00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
or normal like absolutely that's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.040

same free workout every single freaking

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.609 
same free workout every single freaking
day<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.509> hardly<00:02:09.750> ever<00:02:09.840> drink<00:02:10.110> coffee<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
day but hardly ever drink coffee and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.110 
day but hardly ever drink coffee and
then<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.890> drink<00:02:11.039> coffee<00:02:11.190> instead<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.940> feel

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
then you drink coffee instead I feel

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.059 
then you drink coffee instead I feel
like<00:02:12.239> there's<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:13.500> again<00:02:13.709> I'm<00:02:13.800> like<00:02:13.920> I'm<00:02:14.040> not

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
like there's and again I'm like I'm not

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.559 
like there's and again I'm like I'm not
an<00:02:14.250> expert<00:02:14.459> but<00:02:14.610> there's<00:02:14.910> different<00:02:15.209> types<00:02:15.239> of

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
an expert but there's different types of

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.990 
an expert but there's different types of
caffeine<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:16.260> your<00:02:16.410> body<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:17.069> attenuated

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
caffeine and if your body is attenuated

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.900 
caffeine and if your body is attenuated
to<00:02:18.300> certain<00:02:18.690> thing<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.050> then<00:02:19.200> he<00:02:19.290> picks<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.709> up

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
to certain thing and then he picks it up

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.010 
to certain thing and then he picks it up
yeah<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.940> would<00:02:21.150> think<00:02:21.239> you'd<00:02:21.420> be<00:02:21.510> responsive

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
yeah I would think you'd be responsive

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.479 
yeah I would think you'd be responsive
and<00:02:22.140> ultimately<00:02:22.560> you're<00:02:22.800> just<00:02:22.980> responding<00:02:23.129> to

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
and ultimately you're just responding to

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.720 
and ultimately you're just responding to
the<00:02:23.730> stimuli

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
the stimuli

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.580 
the stimuli
in<00:02:25.269> those<00:02:25.540> anyways<00:02:26.080> which<00:02:26.230> should<00:02:26.379> be<00:02:26.470> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
in those anyways which should be the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.800 
in those anyways which should be the
caffeine<00:02:26.980> it's<00:02:27.159> not<00:02:27.310> like<00:02:27.690> because<00:02:28.690> your

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
caffeine it's not like because your

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.240 
caffeine it's not like because your
pre-workout<00:02:29.019> has<00:02:29.470> creatine<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.040> feel

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
pre-workout has creatine you feel

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.949 
pre-workout has creatine you feel
awesome<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.909> wouldn't<00:02:31.150> feel<00:02:31.299> any<00:02:31.540> different

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
awesome you wouldn't feel any different

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.110 
awesome you wouldn't feel any different
you're<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.129> responding<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.700> caffeine

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
you're just responding to the caffeine

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.020 
you're just responding to the caffeine
and<00:02:34.830> therefore<00:02:35.830> different<00:02:36.220> caffeine's<00:02:36.760> or

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
and therefore different caffeine's or

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.119 
and therefore different caffeine's or
for<00:02:37.510> example<00:02:37.569> like<00:02:38.019> Mikey<00:02:38.440> workout<00:02:38.739> only<00:02:38.980> has

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
for example like Mikey workout only has

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.490 
for example like Mikey workout only has
100<00:02:39.549> milligrams<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.330> caffeine<00:02:40.510> but<00:02:41.319> if<00:02:41.410> I

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
100 milligrams of caffeine but if I

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.979 
100 milligrams of caffeine but if I
drink<00:02:41.680> coffee<00:02:41.950> which<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.730> normal<00:02:43.450> cup<00:02:43.629> has<00:02:43.810> like

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
drink coffee which a normal cup has like

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.990 
drink coffee which a normal cup has like
200<00:02:44.500> well<00:02:44.920> yeah<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.190> feel<00:02:45.549> way<00:02:45.670> more<00:02:45.700> attractive

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
I know that's not a really legit answer

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.720 
I know that's not a really legit answer
