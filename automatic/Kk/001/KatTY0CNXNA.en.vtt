00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.590 
boy I honestly think it would be
difficult<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:51.070> be<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.520> worse<00:01:51.880> showing<00:01:52.330> than

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
difficult to be a worse showing than

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.420

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
high expectations and thought were

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.470
