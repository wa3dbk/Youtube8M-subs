little hands on his pose there anyway as

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.610 
little hands on his pose there anyway as
I<00:04:17.660> was<00:04:17.690> saying<00:04:17.780> story<00:04:18.139> if<00:04:18.200> this<00:04:18.350> really<00:04:18.470> does

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
I was saying story if this really does

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.500 
I was saying story if this really does
not<00:04:18.739> match<00:04:18.889> up<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.250> my<00:04:19.850> grotesque<00:04:20.359> stereotype

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
not match up to my grotesque stereotype

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.909 
not match up to my grotesque stereotype
I<00:04:20.959> mean<00:04:21.079> that's<00:04:21.169> obviously<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.530> stereotype<00:04:21.889> of

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
I mean that's obviously a stereotype of

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.320 
I mean that's obviously a stereotype of
a<00:04:22.160> good<00:04:22.370> story<00:04:22.520> think<00:04:22.729> it's<00:04:22.820> not<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.120> simple

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
a good story think it's not that simple

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.270 
a good story think it's not that simple
but<00:04:23.870> there<00:04:24.590> is<00:04:24.620> I<00:04:24.800> think<00:04:24.830> there<00:04:25.040> is<00:04:25.070> an<00:04:25.190> element

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
but there is I think there is an element

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.100 
but there is I think there is an element
of<00:04:25.550> truth<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.120> there's<00:04:26.510> no<00:04:26.630> real<00:04:26.870> sense

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
of truth to it and there's no real sense

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.450 
of truth to it and there's no real sense
in<00:04:27.290> which<00:04:27.380> you're<00:04:27.590> drawn<00:04:27.979> into<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.220> story

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
in which you're drawn into the story

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.890 
in which you're drawn into the story
either<00:04:28.610> because<00:04:28.940> none<00:04:29.090> of<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.300> people<00:04:29.660> in<00:04:29.780> it

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
either because none of the people in it

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.640

if by different she means blocky and

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.960 
if by different she means blocky and
boring<00:07:11.930> than<00:07:12.110> I<00:07:12.200> agree<00:07:12.610> let's<00:07:13.610> pick<00:07:13.790> our

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:13.970 
boring than I agree let's pick our

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.460 
boring than I agree let's pick our
exciting<00:07:14.510> Atlantean<00:07:14.840> architecture<00:07:15.290> what

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
exciting Atlantean architecture what

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.690 
exciting Atlantean architecture what
we're<00:07:15.620> going<00:07:15.740> to<00:07:15.860> choose<00:07:16.130> is<00:07:16.370> something<00:07:16.670> very

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:16.700 
we're going to choose is something very

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.870 
we're going to choose is something very
monolithic<00:07:17.630> and<00:07:17.840> blocky<00:07:18.700> really<00:07:19.700> not<00:07:19.850> very

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 
monolithic and blocky really not very

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.430 
monolithic and blocky really not very
exciting<00:07:20.270> stick<00:07:20.660> it<00:07:20.750> all<00:07:20.810> underground<00:07:21.230> so

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
exciting stick it all underground so

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.080 
exciting stick it all underground so
there's<00:07:21.590> no<00:07:21.650> interesting<00:07:22.040> lighting<00:07:22.430> well

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.090 
there's no interesting lighting well

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.460 
there's no interesting lighting well
actually<00:07:23.210> fences<00:07:23.750> this<00:07:23.990> is<00:07:24.080> it<00:07:24.170> quite<00:07:24.320> liquid

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470 
actually fences this is it quite liquid

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.370 
actually fences this is it quite liquid
nicely<00:07:24.920> lit<00:07:25.070> area<00:07:25.780> and<00:07:26.780> generally<00:07:27.110> make<00:07:27.260> it

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380 
nicely lit area and generally make it

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.610 
nicely lit area and generally make it
look<00:07:27.560> really<00:07:27.800> monochrome<00:07:28.790> and<00:07:28.970> dull<00:07:29.620> yeah

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620 
look really monochrome and dull yeah

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.860 
look really monochrome and dull yeah
that's<00:07:31.550> terrible<00:07:31.940> if<00:07:32.060> anyone<00:07:32.270> who<00:07:32.390> if<00:07:32.630> anyone

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:32.870 
that's terrible if anyone who if anyone

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.850 
that's terrible if anyone who if anyone
from<00:07:33.110> cristatus<00:07:33.380> over<00:07:33.560> to<00:07:33.650> which<00:07:33.770> they

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860 
from cristatus over to which they

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.230 
from cristatus over to which they
probably<00:07:34.010> complaining<00:07:34.670> bit<00:07:34.880> about<00:07:35.090> res

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 
probably complaining bit about res

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.000 
probably complaining bit about res
indigenous<00:07:35.600> but<00:07:35.930> I<00:07:36.020> really<00:07:36.200> do<00:07:36.320> think<00:07:36.500> it's<00:07:36.950> a

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.010 
indigenous but I really do think it's a

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.770 
indigenous but I really do think it's a
bit<00:07:37.130> of<00:07:37.190> a<00:07:37.250> mistake<00:07:37.550> in<00:07:38.120> comparison<00:07:38.630> with<00:07:38.660> a

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:38.780 
bit of a mistake in comparison with a

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.670 
bit of a mistake in comparison with a
beauty<00:07:39.080> of<00:07:39.200> some<00:07:39.320> of<00:07:39.380> the<00:07:39.440> outside

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 
beauty of some of the outside

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.410 
beauty of some of the outside
environment<00:07:39.800> because<00:07:40.640> the<00:07:41.000> basic<00:07:41.300> difference

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:41.420 
environment because the basic difference

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.360 
environment because the basic difference
is<00:07:41.660> one<00:07:41.900> of<00:07:41.990> times<00:07:42.110> a<00:07:42.200> creativity<00:07:42.530> is<00:07:42.890> that

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.370 
is one of times a creativity is that

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.960 
is one of times a creativity is that
we're<00:07:43.520> not<00:07:43.610> trying<00:07:43.760> to<00:07:43.910> make<00:07:44.060> something<00:07:44.270> up

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:45.970 
we're not trying to make something up

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.300 
we're not trying to make something up
you<00:07:46.970> inherently<00:07:48.100> people<00:07:49.100> work<00:07:49.280> for

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:49.310 
you inherently people work for

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.560 
you inherently people work for
generalities<00:07:49.940> and<00:07:49.970> what<00:07:50.150> I<00:07:50.180> mean<00:07:50.300> by<00:07:50.360> that<00:07:50.450> is

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.570 
generalities and what I mean by that is

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.390 
generalities and what I mean by that is
if<00:07:51.200> you're<00:07:51.380> if<00:07:51.680> someone<00:07:51.980> says<00:07:52.100> make<00:07:52.250> up<00:07:52.370> a

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 
if you're if someone says make up a

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.180 
if you're if someone says make up a
story<00:07:52.610> about<00:07:52.730> a<00:07:52.850> person
