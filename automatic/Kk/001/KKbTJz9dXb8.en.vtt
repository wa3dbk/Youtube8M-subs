 The quietest machine I have ever seen

 have 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.280
 heard 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:21.459
 the apple stay cut off 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:25.360
 and that's left open 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.360
 now we have to turn that around 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:38.170
 and take a pencil or a 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:42.790
 brush to help everything ready the corners 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.440
 nice out those are the opening to 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.069
 it does not really take or fall 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.069
 to be sewn 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:08.790
 You can iron it now or you have to 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:08.790

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.819
 the cock 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:48.489

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:48.489
 where exactly the middle is back from here 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:04:21.500
 so halves third and far away so 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:22.240
 About the middle and that was the 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.830
 center 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.190

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:55.560
 I brought such a beautiful so nice 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.120
 green leaves kipketer maybe can 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.270
 but you can do it upstairs if you can 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.410
 stir that up 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:08.910
 then it looks a bit more 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:14.340
 after Munich In any case, the 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:15.870
 the basic steps all of us 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.820
 have it now or I just have it now 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:21.240
 a very slow da sonja 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.890
 afterwards all five offer dranhängen of 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.640
 just made a knot down 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:28.290
 Threaded a piece a green piece 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.790
 dark over it and a pearl 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.400
 now I will measure myself here 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:35.090
 about ten centimeters a knot 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.320
 make and then comes the next one 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.340
 and so on and then I'll show you 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.340

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:50.160
 Here again depends ours 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:52.130

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:57.270
 quietly have courage to have colorful fabrics 

00:07:54.630 --> 00:08:00.000
 and these leaves if you 

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:02.880
 So either completely omit looks too 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.460
 without good or just straight 

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:09.350
