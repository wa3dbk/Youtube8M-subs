00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.720 
anticipating that I had finished my kill
and<00:04:34.350> then<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.470> was<00:04:35.800> trying<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.190> pick<00:04:36.310> up<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.580> gun

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
and then I was trying to pick up the gun

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:43.710 
and then I was trying to pick up the gun
from<00:04:37.090> home<00:04:37.240> immediately<00:04:37.540> after<00:04:41.910> ah<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.510> was

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
from home immediately after ah I was

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.000 
from home immediately after ah I was
just<00:04:43.750> in<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.080> in<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.320> process<00:04:44.800> of<00:04:44.890> picking

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
just in the in the process of picking

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:52.850 
just in the in the process of picking
that<00:04:45.250> gun<00:04:45.430> up<00:04:46.020> check<00:04:47.020> my<00:04:47.140> corner

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.779 

damn<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:54.379> just<00:04:55.379> I<00:04:55.530> never<00:04:55.650> have<00:04:55.979> that<00:04:56.099> my<00:04:56.310> chance

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
I never have enough of a chance to pick

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.369 
I never have enough of a chance to pick
up<00:04:59.009> that<00:04:59.039> sniper<00:04:59.819> rifle<00:05:00.210> or<00:05:00.300> any<00:05:00.539> gun<00:05:00.840> really<00:05:01.199> i

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
I'm dead and i think it just has to do

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.300 
I'm dead and i think it just has to do
with<00:05:36.539> the<00:05:36.599> fact<00:05:36.779> that<00:05:36.930> i'm<00:05:37.169> i'm<00:05:37.710> right<00:05:38.189> up

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
with the fact that i'm i'm right up

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.159 
with the fact that i'm i'm right up
close<00:05:38.460> Russian<00:05:39.240> flu<00:05:39.389> and<00:05:39.629> getting<00:05:39.840> some<00:05:39.990> lag

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
close Russian flu and getting some lag

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.860 
close Russian flu and getting some lag
spikes<00:05:41.509> every<00:05:42.509> single<00:05:42.840> time<00:05:43.020> I<00:05:43.229> get<00:05:43.529> a<00:05:43.560> kill

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
spikes every single time I get a kill

00:05:44.870 --> 00:06:00.379 
spikes every single time I get a kill
every<00:05:45.870> single<00:05:45.900> time<00:05:46.500> I<00:05:58.879> had<00:05:59.879> to<00:05:59.909> try<00:06:00.150> for<00:06:00.210> that

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
every single time I had to try for that

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:01.730 
every single time I had to try for that
no<00:06:00.539> scope<00:06:00.779> there<00:06:00.900> was<00:06:01.020> no<00:06:01.080> time<00:06:01.229> to<00:06:01.289> quickscope

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
no scope there was no time to quickscope

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.350 
no scope there was no time to quickscope
and<00:06:01.979> with<00:06:02.129> my<00:06:02.250> sensitivity<00:06:02.699> I<00:06:02.909> wouldn't<00:06:03.270> have

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
and with my sensitivity I wouldn't have

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.999 
and with my sensitivity I wouldn't have
been<00:06:03.479> able<00:06:03.599> to<00:06:03.750> keep<00:06:03.900> my<00:06:04.050> shots<00:06:04.319> on<00:06:04.500> with<00:06:04.979> a

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
been able to keep my shots on with a

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.680 
been able to keep my shots on with a
quick<00:06:05.219> scope<00:06:06.800> what<00:06:07.800> how<00:06:08.759> did<00:06:08.819> that<00:06:09.120> combat<00:06:09.509> axe

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
quick scope what how did that combat axe

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:18.870 
quick scope what how did that combat axe
not<00:06:09.990> hit<00:06:10.199> him<00:06:10.339> that<00:06:11.339> is<00:06:11.520> ridiculous

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.940 

oh<00:06:19.800> no<00:06:20.800> it's<00:06:21.730> too<00:06:21.820> many<00:06:22.000> spawns<00:06:22.270> around<00:06:22.600> there

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
oh no it's too many spawns around there

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.860 
oh no it's too many spawns around there
too<00:06:23.950> easy<00:06:24.130> to<00:06:24.280> get<00:06:24.370> overwhelmed<00:06:24.940> I<00:06:25.150> don't

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
too easy to get overwhelmed I don't

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.790 
too easy to get overwhelmed I don't
think<00:06:26.020> we're<00:06:26.110> going<00:06:26.200> to<00:06:26.290> be<00:06:26.380> able<00:06:26.440> to<00:06:26.590> do<00:06:26.680> it

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
think we're going to be able to do it

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.240 
think we're going to be able to do it
here<00:06:26.920> guys<00:06:27.450> we'll<00:06:28.450> do<00:06:28.570> our<00:06:28.600> best<00:06:28.720> still<00:06:32.250> yeah

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
here guys we'll do our best still yeah

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.570 
here guys we'll do our best still yeah
didn't<00:06:33.760> quite<00:06:33.910> do<00:06:34.090> it<00:06:34.120> but<00:06:34.480> 21<00:06:35.200> and<00:06:35.440> 21<00:06:35.860> not<00:06:36.460> a

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
didn't quite do it but 21 and 21 not a

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.220 
didn't quite do it but 21 and 21 not a
very<00:06:36.790> good<00:06:36.880> game<00:06:37.150> either<00:06:37.360> but<00:06:37.690> considering

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
very good game either but considering

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.350 
very good game either but considering
what<00:06:38.260> I<00:06:38.440> was<00:06:38.680> trying<00:06:38.950> to<00:06:39.070> do<00:06:39.250> it's<00:06:40.060> very

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
what I was trying to do it's very

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.350 
what I was trying to do it's very
challenging<00:06:40.710> hopefully<00:06:41.710> well<00:06:42.160> I<00:06:42.490> really<00:06:43.210> hope

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
challenging hopefully well I really hope

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.640 
challenging hopefully well I really hope
we<00:06:43.390> get<00:06:43.540> a<00:06:43.600> different<00:06:43.930> map<00:06:44.050> next<00:06:44.350> time<00:06:44.470> I<00:06:44.500> know

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
we get a different map next time I know

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.710 
we get a different map next time I know
we<00:06:44.860> will<00:06:44.890> because<00:06:45.790> it<00:06:45.910> won't<00:06:46.060> let<00:06:46.180> us<00:06:46.330> vote<00:06:46.450> for

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
we will because it won't let us vote for

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.420 
we will because it won't let us vote for
it<00:06:46.810> again<00:06:46.900> for<00:06:47.290> the<00:06:47.380> third<00:06:47.410> time<00:06:47.590> in<00:06:47.830> a<00:06:48.010> row<00:06:48.040> but

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
it again for the third time in a row but

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.190 
it again for the third time in a row but
hopefully<00:06:49.270> we'll<00:06:49.420> get<00:06:49.540> something<00:06:49.810> that's<00:06:50.080> a

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
hopefully we'll get something that's a

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.480 
hopefully we'll get something that's a
little<00:06:50.320> bit<00:06:50.440> easier<00:06:50.620> to<00:06:50.830> play<00:06:51.040> and<00:06:51.280> I<00:06:51.340> have<00:06:51.460> a

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
little bit easier to play and I have a

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.950 
little bit easier to play and I have a
little<00:06:51.670> bit<00:06:51.880> more<00:06:52.000> room<00:06:52.210> to<00:06:52.390> breathe<00:06:52.660> and

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
little bit more room to breathe and

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.840 
little bit more room to breathe and
actually<00:06:53.230> pick<00:06:53.380> up<00:06:53.530> a<00:06:53.620> gun<00:06:53.770> and<00:06:53.830> stay<00:06:54.580> alive

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
actually pick up a gun and stay alive

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.580 
actually pick up a gun and stay alive
with<00:06:55.090> it<00:06:55.180> for<00:06:55.300> a<00:06:55.360> little<00:06:55.420> while<00:06:55.540> and<00:06:55.840> get<00:06:56.380> some
