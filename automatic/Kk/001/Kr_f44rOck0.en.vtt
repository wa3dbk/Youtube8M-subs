00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.220
 it is ours 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.440
 evacuated 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.920
 the recruits I gave the command myself 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.550
 what did you tell him? 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.510
 the goal up 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170
 we do not need to know how it works 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.100
 That's right, I succeeded 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 the first one in the city is no different for me that does not really matter 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.680
 if he really wants to make a request 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 different 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.299
 heated 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.240
 has through 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.569
 destroyed the city 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.169
 maybe ninth in the end 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.829
 to sort the only meaningful device 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.849
 we are scared 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.559
 not available 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.559
 the rules a little bit 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.779
 Deus Ex Invisible pipe enters a heavy legacy 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:25.049
 the expectations of the fans of the first part are high 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.469
 Good game is much more than a simple ego-shooter 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.969
 we can solve conflicts in not only with the weapon in hand 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.619
 diplomatic talks lead to the 10th as well 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:36.710
 is regrettable 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.550
 that we do not have a German version at the time of the video submission 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:46.519
 just for the translations of logic Iverson had huge 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:47.529
 Effort operated 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.529
 Place around her in our test 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.429
 Problems with Delo 6 2 are not necessarily caused by Thie's green 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:07.299
 to discuss 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.189
 who solid arguments 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.469
 like a sniper rifle preferred 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.029
 sometimes country can fight through the levels 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.439
 and succeed as a one-man army 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:20.059
 but as from the deepest valley, there are far more possibilities 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.080
 they can, for example, sneak past guards and thus 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.130
 to avoid any contact with the enemy or they cracked Schiesser all the more 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.130
 to penetrate restricted areas 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.930
 just as they imagine as laid 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.499
 June will be hectic 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:49.279
 Turrets allowed to be programmed to interrupt robots even under their own 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.879
 Be brought control 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.019
 surveillance cameras also have nothing to oppose to a hacker attack 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.889
 Basis for the different approaches Gilgen so-called 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.029
 bio-market 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:05.689
 depending on which implants they use, they improve certain 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:07.710
 properties 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.430
 it is possible 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.719
 Sport to move life energy 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:14.699
 and even by Randy 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.379
 and if they do not want to get their hands dirty 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:21.379
 they just jump animals on 8 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.339
 but not only the problem of filling the resignation lies in their hands 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:31.339
 they also decide who they support 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.979
 In Deus Ex Invisible board, there are no set friends and enemies 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.180
 depending on which of the many parties they are doing assignments and 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.150
 depending on the many small decisions playing moves 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.189
 the sympathies of the groups remained 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:52.369
 it is therefore dominating which course the story with 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:59.059
 The US at Dusseldorf Mohr is a worthy successor to a great 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.150
 game 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.889
 despite some changes 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.309
 the adventure reaches almost the same playful depth 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:09.569
 However, the game time is much shorter and has some cases 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.020
 maybe expect too much 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.629
 thanks to an exciting backstory and credible 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.050
 Characters SID captivate one of these titles 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.110
 the great freedom of action does the rest and gives the player that 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.339
 Feeling to have full control over the course of things at all times 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:31.309
 in combination with the complex localization, this results in one 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:34.309
 Treats for pc games 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:41.599
 - 6 we are demonstrating ourselves wor especially with its elaborate light and 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:45.459
 Shadow effects on which graphics performance a modern computer 

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:46.360
 Amstetten 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.840
 but the rather edgy of the picture require but at the highest level of detail 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.599
 after a 3 gigahertz calculator and at least one radio 9700 program 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:02.300
 known in the left possible details the Indians 6 2 especially the divisions 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.229
 the image structure and is noticeably more fluid otherwise XanGo few 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.539
 Changes are recognizable nevertheless, here too at least 1 2 gigahertz 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:14.300
 bind for the full fun
