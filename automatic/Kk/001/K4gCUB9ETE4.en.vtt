00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.670
 Rodriguez moral adeba I will also do 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.310
 a demonstration of how it is placed in a 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.800
 that these lashes for you had to these 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.829
 deeper looks where you take 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.960

 following to get place these 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.640
 eyelashes that is a very lemony area the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.210
 curious because each eyelash is placed 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.890
 a buna how it works well is good 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.480
 a treatment that lasts approximately 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.719
 one hour and a half 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.730
 they will become internal perfect at that time and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.850
 half what we do is place a hair 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.379
 synthetic on a natural eyelash 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.270

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600
 the experts 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.340
 and better than us on other issues in 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.380
 the program we can see the evolution of 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.530
 how are all these 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.030
 eyelashes that dash as a company the 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.890
 look at the moment we could 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.200
 lashes longer than given that 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.320
 all doors the issues are already the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.970
 lashes of the xxix of the condition of 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.730
 the company 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.840
 what is uan explain is a mica the 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.539
 look with my cries 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.030
 good to see the look if it's good as 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.070

 when placing the extensions what 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.560
 we do is 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.750
 give more joy to return an image and if 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.910
 well a mica with worked that 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.580
 place now let's place this 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.910
 patch that has collagen and is 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.680
 firming up what helps good if 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.750
 We have dark circles 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.250

 the eyes the harder the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:30.720
 eyelashes in charge of looking at me laura 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:35.879
 the extensions last about 4 or 5 weeks 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.260
 and it is a very expensive that tractament 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.599
 It was always considered a treatment 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.579
 of luxury but good what we try with 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.859
 look at me is to make good all 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.750

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.079
 we have below yes 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.510
 and to continue protecting better their 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.489
 natural lashes of eyelashes that 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.340
 will place these extensions that are 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.129
 zetas 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.069
 They are synthetic hair and there are also 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:15.400
 good mink and there are natural hair 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.730
 but the effect is always better with the 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.360
 Synthetic hair extensions and the gent 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.360
 what do you have 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.850
 people want a more more effect 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.860
 spectacular of the topics that form the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.630
 particular that are lamination of

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.890
 unique from just yours 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.460
 we use an adhesive that is 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.250
 hypoallergenic 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.960
 special to place the extensions in 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.880
 the case of laura the hour has some which 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.110
 men degrees then what are we going to do 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.810
 is to accentuate the shape of your eye back 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.370
 here we have different models and stop 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.790
 for clear insults there are different 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.890
 long sizes thicknesses curvatures its 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.210
 command stores in which they jump and 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.610
 fine cures also from the hardest 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.470
 hygienic today 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.400
 here they are already go a first 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.380
 extension is used to make a 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.709
 natural style that is what we are going to 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.430
 do with laura let's use three 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.509
 different measures 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.680
 come back because three different modules 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:28.810
 different vegetables depending on the 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.870
 area of the lyon so that the clear tab 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.449
 cutting at the ends at the end 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:40.090
 internal colors more tradition is 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:42.940
 clear smaller annoying does not bother 90 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.990
 minutes do not return if we can we can 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.880
 start some there and so we 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.620
 We will go to other issues of the program and 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.600
 has to be in quietly because I know 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.130
 which is an area that lacks 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.289
 concentration on the part of the person 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.080
 that is 100 also on the part of the 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.120
 person to whom they went and insured 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.710
 also work in a quiet 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.180
 Julian name of now with works that 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.950
 this first memory have been removed 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.500
 tabs 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.960
 clear as for example we look for a 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.849
 tab if we want to place the extension 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.440
 yes 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.230
 and now there is each zone 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.870
 if she needs them to make us 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.770
 invoices to others a unique hooks 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.770
 that this black tail 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.790
 and now I do not know I just have difficulty 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.790
 dinner not 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.510
 we went out and there we would have a return 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.850
 we have an engineering to follow and 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.410
 really costs one stands out on the 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.920
 high because it is very necessary 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.810
 months in a way let's say palmones 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.560
 get contributions of the pulsed mascara this 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.030
 people tab remember our 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.000
 viewers that to the page of the 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.310
 program the result now will not be 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.140
 So nervous of Cali I stretch the bag 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.920
 you can never rest more quietly 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.480
 work in that period the direct 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.720
 harder than in portland other 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.420
 questions how this technique works 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.520
 the extension of the eyelashes and I 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.920
 we asked if you kept 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.100
 pesetas and there are many people who keep 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.110
 pots every month are also more than 100 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.400
 million pesetas going to get the 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.770
 pesetas from home meals that do not go

 change since 2002 they are 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.100
 euros work where that is what is 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.990
 happening and then even carles 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.790
 turret of an entity that you're 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.500
 pesetas if they love and a house that 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.790
