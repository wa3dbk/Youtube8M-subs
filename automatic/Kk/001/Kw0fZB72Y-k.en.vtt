fantastic quarry is a substance that

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.179 
fantastic quarry is a substance that
what<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.140> breaks<00:00:19.380> down<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.800> produces

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
what it breaks down it produces

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.859 
what it breaks down it produces
potassium<00:00:20.730> chloride<00:00:21.000> which<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.359> very<00:00:21.660> similar

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
potassium chloride which is very similar

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.070 
potassium chloride which is very similar
to<00:00:22.020> table<00:00:22.380> salt<00:00:22.590> plus<00:00:23.250> lots<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.760> oxygen<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
to table salt plus lots of oxygen and

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140 
to table salt plus lots of oxygen and
when<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.439> put<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.769> with<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:26.039> organic<00:00:26.369> material

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
when you put it with an organic material

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.439 
when you put it with an organic material
like<00:00:27.180> sugar<00:00:28.050> or<00:00:28.349> protein<00:00:29.189> or<00:00:29.429> leather<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:30.060> wood

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
like sugar or protein or leather or wood

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.269 
like sugar or protein or leather or wood
or<00:00:30.480> sometimes<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.560> reacts<00:00:31.920> pretty

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
or sometimes that it reacts pretty

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.850 
or sometimes that it reacts pretty
excited<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.290> we're<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.649> going<00:00:34.770> to

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
these what we look at is is how that

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.240 
these what we look at is is how that
energy<00:01:06.090> comes<00:01:06.540> out<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.990> small<00:01:07.380> steps<00:01:07.680> right<00:01:08.040> if

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
energy comes out in small steps right if

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.130 
energy comes out in small steps right if
you<00:01:08.430> look<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.700> kreb<00:01:08.940> cycle<00:01:08.970> or<00:01:09.450> quad<00:01:09.630> pollicis

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
you look at kreb cycle or quad pollicis

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.690 
you look at kreb cycle or quad pollicis
and<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.380> those<00:01:10.500> things<00:01:10.710> along<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.280> to

what's this white stuff do you think
here<00:04:17.860> at<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.040> top<00:04:19.350> potassium<00:04:20.350> chloride

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
here at the top potassium chloride

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.800 
here at the top potassium chloride
absolutely<00:04:21.519> so<00:04:21.820> this<00:04:22.030> is<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.420> stuff<00:04:22.660> that's

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
absolutely so this is the stuff that's

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.180 
absolutely so this is the stuff that's
kind<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.140> similar<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.470> table<00:04:23.830> salt<00:04:23.950> and

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
kind of similar to table salt and

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.280 
kind of similar to table salt and
reactive<00:04:24.640> kind<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.060> got<00:04:25.300> enough<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.840> here<00:04:26.020> I

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
reactive kind of got enough to here I

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.560 
reactive kind of got enough to here I
don't<00:04:27.040> know<00:04:27.160> if<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.370> turned<00:04:27.730> if<00:04:28.000> it's<00:04:28.180> sublimes

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
don't know if it turned if it's sublimes

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.540 
don't know if it turned if it's sublimes
or<00:04:28.810> how<00:04:28.930> it<00:04:29.020> goes<00:04:29.170> exactly<00:04:29.380> all<00:04:30.280> right<00:04:30.370> let's

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
or how it goes exactly all right let's

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.900 
or how it goes exactly all right let's
do<00:04:31.420> another<00:04:31.450> one<00:04:31.870> here<00:04:32.400> just<00:04:33.400> in<00:04:33.520> case<00:04:33.550> it's

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.460 

I'd<00:04:54.000> say<00:04:54.360> we<00:04:54.600> had<00:04:54.690> trouble<00:04:54.990> with<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.169> before

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
I'd say we had trouble with it before

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:15.090 
I'd say we had trouble with it before
it's<00:04:55.620> resisting<00:04:57.889> straight

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.980 

any<00:05:15.670> questions<00:05:16.120> when<00:05:16.270> we're<00:05:16.420> waiting<00:05:16.660> for<00:05:16.720> the

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
any questions when we're waiting for the

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.270 
any questions when we're waiting for the
milk

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:27.820 

okay

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:38.530 

it's<00:05:28.580> heating<00:05:28.849> it<00:05:28.909> to<00:05:28.940> the<00:05:29.120> melting<00:05:29.449> point

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.410 

it's<00:05:39.370> well<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.400> guess<00:05:40.610> it's<00:05:40.790> closed<00:05:41.030> now<00:05:41.060> it's

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
it's well I guess it's closed now it's

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.200 
it's well I guess it's closed now it's
that<00:05:41.510> black<00:05:41.860> over<00:05:42.860> there<00:05:43.010> that<00:05:43.700> has<00:05:43.730> all<00:05:44.030> that

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
that black over there that has all that

00:05:44.210 --> 00:06:07.860 
that black over there that has all that
kind<00:05:44.450> of<00:05:44.480> stuff<00:05:44.690> in<00:05:44.840> it<00:05:45.430> all<00:05:46.430> right

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.780 

the<00:06:08.870> shirt<00:06:11.980> notice<00:06:12.980> all<00:06:13.130> the<00:06:13.250> sit<00:06:13.460> down<00:06:13.640> in

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
the shirt notice all the sit down in

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.370 
the shirt notice all the sit down in
here<00:06:13.970> there<00:06:14.150> wasn't<00:06:14.420> enough<00:06:14.600> oxidants

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
here there wasn't enough oxidants

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.270 
here there wasn't enough oxidants
hopefully<00:06:15.650> finish<00:06:15.890> the<00:06:16.100> reaction<00:06:16.580> but<00:06:16.780> it

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
hopefully finish the reaction but it

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.709 
hopefully finish the reaction but it
look<00:06:19.280> at<00:06:19.370> all<00:06:19.460> that<00:06:19.640> pretty<00:06:19.910> pink<00:06:20.780> in<00:06:20.990> there

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.719 

certainly<00:06:25.439> because<00:06:25.709> this<00:06:25.860> is<00:06:26.129> wings<00:06:26.429> with<00:06:26.580> a

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
certainly because this is wings with a

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.189 
certainly because this is wings with a
complete<00:06:27.059> headed<00:06:27.299> in<00:06:27.419> little<00:06:27.659> pieces<00:06:27.809> and<00:06:28.019> my

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
complete headed in little pieces and my

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:30.049 
complete headed in little pieces and my
guess<00:06:28.379> is<00:06:28.559> it<00:06:28.679> would<00:06:28.769> be<00:06:28.830> better<00:06:28.919> for<00:06:29.189> little

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:30.059 
guess is it would be better for little

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:43.679 
guess is it would be better for little
shreds<00:06:30.360> instead<00:06:31.879> okay

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:43.689 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:45.749 

you
