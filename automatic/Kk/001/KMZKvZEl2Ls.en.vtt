throughout<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.700> whole<00:05:32.820> thing<00:05:33.060> I<00:05:33.270> think<00:05:33.330> I

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
throughout the whole thing I think I

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.780

wanted<00:05:34.020> normally<00:05:34.770> in<00:05:34.950> a<00:05:35.010> music<00:05:35.280> video<00:05:35.400> see

more than one concept and I always solve
one<00:05:38.070> so<00:05:38.370> it<00:05:38.550> gets<00:05:38.670> four<00:05:38.970> and<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.150> half<00:05:39.180> from<00:05:39.570> me

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
one so it gets four and a half from me
