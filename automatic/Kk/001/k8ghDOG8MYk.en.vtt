the largest organ in Canada actually a

the largest organ in Canada actually a
very<00:00:12.450> large<00:00:12.630> Casavant<00:00:13.259> organ<00:00:13.799> which<00:00:14.639> was

very large Casavant organ which was

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.130 
very large Casavant organ which was
built<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.360> Quebec<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:17.420> installed<00:00:18.420> here<00:00:18.900> at

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140

Metropolitan<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:20.449> 1930<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.010> my<00:00:23.010> impression

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
Metropolitan in 1930 and my impression

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.620 
Metropolitan in 1930 and my impression
is<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.880> pretty<00:00:24.150> much<00:00:24.300> remained

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
is that it's pretty much remained

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.679 
is that it's pretty much remained
unchanged<00:00:25.470> since<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:26.070> point<00:00:26.539> except<00:00:27.539> with

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
unchanged since that point except with

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.990 
unchanged since that point except with
the<00:00:27.840> exception<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.650> addition<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.789> back

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the exception of in addition in the back

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.319 
the exception of in addition in the back
of<00:00:30.330> seven<00:00:31.320> new<00:00:31.439> ranks<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.949> late<00:00:32.180> 90s<00:00:33.180> I

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
of seven new ranks in the late 90s I

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.740 
of seven new ranks in the late 90s I
believe<00:00:34.579> but<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.940> front<00:00:36.149> organ<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.540> pretty

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
believe but the front organ is pretty

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.930 
believe but the front organ is pretty
much<00:00:36.899> unchanged<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.430> style<00:00:38.760> of

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
much unchanged and the the style of

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.880 
much unchanged and the the style of
organ<00:00:39.300> building<00:00:39.570> particularly<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.379> time

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
organ building particularly at that time

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.520 
organ building particularly at that time
in<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> first<00:00:42.420> part<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> 20th<00:00:43.079> century

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
in the first part of the 20th century

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.979 
in the first part of the 20th century
was<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.850> making<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> organ<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.870> an

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
was one of making the organ be an

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.680 
was one of making the organ be an
orchestra<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.730> an<00:00:47.879> organ<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.210> this

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
orchestra so with an organ like this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.029 
orchestra so with an organ like this
particularly<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.280> many<00:00:51.890> sets<00:00:52.890> of

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
particularly we have so many sets of

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.740 
particularly we have so many sets of
pipes<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.879> designed<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.480> mimic

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
pipes that are designed to mimic

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.290 
pipes that are designed to mimic
orchestral<00:00:55.590> colors<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.969> organ

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
orchestral colors and on this organ

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
orchestral colors and on this organ
there's<00:00:57.840> even<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.289> division<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.949> whole<00:00:59.309> section

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
there's even a division a whole section

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.209 
there's even a division a whole section
of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.390> instrument<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.800> called<00:01:02.100> the

of the instrument that is called the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.609 
of the instrument that is called the
orchestral<00:01:02.640> division<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.589> you

orchestral division and in it can you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.740 
orchestral division and in it can you
you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.309> find<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.760> only<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:06.299> standard

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

you can find not only your standard
organ<00:01:07.049> sounds<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.650> flutes<00:01:09.229> or<00:01:10.229> strings<00:01:13.700> but

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
organ sounds like flutes or strings but

organ sounds like flutes or strings but
you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.030> also<00:01:15.150> find<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.659> plethora<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.380> color

orchestral<00:02:30.040> transcription<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.330> long<00:02:31.569> time

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
orchestral transcription for a long time

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.250 
orchestral transcription for a long time
that's<00:02:33.700> how<00:02:34.030> many<00:02:34.630> people<00:02:34.930> around<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.200> world

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
that's how many people around the world

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.140 
that's how many people around the world
actually<00:02:35.770> heard<00:02:35.950> orchestral<00:02:36.520> music<00:02:36.700> because

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
actually heard orchestral music because

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.240 
actually heard orchestral music because
small<00:02:37.720> cities<00:02:38.050> couldn't<00:02:38.500> usually<00:02:38.800> support<00:02:39.160> an

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
small cities couldn't usually support an

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.210 
small cities couldn't usually support an
orchestra<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.780> this<00:02:41.290> orchestral<00:02:41.769> music<00:02:41.950> would

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
orchestra so this orchestral music would

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.100 
orchestra so this orchestral music would
be<00:02:42.340> played<00:02:42.550> on<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.790> organ<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:43.780> piece<00:02:43.959> in

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
be played on the organ and this piece in

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.780 
be played on the organ and this piece in
particular<00:02:44.260> was<00:02:44.800> actually<00:02:45.190> transcribed<00:02:45.700> for

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
particular was actually transcribed for

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.040 
particular was actually transcribed for
organ<00:02:46.030> right<00:02:46.209> from<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.450> outset<00:02:46.510> from<00:02:46.959> the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
organ right from the outset from the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.690 
organ right from the outset from the
publisher<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.160> would<00:02:48.280> have<00:02:48.310> more

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
publisher so that it would have more

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.490 
publisher so that it would have more
kind<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.390> lasting<00:02:49.810> popularity

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
kind of lasting popularity

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.530 
kind of lasting popularity
so<00:02:51.100> essentially<00:02:51.459> registration<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.239> organ

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
so essentially registration of the organ

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.690 
so essentially registration of the organ
in<00:02:52.660> my<00:02:52.690> mind<00:02:53.080> is<00:02:53.319> essentially<00:02:53.890> orchestrating

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
in my mind is essentially orchestrating

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.780 
in my mind is essentially orchestrating
a<00:02:54.880> piece<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.890> whether<00:02:56.890> it's<00:02:57.100> Bach<00:02:57.310> or<00:02:57.610> whether

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
a piece and whether it's Bach or whether

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.910 
a piece and whether it's Bach or whether
it's<00:02:58.060> Elgar<00:02:58.480> that's<00:02:59.260> what<00:02:59.410> you're<00:02:59.530> doing<00:02:59.650> is

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
it's Elgar that's what you're doing is

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.740 
it's Elgar that's what you're doing is
you're<00:03:00.040> orchestrating<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.880> using<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.390> organ

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
you're orchestrating and using the organ

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.729 
you're orchestrating and using the organ
in<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.500> way<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:05.140> just<00:03:05.350> go<00:03:05.470> searching

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
in that way and so I just go searching

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.740 
in that way and so I just go searching
for<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.459> sounds<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:06.880> I<00:03:06.940> want<00:03:07.209> but<00:03:07.450> it's

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
for the sounds that I want but it's

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.580 
for the sounds that I want but it's
really<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.140> simple

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
really that simple

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.430 
really that simple
and<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:09.160> can<00:03:09.310> combine<00:03:09.519> them<00:03:09.780> or<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.019> like<00:03:11.200> and

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
and you can combine them or you like and

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.640 
and you can combine them or you like and
I<00:03:11.500> kind<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.040> have<00:03:12.370> what<00:03:12.610> I<00:03:13.049> want<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.170> hear<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:14.530> my

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
I kind of have what I want to hear in my

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.740 
I kind of have what I want to hear in my
head<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.100> then<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.250> try<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.030> find<00:03:16.329> at<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.570> best

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
head and then I try to find at the best

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.160 
head and then I try to find at the best
I<00:03:16.900> can

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
I can

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.170 
I can
so<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.430> organ<00:03:20.670> we<00:03:21.670> have<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.000> little

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
so in this organ we have this little

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.650 
so in this organ we have this little
lick<00:03:22.510> here<00:03:22.780> at<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.959> beginning<00:03:24.359> now<00:03:25.359> you<00:03:25.420> could

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
lick here at the beginning now you could

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.470 
lick here at the beginning now you could
play<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:25.989> on<00:03:26.109> any<00:03:26.290> different<00:03:26.560> colors<00:03:27.480> but

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
play that on any different colors but

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.180 
play that on any different colors but
like<00:03:28.900> I<00:03:29.049> I<00:03:29.290> play<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:29.739> down<00:03:29.890> here<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.620> center

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
like I I play it down here the center

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.250 
like I I play it down here the center
phone<00:03:33.459> kind<00:03:34.359> of<00:03:34.450> coupled<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:34.840> which<00:03:35.019> is<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.170> very

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
phone kind of coupled in which is a very

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.280 
phone kind of coupled in which is a very
very<00:03:35.739> loud<00:03:38.670> principal<00:03:39.670> sound<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:41.019> kind

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
very loud principal sound so that kind

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.330 
very loud principal sound so that kind
of<00:03:41.380> gives<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.709> just<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.920> little<00:03:42.160> bit<00:03:42.250> of

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
of gives it just a little bit of

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.240 
of gives it just a little bit of
immediacy<00:03:42.760> down<00:03:43.030> here<00:03:43.329> and<00:03:44.290> then<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.470> play<00:03:44.799> with

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
immediacy down here and then I play with

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:57.140 
immediacy down here and then I play with
a<00:03:45.280> little<00:03:45.579> bit<00:03:45.670> more<00:03:45.790> clarity<00:03:46.209> up<00:03:46.420> here

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.059 

and<00:03:57.659> I<00:03:57.780> want<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:57.989> add<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.200> little<00:03:58.470> bit<00:03:58.680> more<00:03:58.860> so

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
and I want to add a little bit more so

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.649 
and I want to add a little bit more so
I'm<00:03:59.159> just<00:03:59.340> going<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.640> actually<00:04:00.000> just<00:04:00.030> add<00:04:00.390> this

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
I'm just going to actually just add this

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:13.610 
I'm just going to actually just add this
at<00:04:01.349> this<00:04:01.500> point

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.069 

there's<00:04:14.620> this<00:04:14.769> little<00:04:14.980> kind<00:04:15.280> of<00:04:15.459> bike<00:04:15.670> pump<00:04:16.660> at

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
there's this little kind of bike pump at

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.409 
there's this little kind of bike pump at
the<00:04:17.229> end<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.829> so<00:04:18.100> for<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.430> like<00:04:18.759> I<00:04:18.970> feel<00:04:19.299> like

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
the end and so for that like I feel like

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.240 
the end and so for that like I feel like
it<00:04:19.539> means<00:04:19.660> just<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:19.959> little<00:04:20.139> bit<00:04:20.229> more<00:04:20.350> pedal<00:04:20.769> so

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
it means just a little bit more pedal so

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.920 
it means just a little bit more pedal so
I'm<00:04:21.400> hitting<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.820> peddle<00:04:22.120> piston<00:04:22.509> here<00:04:22.750> which

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
I'm hitting a peddle piston here which

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.779 
I'm hitting a peddle piston here which
is<00:04:23.050> adding<00:04:23.410> just<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.680> few<00:04:23.860> stops<00:04:24.100> including<00:04:24.669> the

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
is adding just a few stops including the

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.530 
is adding just a few stops including the
lowest<00:04:25.150> pipes<00:04:25.419> on<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.900> organ
