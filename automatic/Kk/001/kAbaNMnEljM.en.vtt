it's<00:00:06.899> ironic<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.379> Disney<00:00:07.859> decided<00:00:08.160> not<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
it's ironic that Disney decided not to

it's ironic that Disney decided not to
do<00:00:08.790> any<00:00:09.030> more<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.389> Fantasia<00:00:09.840> series

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
do any more of the Fantasia series

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.169 
do any more of the Fantasia series
because<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.219> next<00:00:11.429> couple<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.759> films

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
because for the next couple of films

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.089 
because for the next couple of films
they<00:00:12.570> be<00:00:12.840> trying<00:00:13.110> endlessly<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.799> try<00:00:13.980> and

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
they be trying endlessly to try and

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.880 
they be trying endlessly to try and
recreate<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.610> make<00:00:15.299> my<00:00:15.480> music<00:00:15.540> was<00:00:16.139> probably

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
recreate it make my music was probably

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.099 
recreate it make my music was probably
the<00:00:17.220> first<00:00:17.550> attempt<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.060> try<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.480> do<00:00:18.600> that

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
the first attempt to try and do that

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.260 
the first attempt to try and do that
it<00:00:19.230> follows<00:00:19.529> sort<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.920> similar<00:00:20.220> formula<00:00:20.910> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
it follows sort of a similar formula to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060 
it follows sort of a similar formula to
what<00:00:21.420> Three<00:00:21.600> Caballeros<00:00:21.750> was<00:00:22.320> doing<00:00:22.680> just

tying together a series of shorts with a
certain<00:00:25.199> kind<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.470> music

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
certain kind of music

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.830

you actually makes it into this one
which<00:00:45.270> was<00:00:45.450> originally<00:00:45.629> supposed<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.140> be

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
which was originally supposed to be

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.319 
which was originally supposed to be
featured<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.680> sequel<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> Fantasia<00:00:47.610> except

featured a sequel to Fantasia except

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.610 
featured a sequel to Fantasia except
instead<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> using<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.079> classical<00:00:49.530> music

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
instead of using the classical music

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920 
instead of using the classical music
they<00:00:50.010> use<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> song<00:00:50.550> instead<00:00:50.850> later<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
they use a song instead later the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.779 
they use a song instead later the
original<00:00:52.350> would<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.590> released<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.039> DVD<00:00:53.250> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
original would be released on DVD and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.240 
original would be released on DVD and
it's<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.420> lot<00:00:54.570> better<00:00:54.719> make<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.680> music<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
it's a lot better make my music is

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.010 
it's a lot better make my music is
probably<00:00:56.820> closer<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:57.690> Three<00:00:57.870> Caballeros

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
probably closer to what Three Caballeros

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.160 
probably closer to what Three Caballeros
was<00:00:58.590> trying<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.460> sort<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.149> fun<00:01:00.480> series<00:01:01.020> of
