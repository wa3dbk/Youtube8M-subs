moist underneath one of the things that

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.980 
moist underneath one of the things that
I've<00:02:01.680> noticed<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.850> when<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.780> take

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
I've noticed with this is when you take

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
I've noticed with this is when you take
a<00:02:04.020> look<00:02:04.170> at<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.380> you've<00:02:04.500> got<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> good<00:02:04.920> 100<00:02:05.159> mil

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
a look at it you've got a good 100 mil

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.340 
a look at it you've got a good 100 mil
layer<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.240> small<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.140> so

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
layer of this small in there so

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.469 
layer of this small in there so
you're<00:02:07.530> really<00:02:07.770> keeping<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.550> lot<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.060> mulch<00:02:09.300> on

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
you're really keeping a lot of mulch on

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.660 
you're really keeping a lot of mulch on
top<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.810> soil<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.349> over<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
top of the soil but over here at the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.760 
top of the soil but over here at the
base<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.239> rose<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.900> all<00:02:13.050> balled<00:02:13.319> out

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
base of the rose it's all balled out

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.950 
base of the rose it's all balled out
down<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.250> natural<00:02:14.370> scenes<00:02:14.820> yes<00:02:15.360> we<00:02:15.750> do

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
down to the natural scenes yes we do

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.650 
down to the natural scenes yes we do
that<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.650> then<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.040> fertilize<00:02:17.340> right<00:02:18.000> back<00:02:18.330> on

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
that and then we fertilize right back on

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.070 
that and then we fertilize right back on
the<00:02:18.930> drip<00:02:19.890> line<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.270> think<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.690> good<00:02:21.900> then

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
the drip line and I think it's good then

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.510 
the drip line and I think it's good then
for<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.380> watering<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.890> water<00:02:23.070> has<00:02:23.340> got<00:02:23.490> a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
for the watering the water has got a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.760 
for the watering the water has got a
bowl<00:02:23.820> then<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.420> go<00:02:24.600> with<00:02:24.630> usually<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.620> there's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
bowl then to go with usually so there's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.080 
bowl then to go with usually so there's
more<00:02:25.920> likely<00:02:26.250> waters<00:02:26.490> gonna<00:02:26.610> run<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.000> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
more likely waters gonna run to the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.350 
more likely waters gonna run to the
Roses<00:02:27.450> roots<00:02:27.690> yang<00:02:27.960> run<00:02:28.170> away<00:02:28.410> from<00:02:28.710> yes

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
to picking them I think if you pick them

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.040 
to picking them I think if you pick them
and<00:02:41.430> they're<00:02:41.760> just<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:42.240> their<00:02:42.450> way<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.630> being

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
and they're just on their way to being

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.930 
and they're just on their way to being
open<00:02:43.560> if<00:02:43.680> you'd<00:02:43.800> like<00:02:43.920> them<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.190> last<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.760> few

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
open if you'd like them to last a few

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.230 
open if you'd like them to last a few
days<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.860> really<00:02:46.860> if<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.070> can<00:02:47.250> aim<00:02:47.550> for<00:02:47.580> 40

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
days and really if you can aim for 40

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.500 
days and really if you can aim for 40
centimeters<00:02:49.080> that's<00:02:49.320> what<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.420> that's<00:02:51.420> so

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
centimeters that's what you do that's so

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.370 
centimeters that's what you do that's so
bad<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.840> into<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:56.510> with<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.140> trick

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
bad that into and I with the the trick

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.040 
bad that into and I with the the trick
with<00:02:58.620> these<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:59.010> think<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.970> much<00:03:00.240> variety<00:03:00.480> as

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
with these I think is as much variety as

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.930 
with these I think is as much variety as
well<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.950> end<00:03:02.010> up<00:03:02.130> with<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> vast<00:03:02.640> full
