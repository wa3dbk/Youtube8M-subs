00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello, guys, how about I bring you a new one? 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.470
 episode of equipment for cough and I know that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.929
 I said that the previous one that I made of the league 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.179
 tippeligaen was going to be the last but it 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.099
 it happened to me that I had the team here 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.680
 silver and then I'll have the gold one too 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.040
 to analyze what I'm doing 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.890
 the tubular rock and so good I wanted 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.620
 I wanted to mention to the opinion of the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.370
 players and others and good this team of 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.900
 the Belgian silver league of the polis the 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.329
 truth that I liked a lot about 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.160
 all because it is very fast and the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.980
 defenses are very good and let's go 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.679
 commenting one on one for players the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.120
 goalkeeper is proto is pretty good for 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:46.710
 be silver has stretched 82 and 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.929
 position 81 those two statistics are 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.179
 quite important for a goalkeeper and 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.640
 Well, this one, the truth that fulfills 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:56.850
 well the two middle ones are donkey to the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.069
 less personally they are among the best 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.420
 central to the game I think because of 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.149
 silver we are always talking 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.280
 of silver more than anything by rhythm and 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.180
 defense of how you see the statistics 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 are 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.890
 rhythm 78 defense 73 header 76 put 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.940
 above 70 and at the 82 pace 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.830
 a lot of speed defense 74 and header 72 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.150
 this for some silver you are 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.210
 used to signing 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.890
 of this category because the truth that they are 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.140
 very very good statistics do not 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.900
 they find in many leagues the truth is 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.150
 thought good so nothing these two 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.430
 for me along with canon that can be 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.520
 another option to exchange or to 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.119
 have the owner 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.429
 are are great then the lateral ones 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.500
 because I just have them there for rhythm 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.960
 I always like bands 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.000
 quickly and they are safari on the left with 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.830
 90 rhythm and opare on the right with rhythm 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.160
 90 mind 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.420
 the good midfielder you already know that the 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.810
 half hundred in the game is usually 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.850
 affection but good I signed first to him 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.619
 point 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.689
 I was pleasantly surprised because I did not 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.300
 I expected a lot from that player and the 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.120
 true that it has rhythm 73 then also 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.370
 has 71 72 times that were not new 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.410
 bad shooting statistics 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.850
 maybe 63 is a little short but 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.910
 well then it has given me very good 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.920
 result the truth that I have gotten several 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.720
 goals with him and good I'm happy 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.160
 it's also cheap I got it for 200 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.290
 will run 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.739
 the other two so they are expensive 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.409
 1 that fixes that it goes to four thousand 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.750
 five thousand coins easy but good your 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:42.049
 statistics you have everything above 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.439
 of the 70 the truth that has very good 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.090
 shot the paste sticks well away from the 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.950
 ontot and then have good statistics 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.180
 of defense so you can not ask him 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.220
 much more 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.930
 blondel is also similar to this one maybe 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.799
 the statistics are a little worse but 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.420
 on the subject of the longhorns the truth 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.060
 that he had read good opinions about 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.639
 the one that hits her pretty well and the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.950
 first what partner did I try to put it 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.000
 Well, the truth is that very good 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.280
 impressions with this player 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.170
 I will leave you as always the link above 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.730
 so you can see the videos two parts of 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.840
 juan the face glory and you will have all 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:22.400
 the goals and well let's go up already to the 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.400
 front trio 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.840
 if I eat you forward center good we're going 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.630
 to leave him for the end because he has 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.020
 has this player's cloth on the left 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.740
 I have to win so a good rhythm player 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.060
 86 min 81 four days of dribbling the only 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.040
 of the team that has four skis 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.630
 in front and well you know that to me 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.210
 I always like to haggle a little and 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.030
 I had to have an uncle up to 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.250
 Although there is an option that is a 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.010
 player with more rhythm that is called his 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.350
 lowered or its greater or something like that good I 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.870
 I preferred to win and for the dribble and the 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.660
 true that the shot of 59 does not make 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.130
 justice for me I think it's a little 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.070
 best 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.550
 then on the right I have Suarez is a 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.850
 player that is good is also none 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.230
 wonder has rhythm 84 shots 70 the 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.569
 shot does not convince me either 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.299
 a lot but good 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.639
 has served me well the truth that has 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.850
 done his job and well maybe another 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.580
 option here up here would be rudy that 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.800
 has rhythm 90 I think so good as 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.560
 does not have this nor does it have 4 stretching 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.830
 the dribble must have the same shot that 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.750
 rudy 3 or 2 so maybe you can 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.830
 opting for that has always been that 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.680
 it will also be more expensive 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.280
 and good up and no doubt the star of 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.150
 this equipment is tchitÃ© as you can see rhythm 93 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.550
 throw 73 dribble stars if it was with 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.360
 4 this good player I do not even know what 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.270
 it would cost now five 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.470
 a thousand coins so good 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.350
 in the market situation that we have 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.160
 now sure much less but to me 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:09.520
 it cost me in his day five thousand and the truth 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.340
 which is great in shooting themes and 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.390
 rhythm or you have to run what 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.460
 want and more 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.680
 and the sticks also very well especially 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.300
 with power perhaps of quality not so much 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.330
 so I noticed but with power 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.849
 great then 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.860
 the truth that I do not have any fault 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.659
 with this player he put a lot of goals 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.419
 I have already commented on it 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:34.069
 other episodes of the label and but three or 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.800
 four goals per game almost always 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:38.330
 they shut up and well I have no doubt about 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.520
 that this player is the one who has to 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:45.460
 be up there in this type of equipment 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.379
 and good guys I hope you like this 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.900
 team to me the truth that is delighted 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.750
 and October you see that in the end we just 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.169
 winning the silver tournament against 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.330
 pretty good equipment and good nothing else 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.710
 see you in subsequent episodes as 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.500
 you know already have the goals here up 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.500
 in the link and also see you later
