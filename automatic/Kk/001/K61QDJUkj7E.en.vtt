pretty<00:02:29.180> cool<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.720> suppose<00:02:30.620> or<00:02:30.920> something<00:02:31.340> maybe

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
pretty cool I suppose or something maybe

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.140 
pretty cool I suppose or something maybe
maybe<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.630> then<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.230> course<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.830> have<00:02:33.980> your

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
maybe and then of course you have your

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.070 
maybe and then of course you have your
you<00:02:35.150> can<00:02:35.330> talk<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.319> your<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:37.640> know

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
you can talk it to your you know

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.809 
you can talk it to your you know
computer<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.500> have<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.799> normal<00:02:40.160> USB<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:40.670> is

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
computer you have the normal USB this is

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.670 
computer you have the normal USB this is
probably<00:02:41.090> it's<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.330> loading<00:02:41.720> cable<00:02:42.110> that<00:02:42.650> you

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
probably it's the loading cable that you

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.800 
probably it's the loading cable that you
charge<00:02:43.099> up<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.459> device<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.030> then<00:02:44.390> also<00:02:44.599> you

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
charge up the device and then also you

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.039 
charge up the device and then also you
can<00:02:45.140> put<00:02:45.349> it<00:02:45.500> into<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:46.069> wall<00:02:46.299> so<00:02:47.299> that's<00:02:47.900> not

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
can put it into the wall so that's not

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.050 
can put it into the wall so that's not
