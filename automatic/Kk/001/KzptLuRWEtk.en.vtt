00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
for me and I bought the truck it was

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.680 
for me and I bought the truck it was
already<00:00:29.820> stripped<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.990> back<00:00:31.289> door<00:00:31.529> body

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the only only real problem with these is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.000 
the only only real problem with these is
the<00:00:40.550> those<00:00:41.550> factors<00:00:42.230> that<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> big<00:00:43.770> hose

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010

rail<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> front<00:00:45.289> so<00:00:46.289> they're<00:00:46.440> not

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
rail on the front so they're not

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.069 
rail on the front so they're not
designed<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:49.520> have<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> bumper<00:00:50.820> put<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.239> them

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
designed to have a bumper put on them

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.220 
designed to have a bumper put on them
so<00:00:53.649> I<00:00:54.070> put<00:00:54.579> in<00:00:54.670> an<00:00:54.730> old<00:00:54.790> t800<00:00:55.480> bumper<00:00:55.780> on<00:00:55.930> it

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
so I put in an old t800 bumper on it

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.670 
so I put in an old t800 bumper on it
and<00:00:57.190> if<00:00:58.090> you<00:00:58.239> have<00:00:58.660> it<00:00:58.809> set<00:00:59.140> back<00:00:59.170> far<00:00:59.649> enough

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
and if you have it set back far enough

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.310 
and if you have it set back far enough
to<00:01:00.750> look<00:01:01.750> normal

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
to look normal

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.060 
to look normal
that's<00:01:03.220> as<00:01:03.430> far<00:01:03.640> as<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:03.940> food<00:01:04.150> will<00:01:04.390> open<00:01:05.070> so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
that's as far as the food will open so

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.240 
that's as far as the food will open so
eventually<00:01:08.670> I'll<00:01:09.670> probably<00:01:09.940> change<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:11.250> but

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
eventually I'll probably change that but

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.850 
eventually I'll probably change that but
for<00:01:12.550> right<00:01:12.729> now<00:01:12.790> that's<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:14.440> way<00:01:14.590> it's<00:01:14.740> going

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
for right now that's the way it's going

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.830 
for right now that's the way it's going
to<00:01:14.920> be<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.659> got<00:01:16.659> some<00:01:17.080> more<00:01:17.259> detailing<00:01:17.680> to<00:01:18.009> do<00:01:18.840> on

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
to be I got some more detailing to do on

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.180 
to be I got some more detailing to do on
this<00:01:20.200> -<00:01:20.470> it<00:01:20.890> needs<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.960> trailer<00:01:23.350> airlines

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
this - it needs with trailer airlines

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.940 
this - it needs with trailer airlines
and<00:01:24.790> it<00:01:25.180> needs<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.780> lipst<00:01:26.140> route<00:01:28.680> both<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.860> those

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
and it needs a lipst route both of those

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.820 
and it needs a lipst route both of those
are<00:01:30.130> pretty<00:01:30.340> easy<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.670> do<00:01:30.850> I<00:01:31.030> just<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:32.710> been

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
are pretty easy to do I just have been

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.930 
are pretty easy to do I just have been
doing<00:01:33.070> other<00:01:33.280> stuff<00:01:33.369> lately<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:35.789> these<00:01:36.789> are

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
doing other stuff lately so these are

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.550 
doing other stuff lately so these are
pretty<00:01:37.119> nice<00:01:37.240> models<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.160> can<00:01:39.369> see<00:01:40.560> they

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
pretty nice models as you can see they

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.980 
pretty nice models as you can see they
steer<00:01:41.950> at<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.160> pretty<00:01:42.399> good<00:01:42.520> angle

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.800 

and<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.290> roll<00:01:46.610> pretty<00:01:47.610> decently<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.540> kind

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and they roll pretty decently they kind

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
and they roll pretty decently they kind
of<00:01:48.840> bind<00:01:49.080> up<00:01:49.260> a<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.530> bit<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.010> it's<00:01:50.190> not

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
of bind up a little bit and it's not

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:58.969 
of bind up a little bit and it's not
full<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:51.500> steered<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.770> way<00:01:55.369> but<00:01:57.979> they

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
full like steered all the way but they

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.870 
full like steered all the way but they
don't<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.759> not<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.330> 48<00:02:01.290> hundreds<00:02:01.880> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
don't it's not like the 48 hundreds the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.790 
don't it's not like the 48 hundreds the
white<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.300> where<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.080> turn<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.530> all

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
white it's where the if you turn it all

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.990 
white it's where the if you turn it all
the<00:02:04.830> way<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.280> hood<00:02:05.520> pops<00:02:05.820> up<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> that's<00:02:07.920> cool

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.620 

they<00:02:12.000> went<00:02:12.209> with<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:14.540> super<00:02:15.540> single<00:02:15.840> steers

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.550 

that's<00:02:19.630> fine<00:02:19.900> but<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.750> wheels<00:02:22.990> on<00:02:23.200> these<00:02:23.350> are

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
that's fine but the wheels on these are

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.740 
that's fine but the wheels on these are
different<00:02:24.990> see<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.020> front<00:02:26.410> wheel<00:02:27.750> as

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
different see the front wheel as

different see the front wheel as
compared<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.500> wheel<00:02:30.460> on<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.730> drop<00:02:30.940> axle

the<00:02:38.260> wheel<00:02:38.469> on<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.010> drop<00:02:39.250> axle<00:02:41.010> came<00:02:42.010> off<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.310> a

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
the wheel on the drop axle came off of a

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.140 
the wheel on the drop axle came off of a
first<00:02:44.409> gear<00:02:44.650> Pete

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.920 

and<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.640> rear<00:02:52.940> wheels<00:02:53.180> are<00:02:53.330> different<00:02:53.780> too

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
and the rear wheels are different too

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.650 
and the rear wheels are different too
they<00:02:54.170> don't<00:02:54.880> they<00:02:55.880> don't<00:02:55.910> match<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.540> other

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
they don't they don't match the other

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.100 
they don't they don't match the other
first<00:02:57.050> gear<00:02:57.290> wheels<00:02:57.470> but<00:02:57.740> they're<00:02:57.920> nice<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:59.110> it

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
first gear wheels but they're nice so it

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.150 
first gear wheels but they're nice so it
kind<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.320> looks<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.590> me<00:03:00.740> like<00:03:00.770> they're

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
kind of looks to me like they're

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.440 
kind of looks to me like they're
starting<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:03.400> like<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.550> next<00:03:04.880> generation

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
starting to like the next generation

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.570 
starting to like the next generation
that<00:03:05.540> wheels<00:03:05.750> might<00:03:06.080> be<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.290> super<00:03:07.010> single<00:03:07.370> and

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
that wheels might be a super single and

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.550 
that wheels might be a super single and
drive<00:03:07.880> because<00:03:08.300> they<00:03:08.450> look<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.990> lot<00:03:09.140> like<00:03:09.320> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
drive because they look a lot like the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.380 
drive because they look a lot like the
super<00:03:10.490> single<00:03:10.820> wheels<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:13.370> DF<00:03:13.850> tank<00:03:14.120> in<00:03:14.300> the
