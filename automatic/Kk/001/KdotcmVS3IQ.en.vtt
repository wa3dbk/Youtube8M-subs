Brett upload some amazing gameplay all
the<00:02:57.210> ones<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.690> think<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.020> a<00:02:58.140> like<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.320> 97<00:02:58.890> 23

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
the ones I can think of a like a 97 23

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.780 
the ones I can think of a like a 97 23
and<00:02:59.730> I<00:03:00.060> think<00:03:00.270> he<00:03:00.360> has<00:03:00.450> 136<00:03:01.440> 21<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.610> that's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
and I think he has 136 21 so that's

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.970 
and I think he has 136 21 so that's
pretty<00:03:03.030> damn<00:03:03.210> awesome<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:04.410> gameplay<00:03:04.620> was

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
pretty damn awesome this gameplay was

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
actually a 95 21 I ended up going on a

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.230 
actually a 95 21 I ended up going on a
50<00:03:07.830> kill<00:03:08.040> streak<00:03:08.280> if<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.550> include<00:03:08.850> my<00:03:09.000> first

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240

50 kill streak if you include my first
chopper<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.720> her<00:03:09.810> arm<00:03:10.050> which<00:03:10.830> was<00:03:10.860> pretty<00:03:11.550> nice

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
chopper in her arm which was pretty nice

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.820 
chopper in her arm which was pretty nice
for<00:03:12.030> me<00:03:12.090> it's<00:03:12.330> one<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.570> my<00:03:12.630> highest<00:03:13.020> yet<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.590> had

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
for me it's one of my highest yet I had

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.730 
for me it's one of my highest yet I had
do<00:03:14.010> have<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.190> 45<00:03:14.700> gun<00:03:15.000> kill<00:03:15.210> streak<00:03:15.480> but<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.500> was

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
do have a 45 gun kill streak but it was

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.120 
do have a 45 gun kill streak but it was
kind<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.250> campy<00:03:17.790> with<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.060> m16<00:03:18.600> on<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:19.130> crisis

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
kind of campy with the m16 on a crisis

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.940 
kind of campy with the m16 on a crisis
just<00:03:20.370> sitting<00:03:20.580> up<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.820> sand<00:03:21.120> bag<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:21.660> that

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
just sitting up on the sand bag so that

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.370 
just sitting up on the sand bag so that
that<00:03:22.950> kind<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.370> was<00:03:24.120> stupid<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.170> don't

that kind of was stupid and I just don't
really<00:03:25.440> think<00:03:25.650> it's<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.860> good<00:03:25.890> kill<00:03:26.160> streak<00:03:26.400> but

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
jungle is actually a really good map for

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.310 
jungle is actually a really good map for
the<00:04:50.000> g11<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.600> only<00:04:50.780> thing<00:04:50.960> is<00:04:50.990> that<00:04:51.080> when

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
the g11 the only thing is that when

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.350 
the g11 the only thing is that when
you're<00:04:51.440> in<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.620> village<00:04:52.030> things<00:04:53.030> can<00:04:53.240> get

really<00:04:53.600> close<00:04:53.870> quarters<00:04:54.320> which<00:04:54.830> is<00:04:54.950> why<00:04:55.100> was

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
really close quarters which is why was

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.970 
really close quarters which is why was
grading<00:04:55.580> them<00:04:55.640> at<00:04:55.760> 74<00:04:56.180> years<00:04:56.450> so<00:04:56.660> yeah<00:04:57.470> my<00:04:57.710> dogs

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
grading them at 74 years so yeah my dogs

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.240 
grading them at 74 years so yeah my dogs
absolutely<00:04:58.580> went<00:04:58.730> to<00:04:58.820> town<00:04:59.030> on<00:04:59.210> this<00:04:59.300> video<00:04:59.570> to

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
absolutely went to town on this video to

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.620 
absolutely went to town on this video to
almost<00:05:01.250> times<00:05:01.580> my<00:05:01.850> dogs<00:05:02.060> only<00:05:02.330> get<00:05:02.540> me

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
almost times my dogs only get me

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.330 
almost times my dogs only get me
anywhere<00:05:02.840> from<00:05:03.050> four<00:05:03.440> to<00:05:03.470> six<00:05:03.710> kills<00:05:04.010> which<00:05:04.220> is

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
anywhere from four to six kills which is

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.620 
anywhere from four to six kills which is
obviously<00:05:04.640> better<00:05:04.790> than<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.180> gun<00:05:05.330> shipping

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
obviously better than the gun shipping

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
obviously better than the gun shipping
ground<00:05:05.840> war<00:05:05.990> because<00:05:06.140> they<00:05:06.230> don't<00:05:06.380> really<00:05:06.470> get

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
ground war because they don't really get

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.950 
ground war because they don't really get
any<00:05:06.860> kills<00:05:07.100> a<00:05:07.340> there's<00:05:08.030> like<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.240> glitch<00:05:08.540> but

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
any kills a there's like a glitch but

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.140 
any kills a there's like a glitch but
i'm<00:05:09.200> sure<00:05:09.230> you<00:05:09.440> guys<00:05:09.470> know<00:05:09.590> that<00:05:09.800> so<00:05:10.520> this<00:05:10.970> was
