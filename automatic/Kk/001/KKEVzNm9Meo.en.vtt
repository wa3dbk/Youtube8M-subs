00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
following him and I tried to do

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.050 
following him and I tried to do
something<00:02:40.630> really<00:02:40.810> stupid<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.850> thought<00:02:42.850> he<00:02:42.970> was

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
looking the other way but I guess he

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.260
