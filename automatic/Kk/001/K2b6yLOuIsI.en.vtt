00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
I bought this on Amazon a few weeks back

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.200 
I bought this on Amazon a few weeks back
and<00:00:18.590> basically<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:20.040> this<00:00:20.190> is<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.880> for

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
and basically what this is is for

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.110 
and basically what this is is for
obviously<00:00:21.810> for<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.110> siphoning<00:00:22.760> liquids<00:00:23.760> it'll

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.120 
obviously for a siphoning liquids it'll

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.040 
obviously for a siphoning liquids it'll
siphon<00:00:25.110> any<00:00:25.380> type<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.950> liquid<00:00:26.720> including<00:00:27.720> some

what<00:00:28.260> stick<00:00:28.590> oils<00:00:29.040> bars<00:00:29.970> you're<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.270> to<00:00:30.420> think

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
what stick oils bars you're not to think

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.630 
what stick oils bars you're not to think
it's<00:00:31.500> pretty<00:00:32.040> cool

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it's pretty cool

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.579 
it's pretty cool
basically<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.469> six<00:00:34.739> foot<00:00:35.359> tube<00:00:36.589> with

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
basically it's just a six foot tube with

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.819 
basically it's just a six foot tube with
the<00:00:37.620> brass<00:00:39.050> tip<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.289> and<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.679> got<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the brass tip on it and it's got a

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.430 
the brass tip on it and it's got a
little<00:00:40.949> glass<00:00:41.309> marble<00:00:41.909> inside<00:00:42.269> here<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
little glass marble inside here and the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.389 
little glass marble inside here and the
idea<00:00:43.769> is<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.460> basically<00:00:44.820> stick<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.780> into<00:00:46.399> say

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
idea is you basically stick it into say

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.309 
idea is you basically stick it into say
you<00:00:47.460> needed<00:00:47.699> to<00:00:47.850> fill<00:00:47.999> up<00:00:48.149> your<00:00:48.179> car<00:00:48.719> because

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:49.319 
you needed to fill up your car because

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.340 
you needed to fill up your car because
it<00:00:49.469> ran<00:00:49.589> out<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.800> fuel<00:00:50.989> basically<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.109> stick

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it ran out of fuel basically you stick

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.669 
it ran out of fuel basically you stick
this<00:00:52.499> into<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> gas<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.870> shake<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
this into a gas can can you shake it and

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.119 
this into a gas can can you shake it and
up<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.249> down<00:00:56.399> motion<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.569> first<00:00:58.530> deflection

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
up and down motion and first deflection

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.790 
up and down motion and first deflection
and<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.089> put<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.479> into<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.989> gas<00:01:01.199> tank<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and you put this into the gas tank and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.719 
and you put this into the gas tank and
it<00:01:02.670> fills<00:01:02.909> right<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.800> moves<00:01:04.800> about<00:01:05.159> three

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it fills right up it moves about three

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.690 
it fills right up it moves about three
and<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> half<00:01:05.909> gallons<00:01:06.920> per<00:01:07.920> minute<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.549> what

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
and a half gallons per minute it's what

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
and a half gallons per minute it's what
it<00:01:08.790> says<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.390> doesn't<00:01:09.689> move<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.439> liquid

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
it says and it doesn't move the liquid

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.670 
it says and it doesn't move the liquid
pretty<00:01:10.979> fast<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:12.540> milk<00:01:12.810> jug<00:01:12.899> a<00:01:13.320> full

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
pretty fast so I got a milk jug a full

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.039 
pretty fast so I got a milk jug a full
milk<00:01:13.920> jug<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.640> water<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.180> an<00:01:15.719> empty

milk jug here with water and an empty
milk<00:01:16.200> jug<00:01:16.500> full<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.890> air<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.759> we're<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.390> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
milk jug full of air and we're going to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.940 
milk jug full of air and we're going to
find<00:01:18.689> out<00:01:19.250> just<00:01:20.250> how<00:01:20.460> well<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.909> works<00:01:21.950> now

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.660 
find out just how well this works now
I've<00:01:23.100> tried<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.520> before<00:01:25.070> by<00:01:26.070> having<00:01:26.430> two

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
I've tried this before by having two

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.120 
I've tried this before by having two
just<00:01:27.149> next<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.170> each<00:01:28.229> other<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> didn't

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
just next to each other and it didn't

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.840 
just next to each other and it didn't
work<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:30.479> jug<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.920> liquid<00:01:32.310> needs

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
work the jug that has the liquid needs

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.270 
work the jug that has the liquid needs
to<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.270> higher<00:01:33.600> than<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.740> you're<00:01:34.890> trying<00:01:35.189> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.870 
to be higher than what you're trying to
put<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:36.329> liquid<00:01:36.750> into<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.369> I'll<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.670> put

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
put the liquid into so I'll just put

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.730
