the trees and and so on ok so I'm going

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.889 
the trees and and so on ok so I'm going
to<00:00:58.199> zoom<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> Sun<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.670> on<00:01:00.120> manual

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
to zoom in on the Sun this is on manual

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.460 
to zoom in on the Sun this is on manual
focus<00:01:01.379> at<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.559> moment<00:01:01.620> set<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.340> infinity<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
focus at the moment set to infinity and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
focus at the moment set to infinity and
auto<00:01:04.470> exposure<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> zoom<00:01:05.820> in

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
auto exposure so I'm going to zoom in

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.690 
auto exposure so I'm going to zoom in
onto<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.659> Sun<00:01:06.960> until<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.830> suddenly<00:01:08.280> becomes

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
onto the Sun until it suddenly becomes

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.700 
onto the Sun until it suddenly becomes
clear<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:09.900> I'm<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.320> lock<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
clear and then I'm going to lock the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.100 
clear and then I'm going to lock the
exposure<00:01:12.409> ok<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> sun<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.780> nice

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
exposure ok so now that the sun is nice

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.600 
exposure ok so now that the sun is nice
and<00:01:16.320> clear<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> lock<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.159> exposure

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
and clear I'm going to lock the exposure

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.460 
and clear I'm going to lock the exposure
so<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.060> doesn't<00:01:18.330> go<00:01:18.420> change<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.990> us<00:01:19.140> when<00:01:19.350> i

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
so it doesn't go change on us when i

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.870 
so it doesn't go change on us when i
zoom<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:22.130> that<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:23.280> hold<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.700> nice

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
zoom out and that will hold that nice

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.399 
zoom out and that will hold that nice
and<00:01:24.090> clear<00:01:24.299> without<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.630> leg<00:01:24.900> layer<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.350> we

to<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> Sun<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.939> actually<00:02:06.299> glia<00:02:06.630> which<00:02:06.930> is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
to be the Sun is actually glia which is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.350 
to be the Sun is actually glia which is
caused<00:02:07.380> by<00:02:07.649> scattering<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.729> sunlight<00:02:08.970> as

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
caused by scattering of the sunlight as

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.830 
caused by scattering of the sunlight as
it<00:02:09.539> passes<00:02:09.750> through<00:02:09.989> our<00:02:10.200> atmosphere

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
it passes through our atmosphere

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.589 
it passes through our atmosphere
Aaron<00:02:11.019> is<00:02:11.140> refracted<00:02:11.739> okay<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.209> we<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.450> see

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
Aaron is refracted okay so we can see

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.869 
Aaron is refracted okay so we can see
this<00:02:13.750> tiny<00:02:14.080> little<00:02:14.319> dot<00:02:14.620> that's<00:02:14.920> about<00:02:15.580> half

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
this tiny little dot that's about half

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.759 
this tiny little dot that's about half
of<00:02:16.030> one<00:02:16.239> degree<00:02:16.450> across<00:02:16.959> if<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.319> would<00:02:17.500> measure

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
of one degree across if we would measure

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.150 
of one degree across if we would measure
it<00:02:18.040> as<00:02:18.550> an<00:02:19.000> angle<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.989> that's<00:02:20.560> about<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> same

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
it as an angle and that's about the same

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.850 
it as an angle and that's about the same
size<00:02:21.459> as<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:22.599> moon<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.200> course<00:02:23.379> which<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.680> why

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
size as the moon of course which is why

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.539 
size as the moon of course which is why

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
the disc of the Sun so I'm going to take

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.330 
the disc of the Sun so I'm going to take
the<00:02:33.310> exposure<00:02:33.849> of<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.799> manual<00:02:35.799> setting<00:02:36.190> where

the exposure of the manual setting where

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.670 
the exposure of the manual setting where
it's<00:02:36.459> locked<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.110> you'll<00:02:38.110> see<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.440> camera

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
it's locked and you'll see the camera

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.339 
it's locked and you'll see the camera
adjust<00:02:38.860> itself<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:39.790> then<00:02:40.450> when<00:02:40.629> all<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.900> all

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
adjust itself and then when all that all

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.900 
adjust itself and then when all that all
of<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.620> glare<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.250> Sun<00:02:42.459> comes<00:02:42.700> and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
of that glare of the Sun comes and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.880 
of that glare of the Sun comes and
you'll<00:02:43.030> see<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.569> sun's<00:02:44.049> disc<00:02:44.380> actually

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
you'll see that the sun's disc actually

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.280 
you'll see that the sun's disc actually
looks<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.220> lot<00:02:45.459> bigger<00:02:45.730> than<00:02:46.480> what<00:02:47.140> we're

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
looks a lot bigger than what we're

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.220 
looks a lot bigger than what we're
seeing<00:02:47.319> here<00:02:47.620> so<00:02:47.980> here<00:02:48.160> we<00:02:48.280> go<00:02:48.780> right<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:50.019> see

seeing here so here we go right you see

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.539 
seeing here so here we go right you see
the<00:02:50.349> camera<00:02:50.530> adjusting<00:02:51.010> itself<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.489> the

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
the camera adjusting itself and the

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.630

we're seeing around the outside is

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.819 
we're seeing around the outside is
actually<00:03:37.000> glare<00:03:37.269> it's<00:03:37.510> not<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.840> Sun<00:03:38.049> so<00:03:38.799> the

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
actually glare it's not the Sun so the

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.930 
actually glare it's not the Sun so the
actual<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:40.599> disc<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:41.139> obscured<00:03:41.769> behind<00:03:41.919> my<00:03:42.280> my

actual the disc is obscured behind my my

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.300 
actual the disc is obscured behind my my
finger<00:03:43.329> now<00:03:43.959> if<00:03:44.139> there<00:03:44.349> was<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.530> second<00:03:45.069> son

actually<00:03:47.919> be<00:03:48.280> moving<00:03:48.669> my<00:03:48.819> finger<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.419> that

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
actually be moving my finger so that

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.839 
actually be moving my finger so that
okay<00:03:50.049> there's<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.650> little<00:03:50.919> lens<00:03:51.250> flare<00:03:51.609> there

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
okay there's a little lens flare there

okay we see that lens flare now if the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.670 
okay we see that lens flare now if the
object<00:03:57.280> seemed<00:03:57.819> to<00:03:58.000> stay<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:59.169> same<00:03:59.410> place

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
camera around and appeared to be a

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.030 
camera around and appeared to be a
second<00:04:03.760> son<00:04:04.079> what<00:04:05.079> I<00:04:05.109> would<00:04:05.380> want<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.709> do<00:04:05.829> there

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
is to actually put my finger where the

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.809 
is to actually put my finger where the
with<00:04:09.819> a<00:04:09.849> lens<00:04:10.450> flare<00:04:10.599> is<00:04:11.079> and<00:04:11.549> see<00:04:12.549> if<00:04:12.609> it's

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
with a lens flare is and see if it's

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.120 
with a lens flare is and see if it's
superimposed<00:04:13.569> over<00:04:13.810> my<00:04:14.139> finger<00:04:14.500> as<00:04:14.650> in<00:04:14.889> fact

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
superimposed over my finger as in fact

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.050 
superimposed over my finger as in fact
we<00:04:15.340> see<00:04:16.180> right<00:04:16.959> there<00:04:17.459> okay<00:04:18.459> we<00:04:18.579> can<00:04:18.700> see<00:04:18.880> those

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
we see right there okay we can see those

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.909 
we see right there okay we can see those
little<00:04:19.180> spots<00:04:19.479> are<00:04:19.840> superimposed<00:04:20.200> over<00:04:20.680> my

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
little spots are superimposed over my

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.060 
little spots are superimposed over my
finger<00:04:21.280> which<00:04:21.909> proves<00:04:22.330> that<00:04:22.979> they

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
finger which proves that they

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.560 
finger which proves that they
spots<00:04:24.430> that<00:04:24.610> we're<00:04:24.790> seeing<00:04:24.970> here<00:04:25.360> are

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
spots that we're seeing here are

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.800 
spots that we're seeing here are
actually<00:04:25.990> in<00:04:26.260> spheres<00:04:26.680> okay<00:04:27.670> so<00:04:28.360> there's<00:04:28.600> two

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
actually in spheres okay so there's two

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.590 
actually in spheres okay so there's two
parts<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.920> finger<00:04:30.220> test<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:31.090> first<00:04:31.300> part

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
parts of the finger test the first part

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.840 
parts of the finger test the first part
is<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:32.140> put<00:04:32.620> your<00:04:32.770> finger<00:04:33.070> over<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.430> disk<00:04:33.640> of

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
is to put your finger over the disk of

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
the Sun to make sure that the second

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.560 
the Sun to make sure that the second
object<00:04:35.980> actually<00:04:36.460> disappears<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.510> the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
object actually disappears and the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.620 
object actually disappears and the
second<00:04:38.530> part<00:04:38.680> is<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.160> put<00:04:39.370> your<00:04:39.610> finger<00:04:40.450> over

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
second part is to put your finger over

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.710 
second part is to put your finger over
where<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.020> second<00:04:41.560> object<00:04:41.740> appears<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.850> be<00:04:43.000> to

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
where the second object appears to be to

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.250 
where the second object appears to be to
see<00:04:43.990> if<00:04:44.110> it's<00:04:44.290> blocked<00:04:44.530> out<00:04:44.830> or<00:04:46.260> superimposed

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
see if it's blocked out or superimposed

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.000 
see if it's blocked out or superimposed
over<00:04:47.740> your<00:04:47.980> finger<00:04:48.280> as<00:04:48.400> we<00:04:48.580> see<00:04:48.820> here<00:04:49.350> okay<00:04:50.350> Mia

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
I'm thinking that in terms video he is

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.580 
I'm thinking that in terms video he is
actually<00:04:55.570> putting<00:04:55.990> his<00:04:56.230> finger<00:04:56.710> between<00:04:57.670> the

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
actually putting his finger between the

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.410 
actually putting his finger between the
the<00:04:59.590> lens<00:04:59.890> that<00:05:00.160> he's<00:05:00.280> using<00:05:00.550> which<00:05:00.850> is<00:05:01.090> some

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
the lens that he's using which is some

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.220 
the lens that he's using which is some
smoke<00:05:01.750> plastic<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:03.340> camera<00:05:03.730> in<00:05:04.000> fact<00:05:04.330> you
