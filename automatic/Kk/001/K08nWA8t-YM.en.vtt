major and B minor I'm just basically
doing<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.719> pattern<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.710> hand<00:00:46.879> so

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
doing this pattern with my right hand so

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.810 
doing this pattern with my right hand so
thumb<00:00:48.239> plays<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.559> low<00:00:49.950> E<00:00:49.980> string<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> D

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
thumb plays the low E string and the D

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.139 
thumb plays the low E string and the D
string<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.600> then<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.530> other<00:00:53.399> strings<00:00:53.820> go

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
string and then the other strings go

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.689 
string and then the other strings go
like<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.449> g<00:00:54.989> string<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.320> played<00:00:55.620> by<00:00:55.890> my<00:00:56.129> first

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
like this g string is played by my first

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.689 
like this g string is played by my first
finger<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> B<00:00:58.949> strings<00:00:59.250> played<00:00:59.489> by<00:00:59.579> my

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
finger and the B strings played by my

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.310 
finger and the B strings played by my
second<00:01:00.059> finger<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> high<00:01:00.899> E<00:01:00.930> string<00:01:01.079> is

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
second finger and the high E string is

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.229 
second finger and the high E string is
played<00:01:01.559> by<00:01:01.680> my<00:01:01.829> third<00:01:02.010> finger<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.910> that's<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
played by my third finger so that's the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.370 
played by my third finger so that's the
pattern<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.830> use<00:01:04.939> throughout<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> song<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
pattern I use throughout the song so it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:18.980 
pattern I use throughout the song so it
starts<00:01:07.710> off<00:01:07.799> here's<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> intro

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.380 

then<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.290> goes<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.670> kind<00:01:21.910> of<00:01:21.970> version<00:01:22.300> of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
then it goes to this kind of version of

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.190 
then it goes to this kind of version of
a<00:01:22.480> c-major

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200
