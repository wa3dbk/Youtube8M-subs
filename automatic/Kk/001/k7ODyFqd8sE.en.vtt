00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
169 bucks but I've seen it on Amazon and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.620 
169 bucks but I've seen it on Amazon and
a<00:01:09.869> few<00:01:10.020> other<00:01:10.140> places<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.650> about<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> hundred

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
a few other places for about a hundred

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.520 
a few other places for about a hundred
so<00:01:12.630> now<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.810> we've<00:01:12.960> run<00:01:13.110> through<00:01:13.290> some<00:01:13.470> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
so now that we've run through some of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.899 
so now that we've run through some of
the<00:01:13.590> basics<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> best<00:01:14.520> thing<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.700> do

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the basics I think the best thing to do

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.580 
the basics I think the best thing to do
is<00:01:15.030> actually<00:01:15.210> take<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.720> pool<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.200> test

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
is actually take it to a pool and test

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.429 
is actually take it to a pool and test
it<00:01:16.740> out<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.509> we've<00:01:18.659> made<00:01:18.810> our<00:01:18.869> way<00:01:19.080> out<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
it out so we've made our way out to the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.050 
it out so we've made our way out to the
pool<00:01:19.650> where<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.580> test<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
pool where we can actually test this

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.270 
pool where we can actually test this
products<00:01:21.479> claim<00:01:21.780> how<00:01:22.320> does<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> doing<00:01:23.100> in

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
products claim how does it doing in

products claim how does it doing in
water<00:01:23.729> with<00:01:24.240> normal<00:01:24.720> usage<00:01:25.490> my<00:01:26.490> goal<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
water with normal usage my goal is to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.070 
water with normal usage my goal is to
throw<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.360> pool<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.659> let<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.930> be<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
throw it in the pool and let you be the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.359 
throw it in the pool and let you be the
judge<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.439> how<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> does<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.610> let's<00:01:29.790> pair<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.119> up

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
judge of how it does so let's pair it up

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.200 
judge of how it does so let's pair it up
alright<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.520> seems<00:01:32.670> pretty<00:01:32.939> easy

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.830 

let's<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.900> device<00:01:37.260> is<00:01:37.560> connected

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.300 

actually<00:01:43.840> gets<00:01:43.990> pretty<00:01:44.170> loud<00:01:44.350> could

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
actually gets pretty loud could

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.830 
actually gets pretty loud could
obviously<00:01:45.550> have<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:45.970> spit<00:01:46.300> out<00:01:46.330> some<00:01:46.630> water

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
obviously have to spit out some water

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.780 
obviously have to spit out some water
and<00:01:47.170> whatnot<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.620> kind<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.010> reset<00:01:48.310> itself

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.649 

watching<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.880> water<00:01:52.030> bounce<00:01:52.300> off<00:01:52.479> of<00:01:52.600> this

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
watching the water bounce off of this

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:53.760 
watching the water bounce off of this
thing<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:52.990> actually<00:01:53.290> one<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.530> cooler

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
thing is actually one of the cooler

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.580 
thing is actually one of the cooler
things<00:01:53.800> about<00:01:54.250> it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.200 

the<00:02:02.590> speaker<00:02:02.979> actually<00:02:03.130> gets<00:02:03.490> pretty<00:02:03.729> loud<00:02:03.940> I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
the speaker actually gets pretty loud I

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.580 
the speaker actually gets pretty loud I
have<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.479> say<00:02:04.659> that<00:02:04.840> I'm<00:02:04.960> pretty<00:02:05.409> impressed

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
have to say that I'm pretty impressed

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.729 
have to say that I'm pretty impressed
and<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.759> actually<00:02:07.020> does<00:02:08.020> exactly<00:02:08.380> what<00:02:08.530> it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
and it actually does exactly what it

concludes<00:02:10.780> our<00:02:11.310> unboxing<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.520> testing<00:02:13.000> of

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.870 
concludes our unboxing and testing of
the<00:02:13.390> monster<00:02:13.840> superstar<00:02:14.470> backfloat<00:02:14.850> again<00:02:15.850> I

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
the monster superstar backfloat again I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.699 
the monster superstar backfloat again I
think<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.270> does<00:02:16.420> exactly<00:02:16.840> what<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.350> says<00:02:17.380> it's

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
think it does exactly what it says it's

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.530 
think it does exactly what it says it's
going<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.920> do<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.820> have<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.030> admit<00:02:19.390> that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
going to do and I have to admit that

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.390 
going to do and I have to admit that
it's<00:02:19.690> actually<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:19.989> little<00:02:20.140> bit<00:02:20.320> cooler<00:02:20.590> than<00:02:21.070> I

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
it's actually a little bit cooler than I

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.370 
it's actually a little bit cooler than I
