 best read in the Hundred Tomorrow Forest and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.100
 if his friends had fun on it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.230
 that he told him a story aloud like that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.230
 like on this beautiful spring day 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.100
 as a trout begged us 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.100
 Quiet 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.780
 I should agree a little bit already 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.490

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.610

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.610
 hold 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.170
 Owl went away and took his book 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.090
 Merkel said with kindness 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.460
 I hope owl does not mind us 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.320
 to read something 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.080
 maybe it would appeal said pur 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.190

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.750

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.050

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.840
 so knocked analyst higher I can get 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.100
 He asked if you borrow a book 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.930
 what can be said euro surprised since 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.670
 none of the friends had any eternal life 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.490
 I borrowed a book from Euler 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.360
 which because I do not know exactly 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.460

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.530
 I also added Merkel and 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.659
 me too 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.299
 Everyone wanted to borrow a book 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.890

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.129
 library considered you have one 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.140
 couple of huge books did indeed said 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.750

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.849
 very small book newly chosen for everyone 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.209
 Make a book out of his friends as they leave 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:27.920
 thought when they read all 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.920
 they do not need me to learn anymore 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:36.870
 make yourself comfortable to read 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.299
 the first page was a picture of one 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.910
 Beehive full of golden honey 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.069
 Small rumbles it has no sense with 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.590
 To read empty stomach, he said 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.900
 he tucked his book under his arm 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.900
 and marched home 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.640
 Everywhere in the forest were the others 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.530
 also busy with her reading 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.780
 ticker let the whole first word in 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.420
 his book and decided that with a 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.530
 round hopping to celebrate 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.130

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.000
 that he should be in his garden you 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.990
 was distracted by a rain shower 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.870
 Russ prefers to play all the pictures 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.100
 a leaf floating on piglet's book 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.740
 reminded him that he was still capable 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.320
 had to pu up next morning 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.710
 He reached for a honey pot and saw it 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.510
 book under his feet he said I 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.220

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.720

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.700

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.820
