insemination on chan chan that was a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.920 
insemination on chan chan that was a
complicated<00:00:20.160> procedure<00:00:20.430> but<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.689> were<00:00:21.779> very

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
complicated procedure but we were very

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.439 
complicated procedure but we were very
lucky<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.439> our<00:00:22.949> own<00:00:23.160> expert<00:00:24.150> team

incredibly<00:00:35.730> well<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.899> all<00:00:37.020> so

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
incredibly well but it's all so

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.130 
incredibly well but it's all so
complicated<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.250> fact<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:39.329> this

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
complicated in the fact that for this

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.650 
complicated in the fact that for this
year<00:00:40.530> we've<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.000> used<00:00:42.180> yango<00:00:42.600> in

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
year we've not just used yango in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.690 
year we've not just used yango in
seeming<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.290> we've<00:00:43.469> also<00:00:43.649> decided<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.489> use

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
seeming what we've also decided to use

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.420 
seeming what we've also decided to use
the<00:00:45.030> semen<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.570> foul<00:00:45.930> ball<00:00:46.170> barbara<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the semen of foul ball barbara was the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.180 
the semen of foul ball barbara was the
last<00:00:47.579> Panda<00:00:47.910> who<00:00:48.750> was<00:00:48.960> present<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> UK<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
last Panda who was present in the UK and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.729 
last Panda who was present in the UK and
then<00:00:50.399> he<00:00:50.520> went<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.180> Berlin<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.050> he<00:00:52.530> died

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
then he went on to Berlin and he died

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.520 
then he went on to Berlin and he died
last<00:00:52.949> year<00:00:53.149> yeah<00:00:54.149> baba<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.170> World<00:00:55.440> Cup

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
last year yeah baba was a World Cup

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.299 
last year yeah baba was a World Cup
giant<00:00:56.460> panda<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.030> has<00:00:57.870> new<00:00:58.109> Cubs<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:59.129> that's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
giant panda and has new Cubs but that's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.670 
giant panda and has new Cubs but that's
not<00:00:59.520> only<00:00:59.850> because<00:01:00.239> he<00:01:00.270> never<00:01:01.230> get<00:01:01.469> really

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
not only because he never get really

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.139 
not only because he never get really
given<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> opportunity<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> debride<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
given the opportunity to debride the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.450 
given the opportunity to debride the
reason<00:01:04.080> why<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.379> decided<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.159> is

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
reason why we decided to do this is

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.899 
reason why we decided to do this is
quite<00:01:06.000> complicated<00:01:06.619> but<00:01:07.619> when<00:01:08.400> you're<00:01:08.670> doing

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
quite complicated but when you're doing

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.260 
quite complicated but when you're doing
insemination<00:01:09.619> directly<00:01:10.619> into<00:01:10.830> uterus<00:01:11.270> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
insemination directly into uterus you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.200 
insemination directly into uterus you
can't<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.130> use<00:01:14.159> fresh<00:01:14.909> semen

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
can't really or you can use fresh semen

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.179 
can't really or you can use fresh semen
but<00:01:15.600> there<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> danger<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> would<00:01:16.740> cause

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
but there is a danger it would cause

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.969 
but there is a danger it would cause
anaphylactic<00:01:17.729> shock<00:01:17.939> within<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.750> Panda<00:01:19.259> so

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
anaphylactic shock within the Panda so

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.740 
anaphylactic shock within the Panda so
not<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> prevent<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.360> first

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
not to prevent that the first

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
not to prevent that the first
insemination<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.590> usually<00:01:22.740> use<00:01:23.100> frozen

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
insemination you usually use frozen

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.950 
insemination you usually use frozen
semen<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.259> frozen<00:01:25.560> semen<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.130> used

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
semen and the frozen semen that we used

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.050 
semen and the frozen semen that we used
was<00:01:27.960> from<00:01:28.470> yang<00:01:28.950> guang<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:29.729> only<00:01:29.820> had<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
was from yang guang but we only had a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.819 
was from yang guang but we only had a
small<00:01:30.210> amounts<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.259> decided<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
small amounts and so we decided to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.270 
small amounts and so we decided to
double<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.119> use<00:01:33.420> bio<00:01:33.689> bomb<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.079> well

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
double it up and use bio bomb as well

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.890 
double it up and use bio bomb as well
and<00:01:35.280> then<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> third<00:01:35.850> insemination<00:01:36.689> we

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and then on the third insemination we

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.140 
and then on the third insemination we
use<00:01:37.049> fresh<00:01:37.409> semen<00:01:37.740> from<00:01:38.009> Yang<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
use fresh semen from Yang one the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.940 
use fresh semen from Yang one the
quality<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> semen<00:01:40.170> from<00:01:40.259> Yang<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:40.740> was

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
quality of semen from Yang one was

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.600 
quality of semen from Yang one was
excellent<00:01:41.840> was<00:01:42.860> ninety<00:01:43.860> two<00:01:44.040> hundred<00:01:44.340> percent

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
excellent was ninety two hundred percent

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.389 
excellent was ninety two hundred percent
motility<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.329> was<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:46.680> was<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> lot<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.070> it's

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
motility and was there was a lot of it's

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.510 
motility and was there was a lot of it's
over<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:48.600> were<00:01:49.200> very<00:01:49.500> pleased<00:01:49.979> with<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.310> state
