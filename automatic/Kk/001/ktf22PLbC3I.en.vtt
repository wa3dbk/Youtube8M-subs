00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:14.570
 hello guys welcome to the second 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.789
 chapter of armor stands revolution and 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.880
 good good good let's start with 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:24.640
 a pretty basic thing to read will be to 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.679
 basic and basic level and good because it is 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.080
 they are rather the ropes 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.970
 let's see a few examples about 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.760
 how to make ropes with trees 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.770
 stands good first of all let's see 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.899
 some utilities that we can put 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.350
 like for example this nonsense that I 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.820
 I think it would be like a 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.100
 an area to wash clothes from the clothes line 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.629
 where the clothes are stretched, because here I have 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.629
 my discs chairs 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.200
 I'll take my leather tunic my 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.420
 pants and my boots 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 and now that they are clean yes we can 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:14.480
 follow the truth a lot but we 're not going 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.870
 to explain at least although it 's what 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.420
 same I will not go into how 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:25.160
 do it from the clothes but in what there is 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.470
 behind that is this string of sticks this 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.920
 chain of sticks that would be or would be 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.530
 a very good string effect is worth 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.810
 Well now we are going to put mode 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.180
 spectator let's see all the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.360
 sermons stands that there are as we see there 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.060
 some armor stands above and three below 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.830
 these three below are simply the 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.830
 three armor stands d 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:56.210
 of clothes 1 in each block centered and 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.950
 well, they just serve to put 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.710
 the clothes and then here we would have the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.740
 armor stands that are holding these 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.290
 sticks sideways because we're going to 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.780
 learn to make side strings and 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.800
 vertical here we would see a simple use 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.710
 of how to make the lateral strings worth 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.510
 opposites horizontally and now we're going to 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.300
 see two examples of how to put the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.020
 vertical ropes for example here 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.020
 we see one 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.690
 creative and we see how the truth remains 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.940
 that is cool enough is not like it is 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.380
 holding on is 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.850
 the wheat box 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.930
 and well here we would have the rope is the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.080
 It's really cool, as you can see 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.900
 few are simply armor 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.950
 they are holding the stick vertically 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.450
 it's worth instead of as before here 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.550
 another example 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.099
 put creative so that you see it without 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.050
 have to see the constant and good 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.200
 here is an example of a well with the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.540
 bucket with the bucket of water just does not 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.099
 would be the well with the top of the 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.030
 of the pulley and down would have simply 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.330
 a 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.140
 the rope that would hold the bucket of water 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.050
 to go up or down simply and good 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.069
 the truth is that it is pretty cool not 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.710
 so now let's show how 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.380
 do these things we go there 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:34.730
 very good guys let's see how to do 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.640
 first all the vertical that in this 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.730
 case would this rope be worth the truth is 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.670
 that this is pretty easy, good as 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.130
 all the strings really the lithium that 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.810
 we will use it will be the stick is worth the stick 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.250
 as you see simply and let's see the 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.660
 command 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.030
 I'm going to copy 12 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.760
 I'm not going to hit but of course it does not leave me 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.060
 Egyptian 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.799
 well we give it to down and here we would see the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.250
 command right now I'm going to 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.250
 leave in the description of the command to 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.250
 put it 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.180
 vertically it is worth 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.540
 that is, the only thing that you will have to 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.790
 will play with the height that the 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.570
 height would be the second coordinate that 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.030
 in this case it would be this with this 5 if 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.290
 now for example instead of 5 I put a 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.580
 -0 down would come here a little lower 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.810
 if I want to do it a little longer than 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.760
 I do then I put 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:43.670
 and minus 0.5 is worth then now I hope 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.520
 because it gives me quite net 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.790
 in this it goes faster than the button 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.100
 stone faster than wood and 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.470
 Well, as you see, every time is a 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.740
 little bit lower now for example in 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.730
 instead of 05 I put minus 1 I give and each 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.110
 time it would be lower 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.430
 we would simply have to play with 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:08.150
 this and then we would have the good the 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.360
 side that would be to join these three 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.520
 sticks what good already done directly 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.160
 and join with these three commands the 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.969
 commands the only thing they do in this case 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.650
 is to move the lateral orientation 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.590
 let's see 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.889
 here you have the command here below I'm going 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.169
 to put a little bit here very well so that 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.840
 see it in a clearer plane than if not 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.930
 you see and all this a milestone and well here what 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.440
 only thing that would change would be the position 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.460
 is the first one that would be the X if not 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:47.139
 I'm wrong 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.419
 x the only thing that would vary would be the X and 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.990
 if you want to put it upside down 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:56.140
 in different 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:06:00.030
 orientation you will have to rotate the love 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:04.750
 stand is put in rotation 90 efe 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:07.630
 and vary is this 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.300
 this coordinate the zeta coordinate in 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.980
 time of the x is worth so good 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.950
 guys this has been a short video and 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.960
 all because there was only one thing very 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.760
 basic living with few things that 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.330
 teach so I hope that I have 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:26.110
 liked how I'm going to make the videos and the 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.220
 format and the style that I'm going to use that 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.610
 it's going to be all with 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.070
 good with in this area in this little 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.890
 giant pillar I will teach the commands 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.600
 and at home I'll put into practice so 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.550
 I hope you liked it as I say 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.550
 and even other ciao
