the government can print money why
doesn't<00:00:06.620> it<00:00:06.680> just<00:00:06.919> print<00:00:07.339> some<00:00:07.549> and<00:00:07.729> hand<00:00:07.879> it

sometimes we forget what money is let's
go<00:00:19.130> back<00:00:19.340> and<00:00:19.670> look<00:00:20.030> at<00:00:20.180> why<00:00:20.450> money<00:00:20.780> was

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
go back and look at why money was
