the update clearance and the clinical

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.429 
the update clearance and the clinical
studies<00:01:35.729> were<00:01:35.909> both<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.720> prove<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.229> it

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
studies were both to prove that it

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.740 
studies were both to prove that it
worked<00:01:37.680> well<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:39.149> that<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.390> was<00:01:39.509> very

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
worked well and also that it was very

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.620 
worked well and also that it was very
safe<00:01:40.020> clearance<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.070> hair<00:01:41.340> max<00:01:41.630> laser

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
safe clearance of the hair max laser

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.410 
safe clearance of the hair max laser
comb<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.799> absolutely<00:01:44.340> an<00:01:44.939> exciting

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
comb is is absolutely an exciting

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.050 
comb is is absolutely an exciting
development<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:45.960> women<00:01:46.380> finally<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.759> they
