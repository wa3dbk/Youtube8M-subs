00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
just little strokes inward remember

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.680 
just little strokes inward remember
let's<00:02:50.680> start<00:02:50.830> off<00:02:51.130> with<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.489> word<00:02:51.690> because

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
let's start off with the word because

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.340 
let's start off with the word because
you<00:02:52.870> can<00:02:53.049> always<00:02:53.319> add<00:02:53.769> more<00:02:53.830> it's<00:02:54.640> really<00:02:55.030> hard

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
you can always add more it's really hard

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.460 
you can always add more it's really hard
to<00:02:56.350> take<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.769> away<00:02:57.569> now<00:02:58.569> take<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:58.870> blending

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
to take it away now take that blending

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.259 
to take it away now take that blending
brush<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.860> we<00:03:00.010> used<00:03:00.190> before<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:01.030> kind

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
brush that we used before and just kind

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.000 
brush that we used before and just kind
of<00:03:01.360> roughly<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.989> know<00:03:02.110> blend<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.620> out<00:03:02.769> it's

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
of roughly you know blend it out it's

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
of roughly you know blend it out it's
nothing<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:04.209> know<00:03:04.360> perfect<00:03:05.849> because<00:03:06.849> the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
nothing you know perfect because the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.780 
nothing you know perfect because the
little<00:03:07.330> strokes<00:03:07.690> we<00:03:07.959> did<00:03:08.170> already<00:03:08.980> acted<00:03:09.579> as<00:03:09.760> a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
little strokes we did already acted as a

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.979 
little strokes we did already acted as a
blending<00:03:10.480> effect<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:13.239> should<00:03:13.540> end<00:03:13.780> up

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
blending effect and so it should end up

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.620 
blending effect and so it should end up
something<00:03:14.500> like<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:15.000> now<00:03:16.000> I'm<00:03:16.269> going<00:03:16.540> to
