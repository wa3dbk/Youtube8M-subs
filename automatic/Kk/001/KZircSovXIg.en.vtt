00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
first before I go for his other stars

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.860 
first before I go for his other stars
but<00:01:01.850> sooner<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:02.879> later<00:01:03.000> you'll<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.270> seeing<00:01:03.750> him

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
but sooner or later you'll be seeing him

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.320 
but sooner or later you'll be seeing him
in<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.260> random<00:01:04.589> videos<00:01:05.129> because<00:01:06.000> I'll<00:01:06.119> try<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
in the random videos because I'll try to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.320 
in the random videos because I'll try to
go<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.740> other<00:01:07.860> stars<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.150> his

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
go for the other stars but this is his

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.350 
go for the other stars but this is his
second<00:01:09.630> attack<00:01:10.159> which<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.310> guess<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.670> OK<00:01:12.030> umm

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
second attack which I guess is OK umm

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.950 
second attack which I guess is OK umm
his<00:01:13.260> ability<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:14.280> train<00:01:14.750> because<00:01:15.750> he<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
his ability is like train because he is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.170 
his ability is like train because he is
necro<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.549> first<00:01:17.850> attack

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
necro and then this is first attack

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.469 
necro and then this is first attack
upgraded<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:21.799> then<00:01:24.710> we<00:01:25.710> got<00:01:25.920> his<00:01:26.479> second

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
upgraded and then we got his second

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.160 
upgraded and then we got his second
attack<00:01:27.720> upgraded<00:01:28.320> which<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.369> guess<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.700> ok<00:01:30.170> but

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
attack upgraded which I guess is ok but
