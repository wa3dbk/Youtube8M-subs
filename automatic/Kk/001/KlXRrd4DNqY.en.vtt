00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.590
 it's under the Californian sun valley 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.330
 loop we find patrick dempsey who 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.650
 getting ready at home sharing his 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.179
 time between sessions and paddocks 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.860
 no matter where they are the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.690
 preparation is always meticulous 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.570
 precisely today it is concentrated 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.680
 on the difficult 90 minutes work 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.680
 with his coach and justin 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.950
 yeah 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.829
 to breathe is to feel at your best 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.059
 blood takes the rhythm of the beats of 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.489
 his heart is now let go 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.739
 now you do not hear or feel 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.050
 anything having to do it again 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.559
 you will go from 150 stations 90 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.910
 probably trying to bring him to the peak 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.320
 of form and then slow down the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.610
 cadence so that they stay fresh for 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.860
 to get to the mans in good 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.210
 conditions and he will take the wheel in 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.619
 optimum conditions with a box 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.119
 of what just having to handle the postman 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.110
 stress tried to talk to him the most 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.110
 possible so that I can recover 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:44.950
 that's good 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:48.790
 cut common roof times 15.7 always 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.790
 when we know the name will do 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.380
 still a little more aggressive on a more 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.030
 long it becomes a surprise the energy 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.560
 that you put in your workouts 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.770
 is then in this moment where you have 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.179
 seen the whole story think of nothing just to 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.430
 think about reflection efforts but 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.420
 only to the importance of these efforts 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.280
 because then you find yourself in 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.599
 a situation driving the car and 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.190
 so so much emotional stress and 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.349
 physics there it is important to know 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.620
 well prepared does not go faster than 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.069
 it stays in control keeps the head 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.019
 right 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.660
 solid on the trackers for towards him the 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.190
 position it's a simulation when the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.440
 car well left then right then 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.739
 left will hold twice and yes again 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.739
 of choice 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.600
 it's its good intensity well continue 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.660
 and continue 5 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.019
 wait i think i'm stronger 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.909
 physically and mentally that I 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.909
 I was in the past I came back 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.519
 school then we will switch to 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.900
 preparation at the level of 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.849
 concentration equilibrium it's 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.900
 important also because without them 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.390
 have all those little things that you 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.980
 want to be able to work and 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.689
 especially to stay mentally strong 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.480
 it's very important to my job if 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.250
 these extreme situations but also the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.780
 hand look coordination is very 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.019
 important in the dg coalitions of 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.019
 race 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.000
 I'm going there by were good job 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.780
 m 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.780
 but 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.590
 and
