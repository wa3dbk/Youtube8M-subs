00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
that we have to start a line at about

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.710 
that we have to start a line at about
115<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.430> new<00:01:06.640> weight<00:01:06.880> room<00:01:07.090> has<00:01:07.240> tripled<00:01:07.630> in

quadrupled<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:12.130> one<00:01:12.580> of<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.820> things<00:01:12.880> that<00:01:13.210> we

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
quadrupled so one of the things that we

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.300 
quadrupled so one of the things that we
wanted<00:01:13.689> to<00:01:13.750> do<00:01:14.080> when<00:01:14.560> we<00:01:14.590> were<00:01:14.860> building<00:01:15.009> the

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
wanted to do when we were building the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
of the things that they wanted to

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.920 
of the things that they wanted to
improve<00:01:21.790> was<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:22.390> amount<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.750> cardio

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
improve was the amount of cardio

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.499

equipment<00:01:23.140> that<00:01:23.470> we<00:01:23.560> had<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.970> what<00:01:25.180> we<00:01:25.299> did<00:01:25.450> is

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
equipment that we had so what we did is

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.600 
equipment that we had so what we did is
we<00:01:25.630> upgraded<00:01:26.229> our<00:01:26.290> cardio<00:01:26.619> equipment<00:01:26.799> we

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
we upgraded our cardio equipment we

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.969 
we upgraded our cardio equipment we
previously<00:01:28.000> had<00:01:28.320> six<00:01:29.320> treadmills<00:01:29.799> we

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
previously had six treadmills we

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.450 
previously had six treadmills we
upgraded<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:30.609> to<00:01:30.819> 24<00:01:31.270> treadmills<00:01:32.310> 16<00:01:33.310> of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
upgraded that to 24 treadmills 16 of

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.520 
upgraded that to 24 treadmills 16 of
those<00:01:33.549> treadmills<00:01:33.850> have<00:01:34.240> 19<00:01:34.630> inch<00:01:34.780> plasma<00:01:35.170> TVs

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
those treadmills have 19 inch plasma TVs

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.469 
those treadmills have 19 inch plasma TVs
which<00:01:35.829> have<00:01:36.009> all<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.520> cable<00:01:37.149> channel

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
which have all the cable channel

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.419 
which have all the cable channel
channels<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.079> are<00:01:38.140> out<00:01:38.319> right<00:01:38.350> now<00:01:38.679> we<00:01:39.280> also

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
channels that are out right now we also

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.399 
channels that are out right now we also
upgraded<00:01:40.119> all<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.390> our<00:01:40.479> precor<00:01:40.899> line<00:01:41.079> went

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
upgraded all of our precor line went

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.639 
upgraded all of our precor line went
from<00:01:41.469> 10<00:01:41.799> free<00:01:42.009> cores<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.460> about<00:01:42.639> 33<00:01:43.090> cores<00:01:43.649> so

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
from 10 free cores to about 33 cores so

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.440 
from 10 free cores to about 33 cores so
the<00:01:44.920> matrix<00:01:45.310> line<00:01:45.490> is<00:01:45.700> one<00:01:45.880> that<00:01:46.030> we<00:01:46.149> really

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
the matrix line is one that we really

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.989 
the matrix line is one that we really
wanted<00:01:46.689> to<00:01:46.810> bring<00:01:46.929> in<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.829> matrix<00:01:48.249> is<00:01:48.490> you

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
wanted to bring in on the matrix is you

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:50.760 
wanted to bring in on the matrix is you
know<00:01:49.119> at<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.389> top<00:01:49.630> as<00:01:49.899> far<00:01:50.139> as<00:01:50.229> technology

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
know at the top as far as technology

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.739 
know at the top as far as technology
goes<00:01:50.950> each<00:01:51.429> one<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:51.700> these<00:01:51.880> machines<00:01:52.420> actually

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
goes each one of these machines actually

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.529 
goes each one of these machines actually
has<00:01:53.079> a<00:01:53.109> rep<00:01:53.469> counter<00:01:53.829> and<00:01:54.039> a<00:01:54.460> timer<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.060> as

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
has a rep counter and a timer so as

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.609 
has a rep counter and a timer so as
you're<00:01:55.689> going<00:01:55.840> through<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.259> you're<00:01:56.380> doing

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
you're going through and you're doing

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.379 
you're going through and you're doing
your<00:01:56.770> rep<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.429> machine<00:01:57.850> will<00:01:57.939> actually<00:01:58.270> tell

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
your rep this machine will actually tell

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:59.969 
your rep this machine will actually tell
you<00:01:58.509> how<00:01:58.689> many<00:01:58.749> reps<00:01:59.109> you<00:01:59.200> have<00:01:59.350> done<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.859> then

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
you how many reps you have done and then

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.209 
you how many reps you have done and then
a<00:02:00.100> timer<00:02:00.369> so<00:02:00.670> that<00:02:00.880> it'll<00:02:01.060> allow<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:03.009> see

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
a timer so that it'll allow you to see

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.949 
a timer so that it'll allow you to see
how<00:02:03.609> much<00:02:03.729> rest<00:02:03.999> time<00:02:04.209> you<00:02:04.329> have<00:02:04.479> in<00:02:04.600> between

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
how much rest time you have in between

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.040 
how much rest time you have in between
the<00:02:05.560> matrices<00:02:05.920> also<00:02:06.429> have<00:02:06.700> lower<00:02:07.600> stacks

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
the matrices also have lower stacks

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.960 
the matrices also have lower stacks
typically<00:02:08.979> in<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.190> weight<00:02:09.340> room<00:02:09.520> you'll<00:02:09.759> see

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
typically in a weight room you'll see

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.520 
typically in a weight room you'll see
weights<00:02:10.270> that<00:02:10.509> have<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.780> really<00:02:11.020> tall<00:02:11.200> stack

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
weights that have the really tall stack

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.650 
weights that have the really tall stack
sometimes<00:02:11.980> those<00:02:12.130> can<00:02:12.160> be<00:02:12.340> intimidating<00:02:12.660> they

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
sometimes those can be intimidating they

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.360 
sometimes those can be intimidating they
can<00:02:13.810> take<00:02:13.930> up<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.140> lot<00:02:14.260> more<00:02:14.440> room<00:02:14.680> these<00:02:15.160> have<00:02:15.310> a

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
can take up a lot more room these have a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.820 
can take up a lot more room these have a
lower<00:02:15.640> stack<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:16.330> kind<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.630> see<00:02:16.830> over

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
lower stack so you can kind of see over

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.410 
lower stack so you can kind of see over
the<00:02:17.950> horizon<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.670> next<00:02:18.910> machine<00:02:19.030> that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
the horizon to the next machine that

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.059 
the horizon to the next machine that
you're<00:02:19.569> going<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.750> use<00:02:19.810> as<00:02:20.650> far<00:02:20.860> as<00:02:20.980> our

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
you're going to use as far as our

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.770 
you're going to use as far as our
training<00:02:21.490> goes<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.940> type<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.180> equipment<00:02:22.510> that

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
training goes the type of equipment that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.690 
training goes the type of equipment that
we<00:02:22.900> brought<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.319> for<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.190> long<00:02:24.370> time<00:02:24.670> we

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
we brought in for a long time we

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.490 
we brought in for a long time we
actually<00:02:25.000> brought<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.510> demo<00:02:25.840> equipment<00:02:26.349> and

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
actually brought in demo equipment and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.930 
actually brought in demo equipment and
let<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.130> students<00:02:27.520> staff<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.700> faculty

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
let the students staff and faculty

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.089 
let the students staff and faculty
actually<00:02:28.630> test<00:02:28.870> out<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.200> equipment<00:02:29.709> before

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
actually test out that equipment before

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.400 
actually test out that equipment before
we<00:02:30.400> decided<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:30.910> what<00:02:31.090> we<00:02:31.209> chose<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.200> last

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
we decided on what we chose in the last

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.860 
we decided on what we chose in the last
so<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.069> rec<00:02:33.250> center<00:02:33.550> is<00:02:34.060> for<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.450> students

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
so the rec center is for the students

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.570 
so the rec center is for the students
and<00:02:34.960> faculty<00:02:35.410> by<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.620> students<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.160> faculty

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
and faculty by the students and faculty

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.580 
and faculty by the students and faculty
and<00:02:37.090> that's<00:02:37.840> one<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> things<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.440> we

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
and that's one of the things that we

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.790 
and that's one of the things that we
strive<00:02:38.800> for<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.280> most

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
strive for the most

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:48.300 
strive for the most
you

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310
