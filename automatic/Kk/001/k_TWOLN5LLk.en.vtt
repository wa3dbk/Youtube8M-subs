this one
I'm<00:02:30.660> going<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.900> start<00:02:31.170> out<00:02:31.320> with<00:02:32.100> many<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.730> green

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
I'm going to start out with many a green

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.610 
I'm going to start out with many a green
and<00:02:33.810> orange<00:02:35.510> so<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.750> one<00:02:36.960> little<00:02:37.140> slice<00:02:37.560> of

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
and orange so do one little slice of

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.570 
and orange so do one little slice of
green<00:02:39.710> stick<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:40.830> right<00:02:40.860> there<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.340> middle

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
green stick it right there in the middle

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.260 
green stick it right there in the middle
I<00:02:43.100> usually<00:02:44.100> cut<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.400> ends<00:02:44.640> off<00:02:44.790> first<00:02:45.120> so

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
I usually cut the ends off first so

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.630 
I usually cut the ends off first so
whenever<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.380> make<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> slices<00:02:47.070> they're<00:02:47.310> even

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
whenever I make the slices they're even

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.500 
whenever I make the slices they're even
and<00:02:48.450> then<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.380> little<00:02:49.560> piece<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.830> orange<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.520> just

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
and then a little piece of orange I just

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.000 
and then a little piece of orange I just
stick<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.840> right<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:52.140> there<00:02:52.290> like<00:02:52.320> that

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
stick it right on there like that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.370 
stick it right on there like that
and<00:02:54.290> then<00:02:55.290> another<00:02:55.500> way<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:55.800> can<00:02:56.070> do<00:02:56.220> this

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
and then another way you can do this

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.660 
and then another way you can do this
this<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.560> one<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.890> more<00:02:59.070> popular<00:02:59.250> ones

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
this is one of the more popular ones

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.540 
this is one of the more popular ones
when<00:02:59.850> I<00:02:59.880> made<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.270> for<00:03:00.480> our<00:03:00.570> birthday<00:03:00.930> party

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
when I made this for our birthday party

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.350 
when I made this for our birthday party
you're<00:03:02.550> going<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.760> cut<00:03:02.940> up<00:03:04.130> several<00:03:05.130> slices<00:03:06.030> of

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
you're going to cut up several slices of

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.870 
you're going to cut up several slices of
the<00:03:07.170> red<00:03:07.440> ends<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.250> we're<00:03:08.400> going<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:08.580> cut<00:03:08.760> them

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
the red ends and we're going to cut them

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.550 
the red ends and we're going to cut them
into<00:03:08.970> little<00:03:09.180> pieces<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.720> then<00:03:09.959> just<00:03:10.290> pile

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
into little pieces and then just pile

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.340 
into little pieces and then just pile
them<00:03:10.800> on<00:03:10.950> top<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> little<00:03:13.230> more

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
them on top and this is a little more

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.199 
them on top and this is a little more
time-consuming<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.340> usually<00:03:14.850> when<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.000> make

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
time-consuming so usually when I make

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.470 
time-consuming so usually when I make
these<00:03:15.360> I'll<00:03:15.570> make<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> couple<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:17.340> batch<00:03:17.550> I'm

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
these I'll make a couple in a batch I'm

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.670 
these I'll make a couple in a batch I'm
just<00:03:18.690> gonna<00:03:18.780> cut<00:03:19.050> them<00:03:19.110> into<00:03:19.260> little<00:03:19.470> pieces

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
just gonna cut them into little pieces

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.400 
just gonna cut them into little pieces
and<00:03:23.630> stick<00:03:24.630> them<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:24.870> top<00:03:25.940> just<00:03:26.940> like<00:03:27.030> that

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
and stick them on top just like that

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.530 
and stick them on top just like that
and<00:03:28.410> I'm<00:03:29.220> just<00:03:29.340> going<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.610> fill<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.910> up<00:03:32.540> moving

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
and I'm just going to fill it up moving

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.840 
and I'm just going to fill it up moving
on<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.890> first<00:03:35.160> one<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.430> we're<00:03:35.580> going<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.730> do

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
on the first one that we're going to do

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.310 
on the first one that we're going to do
is<00:03:35.970> really<00:03:36.269> simple<00:03:36.630> with<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.350> swedish<00:03:37.709> fish

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
is really simple with the swedish fish

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.380 
is really simple with the swedish fish
we<00:03:40.320> have<00:03:40.440> just<00:03:40.650> put<00:03:40.830> this<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.370> fish<00:03:41.640> on<00:03:41.880> top<00:03:42.150> of

cut<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.209> very<00:03:45.750> thin<00:03:46.260> slice<00:03:47.420> of<00:03:48.420> my<00:03:49.019> fruit

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.240 
cut a very thin slice of my fruit
roll-up<00:03:54.680> sometimes<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.800> have<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:55.980> run<00:03:56.130> the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
roll-up sometimes you have to run the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.979 
roll-up sometimes you have to run the
knife<00:03:56.430> through<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.700> just<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.480> make<00:03:57.660> sure<00:03:57.690> you

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
knife through it just to make sure you

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.170 
knife through it just to make sure you
cut<00:03:58.230> every<00:03:58.769> little<00:03:59.010> bit<00:04:01.820> otherwise<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:03.090> will

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
cut every little bit otherwise it will

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.100 
cut every little bit otherwise it will
stick<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:06.120> then<00:04:06.360> I'm<00:04:06.480> just<00:04:06.510> gonna<00:04:06.720> wrap<00:04:06.989> it

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
stick and then I'm just gonna wrap it

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.100 
stick and then I'm just gonna wrap it
around<00:04:08.120> this<00:04:09.120> is<00:04:09.180> definitely<00:04:09.660> one<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:09.959> the

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
around this is definitely one of the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.680 
around this is definitely one of the
easiest

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.890 

there<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:16.810> go<00:04:16.959> there's<00:04:17.500> no<00:04:17.740> one<00:04:17.920> and<00:04:18.810> for<00:04:19.810> the

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
there you go there's no one and for the

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.110 
there you go there's no one and for the
last<00:04:20.110> one<00:04:20.290> I've<00:04:20.650> got<00:04:20.800> my<00:04:20.920> two<00:04:20.980> starbursts<00:04:21.790> here

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
last one I've got my two starbursts here

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.120 
last one I've got my two starbursts here
now<00:04:23.550> starbursts<00:04:24.550> they<00:04:24.850> don't<00:04:25.590> move<00:04:26.590> very<00:04:26.650> well

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
now starbursts they don't move very well

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.730 
now starbursts they don't move very well
and<00:04:27.700> this<00:04:27.880> takes<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.270> minute<00:04:28.300> but<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.410> well

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
and this takes a minute but it is well

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.410 
and this takes a minute but it is well
worth<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.220> because<00:04:30.370> whenever<00:04:30.700> you<00:04:30.940> put<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.300> on

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
worth it because whenever you put it on

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.270 
worth it because whenever you put it on
top<00:04:31.600> it<00:04:31.780> really<00:04:32.140> does<00:04:32.500> look<00:04:32.650> like<00:04:32.710> sushi<00:04:35.280> it

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280

top it really does look like sushi it

placed the sushi just all over the cake
I<00:06:29.720> mean<00:06:29.870> it's<00:06:30.050> really<00:06:30.259> not<00:06:30.470> a<00:06:30.530> specific

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
I mean it's really not a specific

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.339 
I mean it's really not a specific
pattern<00:06:31.729> or<00:06:32.120> anything<00:06:32.330> like<00:06:32.599> that<00:06:32.660> but<00:06:33.080> as<00:06:33.199> you

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
pattern or anything like that but as you

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.839 
pattern or anything like that but as you
can<00:06:33.500> see<00:06:33.740> all<00:06:34.220> the<00:06:34.819> sushi<00:06:35.060> is<00:06:35.479> on<00:06:35.990> the<00:06:36.110> top<00:06:36.319> and

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
can see all the sushi is on the top and

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.180 
can see all the sushi is on the top and
the<00:06:37.849> sides<00:06:38.229> and<00:06:39.229> down<00:06:39.470> on<00:06:39.620> the<00:06:39.710> bottom<00:06:39.979> it's

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
the sides and down on the bottom it's

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.469 
the sides and down on the bottom it's
just<00:06:40.340> a<00:06:40.430> two-tiered<00:06:40.879> cake<00:06:42.159> so<00:06:43.159> this<00:06:44.060> is<00:06:44.210> how<00:06:44.330> it

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
just a two-tiered cake so this is how it

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:45.670 
just a two-tiered cake so this is how it
turned<00:06:44.690> out<00:06:44.870> and<00:06:45.020> I<00:06:45.110> thought<00:06:45.289> it<00:06:45.379> was<00:06:45.530> super

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680
