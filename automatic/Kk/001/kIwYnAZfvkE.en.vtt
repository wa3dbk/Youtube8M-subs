00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.450
 types 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.240
 Well you will arrive famous we are already a 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.610
 day more with the mavericks new weapon of the 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.410
 new dlc of the call of duty coast as well 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.199
 good in a start the game I've 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.459
 duel by teams because the 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.440
 new maps the truth is that there are people 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.970
 but bitch bitch so let's go 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.940
 leave it for a tad later you can 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.840
 take us somewhere villa in there 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.150
 so let's see 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.490
 we take it for granted with a low the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.490
 head let's see butt to touch 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.410
 it's higher up apparently on the radar 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.590
 it's perfect so we're not going to 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.820
 climb up a second because I do not know 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.820
 if the one above is a partner not 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.120
 now let's see the gun is worth this 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.910
 it's true that it seemed to me 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.400
 it appeared wrong the truth I like it is not 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.140
 badly the weapon goes a tad pretty 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.140
 times if you do not control it well 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.830
 but the truth is that I have a 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.830
 30 percent accuracy with this 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.830
 kid 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.060
 we're already going to see if we can get out 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.060
 the helicopter 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.770
 but I was out of here to have a 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.780
 shape of who or what a kid we are going to 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.490
 leave this and now yes 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.990
 Well, nothing, we did not take off the helicopter 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.140
 nothing happened but we killed one with the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 turret 81 to catch rockies 91 and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.560
 we keep perfect these two have fallen from 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.810
 the cute ones and I will not leave the weapon uncle 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.460
 super good 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.500
 so in fact come you're going to have a 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.750
 part of equipment that is a do 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.850
 quickies 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.560
 uy 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.479
 you have seen that always calculation of 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.119
 just bullets for each one and stopped 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.210
 shoot and that is sometimes pretty bad 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.210
 do not 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.590
 but it's good because that way you save bullets 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.760
 Take off Take off Take off 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.760
 me for me perfect 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.450
 now I have higher 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.670
 I do not know if I think the abbot to the compañera 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.670
 if we move forward we risk because 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.950
 I want to recharge to see if they leave me 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.780
 great ale s sad with that they have 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.650
 taken out the comrades kill me and another 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.209
 Once torrent kill me good 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.490
 now if we continue to advance of course 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.270
 let's go see 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.270

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.210

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.560

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.380

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.040

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.049
 in álava is perfect 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.260
 do not give a person who was to me 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.120
 position not the network ever because you have 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.639
 all of really losing 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.459
 up and down left to right by 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.470
 two sides and there is one more there I believe in the 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.760
 partner 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.760
 I do not know, we'll never know 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.040

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.440
 my mother listening he went through all 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.620

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.620
 let's go this 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.079
 the mahatma that this no thanks 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.310
 companions 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.129
 by the way I have put stable aim 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.219
 I never do it with an assault rifle 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:01.230
 but put because it 's this branch results 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.760
 as the peacekeeper of the green white 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.760
 wafer that is out outside out 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.770
 shape 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.270
 ok, my mother 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.520
 shriek way 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.370
 it turns out to me like the keeper pencil 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.370
 of white but not a true hybrid 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.480
 so we do what it's worth 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.360
 game won 34 4 I do not know why I 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.880

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.120
 is that it is fine the weapon is not 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.400
