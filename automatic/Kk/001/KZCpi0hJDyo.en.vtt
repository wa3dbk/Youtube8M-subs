some paper ruffles out of card stock
paper<00:00:13.769> ruffles<00:00:14.730> like<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.089> are<00:00:15.299> easy<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.809> make

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
paper ruffles like this are easy to make

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.410 
paper ruffles like this are easy to make
with<00:00:16.289> softer<00:00:17.220> paper<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:18.060> tissue<00:00:18.270> paper

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
with softer paper like tissue paper

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.890 
with softer paper like tissue paper
crepe<00:00:19.020> paper<00:00:19.230> or<00:00:19.590> even<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:20.010> light<00:00:20.220> weight<00:00:20.900> paper

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
crepe paper or even a light weight paper

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.410 
crepe paper or even a light weight paper
but<00:00:22.560> with<00:00:22.710> cardstock<00:00:23.310> they're<00:00:23.939> not<00:00:24.119> as<00:00:24.210> easy

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
but with cardstock they're not as easy

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.250 
but with cardstock they're not as easy
to<00:00:24.539> ruffle<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.859> what<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.010> did<00:00:26.240> is<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.869> create

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
to ruffle so what I did is to create

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.290 
to ruffle so what I did is to create
these<00:00:28.730> I<00:00:29.730> cut<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.929> 2<00:00:31.619> strips<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.309> paper<00:00:32.579> I'm

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
these I cut to 2 strips of paper I'm

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.610 
these I cut to 2 strips of paper I'm
going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> actually<00:00:33.750> try<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:33.960> connect<00:00:34.410> them

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
going to actually try and connect them

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.650 
going to actually try and connect them
instead<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.010> making<00:00:35.280> two<00:00:35.460> separate<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> cut

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
instead of making two separate so I cut

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.619 
instead of making two separate so I cut
two<00:00:36.840> pieces<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.170> paper<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.770> and

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
two pieces of paper like this and

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.180 
two pieces of paper like this and
because<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:39.809> kind<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.170> rigid<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.739> ran<00:00:41.010> it

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
because it's kind of rigid I ran it

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.450 
because it's kind of rigid I ran it
underneath<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:42.600> water<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.739> sink<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.430> a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
underneath the water and the sink for a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.779 
underneath the water and the sink for a
little<00:00:44.670> bit<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.050> got<00:00:46.640> just<00:00:47.640> so

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
little bit just so that it got just so

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.510 
little bit just so that it got just so
it<00:00:47.910> gets<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.239> little<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.960> little<00:00:49.469> damp<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> then

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it gets a little a little damp and then

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.720 
it gets a little a little damp and then
I<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.820> Pat<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.170> paper<00:00:53.010> towel<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.520> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
I just Pat it with a paper towel just to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.040 
I just Pat it with a paper towel just to
get<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> excess<00:00:54.420> off<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:54.989> not

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
get all the excess off so it's not

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.410 
get all the excess off so it's not
really<00:00:55.559> wet<00:00:55.770> anymore<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.190> don't<00:00:56.280> want<00:00:56.550> drips

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
really wet anymore you don't want drips

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.000 
really wet anymore you don't want drips
of<00:00:57.570> water<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:58.320> into<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.680> sewing<00:00:58.920> machine

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
of water going into your sewing machine

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.560 
of water going into your sewing machine
another<00:00:59.850> way<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.120> could<00:01:00.359> do<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.680> use

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
another way you could do this is to use

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.030 
another way you could do this is to use
a<00:01:03.570> spray<00:01:03.809> bottle<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.500> since<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.769> can't<00:01:05.010> find

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040

approximately the tightness that you
want<00:04:49.419> your<00:04:49.570> ruffle<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.199> about<00:04:50.830> how<00:04:51.039> long<00:04:51.250> you

want it and once you let it if you let
it<00:04:53.830> dry<00:04:53.949> like<00:04:54.460> this<00:04:54.789> it's<00:04:55.389> gonna<00:04:56.050> harden<00:04:56.500> and

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
it dry like this it's gonna harden and

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.700 
it dry like this it's gonna harden and
get<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.460> little<00:04:57.610> stiffer<00:04:58.090> like<00:04:58.900> these<00:04:59.110> examples

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
get a little stiffer like these examples

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.760 
get a little stiffer like these examples
right<00:04:59.830> here<00:05:00.960> which<00:05:01.960> is<00:05:01.990> nice<00:05:02.260> because<00:05:02.500> it

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
right here which is nice because it

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.800 
right here which is nice because it
really<00:05:02.800> won't<00:05:03.190> go<00:05:03.310> anywhere<00:05:03.729> but<00:05:04.449> right<00:05:04.660> now

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
really won't go anywhere but right now

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.590 
really won't go anywhere but right now
it's<00:05:05.080> still<00:05:05.410> wet<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:05.949> pliable<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:07.150> you<00:05:07.210> can

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
it's still wet and pliable so you can

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.529 
it's still wet and pliable so you can
either<00:05:08.070> put<00:05:09.070> it<00:05:09.190> on<00:05:09.310> your<00:05:09.789> page<00:05:10.030> or<00:05:10.240> your<00:05:10.330> craft

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
whatever you're gonna do or you can wait

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.279 
whatever you're gonna do or you can wait
for<00:05:12.699> it<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.210> harden<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.900> it<00:05:13.960> gives<00:05:14.139> it<00:05:14.229> a

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
for it to harden and it gives it a

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:15.870 
for it to harden and it gives it a
little<00:05:14.410> bit<00:05:14.650> more<00:05:14.919> a<00:05:15.160> little<00:05:15.729> bit<00:05:15.760> more

thickness<00:05:16.389> but<00:05:17.020> that<00:05:17.410> is<00:05:17.620> how<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:17.889> make<00:05:18.220> paper

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
thickness but that is how you make paper

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.320
