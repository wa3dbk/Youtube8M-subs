00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
just because it only lasts 30 seconds

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.390 
just because it only lasts 30 seconds
like<00:05:20.380> apparently<00:05:21.380> that's<00:05:21.530> wrong<00:05:21.980> because

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
like apparently that's wrong because

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.580 
like apparently that's wrong because
it's<00:05:22.820> only<00:05:23.150> 30<00:05:23.420> seconds<00:05:23.840> it<00:05:24.020> didn't<00:05:24.320> take<00:05:24.440> as

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
it's only 30 seconds it didn't take as

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.200 
it's only 30 seconds it didn't take as
much<00:05:24.710> effort<00:05:24.920> as<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.960> 30<00:05:26.960> minute<00:05:27.380> video<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:28.210> I

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
much effort as a 30 minute video and I

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.020 
much effort as a 30 minute video and I
guess<00:05:29.870> just<00:05:30.080> having<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.560> right<00:05:31.030> intentions

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
guess just having the right intentions

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.850 
guess just having the right intentions
isn't<00:05:32.420> good<00:05:32.600> enough<00:05:32.630> you<00:05:33.110> know<00:05:33.230> it's<00:05:33.470> and

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
isn't good enough you know it's and

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.540 
isn't good enough you know it's and

consistency apparently uploading for a
week<00:05:40.040> every<00:05:40.820> day<00:05:41.380> is<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:43.010> bad<00:05:43.190> thing<00:05:43.400> to<00:05:43.430> do

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
week every day is the bad thing to do

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.470

when you make money because that seems

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.040 
when you make money because that seems
to<00:05:47.720> be<00:05:47.750> all<00:05:48.050> you're<00:05:48.350> doing<00:05:48.590> it<00:05:48.680> for<00:05:49.040> I<00:05:49.750> I<00:05:50.750> did

that<00:05:51.290> for<00:05:51.320> a<00:05:51.620> week<00:05:51.830> because<00:05:52.100> of<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.490> fact<00:05:52.670> that

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
that for a week because of the fact that
