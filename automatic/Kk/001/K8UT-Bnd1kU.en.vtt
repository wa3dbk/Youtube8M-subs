soon as it's done syncing and sometimes

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.920 
soon as it's done syncing and sometimes
it<00:01:46.049> takes<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:46.530> while<00:01:47.600> okay<00:01:48.600> now<00:01:48.750> it's

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it takes a little while okay now it's

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.670 
it takes a little while okay now it's
done<00:01:50.240> usually<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.360> takes<00:01:51.420> less<00:01:51.840> time<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.140> sink

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
done usually it takes less time to sink

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.130

then<00:01:53.159> itunes<00:01:53.820> does<00:01:54.180> especially<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.990> you're

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
then itunes does especially if you're

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.160 
then itunes does especially if you're
doing<00:01:55.290> items<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.890> bulk<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.750> movies<00:01:57.750> are<00:01:58.110> a

doing items in bulk and movies are a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.770 
doing items in bulk and movies are a
toss<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.770> because<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.340> movies<00:01:59.790> are<00:02:00.000> different

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
toss up because the movies are different

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.539 
toss up because the movies are different
lengths<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.290> they<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.740> take<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.009> long<00:02:02.250> time<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
lengths and they can take a long time to
