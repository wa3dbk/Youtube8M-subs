00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
the air filter straight out it's kind of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.870 
the air filter straight out it's kind of
hard<00:02:32.040> because<00:02:32.130> you'll<00:02:32.310> have<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.520> guess<00:02:32.670> tank

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
hard because you'll have to guess tank

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.720 
hard because you'll have to guess tank
off<00:02:33.030> but<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.360> do<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.570> best<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.780> can<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.730> once

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
this it's sealed off on the end Gracie

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.620 
this it's sealed off on the end Gracie
go<00:02:57.810> over<00:02:57.900> there<00:02:58.050> baby<00:02:59.060> we'll<00:03:00.060> go<00:03:00.180> inside<00:03:00.480> how

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
go over there baby we'll go inside how

go over there baby we'll go inside how
long<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.080> then<00:03:01.620> here's<00:03:01.860> your<00:03:01.920> air<00:03:02.010> filter

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
long and then here's your air filter

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.200 
long and then here's your air filter
right<00:03:02.460> here<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.670> that's<00:03:05.670> it

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
right here so that's it

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.430 
right here so that's it
what<00:03:06.600> does<00:03:06.690> gonna<00:03:06.930> do<00:03:06.990> it's<00:03:07.080> gonna<00:03:07.200> give<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.410> a

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
what does gonna do it's gonna give you a

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.990 
what does gonna do it's gonna give you a
little<00:03:07.590> more<00:03:07.770> air<00:03:07.920> flow<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.190> your<00:03:08.430> Ducati<00:03:08.850> and

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
little more air flow to your Ducati and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.940 
little more air flow to your Ducati and
it's<00:03:09.840> gonna<00:03:09.960> make<00:03:10.170> probably<00:03:10.410> like<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> little

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
it's gonna make probably like a little

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.230 
it's gonna make probably like a little
tweaking<00:03:11.430> noise<00:03:11.580> because<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:11.940> hear<00:03:12.120> that

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
tweaking noise because you hear that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.210 
tweaking noise because you hear that
more<00:03:12.420> air<00:03:12.600> sucking<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.950> might<00:03:14.070> give

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
more air sucking in and it might give

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
more air sucking in and it might give
you<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.310> little<00:03:14.400> more<00:03:14.610> horsepower<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:15.090> don't

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
you a little more horsepower I don't

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.030 
you a little more horsepower I don't
know<00:03:15.300> but<00:03:15.540> I'm<00:03:15.630> gonna<00:03:15.750> try<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.350> I'll<00:03:16.770> let<00:03:16.950> you

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
know how it works all right well that's

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.580 
know how it works all right well that's
how<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.290> do<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.470> air<00:03:19.590> filter<00:03:19.860> mod<00:03:21.590> any

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590
