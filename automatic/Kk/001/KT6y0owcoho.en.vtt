00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.339 
started to have to have quite a few
fittings<00:00:26.359> then<00:00:27.359> went<00:00:27.570> down<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.900> line<00:00:28.109> of

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349

having crowns bridges and to the point

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.650 
having crowns bridges and to the point
that<00:00:31.830> when<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.340> my<00:00:32.550> mid-30s<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.540> was

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that when I was in my mid-30s I was

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.139 
that when I was in my mid-30s I was
having<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.230> teeth<00:00:34.559> extracted<00:00:35.149> because

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
having to have teeth extracted because

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.580 
having to have teeth extracted because
they<00:00:36.300> couldn't<00:00:36.510> enter<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> bridge<00:00:37.110> any<00:00:37.290> further

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
they couldn't enter a bridge any further

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.490 
they couldn't enter a bridge any further
