00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Hello and welcome to you 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.580
 a new tutorial in which I give you the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.870
 / part of the command will introduce you 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.760
 For example, we can use this command 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.440
 to generate such a message 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.420
 directly in the front screen 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.920
 text message and if you want it too 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.080
 directly inflict a subtitle hurt 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.090
 Everything is easy in the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.490
 we can increase the simplest new ones 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.350
 Then specify the receiver and determine 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.840
 then enter part and many text 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.250
 For example, say hello then 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.599
 here is the text part directly 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.369
 issued if we want that 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.619
 whole text consists of several words 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.450
 must also quotes here 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.300
 add and are not that on because 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.620
 for example, hello world register with 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.000
 the exclamation point and that execute 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.550
 also get hello world here 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.870
 displayed for such a subtitle 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.960
 is a bit more difficult then could 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.450
 i just / title as receiver and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.399
 sap title then enter text and the like 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.730
 make the one we are told here 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.289
 look at us hello world register 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.480
 We are told that the title 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.129
 command successfully executed 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.250
 However reappear at pretty 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.969
 that she remembers us in that one 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.949
 text only on the screen 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.540
 can pure throw with this at all 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.439
 come now if I title again 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.420
 holy moly title execute text who let 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.650
 will be subtitled here and me now 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.920
 hello world displayed because we in principle 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.049
 with the main command / title-ko limonit 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.180
 title in command general, so to speak 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.740
 have activated and everything else we have 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.270
 here at sat 1 will give, so to speak 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.979
 temporarily saved 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.390
 if now run again the command 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.340
 has been deleted there that is 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.680
 So this compartment will message 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.540
 apparently only once 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.850
 then we can cache them 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.900
 out lead again run with title 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.549
 it will be displayed once and after 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.500
 deleted again that's just how it is 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.640
 if you do that with command blog 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.170
 That's why you want to do it 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.070
 so to speak, here is a great series one 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.960
 command remain at the same time 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.430
 So, once you're done, you're done 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.200
 for that the command is executed or 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.000
 the main part is executed and afterwards 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.799
 at the same time that parting again 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.310
 then you get it all and we 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.560
 can also be titled coal moly a 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.119
 set time with times if or there 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.570
 then if you go on wheels 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.130
 to press 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.259
 we'll get him another three 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.149
 parameter queried we can with the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.289
 First specify how long the text 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.629
 needs to show for how long 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.310
 as calls extremely and subsequently 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.099
 still how long then again needs to 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.810
 hide the whole in server ticks that 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.609
 means when I enter here in 20 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.930
 this is equivalent to a value of one 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:23.439
 second if I am so for example 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.939
 want that text here now for five 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.970
 I'm supposed to put seconds in it 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.680
 five times 20,000 103 101 and if I am 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.519
 now here would like the auto-year seconds 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.319
 needs to hide 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.780
 Rego Center and if I'm here now 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.790
 / title colony the title again hello 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.970
 If you want to spend, you will see the goal 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.489
 faded in and also five seconds 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.319
 12345 should look around hide 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.900
 did it work that time I was 5 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.760
 seconds everything so far in store and you 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.799
 here ten times very briefly a very high 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.359
 For example, enter a value here 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.849
 ordinary long number and now again 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.620
 is up out the / part of the command 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.329
 of course here now in eternity 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.700
 the press to wash when I go 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.400
 I can just want / title 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.970
 then give holy moly small then the text 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.480
 away 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.409
 and if I add orstadt clear 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.090
 All that will be written in as well 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.829
 under points such as the us 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.510
 Department also that a countries themselves 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.459
 completely reset the whole can 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.780
 you also use fourteenth things eg 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.639
 for this circuit i can just hang up 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.440
 Press the button as it is me here the 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.139
 Whole always listed earth we have 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.000
 this is because it is the one 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.040
 subtitle during the command or the 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.479
 main body of device will still change 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.949
 In principle, the whole starts here 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.970
 in which I configure briefly 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.099
 how long the thing to go in and out of 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.449
 then needs to hide here 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.129
 main time over times and then executed 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:41.859
 I can command during the title 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.060
 this is five seconds in the picture in it 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.739
 the parts come or the subtitle 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.590
 I can change this here 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.150
 first specify the text earth after the 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.650
 text earth and so on and so on 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.879
 whatever I can do is to 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.310
 press for here on the button and 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.299
 that must fak the intro of 107 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.389
 tumble 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.840
 he feels unreadable texts again 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.090
 demonstrate 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.680
 After that, the text is about 107 and there 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.090
 there's another tutorial below 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.819
 yes yes from the intro of the meiners and 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.349
 the jason kidd still needs them for that 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.949
 have indeed learned just know that I'm using 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:14.530
 / part comolli title and then here and 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.879
 then text a white text but 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.529
 you can still do business with and 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.060
 effects and that can of course 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.950
 also do everything times if you are here 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.720
 wants to share instead 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.410
 enter a curved bracket and 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.080
 then put two quotation marks in text 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.340
 Come extra colon will be here then 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.600
 another square bracket one 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.400
 curved clinging curved 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.660
 bracket and square bracket after again 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.940
 Swinging brace is that 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.620
 so to speak the red and white we can 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.270
 additional parameters and specify 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.950
 you can for just the terror 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.020
 we use that one showed because 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.310
 this part in the square brackets of 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.230
 corresponds exactly to the part one also 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.760
 used teletext before for who has 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.210
 now times very briefly just once 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.980
 text colon here for example hello 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.280
 world had a momentum and that 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.460
 Whole in the color green single digits 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.020
 also example here as kate though 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.300
 that looks bad then was formal 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.120
 eg de 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.080
 Celik on crew should put everything 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.660
 I have worked 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.850
 now here the italic value in green 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.110
 displayed hunting these texts are the same 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.020
 as with the terror command I can easily 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:23.560
 quite classic from the / talk only 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:25.750
 fashion titles make an album easy holy 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.430
 moly and then the alleged speech text 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.290
 the parts in it was very normal 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.370
 displayed in the terror buffet now there 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.720
 there is still an extra back to the topic 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.850
 there is also the video 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.640
 description and the text of the teltower 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.570
 adds you just speak goeth 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.740
 all very simple I can do it 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.020
 Meanwhile, the heart now 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.340
 even more selector and objective 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.500
 if I add, for example 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.880
 wants appears to me here as 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.140
 I have reached many points 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.400
 I simply have one or flights 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.570
 objectively we are here now 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.760
 / scoreboard objectives of the 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.280
 names added by the dummy are out now 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.940
 already and I can with title 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.800
 Comolli then title go again we go with 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.020
 the klammen already unite a single one 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.700
 just look and then I just have to 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.700
 just instead of the text hello world i can 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.150
 on register 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:15.190
 your whole he is welcome in my 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.080
 Green area in which the title is still 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.130
 change a new command block and 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.910
 if my work can be satisfied 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.560
 just here 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.400
 if the other curly cling 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.370
 which we shoot right now 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.380
 so we do not forget one 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.800
 then add another curved one 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:34.370
 Put on this and there we have the 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.690
 Names of tpi should now be here 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.190
 can also be used as commune and for 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.139
 objective stop the trade topic briefly 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.840
 then copy again in the command room 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:48.320
 and then the animal caught 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.550
 the objective sect to write this 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.660
 right and i now my command 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.250
 will execute me here now 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.250
 scored points I now have 124 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.560
 meter reached I think just times 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.229
 scoreboard players said comolli the ag 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.790
 put on 204 30 then I can still 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:03.800
 run my whole and merzig 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.900
 He displayed a value of 234 have 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.210
 says how to do it with just a little
