00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.050 
down inside smash it on the Left I could
see<00:05:07.680> him<00:05:07.800> scoring<00:05:08.040> a<00:05:08.130> lot<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.280> goals<00:05:08.370> so<00:05:08.760> I'm

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
see him scoring a lot of goals so I'm

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.190 
see him scoring a lot of goals so I'm
gonna<00:05:09.180> inquire<00:05:09.450> about<00:05:09.600> the<00:05:09.780> Incredible<00:05:10.170> Hulk

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
gonna inquire about the Incredible Hulk

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.530 
gonna inquire about the Incredible Hulk
I'm<00:05:10.410> inquire<00:05:10.710> about<00:05:10.830> Rodrigo<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:11.970> Benzema

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.870 
I'm inquire about Rodrigo and Benzema
and<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.800> think<00:05:14.100> it<00:05:14.190> could<00:05:14.340> be<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.460> really<00:05:14.760> really

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
and I think it could be a really really

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.730 
and I think it could be a really really
good<00:05:15.180> look<00:05:15.510> for<00:05:15.870> new<00:05:15.990> cast<00:05:16.260> or<00:05:16.410> not<00:05:16.500> think<00:05:16.680> it

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
good look for new cast or not think it

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.810 
good look for new cast or not think it
could<00:05:16.890> put<00:05:17.010> us<00:05:17.100> in<00:05:17.220> a<00:05:17.280> good<00:05:17.400> place

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
could put us in a good place

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.460 
could put us in a good place
I'm<00:05:17.970> not<00:05:18.180> really<00:05:18.360> gonna<00:05:18.570> upgrade<00:05:18.960> our<00:05:19.080> defense
