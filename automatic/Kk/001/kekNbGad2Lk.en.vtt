all<00:00:06.670> right<00:00:06.850> we're<00:00:07.060> going<00:00:07.150> to<00:00:07.240> do<00:00:07.330> a<00:00:07.360> bit<00:00:07.540> of<00:00:07.570> a

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:07.690 
all right we're going to do a bit of a

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.780 
all right we're going to do a bit of a
macro<00:00:08.080> setup<00:00:08.410> I'm<00:00:08.740> going<00:00:08.920> to<00:00:08.980> take<00:00:09.160> it<00:00:09.340> piece

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
macro setup I'm going to take it piece

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.420 
macro setup I'm going to take it piece
by<00:00:09.850> piece<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:11.110> is<00:00:11.170> the<00:00:11.470> final<00:00:11.860> setup<00:00:12.130> right

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
by piece this is the final setup right

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.180 
by piece this is the final setup right
here<00:00:12.760> what<00:00:12.940> we<00:00:13.059> have<00:00:13.090> is<00:00:13.270> two<00:00:14.200> strobes<00:00:14.620> one

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
here what we have is two strobes one

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.760 
here what we have is two strobes one
behind<00:00:15.549> in<00:00:15.850> a<00:00:16.150> softbox<00:00:16.750> and<00:00:16.960> one<00:00:17.170> here<00:00:17.500> with<00:00:17.740> a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
behind in a softbox and one here with a

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.880 
behind in a softbox and one here with a
reflector<00:00:18.430> and<00:00:18.460> a<00:00:18.610> grid<00:00:18.880> and<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:20.350> passive

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
reflector and a grid and to passive

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.919 
reflector and a grid and to passive
light<00:00:21.070> sources<00:00:21.580> we've<00:00:21.760> got<00:00:21.910> a<00:00:21.939> reflector<00:00:22.539> here

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
light sources we've got a reflector here

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.200 
light sources we've got a reflector here
as<00:00:23.050> well<00:00:23.679> as<00:00:23.859> a<00:00:23.890> little<00:00:24.160> guy<00:00:24.400> which<00:00:24.789> is<00:00:24.910> just<00:00:25.090> a

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
as well as a little guy which is just a

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.450 
as well as a little guy which is just a
folded<00:00:25.570> piece<00:00:25.689> of<00:00:25.900> paper<00:00:26.109> just<00:00:26.259> to<00:00:26.710> to<00:00:27.130> get<00:00:27.310> rid

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
folded piece of paper just to to get rid

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.790 
folded piece of paper just to to get rid
of<00:00:27.519> a<00:00:27.640> shadow<00:00:27.910> that<00:00:28.179> we<00:00:28.330> found<00:00:28.570> so<00:00:29.289> let's<00:00:29.529> break

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
of a shadow that we found so let's break

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.790 
of a shadow that we found so let's break
the<00:00:29.949> whole<00:00:30.099> thing<00:00:30.339> down<00:00:30.519> and<00:00:31.140> life<00:00:32.140> I<00:00:32.290> like<00:00:32.500> see

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
the whole thing down and life I like see

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.520 
the whole thing down and life I like see
how<00:00:32.920> we<00:00:32.950> created<00:00:33.490> this<00:00:33.730> scene<00:00:34.080> okay<00:00:35.080> so<00:00:35.290> our

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
how we created this scene okay so our

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.889 
how we created this scene okay so our
first<00:00:35.770> light<00:00:36.100> is<00:00:36.430> a<00:00:36.820> stroke<00:00:37.329> if<00:00:37.570> you're<00:00:37.780> not

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
first light is a stroke if you're not

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.020 
first light is a stroke if you're not
familiar<00:00:38.079> with<00:00:38.440> studio<00:00:39.340> strobes<00:00:39.789> it's

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
familiar with studio strobes it's

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.690 
familiar with studio strobes it's
basically<00:00:40.420> like<00:00:40.629> any<00:00:40.809> other<00:00:41.050> flash<00:00:41.700> except

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
basically like any other flash except

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.520 
basically like any other flash except
it's<00:00:42.879> a<00:00:42.940> self-contained<00:00:43.420> unit<00:00:43.719> with<00:00:44.199> a<00:00:44.230> lot<00:00:44.500> of

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
it's a self-contained unit with a lot of

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.700 
it's a self-contained unit with a lot of
power<00:00:44.890> so<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:46.059> power<00:00:46.300> source<00:00:46.719> and<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.469> bulb

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
power so the power source and the bulb

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.740 
power so the power source and the bulb
are<00:00:47.890> in<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.070> same<00:00:48.309> unit<00:00:48.760> unlike<00:00:49.270> some<00:00:49.600> other

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
are in the same unit unlike some other

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.740 
are in the same unit unlike some other
types<00:00:50.530> where<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:51.399> have<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.910> head<00:00:52.210> unit<00:00:52.449> that

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
types where you have a head unit that

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.900 
types where you have a head unit that
has<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.109> bulb<00:00:53.350> and<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:54.100> power<00:00:54.309> source<00:00:54.670> is

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
has the bulb and the power source is

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.509 
has the bulb and the power source is
actually<00:00:55.059> someplace<00:00:55.719> different<00:00:55.989> and<00:00:56.469> so<00:00:57.160> this

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
actually someplace different and so this

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.369 
actually someplace different and so this
is<00:00:57.699> right<00:00:58.059> now<00:00:58.300> what<00:00:58.539> we<00:00:58.660> call<00:00:58.809> bare<00:00:59.140> bulb

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
is right now what we call bare bulb

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.130 
is right now what we call bare bulb
where<00:00:59.769> the<00:01:00.100> flash<00:01:00.399> tube<00:01:00.760> has<00:01:01.120> no<00:01:01.480> attachments

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
where the flash tube has no attachments

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.720 
where the flash tube has no attachments
on<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.440> it's<00:01:02.620> just<00:01:02.829> kind<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.070> blasting<00:01:03.609> out

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
on it it's just kind of blasting out

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.070 
on it it's just kind of blasting out
everywhere<00:01:04.300> so<00:01:04.930> let's<00:01:05.410> take<00:01:05.620> a<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:07.450> this

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
everywhere so let's take a with this

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.170 
everywhere so let's take a with this
bulb<00:01:08.380> pointed<00:01:08.830> in<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.100> direction<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:09.820> just

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
bulb pointed in this direction and just

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.890 
bulb pointed in this direction and just
see<00:01:10.330> what<00:01:10.479> it<00:01:10.570> looks<00:01:10.750> like<00:01:10.900> on<00:01:11.110> its<00:01:11.259> own<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:13.360> so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
see what it looks like on its own and so

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.020 
see what it looks like on its own and so
here<00:01:14.290> we<00:01:14.380> have<00:01:14.560> kind<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.100> typical<00:01:15.790> look

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
here we have kind of the typical look

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.350 
here we have kind of the typical look
from<00:01:16.299> a<00:01:16.420> bare<00:01:16.600> bulb<00:01:17.159> because<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.340> light<00:01:18.520> is<00:01:18.700> a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
from a bare bulb because the light is a

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.280 
from a bare bulb because the light is a
very<00:01:19.810> hard<00:01:20.290> light<00:01:20.590> source<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:22.170> spreading<00:01:23.170> out

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
very hard light source and spreading out

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.469 
very hard light source and spreading out
pretty<00:01:23.829> much<00:01:24.070> all<00:01:24.280> over<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.670> entire<00:01:24.790> scene

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
pretty much all over the entire scene

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.630 
pretty much all over the entire scene
you<00:01:25.780> have<00:01:25.990> even<00:01:26.380> illumination<00:01:26.829> all<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.549> way

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
you have even illumination all the way

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.700 
you have even illumination all the way
from<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.000> foreground<00:01:28.450> into<00:01:29.079> the<00:01:29.200> background

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
from the foreground into the background

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.280 
from the foreground into the background
at<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.579> same<00:01:30.909> time<00:01:31.180> you<00:01:31.479> have<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.659> very<00:01:31.930> hard

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
at the same time you have a very hard

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.310 
at the same time you have a very hard
shadow<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:33.430> can<00:01:33.490> see<00:01:33.939> that<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.479> left<00:01:34.720> side<00:01:34.990> of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
shadow you can see that the left side of

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.859 
shadow you can see that the left side of
the<00:01:35.590> product<00:01:36.070> has<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.430> very<00:01:36.820> hard<00:01:37.119> shadow<00:01:37.450> cast

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
the product has a very hard shadow cast

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.080 
the product has a very hard shadow cast
upon<00:01:38.229> it<00:01:38.380> as<00:01:38.500> well<00:01:39.100> as<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.520> shadow<00:01:39.820> that's

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
upon it as well as the shadow that's

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.999 
upon it as well as the shadow that's
cast<00:01:40.210> on<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.750> wood<00:01:40.960> that<00:01:41.290> it's<00:01:41.470> that<00:01:41.829> it's

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
cast on the wood that it's that it's

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.520 
cast on the wood that it's that it's
sitting<00:01:42.250> on<00:01:42.490> I<00:01:42.700> think<00:01:43.149> that<00:01:43.570> this<00:01:43.840> very<00:01:44.170> hard

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
sitting on I think that this very hard

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.770 
sitting on I think that this very hard
shadow<00:01:44.860> particularly<00:01:45.820> on<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.090> product<00:01:46.570> is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
shadow particularly on the product is

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.039 
shadow particularly on the product is
not<00:01:47.649> ideal<00:01:47.920> as<00:01:48.340> well<00:01:48.909> as<00:01:49.060> having<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.600> scene

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
not ideal as well as having the scene

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.139 
not ideal as well as having the scene
evenly<00:01:50.890> illuminated<00:01:51.100> all<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.729> way<00:01:51.850> through

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
evenly illuminated all the way through

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.539 
evenly illuminated all the way through
the<00:01:52.270> background<00:01:52.509> I<00:01:53.049> would<00:01:53.799> like<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.159> have<00:01:54.340> a

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
the background I would like to have a

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.639 
the background I would like to have a
little<00:01:54.850> more<00:01:55.030> depth<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.659> the<00:01:55.750> image<00:01:56.049> by<00:01:56.350> maybe

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
little more depth in the image by maybe

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.899 
little more depth in the image by maybe
having<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:58.049> tonality<00:01:59.049> or<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.590> brightness

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
having the tonality or the brightness

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.700 
having the tonality or the brightness
change<00:02:00.909> as<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.479> go<00:02:01.659> from<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.020> foreground<00:02:02.530> to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
change as you go from the foreground to

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.310 
change as you go from the foreground to
the<00:02:02.740> background<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:04.509> do<00:02:04.659> this<00:02:04.810> we're<00:02:05.079> going<00:02:05.229> to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
the background to do this we're going to

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.920 
the background to do this we're going to
put<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.560> reflector<00:02:06.219> on<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.490> flash<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:07.119> add

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
put a reflector on the flash and add

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.690 
put a reflector on the flash and add
what's<00:02:08.229> called<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.590> grid<00:02:08.830> let's<00:02:09.280> take<00:02:09.460> a<00:02:09.490> look

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
what's called a grid let's take a look

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.120 
what's called a grid let's take a look
at<00:02:09.850> that<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.780> this<00:02:10.960> is<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.170> honeycomb<00:02:11.740> grid

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
at that so this is the honeycomb grid

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.610 
at that so this is the honeycomb grid
and<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.510> see<00:02:13.750> pretty<00:02:13.960> quickly<00:02:14.170> when<00:02:14.590> I

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
and you can see pretty quickly when I

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.940 
and you can see pretty quickly when I
turn<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.160> what<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> grid<00:02:15.700> does

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
turn this what a grid does

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.920 
turn this what a grid does
this<00:02:17.879> makes<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.239> direction<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.780> light

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
this makes the direction of the light

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.050 
this makes the direction of the light
very<00:02:19.170> specific<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.950> flash<00:02:20.250> will<00:02:20.489> throw<00:02:20.790> light

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
very specific a flash will throw light

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.509 
very specific a flash will throw light
out<00:02:21.269> in<00:02:21.450> every<00:02:21.870> direction<00:02:22.099> but<00:02:23.099> when<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.340> put

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
out in every direction but when you put

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.059 
out in every direction but when you put
this<00:02:23.640> grid<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.150> front<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.660> only<00:02:25.319> very

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
this grid in front of it only very

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.640 
this grid in front of it only very
specific<00:02:26.330> angles<00:02:27.330> will<00:02:27.629> be<00:02:27.750> able<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.200> see<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
specific angles will be able to see the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.140 
specific angles will be able to see the
light<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.099> that<00:02:29.310> really<00:02:29.550> allows<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:30.030> to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
light and that really allows you to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.570 
light and that really allows you to
control<00:02:30.540> where<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.900> goes<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:32.160> that's<00:02:32.340> what<00:02:32.550> a

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
control where it goes so that's what a

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.250 
control where it goes so that's what a
grid<00:02:32.640> does<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.239> can<00:02:33.390> see<00:02:33.599> when<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.870> turn<00:02:34.110> it

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
grid does you can see when you turn it

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.190 
grid does you can see when you turn it
at<00:02:34.349> an<00:02:34.500> angle<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:36.360> can't<00:02:36.630> see<00:02:36.870> through<00:02:37.110> it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
at an angle you can't see through it

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.110 
at an angle you can't see through it
when<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.650> can't<00:02:37.890> see<00:02:38.099> through<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.849> flash

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
when you can't see through it the flash

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.780 
when you can't see through it the flash
from<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.390> light<00:02:39.690> won't<00:02:39.959> reach<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.290> or<00:02:40.980> from

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
from the light won't reach you or from

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.970 
from the light won't reach you or from
that<00:02:41.819> vantage<00:02:42.330> point<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:42.810> that's<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.620> purpose

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
that vantage point so that's the purpose

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.920 
that vantage point so that's the purpose
of<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.160> honeycomb<00:02:44.610> grid<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.510> could<00:02:45.660> see<00:02:45.810> this

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
of a honeycomb grid you could see this

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.380 
of a honeycomb grid you could see this
one<00:02:46.140> says<00:02:46.410> 20<00:02:46.769> degrees<00:02:47.099> which<00:02:47.819> means<00:02:48.090> that

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
one says 20 degrees which means that

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.479 
one says 20 degrees which means that
it'll<00:02:48.810> make<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.019> cone<00:02:49.349> of<00:02:49.380> light<00:02:49.590> that's<00:02:50.160> like<00:02:50.459> a

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
it'll make a cone of light that's like a

00:02:50.489 --> 00:03:00.600 
it'll make a cone of light that's like a
20<00:02:50.910> degree<00:02:51.239> angle

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.220 

so<00:03:01.610> I'm<00:03:01.939> really<00:03:02.239> happy<00:03:02.480> with<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.959> way<00:03:03.049> that

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
so I'm really happy with the way that

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.929 
so I'm really happy with the way that
we've<00:03:03.379> controlled<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.010> spill<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:04.700> light

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
we've controlled the spill of this light

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.470 
we've controlled the spill of this light
here<00:03:05.409> but<00:03:06.409> it's<00:03:06.769> still<00:03:07.099> not<00:03:07.400> very<00:03:07.459> hard<00:03:08.090> shadow

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
here but it's still not very hard shadow

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.449 
here but it's still not very hard shadow
going<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:09.019> this<00:03:09.140> direction<00:03:09.219> there's<00:03:10.219> almost

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
going in this direction there's almost

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.610 
going in this direction there's almost
no<00:03:10.819> detail<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.629> side<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.439> looks

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
no detail on this side and it looks

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.649 
no detail on this side and it looks
almost<00:03:12.859> menacing<00:03:13.549> and<00:03:14.269> we're<00:03:14.420> really<00:03:14.569> not

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
almost menacing and we're really not

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.050 
almost menacing and we're really not
looking<00:03:15.079> for<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.290> menacing<00:03:15.890> look<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.340> our<00:03:16.730> nice

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
looking for a menacing look on our nice

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.849 
looking for a menacing look on our nice
product<00:03:17.629> here<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.379> we're<00:03:18.500> going<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.680> add<00:03:18.829> a

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
product here so we're going to add a

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.550 
product here so we're going to add a
reflector<00:03:19.549> on<00:03:19.730> this<00:03:20.329> side<00:03:20.599> so<00:03:21.140> some<00:03:21.379> of<00:03:21.470> the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
reflector on this side so some of the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.110 
reflector on this side so some of the
light<00:03:21.769> that<00:03:22.010> comes<00:03:22.250> this<00:03:22.489> way<00:03:22.730> will<00:03:22.939> bounce

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
light that comes this way will bounce

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.360 
light that comes this way will bounce
back<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:23.959> let's<00:03:24.140> add<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:24.530> reflector<00:03:25.069> and<00:03:25.189> see

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
back so let's add that reflector and see

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:37.420 
back so let's add that reflector and see
what<00:03:25.549> it<00:03:25.670> contributes<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.359> image<00:03:36.370> okay<00:03:37.370> so

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
what it contributes to the image okay so

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.789 
what it contributes to the image okay so
here's<00:03:37.819> the<00:03:37.909> image<00:03:38.269> before<00:03:38.510> using<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:39.530> silver

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
here's the image before using the silver

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.360 
here's the image before using the silver
reflector<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.609> here<00:03:41.239> is<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:42.799> image<00:03:42.950> with<00:03:43.340> the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
reflector and here is the image with the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.270 
reflector and here is the image with the
reflector<00:03:44.060> much<00:03:44.959> better<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.709> opens<00:03:46.099> up<00:03:46.250> that

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
reflector much better it opens up that

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.460 
reflector much better it opens up that
shadow<00:03:46.819> on<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.209> left<00:03:47.510> side<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.049> product

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
shadow on the left side of the product

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.550 
shadow on the left side of the product
from<00:03:48.829> our<00:03:49.010> vantage<00:03:49.250> point<00:03:49.669> and<00:03:50.560> still

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
from our vantage point and still

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.399 
from our vantage point and still
maintains<00:03:52.129> a<00:03:52.340> real<00:03:52.639> nice<00:03:52.909> 3d<00:03:53.599> effect<00:03:54.019> we're

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
maintains a real nice 3d effect we're

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.039 
maintains a real nice 3d effect we're
trying<00:03:54.769> to<00:03:54.859> keep<00:03:55.069> a<00:03:55.310> nice<00:03:55.579> amount<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.269> depth<00:03:56.599> to

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
trying to keep a nice amount of depth to

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.420 
trying to keep a nice amount of depth to
this<00:03:57.230> image<00:03:57.590> which<00:03:57.859> makes<00:03:58.129> it<00:03:58.280> interesting

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
this image which makes it interesting

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.179 
this image which makes it interesting
and<00:03:59.120> I<00:03:59.720> think<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.139> this<00:04:00.319> adding<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.859> silver

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
and I think that this adding the silver

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.369 
and I think that this adding the silver
reflector<00:04:01.700> did<00:04:01.849> a<00:04:01.909> great<00:04:02.180> job<00:04:02.209> of<00:04:02.720> capturing

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
reflector did a great job of capturing

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.289 
reflector did a great job of capturing
some<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.040> light<00:04:04.250> from<00:04:04.459> our<00:04:04.639> strobe<00:04:05.030> and

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
some of the light from our strobe and

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.869 
some of the light from our strobe and
bringing<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:05.959> back<00:04:05.989> into<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:07.190> image<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.609> open

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
bringing it back into the image to open

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.089 
bringing it back into the image to open
up<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.150> shadow<00:04:08.540> so<00:04:09.319> you<00:04:09.409> might<00:04:09.560> be<00:04:09.590> wondering

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
up that shadow so you might be wondering

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.099 
up that shadow so you might be wondering
what<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.489> white<00:04:10.940> piece<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.209> paper<00:04:11.569> was<00:04:11.840> for

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
what the white piece of paper was for

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.599 
what the white piece of paper was for
and<00:04:12.319> it's<00:04:12.590> really<00:04:12.829> just<00:04:12.949> acting<00:04:13.250> like<00:04:13.549> a

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
and it's really just acting like a

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.580 
and it's really just acting like a
reflector<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:14.569> can<00:04:14.720> use<00:04:14.870> anything<00:04:15.139> a<00:04:15.379> white

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
reflector you can use anything a white

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.490 
reflector you can use anything a white
piece<00:04:15.799> of<00:04:15.829> paper<00:04:16.010> an<00:04:16.579> index<00:04:17.150> card<00:04:17.449> a<00:04:17.810> hand

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
piece of paper an index card a hand

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.450 
piece of paper an index card a hand
mirror<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:20.320> project<00:04:21.320> reflections<00:04:21.919> into<00:04:22.280> your

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
mirror to project reflections into your

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.180 
mirror to project reflections into your
scene<00:04:22.840> again<00:04:23.840> we're<00:04:24.409> trying<00:04:24.680> to<00:04:24.800> get<00:04:24.919> visual

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190

dynamics<00:04:26.000> for<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.330> image<00:04:26.659> so<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:26.960> thought<00:04:27.289> that

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
dynamics for the image so I thought that

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.500 
dynamics for the image so I thought that
having<00:04:27.889> a<00:04:28.130> little<00:04:28.400> something<00:04:28.909> extra<00:04:29.270> on<00:04:29.300> the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
having a little something extra on the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.360 
having a little something extra on the
product<00:04:29.900> might<00:04:30.110> be<00:04:30.139> nice<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:30.740> this<00:04:31.010> is<00:04:31.159> how<00:04:31.310> we

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
product might be nice and this is how we

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.420 
product might be nice and this is how we
did<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:32.599> left<00:04:32.810> side<00:04:33.080> here<00:04:33.530> shows<00:04:33.889> the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
did it the left side here shows the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.000 
did it the left side here shows the
image<00:04:34.820> with<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.270> paper<00:04:35.780> reflector<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.650> the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
image with the paper reflector and the

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.339 
image with the paper reflector and the
right<00:04:37.190> side<00:04:37.520> shows<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.090> image<00:04:38.360> without<00:04:38.510> this

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
right side shows the image without this

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:40.600 
right side shows the image without this
is<00:04:39.530> something<00:04:39.889> that's<00:04:40.070> a<00:04:40.159> matter<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.490> taste

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
is something that's a matter of taste

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.540 
is something that's a matter of taste
you<00:04:41.000> might<00:04:41.270> find<00:04:41.539> that<00:04:41.750> it's<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:42.050> little<00:04:42.199> bit

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
you might find that it's a little bit

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.740 
you might find that it's a little bit
distracting<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.580> have<00:04:43.729> in<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.120> image<00:04:44.419> which

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
distracting to have in the image which

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.930 
distracting to have in the image which
is<00:04:44.780> just<00:04:45.229> fine<00:04:45.500> this<00:04:46.070> is<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.310> type<00:04:46.580> of<00:04:46.610> thing

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
is just fine this is the type of thing

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.399 
is just fine this is the type of thing
that<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.210> can<00:04:47.360> play<00:04:47.570> with<00:04:47.780> when<00:04:47.990> you're<00:04:48.139> doing

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.409 
that you can play with when you're doing

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.010 
that you can play with when you're doing
product<00:04:48.800> photography<00:04:49.599> the<00:04:50.599> next<00:04:50.870> thing<00:04:50.990> that

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
product photography the next thing that

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.570 
product photography the next thing that
we're<00:04:51.260> going<00:04:51.380> to<00:04:51.440> look<00:04:51.590> at<00:04:51.830> is<00:04:52.039> adding<00:04:52.490> a

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
we're going to look at is adding a

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.990 
we're going to look at is adding a
backlight<00:04:53.380> okay<00:04:54.380> so<00:04:54.979> we<00:04:55.159> have<00:04:55.340> this<00:04:55.460> set<00:04:55.699> up<00:04:55.849> to

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
backlight okay so we have this set up to

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.200 
backlight okay so we have this set up to
be<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.150> very<00:04:56.870> very<00:04:57.289> soft<00:04:57.740> diffused<00:04:58.370> light<00:04:58.610> what

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
be a very very soft diffused light what

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.210 
be a very very soft diffused light what
you<00:04:59.300> see<00:04:59.509> here<00:04:59.840> is<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.020> we<00:05:00.320> have<00:05:00.530> a<00:05:00.560> strobe

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
you see here is that we have a strobe

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.760 
you see here is that we have a strobe
inside<00:05:01.909> of<00:05:01.940> a<00:05:02.120> softbox<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:03.080> what<00:05:03.229> a<00:05:03.259> softbox

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
inside of a softbox and what a softbox

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.680 
inside of a softbox and what a softbox
does<00:05:04.159> is<00:05:04.430> it<00:05:04.550> really<00:05:04.940> make<00:05:05.120> sure<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:05.539> the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
does is it really make sure that the

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.170 
does is it really make sure that the
light<00:05:05.870> is<00:05:06.080> very<00:05:06.349> soft<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:07.039> it<00:05:07.520> makes<00:05:07.759> the<00:05:07.940> size

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
light is very soft and it makes the size

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.040 
light is very soft and it makes the size
and<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.570> lights

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
and the lights

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.100 
and the lights
is<00:05:09.169> very<00:05:09.409> big<00:05:10.060> now<00:05:11.060> because<00:05:11.509> the<00:05:11.690> front<00:05:11.930> of<00:05:11.990> the

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
is very big now because the front of the

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.110 
is very big now because the front of the
softbox<00:05:12.560> here<00:05:12.919> is<00:05:13.069> really<00:05:13.340> wrinkled<00:05:13.879> it<00:05:14.000> could

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
softbox here is really wrinkled it could

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.570 
softbox here is really wrinkled it could
definitely<00:05:14.300> use<00:05:14.629> an<00:05:14.750> ironing<00:05:15.259> we<00:05:15.770> put<00:05:16.009> a<00:05:16.190> piece

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
definitely use an ironing we put a piece

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.909 
definitely use an ironing we put a piece
of<00:05:16.610> translucent<00:05:17.599> Plexiglas<00:05:18.319> frosted

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
of translucent Plexiglas frosted

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.249 
of translucent Plexiglas frosted
Plexiglas<00:05:19.520> in<00:05:19.759> front<00:05:20.539> of<00:05:20.629> the<00:05:20.720> light<00:05:20.870> source

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
Plexiglas in front of the light source

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.649 
Plexiglas in front of the light source
the<00:05:21.919> reason<00:05:22.310> being<00:05:22.729> here<00:05:23.120> is<00:05:23.300> that<00:05:23.479> we're

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
the reason being here is that we're

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.930 
the reason being here is that we're
shooting<00:05:23.990> it<00:05:24.110> like<00:05:24.259> f13<00:05:25.159> or<00:05:25.400> something<00:05:25.759> like

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
shooting it like f13 or something like

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.399 
shooting it like f13 or something like
that<00:05:26.180> I<00:05:26.419> don't<00:05:26.780> want<00:05:26.900> to<00:05:26.960> see<00:05:27.080> any<00:05:27.229> of<00:05:27.349> the

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
that I don't want to see any of the

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.800 
that I don't want to see any of the
textures<00:05:27.949> from<00:05:28.099> the<00:05:28.250> background<00:05:28.460> either<00:05:29.120> this

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
textures from the background either this

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.439 
textures from the background either this
will<00:05:30.020> also<00:05:30.409> serve<00:05:30.800> to<00:05:31.520> diffuse<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.270> light

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
will also serve to diffuse the light

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.499 
will also serve to diffuse the light
even<00:05:32.690> further<00:05:33.699> alright<00:05:34.699> so<00:05:34.849> we<00:05:34.970> blew<00:05:35.240> some

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:35.509 
even further alright so we blew some

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:37.330 
even further alright so we blew some
light<00:05:35.690> through<00:05:35.960> that<00:05:35.990> back<00:05:36.560> strobe<00:05:37.069> at

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
light through that back strobe at

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.460 
light through that back strobe at
different<00:05:37.879> intensities<00:05:37.970> and<00:05:38.750> let's<00:05:39.229> take<00:05:39.440> a

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
different intensities and let's take a

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.969 
different intensities and let's take a
look<00:05:39.879> this<00:05:40.879> first<00:05:41.210> image<00:05:41.449> here<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.530> can<00:05:42.740> see

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
look this first image here you can see

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.369 
look this first image here you can see
that<00:05:43.190> it's<00:05:43.669> really<00:05:44.030> evenly<00:05:44.690> lit<00:05:44.900> it's<00:05:45.139> almost

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:45.379 
that it's really evenly lit it's almost

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:47.770 
that it's really evenly lit it's almost
like<00:05:45.590> those<00:05:45.770> first<00:05:46.190> images<00:05:46.550> that<00:05:47.060> we<00:05:47.180> did<00:05:47.449> but

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
like those first images that we did but

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.629 
like those first images that we did but
what<00:05:48.050> it<00:05:48.139> does<00:05:48.349> is<00:05:48.560> it<00:05:48.710> gets<00:05:48.889> rid<00:05:49.219> of<00:05:49.250> some<00:05:49.610> of

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
what it does is it gets rid of some of

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.459 
what it does is it gets rid of some of
that<00:05:49.789> shadow<00:05:50.270> of<00:05:50.539> the<00:05:50.659> product<00:05:51.110> this<00:05:51.259> is<00:05:51.319> a

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
that shadow of the product this is a

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:55.089 
that shadow of the product this is a
very<00:05:51.710> flat<00:05:52.190> way<00:05:52.430> to<00:05:52.490> present<00:05:52.819> the<00:05:53.060> image<00:05:54.099> this

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
very flat way to present the image this

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.760 
very flat way to present the image this
way<00:05:55.340> here<00:05:55.940> the<00:05:56.449> intensity<00:05:57.080> was<00:05:57.229> dialed<00:05:57.620> down

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
way here the intensity was dialed down

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.189 
way here the intensity was dialed down
just<00:05:58.190> a<00:05:58.340> little<00:05:58.370> bit<00:05:58.639> to<00:05:59.360> give<00:05:59.569> you<00:05:59.690> kind<00:05:59.930> of<00:06:00.080> a

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
just a little bit to give you kind of a

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.189 
just a little bit to give you kind of a
multi-layer<00:06:00.830> look<00:06:01.490> you<00:06:01.969> have<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.360> foreground

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
multi-layer look you have the foreground

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.170 
multi-layer look you have the foreground
a<00:06:03.319> little<00:06:03.620> bit<00:06:03.740> of<00:06:03.830> a<00:06:03.889> darker<00:06:04.310> mid<00:06:04.490> ground<00:06:04.759> and

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
a little bit of a darker mid ground and

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.420 
a little bit of a darker mid ground and
then<00:06:05.389> a<00:06:05.780> bit<00:06:06.319> of<00:06:06.349> light<00:06:06.710> coming<00:06:07.129> into<00:06:07.280> the

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
then a bit of light coming into the

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.459 
then a bit of light coming into the
background<00:06:08.000> this<00:06:08.180> is<00:06:08.389> a<00:06:08.419> very<00:06:08.659> nice<00:06:08.900> image<00:06:09.169> I

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
background this is a very nice image I

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.050 
background this is a very nice image I
think<00:06:09.500> for<00:06:10.340> what<00:06:10.490> we're<00:06:10.610> trying<00:06:10.909> to

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
think for what we're trying to

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.740 
think for what we're trying to
accomplish<00:06:11.440> so<00:06:12.440> by<00:06:13.400> adding<00:06:13.969> a<00:06:14.060> backlight<00:06:14.569> and

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
accomplish so by adding a backlight and

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.990 
accomplish so by adding a backlight and
the<00:06:15.110> reflectors<00:06:15.710> we<00:06:16.069> got<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.279> lot<00:06:16.520> of<00:06:16.639> different

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
the reflectors we got a lot of different

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.939 
the reflectors we got a lot of different
looks<00:06:17.240> some<00:06:18.110> that<00:06:18.259> you're<00:06:18.380> seeing<00:06:18.650> right<00:06:18.889> here

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
looks some that you're seeing right here

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.610 
looks some that you're seeing right here
of<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:19.610> same<00:06:19.849> product<00:06:20.330> image<00:06:20.599> I<00:06:20.900> think<00:06:21.229> that

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
of the same product image I think that

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.649 
of the same product image I think that
the<00:06:21.770> overall<00:06:22.159> lesson<00:06:22.550> here<00:06:23.180> is<00:06:23.300> that<00:06:23.389> you

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:23.659 
the overall lesson here is that you

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.399 
the overall lesson here is that you
layer<00:06:24.080> in<00:06:24.409> lights<00:06:24.770> and<00:06:25.479> you<00:06:26.479> try<00:06:26.840> to<00:06:26.870> get<00:06:27.199> a

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
layer in lights and you try to get a

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:29.529 
layer in lights and you try to get a
good<00:06:27.710> amount<00:06:27.979> of<00:06:28.130> dimension<00:06:28.819> to<00:06:29.120> the<00:06:29.270> image

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
good amount of dimension to the image

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.519 
good amount of dimension to the image
there's<00:06:30.349> definitely<00:06:31.279> a<00:06:31.520> place<00:06:31.819> for<00:06:32.529> product

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:33.529 
there's definitely a place for product

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.640 
there's definitely a place for product
on<00:06:33.680> white<00:06:34.159> or<00:06:34.370> product<00:06:34.940> on<00:06:35.120> black<00:06:35.479> images<00:06:36.050> but

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
on white or product on black images but

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.260 
on white or product on black images but
images<00:06:37.009> like<00:06:37.219> this<00:06:37.400> have<00:06:37.639> a<00:06:37.669> little<00:06:37.940> bit<00:06:38.090> more

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
images like this have a little bit more

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.600 
images like this have a little bit more
emotional<00:06:38.779> appeal<00:06:39.440> and<00:06:39.650> narrative<00:06:40.159> and<00:06:40.400> when

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
emotional appeal and narrative and when

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.459 
emotional appeal and narrative and when
you're<00:06:40.729> talking<00:06:40.940> about<00:06:41.419> product<00:06:41.840> photography

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:42.469 
you're talking about product photography

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.830 
you're talking about product photography
you<00:06:43.009> have<00:06:43.159> brands<00:06:43.789> and<00:06:44.000> branding<00:06:44.479> to<00:06:44.599> think

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
you have brands and branding to think

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.869
