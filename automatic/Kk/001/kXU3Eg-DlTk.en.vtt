what's up guys i have a new camera now
which<00:00:03.929> means<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.560> my<00:00:04.799> videos<00:00:05.130> are<00:00:05.160> going<00:00:05.490> to

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
which means that my videos are going to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.320 
which means that my videos are going to
be<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:05.730> HD<00:00:05.940> from<00:00:06.629> now<00:00:06.750> on<00:00:06.960> yay<00:00:08.059> so<00:00:09.059> because<00:00:09.300> of

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
be in HD from now on yay so because of

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.209 
be in HD from now on yay so because of
this<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.840> guess<00:00:09.990> my<00:00:10.139> videos<00:00:10.469> won't<00:00:10.830> be<00:00:10.980> quite<00:00:11.130> as

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
this I guess my videos won't be quite as

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.379 
this I guess my videos won't be quite as
bad<00:00:11.519> well<00:00:12.389> they'll<00:00:13.349> still<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.620> bad<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.519> they

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
bad well they'll still be bad but they

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.180 
bad well they'll still be bad but they
won't<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.719> as<00:00:15.809> bad<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.590> watch<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:17.010> guess

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
won't be as bad for you to watch I guess

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.680 
won't be as bad for you to watch I guess
because<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.520> actually<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:18.000> able<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.330> see<00:00:18.510> me

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
because you actually be able to see me

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.290 
because you actually be able to see me
properly<00:00:19.279> then<00:00:20.279> again<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.789> guess<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.150> works

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
properly then again I guess that works

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.480 
properly then again I guess that works
both<00:00:21.539> ways<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.050> might<00:00:22.199> might<00:00:22.920> make<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.279> even

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
both ways it might might make it even

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.509 
both ways it might might make it even
worse<00:00:23.550> which<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.210> see<00:00:24.390> me<00:00:24.570> better<00:00:25.519> then

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
worse which you can see me better then

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.490 
worse which you can see me better then
really<00:00:26.820> think<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.300> through<00:00:29.090> ouch

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
really think this one through ouch

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.260 
really think this one through ouch
anyway<00:00:31.500> I've<00:00:31.830> been<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.099> YouTube<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.850> couple

time<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.309> did<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> Q&amp;A<00:00:35.790> video<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:37.140> I'm<00:00:37.410> gonna

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
time that I did a Q&amp;A video so I'm gonna

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.350 
time that I did a Q&amp;A video so I'm gonna
