00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.639
 parents should set an example to their 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.309
 children so they do not throw rubbish at the 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.230
 street each shell can or bottle sum and 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.689
 when they accumulate it is not only a 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.539

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.750
 support of each one and because the child does not 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.570
 teaches them that they have to raffle 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.309
 sixth because if if the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.380
 school we are already teaching that they have 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.329

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.290
