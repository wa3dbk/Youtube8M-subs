 family is flattering but he enjoyed immense 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.400
 supporting yourself at home how do you think 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.560

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.480
 the government is constantly becoming 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.629
 janovich when we were venezuela during 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:13.670
 last election was easy to notice 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.350
 one interesting thing is the mission task always 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.320
 talked about as very charismatic 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.130
 man 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.080
 and it was noticeable on the streets on 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.689
 pre-election rallies when we 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.819
 were there we saw how he behaves 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:26.549

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:29.259
 changed life and venezuela before 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.689
 he came to power venezuela always 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.359
 was considered a close ally of the United States 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.039
 the economy was built according to the western model 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.940
 desperate grew up in a very poor family and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.420
 when he came to power 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.149
 he began to carry out how he himself is 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.649
 called the Bolivarian 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.199
 revolution he wanted to bring the country 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.820
 the ideals of socialism change it 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.010
 radically strengthen the poorest 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.470
 segments of the population that on 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.710
 for many decades 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.760
 neglected he wanted to show them what they 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.180
 are of great importance for 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.910
 state which had long worked 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.589
 contrary to their interests 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.600
 he knew how to communicate with people like no one 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.929
 another for example at press conferences 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:08.810
 playing musical instruments 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.580
 remember his nine hour telethon 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.780
 of course the chest of drawers could not be 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.759
 boring 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.789
 even political meetings for example 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.009
 the last election rally 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.819
 we attended it 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.439
 the torrential rain was coming 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.400
 then was glad 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.799
 and we all knew that he was struggling with the disease 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.609
 he went up to the stage left behind guard 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:29.980
 and started dancing 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.260
 you can treat him differently but 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.050
 you could always see him alive 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.700
 man and people especially poor 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.320
 felt their connection shot the pilot 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.400
 okinawa iconostasis what it is and they went 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.000
 on the right 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.760
 saw those projects that helped him 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.650
 enlist popular support let's 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.940
 let's see the course of the dispute of all 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.490
 people who live in these slums have never 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.250
 it was possible to go to the city 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.720
 to find a job or go to school 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.020
 the path along this hill may take one and a half 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.120
 hours of public transport here 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.070
 there used to be no president hugo chavez 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.760
 build a cable car that became 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.550
 literally dear life for the poor 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.570
 Venezuela residents but not only 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.509
 cable car brought parts 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.280
 popularity 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.569
 of course, and that's what's interesting 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.090
 have you seen us come to 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.939
 slums so here venezuela is a country 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.200
 with a large urban population such 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.650
 about 30 million people about 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.079
 seventeen live in cities before joining 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.219
 an hour of power many people did not have 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.269
 opportunities just physically couldn't 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.379
 to get to the city for example to get 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.730
 work and why the cable cars were 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.889
 so important they did not have access to 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.280
 social services for example 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.639
 health distinguished built 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.290
 free clinics which for the first time 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.780
 gave people access to services 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.620
 which already used in developed countries he 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.109
 helped create an educational 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.469
 programs and program 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.989
 microfinance for example if you with 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.739
 friends want to make sewing 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.879
 production bank can give you 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.930
 money supply is much lower 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.819
 than the typical financial rates 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.579
 operations and you can create a business so 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.659
 These measures have given people new 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.340
 opportunities but also caused criticism that 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.290
 desperate uses petrodollars to 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.739
 get the support of the poor we saw 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.219
 how popular was he but 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.689
 last October election 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:15.819
 you attended 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.629
 public opinion is still divided 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.549
 barr so dual sim gang was true and although he 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.540
 won by typing about the same 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.340
 percentage of votes as she is the very first 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.149
 election 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.719
 14 years ago there was a split in society 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.219
 court thanks to social 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.759
 programs he enjoyed huge 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.750
 support for the poor 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.740
 but critics have stated that he does not create 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.520
 institutions needed for 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.400
 economic development of venezuela 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.880
 Caracas had other problems 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.240
 who partially decided his support 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.630
 even in slums for example in level 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.000
 crime has not managed to live 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.760
 about 30 million people in 2012 in 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.740
 about twenty thousand 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.370
 homicides for comparison in the usa salvation in 315 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.420
 million people that year 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.320
 recorded 12 thousand murders that is 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.650
 crime remained 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.060
 monstrous in particular 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.620
 also had to face 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.440
 problems of nepotism and corruption but such 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.239
 contradictory person he is not 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.860
 were obtained without a doubt forever 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.100
 changed the situation of venezuela and in all 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.290
 region because his work is not 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.190
 limited to venezuela he 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.739
 sought to promote his political 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.430
 course in the whole region and somehow 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.110
 you can make radical changes 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.550
 love tea messi or hate but forget 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.980
 about him impossible to bogeyman 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.340
 the official site of the white-blue he discussed 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.940
 left behind a big legacy 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.560
 thank you yushchenko thank you
