00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
middle voice that's divided between the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.970 
middle voice that's divided between the
hands<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.840> keeps<00:02:27.990> going<00:02:28.140> back<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.470> forth

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
hands it keeps going back and forth

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.710 
hands it keeps going back and forth
practicing<00:02:29.730> hands<00:02:29.970> separately<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.480> very

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
practicing hands separately is very

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.050 
practicing hands separately is very
difficult<00:02:31.310> one<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.520> most<00:02:32.700> difficult

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
difficult one of the most difficult

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.920 
difficult one of the most difficult
parts<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.989> learning<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:35.070> piece<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.400> music<00:02:35.459> is

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
parts of learning a piece of music is

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.600 
parts of learning a piece of music is
putting<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:36.989> sections<00:02:37.410> together<00:02:37.620> putting

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
putting the sections together putting

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.729 
putting the sections together putting
the<00:02:38.700> hands<00:02:38.970> together<00:02:39.209> is<00:02:39.600> one<00:02:39.900> very<00:02:40.350> difficult

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
the hands together is one very difficult

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.140 
the hands together is one very difficult
part<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.160> putting<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.550> sections<00:02:41.970> together

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
part and putting the sections together

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.810 
part and putting the sections together
is<00:02:42.480> another<00:02:42.750> very<00:02:43.200> difficult<00:02:43.650> part<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.640> with<00:02:44.790> a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
is another very difficult part so with a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.880 
is another very difficult part so with a
piece<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.270> music<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.140> complex<00:02:46.680> that

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
piece of music that is so complex that

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.790 
piece of music that is so complex that
each<00:02:47.160> hand<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.640> not<00:02:47.850> well<00:02:48.120> defined<00:02:48.390> by<00:02:49.320> itself

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
each hand is not well defined by itself

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.850 
each hand is not well defined by itself
but<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.850> music<00:02:51.360> actually<00:02:51.930> goes<00:02:52.170> there<00:02:52.739> are

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
but the music actually goes there are

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.740 
but the music actually goes there are
inner<00:02:53.040> lines<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.730> are<00:02:53.850> divided<00:02:54.420> between<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
inner lines that are divided between the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.650 
inner lines that are divided between the
hands<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.440> extraordinarily<00:02:56.010> difficult

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
hands it's extraordinarily difficult

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.210 
hands it's extraordinarily difficult
sometimes<00:02:57.660> there<00:02:58.260> are<00:02:58.410> techniques<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.010> can

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
sometimes there are techniques you can

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.900 
sometimes there are techniques you can
use<00:02:59.280> for<00:02:59.880> example<00:03:00.650> play<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:02.489> that<00:03:02.640> middle

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
use for example play just that middle

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.789 
use for example play just that middle
voice<00:03:03.090> even<00:03:03.660> if<00:03:03.750> it's<00:03:03.930> divided<00:03:04.470> among<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
voice even if it's divided among the

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.430 
voice even if it's divided among the
hands<00:03:05.160> play<00:03:05.820> that<00:03:06.090> middle<00:03:06.420> voice<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:07.110> see<00:03:07.290> what

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
hands play that middle voice to see what

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.789 
hands play that middle voice to see what
that's<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:08.600> very<00:03:09.600> fundamental<00:03:10.049> technique

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
that's like a very fundamental technique

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.229 
that's like a very fundamental technique
however<00:03:11.190> for<00:03:11.489> getting<00:03:11.730> those<00:03:11.910> phrases

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
however for getting those phrases

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.539 
however for getting those phrases
connected<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.170> sometimes<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.190> just<00:03:14.220> have<00:03:14.430> to

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
connected is sometimes you just have to

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.490 
connected is sometimes you just have to
plow<00:03:14.970> through<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.299> piece<00:03:15.540> even<00:03:16.019> though<00:03:16.350> you

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
plow through a piece even though you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.160 
plow through a piece even though you
can't<00:03:16.950> successfully<00:03:17.519> connect<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.570> phrases

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
can't successfully connect the phrases

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.949 
can't successfully connect the phrases
all<00:03:19.350> strung<00:03:20.040> together<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:21.090> for<00:03:21.269> example<00:03:21.810> if

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
all strung together so for example if

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.690 
all strung together so for example if
you<00:03:22.290> were<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.440> take<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.860> first<00:03:23.100> phrase<00:03:23.459> of

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
you were to take the first phrase of

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:31.980 
you were to take the first phrase of
this

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.980 

let's<00:03:32.950> say<00:03:33.070> you<00:03:33.190> memorize<00:03:33.550> that<00:03:33.760> much<00:03:34.090> but

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
let's say you memorize that much but

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.140 
let's say you memorize that much but
then<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.290> next<00:03:35.440> phrase<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:36.580> memorize<00:03:36.910> that

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
then the next phrase you memorize that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.240 
then the next phrase you memorize that
but<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.420> can't<00:03:37.660> put<00:03:37.810> them<00:03:37.870> together<00:03:38.250> well

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
but you can't put them together well

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.720 
but you can't put them together well
sometimes<00:03:39.910> that<00:03:40.180> happens<00:03:40.560> yet<00:03:41.560> if<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:42.220> waited

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
sometimes that happens yet if you waited

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.670 
sometimes that happens yet if you waited
for<00:03:42.880> yourself<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.480> be<00:03:43.600> able<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.900> get<00:03:44.050> those<00:03:44.200> two

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
for yourself to be able to get those two

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.250 
for yourself to be able to get those two
phrases<00:03:45.010> put<00:03:45.670> together<00:03:45.940> smoothly<00:03:46.330> it<00:03:47.020> could

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
phrases put together smoothly it could

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.960 
phrases put together smoothly it could
take<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:47.800> long<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:48.400> your<00:03:48.520> practice

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
take you so long that your practice

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.700 
take you so long that your practice
session<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:49.690> end<00:03:49.870> up<00:03:50.020> working<00:03:50.230> on<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:50.590> little

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
session you end up working on so little

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.120 
session you end up working on so little
music<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.940> here's<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.630> secret<00:03:53.470> sometimes
