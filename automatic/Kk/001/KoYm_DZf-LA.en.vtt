the bent-over barbell bro

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.889 
the bent-over barbell bro
many<00:00:05.160> degrees<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.609> why<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:05.790> like<00:00:06.089> it<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.420> then

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
many degrees is why I like it and then

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.200 
many degrees is why I like it and then
just<00:00:07.109> some<00:00:07.290> subtle<00:00:07.859> forms<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.519> contend

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
just some subtle forms we contend

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.150 
just some subtle forms we contend
technical<00:00:09.750> stuff<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.469> want<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.950> go<00:00:11.040> over

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
technical stuff that I want to go over

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.680 
technical stuff that I want to go over
and<00:00:11.309> how<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.490> do<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:11.910> properly<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.599> how<00:00:12.660> to

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
and how to do it properly and how to

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.499 
and how to do it properly and how to
perform<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.230> properly<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:13.860> obviously<00:00:14.849> it's<00:00:15.360> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
perform it properly so obviously it's a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.970 
perform it properly so obviously it's a
fantastic<00:00:16.080> one<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> building<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
fantastic one with the building of the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.189 
fantastic one with the building of the
back<00:00:17.220> strain<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:18.480> build<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.720> must<00:00:18.900> go<00:00:19.050> after

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
back strain to build a must go after

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.099 
back strain to build a must go after
that<00:00:19.730> but<00:00:20.730> when<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:20.910> comes<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.300> our<00:00:21.449> accessory

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
that but when it comes to our accessory

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.080 
that but when it comes to our accessory
movements<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.279> consider<00:00:23.699> an

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
movements and this is what I consider an

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.120 
movements and this is what I consider an
accessory<00:00:24.630> movement<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.890> choose

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
accessory movement I like to choose

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.490 
accessory movement I like to choose
exercises<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.060> are<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.480> address<00:00:27.990> some

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
exercises that are going to address some

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.089 
exercises that are going to address some
form<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.570> technical<00:00:30.570> flaw<00:00:30.810> or<00:00:31.199> imbalance<00:00:31.949> with

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
form of technical flaw or imbalance with

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.190 
form of technical flaw or imbalance with
one<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> major<00:00:32.640> lift<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.360> taking<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
one of the major lift so taking the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.590 
one of the major lift so taking the
doublet<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:34.739> example<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.489> feel<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.329> bent<00:00:36.510> over

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
doublet for example I feel the bent over

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.049 
doublet for example I feel the bent over
row<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> great<00:00:37.620> accessory<00:00:38.040> movement<00:00:38.670> to

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
row is a great accessory movement to

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.600 
row is a great accessory movement to
help<00:00:39.450> aid<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.620> deadlift<00:00:41.100> performance

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
help aid with the deadlift performance

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.330 
help aid with the deadlift performance
so<00:00:41.820> whether<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.420> weak<00:00:42.660> upper<00:00:42.809> back

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
so whether you have a weak upper back

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.889 
so whether you have a weak upper back
and<00:00:44.340> obviously<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> translate

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
and obviously it's going to translate

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.229 
and obviously it's going to translate
well<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.200> how<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.530> perform<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
well to how we perform it so one of the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.209 
well to how we perform it so one of the
things<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.079> big<00:00:49.260> mistake<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> lot<00:00:50.190> of

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
things the big mistake I see a lot of

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
things the big mistake I see a lot of
people<00:00:50.340> make<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.789> I'm<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.329> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.629> call<00:00:51.780> me

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
people make is I'm just going to call me

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.240 
people make is I'm just going to call me
here<00:00:51.989> identify<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:52.590> quickly

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
here identify really quickly

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.979 
here identify really quickly
I<00:00:53.280> don't<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.940> me<00:00:54.090> someone<00:00:54.300> unwraps<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
I don't like me someone unwraps the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.930 
I don't like me someone unwraps the
barbell<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.800> then<00:00:56.219> try<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> better

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
barbell and then try to do a better

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.420 
barbell and then try to do a better
world<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.510> way<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:57.840> feel<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:59.129> so

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
world that way I just feel like it is so

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.310 
world that way I just feel like it is so
awkward<00:00:59.670> carry<00:01:00.149> over<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> deadlift<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
awkward carry over to the deadlift and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.290 
awkward carry over to the deadlift and
nothing<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.340> wrong<00:01:02.609> way<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.059> my

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
nothing it's the wrong way it's just my

personal preference I prefer to start

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.060 
personal preference I prefer to start
from<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> floor<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> taking<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
from the floor so taking the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.830 
from the floor so taking the
conventional<00:01:08.580> deadlift<00:01:08.880> into<00:01:09.119> consideration

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
little bit stiffer so we're going to do

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.480 
little bit stiffer so we're going to do
it<00:01:59.030> here<00:01:59.360> like<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:00.500> we're<00:02:01.009> going<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.280> start

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
it here like so we're going to start

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.040 
it here like so we're going to start
with<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.670> bar<00:02:01.850> about<00:02:02.270> an<00:02:02.540> inch<00:02:02.810> off<00:02:03.020> the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
with the bar about an inch off the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.380 
with the bar about an inch off the
ground<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:04.040> we're<00:02:04.190> still<00:02:04.369> nice<00:02:04.550> and<00:02:04.580> tight<00:02:04.970> and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
ground so we're still nice and tight and

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.550 
ground so we're still nice and tight and
then<00:02:05.600> we're<00:02:05.720> going<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.869> grow<00:02:06.050> right<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.440> our

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
then we're going to grow right to our

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.170 
then we're going to grow right to our
chest<00:02:11.530> so<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:13.280> there's<00:02:13.640> not<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.850> lot<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.090> that

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
chest so so there's not a lot of that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.570 
chest so so there's not a lot of that
person<00:02:14.600> jerking<00:02:14.930> motion<00:02:15.320> here<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.769> again<00:02:16.280> not

the<00:02:16.730> best<00:02:16.940> long<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:18.140> think<00:02:18.620> when<00:02:18.739> we're<00:02:18.860> trying

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.780 
to flip the bulb little weight and won't
even<00:02:21.410> get<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.560> little<00:02:21.680> more<00:02:21.920> advanced<00:02:22.190> movement

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790
