00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
rain and so I pounded out I'm basically

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.019 
rain and so I pounded out I'm basically
doing<00:00:20.550> my<00:00:20.760> intro<00:00:21.029> here<00:00:21.270> after<00:00:21.600> he<00:00:21.750> left<00:00:21.960> but

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
doing my intro here after he left but

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:41.030 
doing my intro here after he left but
there's<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> couple<00:00:24.210> clips<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.500> did

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.430 
if we can get his headlight to actually
sit<00:01:33.300> in<00:01:33.330> there<00:01:33.509> until<00:01:33.630> he<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.960> find<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.259> set<00:01:34.410> of

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.969 
sit in there until he can find a set of
lights<00:01:34.649> for<00:01:34.890> him<00:01:36.320> says<00:01:37.320> he's<00:01:37.440> got<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> cover

for<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:41.330> just<00:01:42.330> want<00:01:42.780> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
for that one but I think I just want to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.279 
for that one but I think I just want to
see<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.440> with<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:45.289> but

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
see what we can do with that but

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.050 
see what we can do with that but
otherwise<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.069> car<00:01:47.250> seemed<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.759> take<00:01:47.910> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
otherwise the car seemed to take the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.910 
otherwise the car seemed to take the
shot<00:01:48.240> pretty<00:01:48.479> good<00:01:48.720> he<00:01:49.470> was<00:01:49.619> worried<00:01:49.860> about

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
shot pretty good he was worried about

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.279 
shot pretty good he was worried about
that<00:01:50.069> bumper<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:50.640> said<00:01:50.910> let's<00:01:51.090> leave<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:52.080> not

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
that bumper I said let's leave it if not

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.940 
that bumper I said let's leave it if not
we'll<00:01:52.440> put<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> big<00:01:52.860> 2x6<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.789> their<00:01:54.679> best<00:01:55.679> work

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
we'll put a big 2x6 on their best work

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.749 
we'll put a big 2x6 on their best work
but<00:01:57.890> looks<00:01:58.890> like<00:01:58.950> we<00:01:59.130> don't<00:01:59.250> need<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.459> Fender

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
