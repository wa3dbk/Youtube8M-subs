all glued up we're gonna done refasten

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.679 
all glued up we're gonna done refasten
it<00:02:45.400> with<00:02:45.519> screws<00:02:45.849> because<00:02:46.060> these<00:02:46.390> these

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
it with screws because these these

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.110 
it with screws because these these
woofers<00:02:47.019> are<00:02:47.140> gonna<00:02:47.819> create<00:02:48.819> a<00:02:48.909> lot<00:02:49.090> of

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
woofers are gonna create a lot of

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.080 
woofers are gonna create a lot of
pressure<00:02:49.390> inside<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:50.079> box<00:02:50.319> so<00:02:50.879> we<00:02:51.879> got<00:02:52.060> a

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
pressure inside this box so we got a

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.030 
pressure inside this box so we got a
wood<00:02:52.329> glue<00:02:52.569> here<00:02:52.870> all<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.470> pieces<00:02:53.680> are<00:02:53.890> going

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
wood glue here all the pieces are going

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.559 
wood glue here all the pieces are going
back<00:02:54.250> together

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
back together

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.559 
back together
you<00:02:55.989> could<00:02:56.140> see<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.560> screws<00:02:57.159> are<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:58.150> nails

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
you could see the screws are the nails

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.880 
you could see the screws are the nails
have<00:02:58.870> been<00:02:59.079> in<00:02:59.920> with<00:03:00.220> our<00:03:00.400> air<00:03:01.390> nailer<00:03:01.890> and

have been in with our air nailer and
we'll<00:03:03.879> come<00:03:04.060> back<00:03:04.090> once<00:03:04.450> that's<00:03:05.079> done<00:03:06.659> so<00:03:07.659> we

woofer<00:03:19.420> requires<00:03:19.870> how<00:03:20.260> long<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.760> it's<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.909> 32

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
woofer requires how long is it it's a 32

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.399 
woofer requires how long is it it's a 32
inch<00:03:22.420> court<00:03:23.290> length<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.510> total<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.569> about<00:03:25.689> 600

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
cubic inches per force per per port and

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.559 
cubic inches per force per per port and
then<00:03:30.159> what's<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.519> box<00:03:30.700> dimensions<00:03:31.329> the

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
then what's the box dimensions the

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.830 
then what's the box dimensions the
internal<00:03:32.139> size<00:03:32.950> per<00:03:33.340> woofer<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.909> mat<00:03:34.239> size<00:03:34.599> of

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.280 
internal size per woofer the mat size of
1.3<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:36.280> it's<00:03:36.400> one<00:03:36.549> point<00:03:36.849> three<00:03:37.090> cubic<00:03:38.079> feet

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
1.3 so it's one point three cubic feet

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.939 
1.3 so it's one point three cubic feet
per<00:03:38.680> woofer<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:39.879> he's<00:03:40.870> cutting<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.620> woofers

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
per woofer and he's cutting the woofers

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.339 
per woofer and he's cutting the woofers
in<00:03:42.129> right<00:03:42.310> now<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.819> he's<00:03:43.720> gonna<00:03:43.840> put<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.139> top

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
in right now and he's gonna put the top

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.409 
in right now and he's gonna put the top
back<00:03:44.379> together<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:45.129> then<00:03:45.250> we're<00:03:45.370> gonna<00:03:45.519> wrap

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
back together and then we're gonna wrap

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.009 
back together and then we're gonna wrap
it<00:03:46.660> with<00:03:46.810> carpet<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:48.540> get<00:03:49.540> ready<00:03:49.720> for<00:03:49.930> the

it with carpet and get ready for the
next<00:03:50.230> stage<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.900> is<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.260> finish<00:03:53.650> box<00:03:54.750> you

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
next stage so this is the finish box you

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.210 
next stage so this is the finish box you
could<00:03:55.870> see<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.169> ports<00:03:56.500> with<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.769> top<00:03:56.980> on

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
could see the ports with the top on

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.430 
could see the ports with the top on
there<00:03:57.459> they're<00:03:57.639> painted<00:03:57.970> black<00:03:58.150> which<00:03:58.389> is<00:03:59.260> the

there they're painted black which is the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.809 
there they're painted black which is the
reason<00:03:59.680> why<00:03:59.919> we<00:04:00.069> did<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.430> because<00:04:00.489> those<00:04:00.699> are

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
reason why we did that because those are

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.050
