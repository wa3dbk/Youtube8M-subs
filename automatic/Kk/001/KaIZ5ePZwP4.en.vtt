we showed the journey of Gabriel in the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.950 
we showed the journey of Gabriel in the
first<00:00:31.560> game<00:00:31.940> from<00:00:32.940> light<00:00:33.179> to<00:00:33.300> darkness<00:00:33.629> and<00:00:33.809> in

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
first game from light to darkness and in

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.630 
first game from light to darkness and in
this<00:00:34.079> game<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.410> go<00:00:34.530> from<00:00:34.710> dark<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.039> very<00:00:35.550> very

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
this game we go from dark to very very

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.459 
this game we go from dark to very very
dark<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.449> a<00:00:36.510> much<00:00:36.660> more<00:00:36.870> cruel<00:00:37.109> a<00:00:37.140> tower

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
dark and it's a much more cruel a tower

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.220 
dark and it's a much more cruel a tower
much<00:00:37.679> darker<00:00:38.039> Tower<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.999> think<00:00:39.269> that<00:00:39.510> you

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
much darker Tower and I think that you

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.450 
much darker Tower and I think that you
know<00:00:40.350> following<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.769> character<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.339> can

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
know following a character that you can

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.610 
know following a character that you can
identify<00:00:41.550> was<00:00:42.149> really<00:00:42.510> important<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.140> we

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
identify was really important so we

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.770 
identify was really important so we
wanted<00:00:43.859> to<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> guy<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.670> people<00:00:44.789> really

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
wanted to have a guy that people really

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
wanted to have a guy that people really
saw<00:00:45.989> Rafael<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:46.890> him<00:00:47.039> they<00:00:47.339> understood<00:00:47.730> how

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
saw Rafael for him they understood how

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.729 
saw Rafael for him they understood how
he<00:00:47.969> got<00:00:48.179> to<00:00:48.269> that<00:00:48.359> place<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.839> so<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> think<00:00:49.620> in

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
he got to that place and so I think in

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
he got to that place and so I think in
many<00:00:49.859> ways<00:00:50.070> our<00:00:50.249> Dracula<00:00:50.609> is<00:00:50.879> more<00:00:51.089> human<00:00:51.449> than

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
many ways our Dracula is more human than

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.930 
many ways our Dracula is more human than
previous<00:00:52.679> incarnations<00:00:52.769> of<00:00:53.249> Dracula

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
Dracula's motivations are to end he's

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.259 
Dracula's motivations are to end he's
immortal<00:00:58.620> life<00:00:58.949> because<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.819> main<00:01:00.089> thing

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
immortal life because the main thing

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.329 
immortal life because the main thing
that's<00:01:00.359> driving<00:01:00.629> him<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.109> game<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:02.249> know

we<00:01:22.350> specifically<00:01:22.920> designed<00:01:23.250> Dracula<00:01:23.730> as<00:01:23.910> a

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
we specifically designed Dracula as a

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.340 
we specifically designed Dracula as a
character<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.900> people<00:01:25.020> could<00:01:25.230> identify

character that people could identify

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.260 
character that people could identify
with<00:01:25.890> our<00:01:25.920> early<00:01:26.370> designs<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.850> Dracula<00:01:27.210> were

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
with our early designs of Dracula were

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.940 
with our early designs of Dracula were
much<00:01:27.420> more<00:01:27.570> kind<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.380> very<00:01:28.770> powerful

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
much more kind of a very powerful

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.610 
much more kind of a very powerful
character<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.060> wanted<00:01:30.300> to<00:01:30.360> give<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:31.050> tough

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620

what brothers brought to the to the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.729 
what brothers brought to the to the
rowers<00:02:34.390> he's<00:02:34.720> made<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:35.050> jacket<00:02:35.440> are<00:02:35.590> really

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
rowers he's made a jacket are really

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.040 
rowers he's made a jacket are really
dangerous<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:37.120> can<00:02:37.269> sense<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.630> evil<00:02:37.989> he

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
dangerous and you can sense the evil he

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.960 
dangerous and you can sense the evil he
could<00:02:38.170> sense<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.680> kind<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.280> predatory<00:02:39.670> nature

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
could sense the kind of predatory nature

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.000 
could sense the kind of predatory nature
of<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.660> character<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.560> wasn't<00:02:41.769> there

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
of the character that wasn't there

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.110 
of the character that wasn't there
before<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.610> think<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.850> really<00:02:42.940> comes

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
before and I think it really comes

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.640 
before and I think it really comes
across<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.690> that's<00:02:43.810> something<00:02:44.110> he<00:02:44.260> was<00:02:44.410> very

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
across and that's something he was very

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.130 
across and that's something he was very
certain<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.610> he<00:02:45.790> wanted<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.180> do<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:47.019> the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
certain that he wanted to do on the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.870 
certain that he wanted to do on the
voice-over<00:02:47.440> section<00:02:47.830> cuz<00:02:48.160> we<00:02:48.280> kind<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.700> wanted

voice-over section cuz we kind of wanted

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.699 
voice-over section cuz we kind of wanted
him<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.150> imitate<00:02:49.360> what<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:50.170> other<00:02:50.319> actor<00:02:50.620> had

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
him to imitate what the other actor had

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.430 
him to imitate what the other actor had
done<00:02:50.920> he<00:02:51.760> was<00:02:51.910> like<00:02:52.090> no<00:02:52.239> no<00:02:52.360> no<00:02:52.440> Gabriel

that<00:02:54.760> he<00:02:54.819> would<00:02:54.910> be<00:02:55.030> much<00:02:55.180> more<00:02:55.330> like<00:02:55.450> this<00:02:55.630> and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
that he would be much more like this and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.930 
that he would be much more like this and
soon<00:02:55.989> as<00:02:56.080> we<00:02:56.170> heard<00:02:56.319> his<00:02:56.500> performance<00:02:57.040> you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
soon as we heard his performance you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.270 
soon as we heard his performance you
know<00:02:58.090> we<00:02:58.989> realized<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.650> actually<00:02:59.830> he<00:03:00.160> was

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
know we realized that actually he was

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.270 
know we realized that actually he was
right<00:03:00.489> that<00:03:00.700> this<00:03:00.940> was<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.180> way<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:01.360> do<00:03:01.569> it

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.110 

I<00:03:05.310> am

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.750 

I<00:03:10.030> think<00:03:11.030> my<00:03:11.690> favorite<00:03:12.049> Dracula<00:03:12.409> in<00:03:12.560> cinema<00:03:13.010> is

I think my favorite Dracula in cinema is

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.190 
I think my favorite Dracula in cinema is
probably<00:03:14.090> Gary<00:03:14.330> Oldman's<00:03:14.720> portrayal<00:03:15.140> of

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
probably Gary Oldman's portrayal of

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.720 
probably Gary Oldman's portrayal of
Dracula<00:03:15.650> in<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:15.830> process<00:03:16.099> for<00:03:16.250> Coppola<00:03:16.580> film

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
Dracula in the process for Coppola film

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.479 
Dracula in the process for Coppola film
he<00:03:17.269> changes<00:03:17.750> quite<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:18.019> lot<00:03:18.230> between<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:19.340> know

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
quite you know very powerful but also

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.180 
quite you know very powerful but also
you<00:03:26.780> know<00:03:26.959> he's<00:03:27.049> gonna<00:03:27.230> it's<00:03:27.409> a<00:03:27.440> nasty<00:03:27.620> easiest

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
you know he's gonna it's a nasty easiest

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.550

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
monster and we see that really clearly I

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.380 
monster and we see that really clearly I
really<00:03:31.069> think<00:03:31.340> his<00:03:31.430> portrayal<00:03:31.819> was<00:03:32.150> probably

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
really think his portrayal was probably

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.420 
really think his portrayal was probably
the<00:03:32.510> best<00:03:32.690> Dracula<00:03:33.110> I've<00:03:33.200> ever<00:03:33.379> seen<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.769> also

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
we thought that was a bit naive for

we thought that was a bit naive for
today's<00:03:44.000> standards<00:03:44.540> but<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.470> terrific
