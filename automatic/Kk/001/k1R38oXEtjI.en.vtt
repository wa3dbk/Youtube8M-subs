mainly different level 5 in all the only

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.560 
mainly different level 5 in all the only
tech<00:03:12.019> they<00:03:12.200> know<00:03:12.380> is<00:03:12.560> just<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.160> think<00:03:14.090> hidden

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
tech they know is just I think hidden

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.020 
tech they know is just I think hidden
yeah<00:03:14.840> hidden<00:03:15.110> power<00:03:15.610> if<00:03:16.610> you're<00:03:16.820> kind<00:03:17.000> of

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
yeah hidden power if you're kind of

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.880 
yeah hidden power if you're kind of
capture<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:17.480> unknown<00:03:17.780> make<00:03:18.140> sure<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.410> damage

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
capture in unknown make sure you damage

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.370 
capture in unknown make sure you damage
it<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.070> little<00:03:19.900> just<00:03:20.900> throwing<00:03:21.140> a<00:03:21.230> football

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
it a little just throwing a football

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.130 
it a little just throwing a football
like<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:21.920> it's<00:03:22.340> gonna<00:03:22.459> it's<00:03:22.730> gonna<00:03:22.880> be<00:03:23.000> very

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
like that it's gonna it's gonna be very

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.600 
like that it's gonna it's gonna be very
unlikely<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:25.100> you're<00:03:25.250> gonna<00:03:25.340> catch<00:03:25.549> it<00:03:27.610> if

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
unlikely that you're gonna catch it if

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.490 
unlikely that you're gonna catch it if
your<00:03:28.910> ginseng<00:03:29.390> your<00:03:29.690> foot<00:03:29.840> point<00:03:30.019> a<00:03:30.110> lot<00:03:30.290> or

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
your ginseng your foot point a lot or

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.220 
your ginseng your foot point a lot or
you<00:03:30.530> have<00:03:30.860> any<00:03:31.040> Pokemon<00:03:31.459> this<00:03:31.579> level<00:03:31.850> 6<00:03:32.120> on<00:03:32.570> you

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
you have any Pokemon this level 6 on you

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.860 
you have any Pokemon this level 6 on you
can<00:03:33.380> train<00:03:33.709> very<00:03:34.100> nicely<00:03:34.400> over<00:03:34.670> here<00:03:34.940> for<00:03:35.840> a

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
can train very nicely over here for a

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.660 
can train very nicely over here for a
lot<00:03:36.019> of<00:03:36.140> level<00:03:36.380> fries<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:37.010> then<00:03:37.130> if<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.489> want

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
lot of level fries and then if you want

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.460 
lot of level fries and then if you want
you<00:03:37.730> can<00:03:37.910> go<00:03:37.970> back<00:03:38.269> up<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.720> there<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.440> the

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
you can go back up and there is the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.770 
you can go back up and there is the
patch<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:40.040> grass<00:03:40.220> where<00:03:40.579> you<00:03:41.180> can<00:03:41.299> find<00:03:41.480> level

six or seven Pokemon and they're also

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.960 
six or seven Pokemon and they're also
good<00:03:44.570> for<00:03:44.720> training

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.480 

I'm<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.180> kind<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.480> weaken<00:03:50.870> him<00:03:51.490> because

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
I'm this kind of weaken him because

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.730 
I'm this kind of weaken him because
because<00:03:52.790> mine<00:03:52.970> my<00:03:53.420> Mary<00:03:53.690> pick<00:03:53.900> up<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.080> 14<00:03:54.710> and

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
because mine my Mary pick up a 14 and

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.620 
because mine my Mary pick up a 14 and
it's<00:03:55.160> only<00:03:55.310> level<00:03:55.520> five<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:56.030> i<00:03:56.060> miss<00:03:56.300> afraid<00:03:56.570> if

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
it's only level five so i miss afraid if

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.200 
it's only level five so i miss afraid if
i<00:03:56.720> hit<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:56.930> then<00:03:57.290> might<00:03:58.130> get<00:03:58.280> knocked<00:03:58.400> out<00:03:58.610> if<00:03:59.060> i

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
i hit it then might get knocked out if i

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:09.700 
i hit it then might get knocked out if i
decide<00:03:59.510> doing<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.870> fork<00:04:00.110> ball<00:04:00.140> I<00:04:01.810> feel<00:04:02.810> ah<00:04:08.710> ok

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
decide doing the fork ball I feel ah ok

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.410 
decide doing the fork ball I feel ah ok
I<00:04:09.740> guess<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.100> couldn't<00:04:10.370> get<00:04:10.490> sour<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.150> I

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
I guess I couldn't get sour and I I

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.210 
I guess I couldn't get sour and I I
probably<00:04:11.930> got<00:04:12.140> another<00:04:12.290> one<00:04:12.590> just<00:04:12.860> to<00:04:13.040> show

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
probably got another one just to show

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.360 
probably got another one just to show
you<00:04:13.250> guys<00:04:13.520> how<00:04:14.590> it<00:04:15.590> looks<00:04:15.770> in<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.040> unknown

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
you guys how it looks in the unknown

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:24.310 
you guys how it looks in the unknown
report<00:04:17.709> recorder<00:04:22.240> yeah<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.810> can<00:04:23.990> find<00:04:24.230> a

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
report recorder yeah so you can find a

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.800 
report recorder yeah so you can find a
lot<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.500> unknowns<00:04:24.890> that<00:04:25.490> bad<00:04:26.060> hard<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.420> cut<00:04:26.600> but

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
lot of unknowns that bad hard to cut but

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.460 
lot of unknowns that bad hard to cut but
make<00:04:26.990> sure<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.290> have<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.610> plenty<00:04:28.610> of<00:04:28.700> football

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
make sure you have a plenty of football

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.070 
make sure you have a plenty of football
because<00:04:30.700> they<00:04:31.700> don't<00:04:31.910> they<00:04:32.270> tend<00:04:32.540> to<00:04:32.600> be<00:04:32.780> a

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
because they don't they tend to be a

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.250 
because they don't they tend to be a
little<00:04:33.740> hard<00:04:33.980> to<00:04:34.100> catch<00:04:34.280> after<00:04:34.490> a<00:04:34.670> while<00:04:35.050> so<00:04:36.050> if

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
little hard to catch after a while so if

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.960 
little hard to catch after a while so if
you<00:04:36.410> do<00:04:36.620> want<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.920> continue<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.610> finish<00:04:37.640> the

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
you do want to continue and finish the

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.080 
you do want to continue and finish the
puzzle<00:04:38.090> right<00:04:38.360> now<00:04:38.540> you<00:04:39.260> can<00:04:39.410> just<00:04:39.560> go<00:04:39.740> down

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
puzzle right now you can just go down
