00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
up here so originally my plans for this

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.880 
up here so originally my plans for this
space<00:03:07.330> was<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.660> put<00:03:07.810> my<00:03:07.900> bedroom<00:03:08.260> upstairs<00:03:08.500> in

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
space was to put my bedroom upstairs in

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.350 
space was to put my bedroom upstairs in
the<00:03:08.980> loft<00:03:09.130> but<00:03:09.280> once<00:03:09.490> I<00:03:09.610> actually<00:03:09.790> got<00:03:10.090> into

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
the loft but once I actually got into

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.090 
the loft but once I actually got into
space<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.810> decided<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.290> flip-flop<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.920> so<00:03:12.040> I

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
space I decided to flip-flop it so I

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.920 
space I decided to flip-flop it so I
could<00:03:12.280> really<00:03:12.640> separate<00:03:13.060> my<00:03:13.180> workspace<00:03:13.720> from

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930
