00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.710
 same job 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.720

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.700
 description first go to install 1 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.840
 fashion is 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.329
 no clouds in the sump means open it 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.450

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.990

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.360

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.720
 everybody has a different way to go into fashion 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.520
 and throw this file just here because 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.800

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.379
 about as simple as there are no clouds and all 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.870
 just do not have them in the clouds 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.260

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.040
 Maud 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:36.540

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.810
