don't love about the foundation is that

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.460 
don't love about the foundation is that

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
pump from Mac and that's probably what

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.910 
pump from Mac and that's probably what
I'm<00:02:52.910> going<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.120> end<00:02:53.180> up<00:02:53.360> doing<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.560> far<00:02:54.769> it

I'm going to end up doing so far it
hasn't<00:02:55.160> really<00:02:55.730> been<00:02:56.000> bothering<00:02:56.510> me<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.870> it

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
hasn't really been bothering me that it

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.470 
hasn't really been bothering me that it
doesn't<00:02:57.260> have<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.440> pump<00:02:57.769> but<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.760> would<00:02:58.970> really

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
doesn't have a pump but it would really

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.110 
doesn't have a pump but it would really
help<00:02:59.690> like<00:03:00.319> keep<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.799> mess<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.400> minimum<00:03:01.459> and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
help like keep the mess to a minimum and

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.640 
help like keep the mess to a minimum and
just<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:02.930> don't<00:03:03.110> really<00:03:03.230> waste<00:03:03.530> a

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
just so that you don't really waste a

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.900 
just so that you don't really waste a
lot<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:03.950> foundation<00:03:04.370> because<00:03:04.549> sometimes

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
lot of the foundation because sometimes

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.940 
lot of the foundation because sometimes
a<00:03:05.120> little<00:03:05.630> bit<00:03:05.720> too<00:03:06.110> much<00:03:06.349> of<00:03:06.560> foundation

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
a little bit too much of foundation

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.440 
a little bit too much of foundation
comes<00:03:07.130> out<00:03:07.280> on<00:03:07.549> to<00:03:07.700> my<00:03:07.819> Beauty<00:03:08.060> Blender

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
comes out on to my Beauty Blender

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.990 
comes out on to my Beauty Blender
and<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:09.709> have<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:09.980> try<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.220> squeeze<00:03:10.640> some<00:03:10.880> back

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
and I have to try to squeeze some back

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.370 
and I have to try to squeeze some back
in<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.209> bottle<00:03:11.420> because<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.660> don't<00:03:12.080> want<00:03:12.290> to

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
in the bottle because I don't want to

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.430 
in the bottle because I don't want to
waste<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:12.680> foundation<00:03:13.250> but<00:03:13.970> I<00:03:14.440> always

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
waste that foundation but I always

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.520 
waste that foundation but I always
always<00:03:16.040> apply<00:03:16.519> by<00:03:16.940> pouring<00:03:17.390> just<00:03:17.599> some<00:03:17.810> by

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
always apply by pouring just some by

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.259 
always apply by pouring just some by
pouring<00:03:18.890> some<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.190> foundation<00:03:19.580> on<00:03:20.030> my

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
pouring some of the foundation on my

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.479 
pouring some of the foundation on my
Beauty<00:03:20.569> Blender<00:03:20.599> and<00:03:21.170> then<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:21.859> just<00:03:22.100> dab<00:03:22.459> it

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
Beauty Blender and then I just dab it

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.569 
Beauty Blender and then I just dab it
onto<00:03:22.700> my<00:03:22.910> skin<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:24.200> dab<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.709> like<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:25.070> ton

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
onto my skin and I dab it like a ton

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.970 
onto my skin and I dab it like a ton
until<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.359> foundation<00:03:26.870> is<00:03:26.989> like<00:03:27.140> synced

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
until that foundation is like synced

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.890 
until that foundation is like synced
into<00:03:28.310> my<00:03:28.430> skin<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.940> then<00:03:29.299> I<00:03:29.390> just<00:03:29.570> like<00:03:29.750> to

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
into my skin and then I just like to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.020 
into my skin and then I just like to
grab<00:03:30.109> a<00:03:30.350> stippling<00:03:30.620> brush<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.370> just<00:03:31.640> smooth

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
really don't have anything bad to say

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.529 
really don't have anything bad to say
other<00:05:28.699> than<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.000> fact<00:05:29.180> that<00:05:29.210> it<00:05:29.389> doesn't

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
other than the fact that it doesn't

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.450 
other than the fact that it doesn't
bring<00:05:29.720> a<00:05:29.840> palm<00:05:30.080> but<00:05:30.530> that<00:05:30.680> has<00:05:30.830> nothing<00:05:31.130> to<00:05:31.310> do

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
bring a palm but that has nothing to do

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.580 
bring a palm but that has nothing to do
with<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.669> formula<00:05:32.090> so<00:05:32.389> I<00:05:32.690> would<00:05:33.199> definitely

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590
