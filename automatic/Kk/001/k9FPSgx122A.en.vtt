00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.230
 I was lucky but already doing 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.420
 paragliding here a few years 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 exactly 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.900
 on the glacier I made his parachute 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.850
 I also did a bungee jump 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.690
 tests of very strong sensations that me 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.690
 please a lot 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.600
 and 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.470
 at least 4000 meters here we wholesale 45 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.210
 seconds of freefall 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.280
 that's what counts a speed 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.290
 approximate as I saw on the ad 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.520
 at the service we are at about 226 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.900
 about the same if you go to 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.440
 find in that position there in 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.059
 free fall 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.040
 devaux - and then we will give a 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.370
 slap on the shoulders and simply kill 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.370
 on the 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.910
 we know that once in the plane and at 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.370
 moment of jumping we can become very 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.080
 nervous in any case that's the nervousness 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.170
 rises more nervous at the beginning of a match 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.880
 or at the beginning of a jump it depends on that 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.409
 will depend it's clear that we're going up in 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.610
 the plane today I think I'm going 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.409
 to be very nervous that's for sure but 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.150
 it's also something that I like 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.150
 it's a nervousness that is very good 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.030
 for us the goal is that it is a beautiful 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.650
 jump it's not our sauce is his 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.759
 so we will do everything so that you 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.470
 to be good so that they are 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.060
 calm so they are relaxed site 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.040
 is relaxed with your confidence at least 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.430
 the jump will go well and you 'll be 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.430
 not sick 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.340
 a rather incredible pressure rise 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.200
 I really love it I enjoyed it all 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.640
 once we're going to jump we say more 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.770
 nothing and we focus well anyway 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.850
 me personally after the descent 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.850
 is just mind-blowing
