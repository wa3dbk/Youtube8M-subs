drives but really black and green are
pretty<00:00:06.089> popular<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:06.720> today's<00:00:06.899> market<00:00:07.560> so

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
pretty popular in today's market so

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:21.760 
pretty popular in today's market so
which<00:00:08.490> ones<00:00:08.730> better

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.620 

today<00:00:22.340> I'm<00:00:22.400> seeking<00:00:22.670> water<00:00:22.970> I<00:00:23.060> went<00:00:23.300> out<00:00:23.449> and

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
today I'm seeking water I went out and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.359 
today I'm seeking water I went out and
got<00:00:23.690> a<00:00:23.750> flash<00:00:24.020> drive<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:24.650> grain<00:00:24.920> drive<00:00:25.189> now

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
got a flash drive and a grain drive now

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.070 
got a flash drive and a grain drive now
these<00:00:25.580> are<00:00:25.820> obviously<00:00:26.180> not<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:26.539> latest<00:00:26.720> ones

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
these are obviously not the latest ones

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.960 
these are obviously not the latest ones
as<00:00:27.260> I<00:00:27.349> hope<00:00:27.590> one<00:00:28.160> of<00:00:28.189> them<00:00:28.310> upside<00:00:28.760> down

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
as I hope one of them upside down

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.420 
as I hope one of them upside down
because<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.349> black<00:00:30.590> drives<00:00:30.860> now<00:00:31.040> have<00:00:31.220> big

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
because the black drives now have big

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.770 
because the black drives now have big
black<00:00:31.640> stickers<00:00:32.029> on<00:00:32.150> them<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.629> green

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
black stickers on them and the green

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.110 
black stickers on them and the green
drives<00:00:32.960> have<00:00:33.200> more<00:00:33.410> green<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:33.980> yes<00:00:34.550> this<00:00:34.760> is<00:00:34.940> an

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
drives have more green so yes this is an

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.490 
drives have more green so yes this is an
older<00:00:35.390> version<00:00:35.510> but<00:00:35.809> there's<00:00:36.020> still<00:00:36.200> black

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
older version but there's still black

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.960 
older version but there's still black
drives<00:00:36.770> angry<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.309> drives<00:00:37.489> running<00:00:37.879> at

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
drives angry and drives running at

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.759 
drives angry and drives running at
roughly<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.330> same<00:00:38.449> spec<00:00:38.930> as<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.410> new<00:00:39.559> ones

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
roughly the same spec as the new ones

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.189 
roughly the same spec as the new ones
now<00:00:40.280> also<00:00:40.550> true<00:00:40.910> we<00:00:41.030> chucked<00:00:41.300> in<00:00:41.420> an<00:00:41.540> SSD<00:00:41.900> is

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
now also true we chucked in an SSD is

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.500 
now also true we chucked in an SSD is
sort<00:00:42.410> of<00:00:42.470> a<00:00:42.590> comparison<00:00:42.949> and<00:00:43.400> found<00:00:44.239> that

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
sort of a comparison and found that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.240 
sort of a comparison and found that
there's<00:00:44.720> not<00:00:44.900> even<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:45.260> point<00:00:45.470> in<00:00:45.739> making<00:00:45.949> a

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
there's not even a point in making a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.900 
there's not even a point in making a
graph<00:00:46.489> now<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.120> WD<00:00:47.690> blacks<00:00:48.019> run<00:00:48.290> at<00:00:48.410> 7,200<00:00:49.400> rpm

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
graph now the WD blacks run at 7,200 rpm

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.420 
graph now the WD blacks run at 7,200 rpm
and<00:00:50.089> the<00:00:50.239> WD<00:00:50.660> greens<00:00:50.960> run<00:00:51.199> at<00:00:51.970> 5200<00:00:52.970> rpm<00:00:53.570> and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
and the WD greens run at 5200 rpm and

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.369 
and the WD greens run at 5200 rpm and
theoretically<00:00:55.430> in<00:00:55.729> benchmarks<00:00:56.390> yes<00:00:56.659> the<00:00:56.989> WD

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
theoretically in benchmarks yes the WD

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.079 
theoretically in benchmarks yes the WD
black<00:00:57.620> does<00:00:57.890> crush<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.460> grain<00:00:58.699> but<00:00:58.970> in

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
black does crush the grain but in

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.210 
black does crush the grain but in
day-to-day<00:00:59.269> use<00:00:59.839> there's<00:01:00.500> kind<00:01:00.860> of<00:01:00.979> not<00:01:01.190> that

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
day-to-day use there's kind of not that

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.219 
day-to-day use there's kind of not that
much<00:01:01.610> difference<00:01:02.180> now<00:01:02.269> I<00:01:02.390> did<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.629> few<00:01:02.869> things<00:01:03.080> I

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
much difference now I did a few things I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.109 
much difference now I did a few things I
installed<00:01:03.589> an<00:01:03.680> OS<00:01:03.979> on<00:01:04.159> both<00:01:04.339> these<00:01:04.519> drives<00:01:04.879> and

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
installed an OS on both these drives and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.680 
installed an OS on both these drives and
I<00:01:05.750> booted<00:01:06.140> up<00:01:06.290> games<00:01:06.619> I<00:01:06.920> ran<00:01:07.159> payday<00:01:07.490> 2<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:08.000> ran

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
I booted up games I ran payday 2 I ran

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.590 
I booted up games I ran payday 2 I ran
Just<00:01:08.930> Cause<00:01:09.049> 2<00:01:09.560> basically<00:01:10.400> my<00:01:10.640> main<00:01:10.790> suite<00:01:11.420> of

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
Just Cause 2 basically my main suite of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.630 
Just Cause 2 basically my main suite of
games<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.140> I<00:01:12.200> have<00:01:12.409> on<00:01:12.560> my<00:01:12.590> Steam<00:01:13.040> library<00:01:13.070> so

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
games that I have on my Steam library so

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.859 
games that I have on my Steam library so
if<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:13.820> do<00:01:13.970> know<00:01:14.090> what<00:01:14.240> they<00:01:14.360> are<00:01:14.510> then<00:01:14.720> I

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
if you do know what they are then I

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.140 
if you do know what they are then I
basically<00:01:15.530> ran<00:01:15.770> all<00:01:16.040> of<00:01:16.189> them<00:01:16.340> yes<00:01:16.610> it<00:01:16.790> did<00:01:16.939> use

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
basically ran all of them yes it did use

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.520 
basically ran all of them yes it did use
a<00:01:17.180> lot<00:01:17.270> Internet<00:01:17.840> to<00:01:17.930> download<00:01:18.080> but<00:01:18.380> that's

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
a lot Internet to download but that's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.179 
a lot Internet to download but that's
not<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.830> point

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
not the point

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.580 
not the point
so<00:01:19.340> each<00:01:20.210> of<00:01:20.450> these<00:01:20.600> drives<00:01:20.900> one<00:01:21.200> terabyte

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
so each of these drives one terabyte

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.910 
so each of these drives one terabyte
each<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:22.159> loaded<00:01:23.090> them<00:01:23.270> up<00:01:23.420> I<00:01:23.630> ran<00:01:24.080> them<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.500> for

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
each I loaded them up I ran them and for

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.999 
each I loaded them up I ran them and for
me<00:01:25.010> using<00:01:25.400> four<00:01:26.030> SSDs<00:01:26.539> in<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.810> raid<00:01:26.960> zero<00:01:27.259> it<00:01:27.530> was

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
me using four SSDs in a raid zero it was

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.069 
me using four SSDs in a raid zero it was
slower<00:01:28.429> for<00:01:28.700> me<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.000> move<00:01:29.179> to<00:01:29.509> one<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.929> these

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
slower for me to move to one of these

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.830 
slower for me to move to one of these
drives<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:30.679> to<00:01:31.250> be<00:01:31.399> honest<00:01:31.670> with<00:01:31.789> you<00:01:32.000> if<00:01:32.600> I

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
drives but to be honest with you if I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.779 
drives but to be honest with you if I
did<00:01:33.049> a<00:01:33.079> blind<00:01:33.469> test<00:01:33.829> like<00:01:34.159> someone<00:01:34.759> just

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
did a blind test like someone just

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.580 
did a blind test like someone just
disconnected<00:01:35.780> one<00:01:35.929> of<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.049> drives<00:01:36.289> and<00:01:36.439> we

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
disconnected one of the drives and we

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.080 
disconnected one of the drives and we
booted<00:01:36.859> off<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.039> other<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.369> could<00:01:37.579> not<00:01:37.759> tell

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
booted off the other I could not tell

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.550 
booted off the other I could not tell
you<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.329> difference<00:01:38.719> now<00:01:38.899> I<00:01:38.929> did<00:01:39.140> also<00:01:39.259> do

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
you the difference now I did also do

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.580 
you the difference now I did also do
some<00:01:39.770> time<00:01:40.340> tests<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:40.999> did<00:01:41.329> a<00:01:41.509> two<00:01:41.960> gigabyte

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
some time tests I did a two gigabyte

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.950 
some time tests I did a two gigabyte
file<00:01:43.100> duplication<00:01:44.090> on<00:01:44.179> each<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.539> these<00:01:44.630> drives

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
file duplication on each of these drives

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.499 
file duplication on each of these drives
and<00:01:45.200> there<00:01:45.799> were<00:01:45.920> only<00:01:46.130> about<00:01:46.549> 5<00:01:46.969> seconds

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
and there were only about 5 seconds

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.810 
and there were only about 5 seconds
difference<00:01:47.840> with<00:01:48.289> each<00:01:48.439> other<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.070> that<00:01:49.310> was<00:01:49.789> a

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
difference with each other so that was a

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.760 
difference with each other so that was a
bit<00:01:50.060> there<00:01:50.090> now<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.689> WD<00:01:51.229> greens<00:01:51.560> are

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
bit there now the WD greens are

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.800 
bit there now the WD greens are
supposedly<00:01:52.460> meant<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.759> save<00:01:52.999> power<00:01:53.329> and<00:01:53.539> stuff

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
supposedly meant to save power and stuff

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.660 
supposedly meant to save power and stuff
and<00:01:53.990> that<00:01:54.319> would<00:01:54.560> make<00:01:54.740> sense<00:01:55.009> if<00:01:55.280> there<00:01:55.490> is<00:01:55.640> a

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
and that would make sense if there is a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.179 
and that would make sense if there is a
lot<00:01:55.969> of<00:01:56.179> them<00:01:56.359> but<00:01:56.689> for<00:01:56.899> me<00:01:57.079> I<00:01:57.380> noticed<00:01:57.679> not

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
lot of them but for me I noticed not

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.160 
lot of them but for me I noticed not
even<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.549> lot<00:01:58.819> of<00:01:59.090> difference<00:01:59.539> on<00:01:59.719> my<00:01:59.749> power

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
even a lot of difference on my power

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.489 
even a lot of difference on my power
meter<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:01.390> don't<00:02:02.390> really<00:02:02.749> know<00:02:02.960> how<00:02:03.200> much<00:02:03.350> of

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:03.499 
meter so I don't really know how much of

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.429 
meter so I don't really know how much of
a<00:02:03.590> saving<00:02:03.950> they<00:02:04.069> bring<00:02:04.340> but<00:02:04.609> yeah<00:02:05.450> now<00:02:06.079> on<00:02:06.319> to

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
a saving they bring but yeah now on to

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.290 
a saving they bring but yeah now on to
our<00:02:06.469> SSD<00:02:06.920> comparison<00:02:07.639> of<00:02:07.759> course<00:02:08.060> it's

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
our SSD comparison of course it's

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.880 
our SSD comparison of course it's
lightning<00:02:08.720> fast<00:02:08.750> compared<00:02:09.319> to<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.710> was

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
lightning fast compared to that it was

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.940 
lightning fast compared to that it was
seconds<00:02:10.759> faster<00:02:11.240> than<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:12.110> two<00:02:12.410> mechanical

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
seconds faster than the two mechanical

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.670 
seconds faster than the two mechanical
drives<00:02:13.190> on<00:02:13.430> data<00:02:13.790> duplication<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.930> again

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
drives on data duplication so again

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.050 
drives on data duplication so again
there's<00:02:15.860> not<00:02:15.980> even<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.250> point<00:02:16.460> making<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.819> graph

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
there's not even a point making a graph

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.820 
there's not even a point making a graph
because<00:02:17.480> there's<00:02:17.750> about<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:18.050> 5<00:02:18.290> second<00:02:18.650> gap

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
because there's about a 5 second gap

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.430 
because there's about a 5 second gap
between<00:02:19.010> these<00:02:19.370> two<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.850> about<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.540> 20<00:02:21.080> second

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
between these two and about a 20 second

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.059 
between these two and about a 20 second
gap<00:02:21.650> between<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.000> WD<00:02:23.450> black<00:02:23.720> now

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
gap between this and the WD black now

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.500 
gap between this and the WD black now
which<00:02:25.069> one's<00:02:25.310> better<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.910> which<00:02:26.030> one's<00:02:26.270> worse

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
which one's better and which one's worse

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.880 
which one's better and which one's worse
well<00:02:26.750> there<00:02:26.870> isn't<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.260> better<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.680> worse

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
well there isn't a better and worse

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.650 
well there isn't a better and worse
because<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.970> wouldn't<00:02:29.270> run<00:02:29.480> them

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
because you wouldn't run them

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.450 
because you wouldn't run them
side-by-side<00:02:29.900> with<00:02:30.530> stop<00:02:30.800> Watchers<00:02:31.280> and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
file start and stop and all that

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.089 
file start and stop and all that
stuff<00:02:36.000> you're<00:02:36.959> gonna<00:02:37.110> have<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.349> hard<00:02:37.560> time<00:02:37.830> so

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
stuff you're gonna have a hard time so

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.949 
stuff you're gonna have a hard time so
for<00:02:38.250> me<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.550> would<00:02:38.760> say<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.120> pick<00:02:39.390> up<00:02:39.510> one<00:02:39.750> that

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
for me I would say just pick up one that

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.050 
for me I would say just pick up one that
fits<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.410> your<00:02:40.440> budget<00:02:40.590> if<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> WD<00:02:41.640> fits<00:02:41.910> in

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
fits in your budget if the WD fits in

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.479 
fits in your budget if the WD fits in
then<00:02:42.270> get<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:43.080> Green<00:02:43.349> Drive<00:02:43.590> fits<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.099> sorry

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
then get the Green Drive fits in sorry

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.890 
then get the Green Drive fits in sorry
then<00:02:44.700> get<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.000> Green<00:02:45.209> Drive<00:02:45.390> if<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.690> black

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
then get the Green Drive if the black

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.330 
then get the Green Drive if the black
can<00:02:46.110> fit<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.410> your<00:02:46.470> budget<00:02:46.890> then<00:02:47.010> get<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
black if an SSD on the other hand can

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.760 
black if an SSD on the other hand can
fit<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.130> your<00:02:50.220> budget<00:02:50.400> then<00:02:50.819> get<00:02:51.120> an<00:02:51.239> SSD

because<00:02:52.770> all<00:02:52.950> these<00:02:53.069> drives<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.670> again

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
because all these drives you again

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.280 
because all these drives you again
you're<00:02:54.330> not<00:02:54.390> gonna<00:02:54.510> be<00:02:54.690> running<00:02:54.989> side-by-side

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
you're not gonna be running side-by-side

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.500 
you're not gonna be running side-by-side
like<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:56.069> was<00:02:56.280> you're<00:02:56.760> not<00:02:56.910> gonna<00:02:57.060> see<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
like I was you're not gonna see the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.960 
like I was you're not gonna see the
difference<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.200> there<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.860> difference<00:02:59.400> so

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
difference but there is a difference so

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.309 
difference but there is a difference so
what<00:03:00.180> was<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.450> point<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.930> video<00:03:01.110> now

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
what was the point of this video now

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.710 
what was the point of this video now
there's<00:03:02.190> bound<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.670> be<00:03:02.730> lots<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.180> other<00:03:03.300> videos

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
there's bound to be lots of other videos

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.300 
there's bound to be lots of other videos
out<00:03:03.870> there<00:03:03.959> saying<00:03:04.350> oh<00:03:04.530> my<00:03:04.709> god<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.099> black

out there saying oh my god the black

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.800 
out there saying oh my god the black
drives<00:03:05.580> are<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:05.880> much<00:03:06.120> better<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.450> get<00:03:06.660> the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
drives are so much better I get the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.170 
drives are so much better I get the
black<00:03:06.959> Drive<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.470> really<00:03:08.400> guys<00:03:08.580> if<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:08.940> come

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
black Drive but really guys if you come

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.390 
black Drive but really guys if you come
from<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.510> realistic<00:03:10.080> standpoint<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.800> just<00:03:11.130> any

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
from a realistic standpoint of just any

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.610 
from a realistic standpoint of just any
old<00:03:11.760> regular<00:03:12.330> person<00:03:12.780> you're<00:03:13.170> gonna<00:03:13.290> find

old regular person you're gonna find

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.140 
old regular person you're gonna find
there's<00:03:13.860> not<00:03:14.010> much<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.400> difference<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:14.940> did

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
there's not much of a difference I did

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.210 
there's not much of a difference I did
get<00:03:15.269> my<00:03:15.450> mate<00:03:15.690> who<00:03:15.989> comes<00:03:16.680> over<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.040> we<00:03:17.130> have

I<00:03:19.250> did<00:03:20.250> put<00:03:20.580> in<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.910> black<00:03:21.299> drive<00:03:21.540> without<00:03:21.720> him

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
I did put in a black drive without him

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.449 
I did put in a black drive without him
knowing<00:03:22.140> he<00:03:22.290> runs<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.709> Green<00:03:22.920> Drive<00:03:23.130> in<00:03:23.310> his

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
knowing he runs a Green Drive in his

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.460 
knowing he runs a Green Drive in his
personal<00:03:23.819> computer<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.959> asked<00:03:25.170> him<00:03:25.290> at<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
personal computer and I asked him at the

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.020 
personal computer and I asked him at the
end<00:03:25.590> did<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.860> notice<00:03:26.130> any<00:03:26.340> slowness<00:03:26.670> of

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
end did you notice any slowness of

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.240 
end did you notice any slowness of
loading<00:03:27.660> things<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.080> said<00:03:28.260> no<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.500> what

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
loading things and said no that what

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.400 
loading things and said no that what
what<00:03:29.489> do<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:29.610> mean<00:03:29.760> slowness<00:03:30.360> it's<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.170> Green

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
what do you mean slowness it's the Green

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.009 
what do you mean slowness it's the Green
Drive<00:03:31.620> right<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:33.030> told<00:03:33.450> him<00:03:33.600> no<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:33.840> was<00:03:33.989> a

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
Drive right and I told him no it was a

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.570 
Drive right and I told him no it was a
back<00:03:34.380> Drive<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.739> he<00:03:34.799> said<00:03:34.950> well<00:03:35.100> there's<00:03:35.370> no

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
back Drive and he said well there's no

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.759 
back Drive and he said well there's no
difference<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.720> someone<00:03:37.049> who's<00:03:37.200> not<00:03:37.350> fully

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
difference so to someone who's not fully

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.880 
difference so to someone who's not fully
into<00:03:38.040> computers<00:03:38.690> there<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.900> no<00:03:40.140> physical<00:03:40.440> or

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
into computers there is no physical or

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.970 
into computers there is no physical or
no<00:03:41.190> real<00:03:42.180> way<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.480> benchmark<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.440> now<00:03:43.620> again<00:03:43.950> I

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
no real way to benchmark it now again I

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.620 
no real way to benchmark it now again I
did<00:03:44.220> run<00:03:44.370> benchmarks<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.090> there's<00:03:45.329> no<00:03:45.420> point

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
did run benchmarks and there's no point

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
did run benchmarks and there's no point
even<00:03:45.690> putting<00:03:45.989> those<00:03:46.140> numbers<00:03:46.440> because<00:03:46.500> you

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
even putting those numbers because you

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.900 
even putting those numbers because you
can<00:03:46.769> go<00:03:46.890> on<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.070> internet<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.370> find<00:03:47.790> those

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
can go on the internet and find those

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.210 
can go on the internet and find those
numbers<00:03:48.239> really<00:03:48.570> simply<00:03:48.930> but<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.709> black<00:03:49.950> does

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
numbers really simply but the black does

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.940 
numbers really simply but the black does
crush<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.730> green<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.299> it's<00:03:52.200> really<00:03:52.500> up<00:03:52.739> to

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
crush the green so it's really up to

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.650 
crush the green so it's really up to
what<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.250> want<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.489> do<00:03:53.670> if<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.180> have<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.420> put<00:03:54.600> in

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
what you want to do if I have to put in

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.270 
what you want to do if I have to put in
a<00:03:54.690> recommendation<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.470> any<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:55.859> again<00:03:56.250> I

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
a recommendation on any of this again I

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.580 
a recommendation on any of this again I
would<00:03:56.459> say<00:03:56.850> go<00:03:57.090> for<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.329> SSD<00:03:57.840> because<00:03:58.350> it's

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
would say go for the SSD because it's

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.380 
would say go for the SSD because it's
going<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:58.980> be<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.130> lot<00:03:59.370> faster<00:03:59.790> in<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.030> long<00:04:00.209> run

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
going to be a lot faster in the long run

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.120 
going to be a lot faster in the long run
than<00:04:00.600> one<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.840> these<00:04:00.959> drives<00:04:01.260> with<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.829> fresh

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
than one of these drives with a fresh

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.250 
than one of these drives with a fresh
install<00:04:02.579> of<00:04:02.609> an<00:04:02.880> OS<00:04:03.180> obviously<00:04:03.810> these<00:04:03.989> drives

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
install of an OS obviously these drives

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.479 
install of an OS obviously these drives
are<00:04:04.380> going<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.560> be<00:04:04.620> pretty<00:04:04.829> fast<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.250> as<00:04:05.370> soon

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
are going to be pretty fast but as soon

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.160 
are going to be pretty fast but as soon
as<00:04:05.609> you<00:04:05.700> start<00:04:05.970> loading<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.299> files<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:06.930> having

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
as you start loading up files and having

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.870 
as you start loading up files and having
a<00:04:07.260> longer<00:04:07.440> boot<00:04:07.650> time<00:04:07.890> you're<00:04:08.070> gonna<00:04:08.280> start<00:04:08.730> to

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
a longer boot time you're gonna start to

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.930 
a longer boot time you're gonna start to
struggle<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:09.299> an<00:04:09.660> SSD<00:04:10.440> otherwise<00:04:11.070> again<00:04:11.549> get

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
struggle so an SSD otherwise again get

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.460 
struggle so an SSD otherwise again get
which<00:04:12.150> one<00:04:12.359> fits<00:04:12.630> in<00:04:12.780> your<00:04:12.900> budget<00:04:13.079> they're

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
which one fits in your budget they're

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.020 
which one fits in your budget they're
practically<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.250> same<00:04:14.489> they're<00:04:14.790> great

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
practically the same they're great

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.060 
practically the same they're great
drives<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.900> Green<00:04:16.109> Drive<00:04:16.289> is<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.470> bit<00:04:16.709> slower

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
drives the Green Drive is a bit slower

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.130 
drives the Green Drive is a bit slower
but<00:04:17.430> there's<00:04:17.910> not<00:04:18.120> too<00:04:18.390> much<00:04:18.630> that's<00:04:18.900> gonna

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
but there's not too much that's gonna

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.770 
but there's not too much that's gonna
take<00:04:19.500> away<00:04:19.739> from<00:04:19.950> that<00:04:20.100> experience<00:04:20.579> if<00:04:21.000> using

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
take away from that experience if using

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.210 
take away from that experience if using
this<00:04:21.870> in<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.109> storage<00:04:22.380> situation<00:04:23.039> definitely

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
this in a storage situation definitely

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.710 
this in a storage situation definitely
go<00:04:23.520> for<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.729> Green<00:04:23.970> Drive<00:04:24.180> because<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.510> use

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
go for the Green Drive because I use

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.990 
go for the Green Drive because I use
screen<00:04:25.050> drives<00:04:25.260> in<00:04:25.410> my<00:04:25.560> server<00:04:25.860> so<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.550> really

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
screen drives in my server so I really

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.150 
screen drives in my server so I really
recommend<00:04:27.120> them<00:04:27.570> for<00:04:27.600> storage<00:04:28.470> but<00:04:28.919> again

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
recommend them for storage but again

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.830 
recommend them for storage but again
it's<00:04:29.430> up<00:04:29.640> to<00:04:29.789> you<00:04:29.880> guys<00:04:30.030> with<00:04:30.450> that<00:04:30.570> being<00:04:30.780> said

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
it's up to you guys with that being said

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.240 
it's up to you guys with that being said
like<00:04:31.500> we'll<00:04:31.680> just<00:04:31.710> like<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:31.979> view

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
like we'll just like the view

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.190 
like we'll just like the view
accordingly<00:04:32.669> let<00:04:32.970> me<00:04:33.090> know<00:04:33.240> can<00:04:33.630> you<00:04:33.930> see<00:04:34.169> a

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
accordingly let me know can you see a

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.110 
accordingly let me know can you see a
difference<00:04:34.620> between<00:04:34.770> greens<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.639> blacks<00:04:35.789> and

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
difference between greens and blacks and

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.850 
difference between greens and blacks and
even<00:04:36.300> SSDs<00:04:36.900> we'll<00:04:37.200> obviously<00:04:37.410> there's<00:04:37.830> a

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
even SSDs we'll obviously there's a

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.350 
even SSDs we'll obviously there's a
difference<00:04:38.160> there<00:04:38.310> but<00:04:38.550> I'll<00:04:38.940> see<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.270> guys

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
difference there but I'll see you guys

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.770 
difference there but I'll see you guys
next<00:04:39.419> time<00:04:39.720> for<00:04:39.870> another<00:04:40.500> video
