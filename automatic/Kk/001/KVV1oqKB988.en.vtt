and I think because of that there's the
fear<00:05:35.069> but<00:05:35.549> once<00:05:35.759> they<00:05:35.939> realize<00:05:36.449> what<00:05:36.839> unions

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
can do and the success stories I think

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:40.909 
can do and the success stories I think
there's<00:05:39.869> more<00:05:40.110> of<00:05:40.169> them<00:05:40.349> that<00:05:40.589> be<00:05:40.739> more
