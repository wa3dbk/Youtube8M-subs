00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.660
 continuing with our study the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.420
 factory operations sum of difference of 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.550
 perfect cubes do not ask for factors to 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.280
 the expression 1 more 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.960
 729 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.960
 x raised at 6 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.030
 we can see that the expression 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.040
 contains two terms 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.140
 Now let's establish if both 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.560
 terms have public networks that is 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.560
 high 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.200
 the first term of the expression is the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:55.800
 number 1 and the cube root of 1 is the 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.510
 same number 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:05.580
 now our second term is 729 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.280
 raised at 6 the cubic root of 729 is 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.479
 a number that multiplied by itself 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:18.570
 three times from 729 the number is 9 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:22.979
 given that 9 times 9 times 9 is 729 and the root 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.380
 cubic of equals 6 is the same x that 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.520
 will have as an exponent the division 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.240
 between 6 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.189
 the root index is 36 divided by 3 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.340
 gives us 2 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:40.569
 in this way we observe that both 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.369
 terms have exact cubic root and the 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.979
 factorization we write it from the 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.770
 next way in the first parenthesis 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.280
 let's place the two roots obtained 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.830
 1 and 9 x squared 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.720
 separated between the sign that separate the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.960
 terms of expression in this case 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.360
 of the plus sign 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.299
 in the second factor we are going to place 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.850
 three terms as follows the 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.080
 first term is the first network is 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.080
 obtained squared 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.350
 our second term is accompanied by 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.050
 minus sign and corresponds to the product 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.740
 between the twelve already obtained that is to say the 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.740
 number one 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.060
 term 9 x squared let's place 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.630
 here a bracket 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.180
 then the plus sign comes and we're going to 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.120
 set the square of the secondary 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.230
 sustained is to say that we are going to raise the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.650
 square the term 9 x elevator 2 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.530
 let's do the operations of 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.240
 second factor as the factor that is 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.130
 well established the one that gives the same one more 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.170
 x squared our second factor 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.740
 let's get it in the following way 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:12.740
 1 squared is 1 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:17.870
 - 1 x 9 x squared is 9 x squared 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:22.880
 plus the square of 9 x squared is the 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:26.900
 square of 9 which is 81 and the square of 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.720
 x squared we observe that it is a 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.690
 power of powers which indicates us 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.720
 that the exponents must multiply 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.290
 two times two is four therefore we have 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.780
 x raised to 4 in this way we have 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.720
 finished factoring and we can 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.390
 conclude that 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:54.270
 one 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:59.670
 plus 729 x raise to 6 equals 1 + 9 x 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:06.980
 squared that multiplies one minus 9 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.980
 x squared plus 81 x room 4
