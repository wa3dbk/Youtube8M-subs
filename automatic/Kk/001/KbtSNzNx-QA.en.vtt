00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
between these two weapons stats but I

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.510 
between these two weapons stats but I
think<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.200> overall<00:00:49.500> appearance<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> tech

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
think the overall appearance of the tech

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.180 
think the overall appearance of the tech
45<00:00:51.149> what's<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> firing<00:00:52.320> those<00:00:52.590> 45

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
45 what's with it firing those 45

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.119 
45 what's with it firing those 45
caliber<00:00:53.610> rounds<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.180> opposed<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.600> strange<00:00:55.170> 5.7

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129

milligrams<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> five-seven<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.629> think<00:00:58.079> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
milligrams of the five-seven I think it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.630 
milligrams of the five-seven I think it
makes<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.500> more<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> better<00:00:58.980> real-life

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
makes it more of a better real-life

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.910 
makes it more of a better real-life
choice<00:01:00.030> we're<00:01:00.899> gonna<00:01:00.989> go<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> secondary

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
attachments in our tech 45 I do think

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.429 
attachments in our tech 45 I do think
it's<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.600> shame<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.080> secondary

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
it's a shame that the secondary

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
it's a shame that the secondary
gunfighter<00:01:07.680> wildcard<00:01:08.040> doesn't<00:01:08.909> allow<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.180> to

equip three attachments on your
