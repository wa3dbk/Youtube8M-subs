00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.719 
interactive for all of us that should
definitely<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.860> something<00:01:29.250> i<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.610> that's

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
definitely be something i think that's

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.240 
definitely be something i think that's
on<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> agenda<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:31.110> channel<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.560> let

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
on the agenda for this channel and let

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.170 
on the agenda for this channel and let
me<00:01:32.340> know<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.549> comments<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:32.970> that's

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
me know in the comments if that's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.490 
me know in the comments if that's
something<00:01:33.360> you'd<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> see<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.140> think

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
something you'd like to see I think

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.899 
something you'd like to see I think
that's<00:01:34.650> definitely<00:01:35.040> doable<00:01:35.189> i<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.640> start<00:01:35.850> up

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
that's definitely doable i can start up

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.760 
that's definitely doable i can start up
a<00:01:36.000> second<00:01:36.270> account<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> lot<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
a second account and a lot of the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.499 
a second account and a lot of the
upgrades<00:01:38.130> are<00:01:38.340> quick<00:01:38.820> early<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> game

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
upgrades are quick early on in the game

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.060 
upgrades are quick early on in the game
so<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.049> could<00:01:40.140> probably<00:01:40.290> get<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> town<00:01:40.799> hall

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
so we could probably get to a town hall

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.240 
so we could probably get to a town hall
probably<00:01:41.790> four<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.030> five<00:01:42.299> relatively<00:01:43.020> quickly

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
probably four or five relatively quickly

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.139 
probably four or five relatively quickly
after<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> raids<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.610> you're<00:01:44.729> seeing<00:01:44.939> here
