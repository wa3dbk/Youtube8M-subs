this is how it works when we plug the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.020 
this is how it works when we plug the
controller<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.170> turn<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.250> tractor<00:00:14.670> Pro

we are in deck a and deck B as usual so

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.669 
we are in deck a and deck B as usual so
this<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:27.349> so<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.740> deck<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:30.150> B<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:31.410> do

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
as they should I think there are there

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.320 
as they should I think there are there
aren't<00:02:07.880> any<00:02:08.090> box<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:09.229> be<00:02:10.070> aware<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.399> some

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
aren't any box but be aware that some

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.440 
aren't any box but be aware that some
box<00:02:11.600> may<00:02:11.900> appear<00:02:12.520> when<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:13.580> use<00:02:13.820> this<00:02:14.390> new

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
box may appear when you use this new

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.850 
box may appear when you use this new
mapping<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:16.130> wasn't<00:02:16.940> tested<00:02:17.390> much<00:02:17.600> yet<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.530> it

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
mapping it wasn't tested much yet but it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.530 
mapping it wasn't tested much yet but it
works<00:02:19.750> for<00:02:20.750> me<00:02:21.020> as<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.680> should<00:02:22.070> work<00:02:22.480> ok<00:02:23.480> so

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
works for me as it should work ok so

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.960 
works for me as it should work ok so
again<00:02:24.320> when<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.010> press<00:02:25.220> sampler<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.610> switch
