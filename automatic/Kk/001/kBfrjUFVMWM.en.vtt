00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
off in the way it did I mean partially I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.020 
off in the way it did I mean partially I
mean<00:01:48.619> must<00:01:48.920> have<00:01:49.039> been<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.250> new<00:01:49.460> things<00:01:49.820> that

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
mean must have been the new things that

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.850 
mean must have been the new things that
you<00:01:50.149> did<00:01:50.330> with<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.660> show<00:01:50.840> I<00:01:50.869> suppose<00:01:51.320> in<00:01:51.590> part

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
you did with the show I suppose in part

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.920 
you did with the show I suppose in part
I<00:01:52.220> think<00:01:52.369> people<00:01:52.789> have<00:01:52.910> an<00:01:53.030> image<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.330> ballroom

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
I think people have an image of ballroom

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.570 
I think people have an image of ballroom
dancing<00:01:54.440> but<00:01:54.560> certainly<00:01:55.100> before<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.460> show

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
dancing but certainly before the show

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.249 
dancing but certainly before the show
started<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:56.030> sort<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.270> like<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:56.660> know<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.960> tea

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
world but we had a fantastic time

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.060 
world but we had a fantastic time
because<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.199> chemistry<00:04:25.590> was<00:04:25.620> right<00:04:25.889> you<00:04:26.039> know

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
because the chemistry was right you know

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.700 
because the chemistry was right you know
we<00:04:26.280> we<00:04:26.430> enjoyed<00:04:26.699> each<00:04:26.729> other's<00:04:27.060> company<00:04:27.360> and

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
we we enjoyed each other's company and

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.170 
we we enjoyed each other's company and
so<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.770> don't<00:04:29.010> really<00:04:29.220> mind<00:04:29.370> so<00:04:29.550> much<00:04:29.580> if<00:04:29.699> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
so you don't really mind so much if the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.370 
so you don't really mind so much if the
chemistry<00:04:30.539> is<00:04:30.570> right<00:04:30.720> but<00:04:30.870> if<00:04:30.990> you<00:04:31.110> get

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
chemistry is right but if you get

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
chemistry is right but if you get
somebody<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.860> don't<00:04:32.070> really<00:04:32.190> get<00:04:32.340> along

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400
