2008<00:00:37.649> may<00:00:37.980> be<00:00:38.040> here<00:00:38.399> 2007<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:40.969> it<00:00:41.969> was<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:43.010> big

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
2008 may be here 2007 and it was a big

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.170 
2008 may be here 2007 and it was a big

it<00:00:59.969> says<00:01:00.149> rare<00:01:00.449> earth<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:01.050> guess<00:01:01.410> because<00:01:01.800> of

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
it says rare earth I guess because of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.549 
it says rare earth I guess because of
the<00:01:02.129> rare<00:01:02.309> earth<00:01:02.489> magnets<00:01:03.170> so<00:01:04.170> instead<00:01:04.500> of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the rare earth magnets so instead of

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.920 
the rare earth magnets so instead of
just<00:01:04.860> earth<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:06.600> usually<00:01:06.780> say<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:08.930> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
just earth like they usually say and the

were<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.369> expensive<00:01:14.670> when<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.119> came<00:01:15.299> out<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
were so expensive when we came out I

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.570 
were so expensive when we came out I
think<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.860> retail<00:01:17.070> price<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.850> over<00:01:18.360> $200<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
think the retail price is over $200 and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.580 
think the retail price is over $200 and
I<00:01:20.580> don't<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.390> sold<00:01:21.630> very<00:01:21.930> well<00:01:22.049> first

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
I don't think they sold very well first

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.080 
I don't think they sold very well first
by<00:01:22.740> their<00:01:22.920> Co<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.490> ended<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.820> getting

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
by their Co so they ended up getting

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.130 
by their Co so they ended up getting
cleared<00:01:24.390> out<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:25.700> some<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.909> 70<00:01:27.360> 70<00:01:27.930> or<00:01:28.020> 80

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
cleared out for some like 70 70 or 80

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.719 
cleared out for some like 70 70 or 80
dollars<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.990> that's<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:32.430> they<00:01:32.579> go

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
dollars and that's kind of but they go

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.499 
dollars and that's kind of but they go
from<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> secondary<00:01:33.570> market<00:01:33.930> now<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:35.509> 60

70<00:01:36.869> $80<00:01:37.259> range<00:01:37.590> which<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.220> quite<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> drop<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
70 $80 range which is quite a drop and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.039 
70 $80 range which is quite a drop and
it's<00:01:40.140> not<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.560> old<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> knife<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:42.049> think

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it's not that old of a knife I think

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.120 
it's not that old of a knife I think
it's<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> pretty<00:01:43.740> cool<00:01:43.890> knife

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
it's a it's a pretty cool knife

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
it's a it's a pretty cool knife
especially<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.939> kind<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> money<00:01:45.450> yeah

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
especially for that kind of money yeah

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
especially for that kind of money yeah
and<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.229> 30<00:01:46.500> V<00:01:46.680> blade<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:47.850> neat<00:01:48.210> rare

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and that's 30 V blade you get neat rare

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.760 
and that's 30 V blade you get neat rare
earth<00:01:48.720> magnets<00:01:49.229> um<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:52.430> probably

earth magnets um it's probably

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.010 
earth magnets um it's probably
marginally<00:01:55.770> safer<00:01:56.100> than<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.600> Swiss<00:01:57.600> Army<00:01:57.780> knife

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
