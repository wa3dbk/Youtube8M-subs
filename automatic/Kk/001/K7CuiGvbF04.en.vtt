00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
bone to form a bill and this is not only

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.410 
bone to form a bill and this is not only
used<00:00:43.039> for<00:00:43.339> hunting<00:00:43.550> but<00:00:43.789> it<00:00:43.879> also<00:00:44.030> makes<00:00:44.329> the

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
used for hunting but it also makes the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.419 
used for hunting but it also makes the
fish<00:00:44.600> really<00:00:44.780> hydrodynamic<00:00:45.649> as<00:00:45.769> well<00:00:45.949> and<00:00:46.190> a

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
fish really hydrodynamic as well and a

fish really hydrodynamic as well and a
very<00:00:46.609> fast<00:00:46.789> swimmer<00:00:47.089> they're<00:00:47.629> easily

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
very fast swimmer they're easily

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.660 
very fast swimmer they're easily
identified<00:00:48.679> or<00:00:48.859> distinguished<00:00:49.309> from<00:00:49.429> other

identified or distinguished from other
species<00:00:50.269> of<00:00:50.300> built<00:00:50.600> fish<00:00:50.809> by<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.109> fact<00:00:51.410> we

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
species of built fish by the fact we

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.910 
species of built fish by the fact we
have<00:00:51.739> a<00:00:51.769> very<00:00:52.339> tall<00:00:52.760> first<00:00:53.570> dorsal<00:00:54.079> fin<00:00:54.289> the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
have a very tall first dorsal fin the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.739 
have a very tall first dorsal fin the
problem<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:55.550> they<00:00:55.969> don't<00:00:56.089> always<00:00:56.300> keep<00:00:56.600> that

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
problem is they don't always keep that

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.599 
problem is they don't always keep that
up<00:00:57.019> when<00:00:57.230> they're<00:00:57.379> swimming<00:00:57.530> unless<00:00:58.370> they're

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
up when they're swimming unless they're

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.189 
up when they're swimming unless they're
corralling<00:00:59.059> bait<00:00:59.269> when<00:00:59.510> they<00:00:59.629> have<00:00:59.809> that<00:01:00.019> up

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
corralling bait when they have that up

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.979 
corralling bait when they have that up
oftentimes<00:01:00.890> they'll<00:01:01.129> swim<00:01:01.399> with<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.449> dorsal

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
oftentimes they'll swim with the dorsal

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.259 
oftentimes they'll swim with the dorsal
fin<00:01:03.070> depressed<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.370> aggrieved<00:01:04.760> which<00:01:05.000> allows

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
fin depressed and aggrieved which allows

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.240 
fin depressed and aggrieved which allows
them<00:01:05.449> to<00:01:05.510> swim<00:01:05.780> very<00:01:05.810> fast<00:01:06.050> but<00:01:06.860> when<00:01:07.010> this<00:01:07.100> is

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
them to swim very fast but when this is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.770 
them to swim very fast but when this is
happening<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:07.700> can<00:01:07.729> still<00:01:08.090> identify<00:01:08.240> them

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
happening you can still identify them

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.319 
happening you can still identify them
fairly<00:01:09.049> well<00:01:09.170> because<00:01:09.290> they<00:01:09.619> have<00:01:09.920> by<00:01:10.310> far<00:01:10.340> the

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
fairly well because they have by far the

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.660

several big advantages for the fish it

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.930 
several big advantages for the fish it

the corner of the jaw where there's very

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
in the throat or in the esophagus so

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:43.980 
in the throat or in the esophagus so
it's<00:04:42.820> good<00:04:43.000> for<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.270> fish<00:04:43.449> in<00:04:43.630> that<00:04:43.660> it's

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
it's good for the fish in that it's

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.540 
it's good for the fish in that it's
gonna<00:04:44.139> catch<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:44.620> somewhere<00:04:45.070> where<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:45.430> won't

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
gonna catch it somewhere where it won't

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.820 
gonna catch it somewhere where it won't

goes way up when you use circle hooks

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.560 
goes way up when you use circle hooks
because<00:04:57.070> they<00:04:57.460> catch<00:04:57.699> fish<00:04:57.970> in<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.240> corner<00:04:58.510> of

you'll<00:05:16.870> find<00:05:17.139> them<00:05:17.320> migrating<00:05:17.740> further<00:05:18.370> up

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
you'll find them migrating further up

northern hemisphere will they'll take

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.520 
northern hemisphere will they'll take
advantage<00:05:21.789> of<00:05:22.210> warmer<00:05:22.539> weather<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:23.050> invade

but<00:05:24.070> once<00:05:24.340> surface<00:05:24.880> temperature<00:05:25.180> we<00:05:25.240> start<00:05:25.449> to

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
but once surface temperature we start to

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.600 
but once surface temperature we start to
cool<00:05:25.750> they'll<00:05:26.590> come<00:05:26.830> back<00:05:26.979> down<00:05:27.250> and<00:05:27.340> move

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
cool they'll come back down and move

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.339 
cool they'll come back down and move
further<00:05:27.849> south<00:05:28.150> and<00:05:28.419> that's<00:05:28.510> where<00:05:28.780> anglers

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
further south and that's where anglers

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:30.779 
further south and that's where anglers
in<00:05:29.380> South<00:05:29.889> Florida<00:05:30.070> really<00:05:30.460> take<00:05:30.639> advantage

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
in South Florida really take advantage

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.909 
in South Florida really take advantage

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
of sailfish you can really catch them

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.370 
of sailfish you can really catch them
year-round<00:05:33.130> here<00:05:33.760> in<00:05:33.940> South<00:05:34.690> Florida<00:05:35.169> and<00:05:35.320> the

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
you get these fish and moving back down

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.909 
you get these fish and moving back down

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.129 
in response to cold weather in fronts
you<00:05:42.370> can<00:05:42.520> really<00:05:42.729> get<00:05:42.820> high<00:05:43.139> concentrations

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.629 
you can really get high concentrations
of<00:05:44.320> sailfish<00:05:44.830> and<00:05:45.039> that's<00:05:45.159> really<00:05:45.340> when<00:05:45.520> the
