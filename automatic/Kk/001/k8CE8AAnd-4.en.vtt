depending<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.590> how<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.859> apply<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.699> did

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
depending on how you apply it I did

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.779 
depending on how you apply it I did
really<00:00:18.480> liked<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.990> but<00:00:19.560> there<00:00:19.859> was<00:00:19.980> East<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.640> it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
so if you are gluten intolerant it will

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.710 
so if you are gluten intolerant it will
make<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.519> break<00:00:23.730> out<00:00:23.880> which<00:00:24.090> was<00:00:24.330> my<00:00:24.510> issue

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
but the new formula is gluten free so if

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.390 
but the new formula is gluten free so if
you<00:00:28.109> had<00:00:28.289> certain<00:00:28.650> issue<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
like on its own but it comes with a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
like on its own but it comes with a
little<00:00:54.300> sample<00:00:54.449> size<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.960> deep<00:00:55.199> moisturizing

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
old formula Indy number 135 even if it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.960 
old formula Indy number 135 even if it
doesn't<00:01:10.860> match<00:01:10.950> perfectly<00:01:11.400> today<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.820> fine

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it mostly wanted to see how the formula

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.740 
it mostly wanted to see how the formula

although<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.119> buildable<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.259> just

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
although it was buildable but it just

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
although it was buildable but it just
say<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.560> looked<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.310> natural<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.000> skin

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
say it looked so natural in this skin

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.580 
say it looked so natural in this skin
and<00:01:39.270> I'm<00:01:39.450> hoping<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.079> one<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.320> gonna<00:01:40.409> be

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and I'm hoping this one it's gonna be

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.440 
and I'm hoping this one it's gonna be
the<00:01:40.680> same<00:01:40.829> way<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> said

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the same way but this one like I said

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.600 
the same way but this one like I said
earlier<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.259> gluten<00:01:43.649> free<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.159> hopefully<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
earlier it is gluten free so hopefully I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
earlier it is gluten free so hopefully I
don't<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.090> breakout

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
don't get the breakout

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
give you like full coverage but it looks

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.970 
give you like full coverage but it looks
so<00:02:55.090> natural<00:02:55.330> that<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:56.200> basically<00:02:56.410> could<00:02:56.800> use

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
so natural that you basically could use

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.670 
so natural that you basically could use

to<00:05:10.540> D<00:05:10.900> older<00:05:11.260> formula<00:05:11.650> probably<00:05:12.340> because<00:05:12.550> I

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
to D older formula probably because I

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.220

absolutely<00:05:26.050> anyone<00:05:26.440> from<00:05:27.039> new<00:05:27.190> reviews<00:05:27.490> I've

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
absolutely anyone from new reviews I've

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.760 
absolutely anyone from new reviews I've
seen<00:05:27.850> online<00:05:28.030> on<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.510> supermel<00:05:28.900> website

seen online on the supermel website
it<00:05:29.919> seems<00:05:30.340> to<00:05:30.520> not<00:05:30.550> work<00:05:30.849> as<00:05:31.000> well<00:05:31.240> in<00:05:31.389> oil<00:05:31.660> your

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
it seems to not work as well in oil your

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.020 
it seems to not work as well in oil your
skin<00:05:32.139> which<00:05:32.470> kind<00:05:33.099> of<00:05:33.129> makes<00:05:33.310> sense<00:05:33.610> they<00:05:33.970> do

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
skin which kind of makes sense they do

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.360 
skin which kind of makes sense they do
have<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.330> matte<00:05:35.110> one<00:05:35.319> that<00:05:35.650> is<00:05:35.800> apparently

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
have a matte one that is apparently

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.399 
have a matte one that is apparently
really<00:05:36.580> good<00:05:36.910> if<00:05:37.419> you<00:05:37.539> use<00:05:37.569> a<00:05:37.750> primer<00:05:38.110> in<00:05:38.349> a

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
really good if you use a primer in a

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.230 
really good if you use a primer in a
powder<00:05:38.650> sometimes<00:05:39.009> it<00:05:39.340> does<00:05:39.520> make<00:05:39.729> it<00:05:39.759> easier

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
powder sometimes it does make it easier

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.610 
powder sometimes it does make it easier
but<00:05:40.479> I<00:05:40.629> just<00:05:40.900> really<00:05:41.229> recommend<00:05:41.560> this

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
but I just really recommend this

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.070 
but I just really recommend this
foundation<00:05:42.099> if<00:05:42.250> you<00:05:42.370> have<00:05:42.550> dry<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.210> normal

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
foundation if you have dry to normal

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.649 
foundation if you have dry to normal
maybe<00:05:44.530> a<00:05:44.860> combination<00:05:45.520> skin<00:05:45.819> you<00:05:46.240> need<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.509> try

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
maybe a combination skin you need to try

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.600 
maybe a combination skin you need to try
this<00:05:46.720> it's<00:05:47.259> just<00:05:47.379> awesome<00:05:47.680> I<00:05:48.099> can't<00:05:48.460> really

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
this it's just awesome I can't really

zoomed<00:05:49.030> in<00:05:49.240> because<00:05:49.539> my<00:05:49.659> camera<00:05:49.930> is<00:05:49.990> really

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
zoomed in because my camera is really

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.930 
zoomed in because my camera is really
far<00:05:50.500> but<00:05:50.680> that's<00:05:50.830> like<00:05:51.009> the<00:05:51.250> closest<00:05:51.729> thing<00:05:51.789> I

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
far but that's like the closest thing I

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.430 
far but that's like the closest thing I
can<00:05:52.090> do<00:05:52.240> from<00:05:52.389> it<00:05:52.569> like<00:05:52.810> you<00:05:52.960> probably<00:05:53.259> can't

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
can do from it like you probably can't

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.529 
can do from it like you probably can't
tell<00:05:53.500> my<00:05:53.889> nose<00:05:54.099> is<00:05:54.370> not<00:05:54.669> dry<00:05:54.879> whatsoever<00:05:55.449> I
