00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
gave him 77 piece because he wasn't the

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.190 
gave him 77 piece because he wasn't the
quickest<00:01:30.130> but<00:01:30.759> he<00:01:30.999> could<00:01:31.210> run<00:01:31.420> back<00:01:31.719> or<00:01:32.020> run

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
quickest but he could run back or run

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.109 
quickest but he could run back or run
forward<00:01:32.590> if<00:01:32.829> needed<00:01:33.369> so<00:01:33.789> you<00:01:33.850> know<00:01:33.969> I<00:01:34.030> think

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
forward if needed so you know I think

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.289 
forward if needed so you know I think
that's<00:01:34.420> fairly<00:01:34.979> decent<00:01:35.979> pace<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.280> give<00:01:36.429> him<00:01:36.549> 84

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.300 
that's fairly decent pace to give him 84
dribbling<00:01:37.929> he<00:01:38.289> could<00:01:38.499> dribble<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.890> ball<00:01:39.039> very

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.679 
barcelona and the semi-finals of the
Champions<00:01:53.679> League<00:01:53.740> when<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.880> think<00:01:55.420> it<00:01:55.569> was

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
Champions League when I think it was

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.050 
Champions League when I think it was
laid<00:01:55.929> on<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.799> was<00:01:56.920> nil<00:01:57.130> nil<00:01:57.340> in<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.700> second

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
laid on and it was nil nil in the second

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.060 
laid on and it was nil nil in the second
leg<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.389> he<00:01:58.450> just<00:01:58.630> farted<00:01:59.109> it<00:01:59.409> in<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.710> might

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
leg and he just farted it in it might

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.620 
leg and he just farted it in it might
first<00:02:00.340> like<00:02:00.550> a<00:02:00.670> fart<00:02:00.909> remember<00:02:01.210> but<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.480> was<00:02:01.600> a

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
first like a fart remember but it was a

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.350 
first like a fart remember but it was a
fantastic<00:02:02.080> girl<00:02:02.530> 25<00:02:03.159> 30<00:02:03.700> yards<00:02:04.120> water

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
fantastic girl 25 30 yards water

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.680 
fantastic girl 25 30 yards water
screamer<00:02:04.960> that<00:02:05.260> was<00:02:05.460> 78<00:02:06.460> defense<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:07.420> guy

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
screamer that was 78 defense this guy

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.150 
screamer that was 78 defense this guy
had<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:09.310> record<00:02:09.850> with<00:02:10.440> referees<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.470> suppose<00:02:11.950> he

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
had a record with referees I suppose he

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.280 
had a record with referees I suppose he
got<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.790> hell<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.420> lot<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.600> yellows<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.110> he

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
got a hell of a lot of yellows and he

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.290 
got a hell of a lot of yellows and he
was<00:02:14.410> criticized<00:02:14.920> for<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.520> think<00:02:15.580> he<00:02:15.880> was

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
was criticized for it and I think he was

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.740 
was criticized for it and I think he was
sent<00:02:16.540> off<00:02:16.660> something<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:17.260> ten<00:02:17.650> times<00:02:18.750> well

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
sent off something like ten times well

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.120 
sent off something like ten times well
probably<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.170> lot<00:02:20.350> more<00:02:20.380> than<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.800> just

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
probably a lot more than that I just

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.460 
probably a lot more than that I just
can't<00:02:21.670> remember<00:02:21.730> but<00:02:22.150> yeah<00:02:22.300> he<00:02:22.720> had<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.959> real

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
can't remember but yeah he had a real

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.949 
can't remember but yeah he had a real
issue<00:02:23.920> with<00:02:24.310> discipline<00:02:24.910> shall<00:02:25.150> we<00:02:25.300> say<00:02:25.480> so

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
issue with discipline shall we say so

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.230 
issue with discipline shall we say so
yeah<00:02:26.110> he<00:02:26.290> could<00:02:26.500> defend<00:02:26.680> any<00:02:27.250> was<00:02:27.490> kind<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.060> a

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
yeah he could defend any was kind of a

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.630 
yeah he could defend any was kind of a
full<00:02:29.140> force<00:02:29.440> with<00:02:29.560> defending<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.400> I've<00:02:30.490> give

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
full force with defending so I've give

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.640 
full force with defending so I've give
him<00:02:30.760> seven<00:02:30.970> year<00:02:31.240> his<00:02:31.720> heading<00:02:32.080> wasn't<00:02:32.410> the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
him seven year his heading wasn't the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.949 
him seven year his heading wasn't the
greatest<00:02:32.920> but<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.760> was<00:02:34.030> ok<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.390> I'll<00:02:34.600> put<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.840> at

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
greatest but it was ok so I'll put it at

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.320 
greatest but it was ok so I'll put it at
70<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.650> his<00:02:36.010> passing<00:02:36.489> wasn't<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:37.090> guy's

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
70 and his passing wasn't this guy's

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.260 
70 and his passing wasn't this guy's
main<00:02:37.630> highlight<00:02:38.080> 89<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.580> was<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> fantastic

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
main highlight 89 it was a fantastic

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.960 
main highlight 89 it was a fantastic
centimeter<00:02:41.050> Lee<00:02:41.470> our<00:02:41.620> second<00:02:42.130> best<00:02:42.370> in<00:02:42.700> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
centimeter Lee our second best in the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.910 
centimeter Lee our second best in the
decade<00:02:43.450> i<00:02:43.570> would<00:02:43.690> say<00:02:43.840> Roy<00:02:44.050> Keane<00:02:44.350> is<00:02:44.470> slightly

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
decade i would say Roy Keane is slightly

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.250 
decade i would say Roy Keane is slightly
ahead<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:46.030> him<00:02:46.270> but<00:02:46.630> then<00:02:46.810> again<00:02:46.840> he's<00:02:47.230> a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
ahead of him but then again he's a

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.040 
ahead of him but then again he's a
holding<00:02:47.770> and<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:49.120> fender<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.750> don't<00:02:49.959> know

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
holding and the fender so don't know

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.570 
holding and the fender so don't know
he's<00:02:50.260> probably<00:02:50.440> our<00:02:50.739> best<00:02:50.920> central

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
he's probably our best central

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.479 
he's probably our best central
midfielder<00:02:52.180> going<00:02:52.810> off<00:02:52.989> literal<00:02:53.590> central<00:02:54.280> mid

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
midfielder going off literal central mid

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.790 
midfielder going off literal central mid
so<00:02:54.940> yeah<00:02:55.120> that<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:56.019> reading<00:02:56.290> I've<00:02:56.560> gave

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
total games is 963 i believe that's a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.490 
total games is 963 i believe that's a
BPL<00:03:17.200> record<00:03:17.739> but<00:03:18.040> i<00:03:18.070> could<00:03:18.370> be<00:03:18.400> wrong<00:03:18.610> there

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
BPL record but i could be wrong there

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.039 
BPL record but i could be wrong there
this<00:03:20.500> talk<00:03:20.769> cause<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.190> 168<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.420> again<00:03:22.660> i<00:03:22.840> can

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
this talk cause is 168 and again i can

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.680 
this talk cause is 168 and again i can
only<00:03:23.140> find<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.709> total<00:03:24.190> BPL<00:03:24.910> games<00:03:25.150> goals<00:03:25.480> and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
only find the total BPL games goals and

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.420 
only find the total BPL games goals and
assists<00:03:26.049> so<00:03:26.530> it's<00:03:27.070> 20<00:03:27.250> ppl<00:03:27.730> game<00:03:28.079> 632<00:03:29.079> tool<00:03:29.890> BPL

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
assists so it's 20 ppl game 632 tool BPL

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.680 
assists so it's 20 ppl game 632 tool BPL
goes<00:03:30.610> 109<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.570> total<00:03:31.870> BPL<00:03:32.260> assists<00:03:33.180> 284<00:03:34.180> but

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
goes 109 and total BPL assists 284 but

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.840 
goes 109 and total BPL assists 284 but
he's<00:03:34.930> had<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.440> think<00:03:36.010> more<00:03:36.340> than<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.519> hundred

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
he's had I think more than a hundred

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.270 
he's had I think more than a hundred
assists<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.600> any<00:03:37.870> other<00:03:38.140> player<00:03:38.440> second<00:03:39.160> is

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
assists of any other player second is

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
box curtainside and passed it for one of

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.390 
box curtainside and passed it for one of
his<00:04:18.910> many<00:04:19.329> assists<00:04:19.870> he<00:04:20.380> had<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.530> decent<00:04:20.859> shot<00:04:21.250> on

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
his many assists he had a decent shot on

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.590 
his many assists he had a decent shot on
him<00:04:21.489> as<00:04:21.609> well<00:04:21.760> when<00:04:21.940> he<00:04:22.030> wanted<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.450> shoot

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
him as well when he wanted to shoot

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.570 
him as well when he wanted to shoot
hence<00:04:22.900> why<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.110> gave<00:04:23.320> him<00:04:23.530> decent<00:04:24.130> shooting<00:04:24.400> and

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
hence why I gave him decent shooting and

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.210 
hence why I gave him decent shooting and
because<00:04:24.910> he's<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.090> left<00:04:25.389> mid<00:04:25.780> he<00:04:26.410> didn't<00:04:27.010> really

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
because he's a left mid he didn't really

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.879 
because he's a left mid he didn't really
defend<00:04:27.850> or<00:04:28.120> head<00:04:28.600> too<00:04:28.930> well<00:04:29.200> so<00:04:29.620> that's<00:04:29.710> why

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
defend or head too well so that's why

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.260 
defend or head too well so that's why
I've<00:04:29.950> given<00:04:30.250> pretty<00:04:30.460> little<00:04:30.729> stunt<00:04:30.970> on<00:04:31.090> that
