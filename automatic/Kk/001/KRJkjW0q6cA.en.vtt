some<00:01:16.320> data<00:01:16.560> sources<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.250> available<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.730> me

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
some data sources I have available to me

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.960 
some data sources I have available to me
in<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.720> case<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.230> have<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.440> map<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.100> Texas<00:01:20.730> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
in this case we have a map of Texas and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.090 
in this case we have a map of Texas and
a<00:01:21.030> math<00:01:21.210> Mexico<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.500> one<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.860> data

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
a math Mexico and one of the data

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.180 
a math Mexico and one of the data
sources<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.550> have<00:01:23.670> failed<00:01:23.970> me<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:25.010> cases<00:01:26.010> of

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
sources I have failed me are cases of

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.450 
sources I have failed me are cases of
avian

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
avian

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.320 
avian
outbreaks<00:01:28.330> in<00:01:28.950> Mexico<00:01:29.950> some<00:01:30.700> of<00:01:30.790> these<00:01:30.880> cases

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
outbreaks in Mexico some of these cases

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.760 
outbreaks in Mexico some of these cases
have<00:01:31.479> been<00:01:31.510> reported<00:01:31.630> by<00:01:32.200> men<00:01:32.500> on<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.710> street

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
have been reported by men on the street

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.580 
have been reported by men on the street
other<00:01:33.640> cases<00:01:33.909> have<00:01:34.210> been<00:01:34.240> reported<00:01:34.360> by<00:01:34.900> wh<00:01:35.380> 0

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
other cases have been reported by wh 0

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.219 
other cases have been reported by wh 0
so<00:01:36.369> therefore<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:37.270> group<00:01:37.659> analysts<00:01:38.110> have

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
so therefore a group analysts have

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.170 
so therefore a group analysts have
looked<00:01:38.440> at<00:01:38.560> this<00:01:38.650> data<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.159> they've<00:01:39.670> signed<00:01:39.970> a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
looked at this data and they've signed a

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.200 
looked at this data and they've signed a
case<00:01:40.509> confidence<00:01:41.290> based<00:01:41.890> on<00:01:42.159> on<00:01:42.490> these

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
case confidence based on on these

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.870 
case confidence based on on these
factors<00:01:43.630> who<00:01:43.780> reported<00:01:44.290> it<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:45.759> we<00:01:45.850> really

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
factors who reported it do we really

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.240 
factors who reported it do we really
believe<00:01:46.180> it's<00:01:46.540> a<00:01:46.570> case<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:46.780> avian<00:01:47.200> flu<00:01:47.259> or<00:01:48.070> are

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
believe it's a case of avian flu or are

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.249 
believe it's a case of avian flu or are
we<00:01:48.369> not<00:01:48.399> so<00:01:48.670> confident<00:01:49.090> there's<00:01:49.690> an<00:01:49.780> analyst<00:01:50.170> I

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
we not so confident there's an analyst I

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.200 
we not so confident there's an analyst I
can<00:01:50.409> decide<00:01:50.710> which<00:01:51.280> cases<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.790> really<00:01:52.000> want<00:01:52.180> to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
can decide which cases I really want to

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.580 
can decide which cases I really want to
work<00:01:52.330> out<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:52.780> I'm<00:01:52.869> going<00:01:52.899> to<00:01:53.020> work<00:01:53.110> on<00:01:53.290> this

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
work out so I'm going to work on this

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.649 
work out so I'm going to work on this
group<00:01:53.800> of<00:01:53.890> cases<00:01:54.250> so<00:01:55.000> that's<00:01:55.149> one<00:01:55.390> group<00:01:55.570> of

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
group of cases so that's one group of

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.719 
group of cases so that's one group of
data<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.619> next<00:01:56.890> group<00:01:57.009> of<00:01:57.159> data<00:01:57.340> I'm<00:01:57.490> going<00:01:57.520> to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
data the next group of data I'm going to

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.109 
data the next group of data I'm going to
work<00:01:57.850> with<00:01:58.030> is<00:01:58.800> trouble<00:01:59.800> hats<00:02:00.009> so<00:02:00.910> these<00:02:01.060> are

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
work with is trouble hats so these are

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.660 
work with is trouble hats so these are
possible<00:02:01.810> travel<00:02:02.200> paths<00:02:02.410> of<00:02:02.710> avian<00:02:03.100> flu<00:02:03.190> in

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
possible travel paths of avian flu in

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.600 
possible travel paths of avian flu in
the<00:02:03.789> United<00:02:04.090> States<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:05.289> it<00:02:05.800> could<00:02:05.950> be<00:02:06.100> you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
the United States and it could be you

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.270 
the United States and it could be you
know<00:02:06.700> shipping<00:02:07.090> channels<00:02:07.560> car<00:02:08.560> pass<00:02:08.830> walking

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
know shipping channels car pass walking

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.150 
know shipping channels car pass walking
past<00:02:09.519> historical<00:02:09.910> data<00:02:10.300> etc<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.739> again

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
past historical data etc and again

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.920 
past historical data etc and again
another<00:02:12.790> panelist<00:02:13.420> have<00:02:13.570> looked<00:02:13.750> at<00:02:13.840> this

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
another panelist have looked at this

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.740 
another panelist have looked at this
data<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.470> they<00:02:14.980> sign<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.489> risk<00:02:15.790> factor<00:02:16.269> based

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
data and they sign a risk factor based

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.130 
data and they sign a risk factor based
on<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.260> ease<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.620> travel<00:02:18.070> as<00:02:18.820> i<00:02:18.940> move<00:02:19.120> my<00:02:19.180> risk

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
on the ease of travel as i move my risk

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.890 
on the ease of travel as i move my risk
suspect<00:02:20.950> slider<00:02:21.330> different<00:02:22.330> paths<00:02:22.630> will

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
suspect slider different paths will

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.090 
suspect slider different paths will
appear<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.560> disappear

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
appear and disappear

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.010 
appear and disappear
so<00:02:25.670> I've<00:02:25.940> decided<00:02:26.060> I'm<00:02:26.450> going<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.660> work<00:02:26.810> on

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
so I've decided I'm going to work on

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.650 
so I've decided I'm going to work on
these<00:02:27.500> travel<00:02:27.950> paths<00:02:28.160> right<00:02:28.460> here<00:02:28.760> I'm<00:02:29.540> going

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
these travel paths right here I'm going

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.930 
these travel paths right here I'm going
to<00:02:29.750> do<00:02:29.810> some<00:02:29.990> what<00:02:30.230> if<00:02:30.410> scenarios<00:02:30.980> on<00:02:31.670> this

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
to do some what if scenarios on this

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.790 
to do some what if scenarios on this
data<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.960> some<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.320> tools<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.680> have

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
data so some of the tools I have

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.560 
data so some of the tools I have
available<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.250> me<00:02:34.370> show<00:02:35.030> up<00:02:35.180> here<00:02:35.390> when<00:02:35.510> i

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
available to me show up here when i

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.780 
available to me show up here when i
click<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:35.810> assets<00:02:36.320> some<00:02:37.040> assets<00:02:37.460> might<00:02:37.640> be

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
click on assets some assets might be

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.000 
click on assets some assets might be
patrol<00:02:38.150> units<00:02:38.540> aid<00:02:38.810> stations<00:02:39.470> here<00:02:39.860> two

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
patrol units aid stations here two

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.700 
patrol units aid stations here two
cameras<00:02:40.430> border<00:02:41.300> checkpoints<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.530> what<00:02:42.620> I'm

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
cameras border checkpoints so what I'm

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.920 
cameras border checkpoints so what I'm
going<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.860> do<00:02:43.040> take<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.880> border<00:02:44.090> checkpoint

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.860 

move<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.650> up<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.769> this<00:02:47.950> travel<00:02:48.310> path<00:02:48.719> I'm<00:02:49.719> going

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
move it up to this travel path I'm going

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.069 
move it up to this travel path I'm going
to<00:02:49.930> take<00:02:50.049> a<00:02:50.109> patrol<00:02:50.530> unit<00:02:50.969> and<00:02:51.969> maybe<00:02:52.959> a

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
to take a patrol unit and maybe a

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.660 
to take a patrol unit and maybe a
security<00:02:53.709> camera<00:02:53.920> because<00:02:54.250> they're<00:02:54.370> actually

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
security camera because they're actually

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.599 
security camera because they're actually
fairly<00:02:54.909> inexpensive<00:02:55.659> to<00:02:55.719> deploy<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:57.459> when<00:02:57.579> I

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
fairly inexpensive to deploy so when I

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.819 
fairly inexpensive to deploy so when I
hit<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.790> commit<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.569> set<00:02:58.900> button<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.439> you'll

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
hit the commit a set button and you'll

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.470 
hit the commit a set button and you'll
notice<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.129> those<00:03:00.340> travel<00:03:01.030> paths<00:03:01.209> have

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
notice that those travel paths have

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.860 
notice that those travel paths have
disappeared<00:03:02.140> because<00:03:02.799> our<00:03:03.099> background<00:03:03.909> and

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
disappeared because our background and

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.809 
disappeared because our background and
back-end<00:03:05.139> analytics<00:03:05.859> engine<00:03:06.010> believes<00:03:06.519> that

we fly these assets until shadow paths

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.520 
we fly these assets until shadow paths
will<00:03:09.760> mitigate<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.269> flow<00:03:10.480> through<00:03:11.439> those
