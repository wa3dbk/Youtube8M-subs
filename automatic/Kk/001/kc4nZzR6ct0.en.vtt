00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
actually finally get around to the idea

clocks out of these sorts of bills and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.040 
clocks out of these sorts of bills and
in<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> past<00:00:24.000> I've<00:00:24.300> had<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.510> put<00:00:24.630> them<00:00:24.810> through

in the past I've had to put them through

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.179 
in the past I've had to put them through
or<00:00:25.890> mount<00:00:26.099> crave<00:00:26.730> them<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:27.330> use<00:00:27.539> a

what<00:01:31.200> I'll<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.560> start<00:01:32.009> running<00:01:32.280> this

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
what I'll do is start running this

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.380 
what I'll do is start running this
through<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.909> we'll<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.320> get

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
through and we'll see what we can get

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.730 
through and we'll see what we can get
just<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.479> give<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> bit<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.049> close-up<00:01:37.590> of

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
just to give you a bit of a close-up of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.310 
just to give you a bit of a close-up of
the<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.430> bill<00:01:38.610> itself<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.259> see

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the the bill itself and as you can see

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.190 
the the bill itself and as you can see
it's<00:01:40.560> quite<00:01:40.710> roughly<00:01:41.159> song<00:01:41.600> which<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.630> pretty

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
it's quite roughly song which is pretty

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.810 
it's quite roughly song which is pretty
typical<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.710> these<00:01:43.950> sorts<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.280> things<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
typical for these sorts of things and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.080 
typical for these sorts of things and
there's<00:01:44.939> all<00:01:45.060> sorts<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.420> interesting<00:01:47.090> edges

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
there's all sorts of interesting edges

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.800 
there's all sorts of interesting edges
and<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.540> life<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.930> these<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:50.329> tend<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> regard<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and the life on these I tend to regard a

and the life on these I tend to regard a
bill<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.290> being<00:01:52.590> actually<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.640> kindle<00:01:54.540> would

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.770 
cancer grows out the side of the tree
and<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.610> our<00:01:59.939> unusual<00:02:00.540> growth

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and it's just like our unusual growth

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.639 
and it's just like our unusual growth
that<00:02:01.670> tend<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.880> cut<00:02:03.329> off<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.079> sold<00:02:04.530> for

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
that tend to be cut off and and sold for

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.210 
that tend to be cut off and and sold for
lots<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.250> lots<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.520> money<00:02:05.899> and<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.890> one<00:02:08.069> was

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
lots and lots of money and this one was

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.240 
lots and lots of money and this one was
no<00:02:08.429> exception<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:09.179> piece<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.629> has<00:02:10.200> cost<00:02:11.099> me

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
no exception this piece here has cost me

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.600 
no exception this piece here has cost me
about<00:02:11.340> 22<00:02:12.060> australian<00:02:12.510> dollars

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
about 22 australian dollars

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.230 
about 22 australian dollars
and<00:02:14.560> but<00:02:15.560> yeah<00:02:15.890> I'm<00:02:16.040> not<00:02:16.190> in<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.400> position<00:02:16.640> to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
and but yeah I'm not in the position to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.850 
and but yeah I'm not in the position to
go<00:02:17.390> out<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.690> harvest<00:02:17.810> my<00:02:18.170> own<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.590> have<00:02:18.740> to

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
go out and harvest my own so I have to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.170 
go out and harvest my own so I have to
sort<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.160> except<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.490> prices<00:02:19.850> that<00:02:19.880> they<00:02:20.000> are

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
sort of except the prices that they are

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.070 
sort of except the prices that they are
now<00:02:23.180> I'm<00:02:23.300> just<00:02:23.420> going<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.660> do<00:02:23.780> one<00:02:23.960> or<00:02:24.050> two

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
now I'm just going to do one or two

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.740 
now I'm just going to do one or two
passes<00:02:24.740> here<00:02:25.010> with<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.490> natural<00:02:26.420> gas

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
passes here with the natural gas

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.080 
passes here with the natural gas
extraction<00:02:26.990> turned<00:02:27.650> off<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.550> I'll<00:02:28.790> lift<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
extraction turned off and I'll lift the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.960 
extraction turned off and I'll lift the
cover<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.780> can<00:02:29.930> get<00:02:30.050> an<00:02:30.110> idea<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.500> what's

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
cover this you can get an idea of what's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.680 
cover this you can get an idea of what's
going<00:02:31.970> on<00:02:32.120> going<00:02:32.390> on<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.720> side<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:34.690> causes

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
going on going on the side and causes

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:53.620 
going on going on the side and causes
the<00:02:35.960> moving<00:02:36.350> painted<00:02:36.770> on<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:38.709> rapid<00:02:39.709> let's<00:02:39.890> see

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.930 

and<00:02:54.200> we're<00:02:54.320> starting<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.710> get<00:02:54.830> quite<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.700> nice

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
and we're starting to get quite a nice

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.760 
and we're starting to get quite a nice
flat<00:02:56.240> area<00:02:56.540> there<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:56.840> already<00:02:57.260> started

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
flat area there and already started

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.070 
flat area there and already started
really<00:02:58.130> good<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.460> see<00:02:58.700> some<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.900> beautiful

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
really good to see some of the beautiful

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.620 
really good to see some of the beautiful
detail<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.950> get<00:03:01.100> in<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.280> world<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:04.630> although

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
detail to get in the world and although

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.300 
detail to get in the world and although
you<00:03:05.690> probably<00:03:05.930> can't<00:03:06.200> see<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.560> very<00:03:06.980> well<00:03:07.190> at

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
you probably can't see that very well at

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.340 
you probably can't see that very well at
the<00:03:07.370> moment<00:03:07.520> once<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:08.630> actually<00:03:08.720> get<00:03:08.960> that<00:03:09.140> and

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
the moment once we actually get that and

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.480 
the moment once we actually get that and
give<00:03:09.770> it<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.920> bit<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.070> an<00:03:10.190> oil<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:12.250> all<00:03:13.250> those

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
give it a bit of an oil that all those

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.170 
give it a bit of an oil that all those
features<00:03:13.730> in<00:03:14.030> suddenly<00:03:14.390> pop<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.700> no<00:03:16.850> I'm<00:03:17.060> going

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
features in suddenly pop so no I'm going

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.660 
features in suddenly pop so no I'm going
to<00:03:17.270> just<00:03:17.770> you<00:03:18.770> see<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.100> generates<00:03:19.400> quite<00:03:19.640> a

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
to just you see that generates quite a

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.100 
to just you see that generates quite a
lot<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:19.940> dust<00:03:20.120> i'm<00:03:20.330> just<00:03:20.480> going<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.630> close<00:03:20.780> the

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
lot of dust i'm just going to close the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:31.650 
lot of dust i'm just going to close the
lid<00:03:21.680> again<00:03:21.800> TMI<00:03:22.730> that's<00:03:22.940> expected<00:03:23.270> back

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.370 

that's<00:04:03.490> about<00:04:03.670> all<00:04:03.730> I<00:04:03.970> can<00:04:04.000> do<00:04:04.240> on<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.570> on<00:04:05.170> this

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
that's about all I can do on the on this

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.870 
that's about all I can do on the on this
piece<00:04:05.620> on<00:04:05.860> on<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.520> drum<00:04:07.180> sander<00:04:08.790> taking<00:04:09.790> a

piece on on the drum sander taking a

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.810 
piece on on the drum sander taking a
fair<00:04:10.330> number<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.630> passes<00:04:11.170> now<00:04:12.130> just<00:04:12.670> to

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
fair number of passes now just to

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.930 
fair number of passes now just to
clarify<00:04:13.560> given<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:15.100> hardness<00:04:15.490> of<00:04:15.730> this

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
clarify given the the hardness of this

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.600 
clarify given the the hardness of this
timber<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.770> the<00:04:18.040> whip<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.400> I<00:04:18.489> was

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610 
timber and the the whip that I was

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.060 
timber and the the whip that I was
taking<00:04:18.970> off<00:04:19.150> I<00:04:19.420> was<00:04:20.410> only<00:04:20.530> changing<00:04:20.980> the

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
taking off I was only changing the

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.260 
taking off I was only changing the
handle<00:04:21.459> by<00:04:22.710> quarter<00:04:23.710> turn<00:04:23.950> initially<00:04:24.520> changed

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
handle by quarter turn initially changed

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.420 
handle by quarter turn initially changed
it<00:04:25.420> down<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:25.660> 18<00:04:26.560> for<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.860> 10<00:04:27.130> which<00:04:27.400> is

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
it down to 18 for the 10 which is

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.800 
it down to 18 for the 10 which is
according<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:28.000> 1<00:04:28.260> 128<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.650> niche<00:04:30.720> just<00:04:31.720> so

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
according to 1 128 to the niche just so

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.810 
according to 1 128 to the niche just so
I<00:04:31.840> didn't<00:04:32.110> put<00:04:32.200> too<00:04:32.380> much<00:04:32.530> load<00:04:32.830> on<00:04:33.130> the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
I didn't put too much load on the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.890 
I didn't put too much load on the
machine<00:04:34.290> under<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.410> head<00:04:36.540> just<00:04:37.540> because<00:04:37.780> of

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
machine under the head just because of

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.210 
machine under the head just because of
the<00:04:37.930> amount<00:04:38.080> of<00:04:38.200> timber<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:38.590> we're<00:04:39.100> taking

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
the amount of timber that we're taking

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.700 
the amount of timber that we're taking
off<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:39.880> be<00:04:40.450> as<00:04:40.990> I<00:04:41.110> said<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.380> word<00:04:41.500> from<00:04:41.650> the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
off and be as I said the word from the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.660 
off and be as I said the word from the
hardness<00:04:42.070> of<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.660> so<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.780> next<00:04:43.930> job<00:04:44.170> now<00:04:44.670> which

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
hardness of it so the next job now which

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.760 
hardness of it so the next job now which
I'll<00:04:45.820> do<00:04:45.940> on<00:04:46.060> a<00:04:46.090> little<00:04:46.570> while<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:47.320> project

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
I'll do on a little while this project

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.990 
I'll do on a little while this project
will<00:04:47.860> probably<00:04:48.160> go<00:04:48.250> back<00:04:48.370> on<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.580> shelf<00:04:48.820> for<00:04:48.880> a

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
will probably go back on the shelf for a

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.870 
will probably go back on the shelf for a
little<00:04:49.090> while<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:50.650> cut<00:04:51.310> out<00:04:51.430> from<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.700> back

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
little while is to cut out from the back

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.690 
little while is to cut out from the back
the<00:04:52.690> area<00:04:53.200> that<00:04:53.350> I<00:04:53.410> need<00:04:53.620> for<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.460> clock

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
the area that I need for the the clock

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.490 
the area that I need for the the clock
mechanism<00:04:54.940> and<00:04:55.750> obviously<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.230> drill<00:04:56.380> a<00:04:56.410> hole

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
mechanism and obviously the drill a hole

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.940 
mechanism and obviously the drill a hole
through<00:04:57.450> then<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.600> hit<00:04:58.720> back<00:04:58.870> with<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.500> random

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
through then to hit back with a random

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.880 
through then to hit back with a random
orbital<00:05:00.250> sander<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.820> get<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.530> giveth<00:05:02.530> to<00:05:02.680> the

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
orbital sander and get the giveth to the

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.100 
orbital sander and get the giveth to the
finish<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.550> one<00:05:03.700> and<00:05:03.990> then<00:05:04.990> we'll

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
finish to the one and then we'll

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.380 
finish to the one and then we'll
actually<00:05:05.230> look<00:05:05.470> at<00:05:05.590> oil<00:05:05.650> in<00:05:05.950> it<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:06.370> putting<00:05:07.240> a

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
actually look at oil in it and putting a

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
actually look at oil in it and putting a
coating<00:05:08.020> on<00:05:08.110> it<00:05:09.030> just<00:05:10.030> so<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.770> retains<00:05:11.770> its<00:05:13.410> the

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
coating on it just so it retains its the

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.660 
coating on it just so it retains its the
beauty<00:05:14.710> of<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.890> timber<00:05:15.220> for<00:05:15.400> as<00:05:15.460> long<00:05:15.610> as

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
beauty of the timber for as long as

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.630 
beauty of the timber for as long as
possible<00:05:15.820> and<00:05:16.980> i'm<00:05:17.980> not<00:05:18.160> sure<00:05:18.280> i<00:05:18.340> think<00:05:18.580> this

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
possible and i'm not sure i think this

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.520 
possible and i'm not sure i think this
one<00:05:18.700> leaned<00:05:19.000> I<00:05:19.090> probably<00:05:19.330> be<00:05:19.600> on<00:05:19.720> on<00:05:20.230> the<00:05:20.320> shop

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
one leaned I probably be on on the shop

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.980 
one leaned I probably be on on the shop
wall<00:05:20.680> out<00:05:20.860> here<00:05:21.130> will<00:05:21.310> be<00:05:21.460> just<00:05:22.300> another

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
wall out here will be just another

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.220 
wall out here will be just another
for<00:05:23.140> the<00:05:23.260> shed<00:05:23.470> but<00:05:24.600> he<00:05:25.600> seems<00:05:26.080> quite

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
for the shed but he seems quite

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.900 
for the shed but he seems quite
appropriate<00:05:26.710> to<00:05:26.800> have<00:05:26.830> a<00:05:26.920> a<00:05:27.100> wooden<00:05:27.670> for

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
appropriate to have a a wooden for

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.010 
appropriate to have a a wooden for
a<00:05:28.570> that's<00:05:28.810> dedicated<00:05:29.560> work
