00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.019 

the<00:00:06.380> concept<00:00:06.830> I<00:00:06.920> want<00:00:07.100> to<00:00:07.220> talk<00:00:07.700> about<00:00:07.819> today

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
the concept I want to talk about today

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.720 
the concept I want to talk about today
is<00:00:08.509> actually<00:00:09.230> combining<00:00:10.009> the<00:00:10.099> major<00:00:10.309> and<00:00:10.639> the

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
is actually combining the major and the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.930 
is actually combining the major and the
minor<00:00:10.999> to<00:00:11.749> create<00:00:12.169> two<00:00:12.919> different<00:00:13.309> sounds<00:00:13.519> on

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
minor to create two different sounds on

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.630 
minor to create two different sounds on
top<00:00:14.209> of<00:00:14.329> each<00:00:14.480> other<00:00:14.629> okay<00:00:15.619> so<00:00:16.250> what<00:00:16.490> we're

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
top of each other okay so what we're

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.339 
top of each other okay so what we're
gonna<00:00:16.699> need<00:00:16.820> and<00:00:17.269> what<00:00:17.480> i'm<00:00:17.599> assuming<00:00:18.140> that

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
gonna need and what i'm assuming that

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.099 
gonna need and what i'm assuming that
you<00:00:18.589> know<00:00:18.920> already<00:00:19.400> is<00:00:19.939> how<00:00:20.330> to<00:00:20.390> play<00:00:20.630> pencil

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
you know already is how to play pencil

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.429 
you know already is how to play pencil
a1<00:00:21.589> and<00:00:21.830> pentatonic<00:00:22.429> shape<00:00:22.460> too

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
a1 and pentatonic shape too

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.140 
a1 and pentatonic shape too
okay<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:24.919> we<00:00:25.369> should<00:00:25.400> be<00:00:25.730> able<00:00:25.849> to<00:00:25.910> play<00:00:26.029> those

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
okay so we should be able to play those

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.970 
okay so we should be able to play those
two<00:00:26.210> shapes<00:00:26.660> now<00:00:26.929> we're<00:00:27.140> gonna<00:00:27.289> put<00:00:27.529> both<00:00:27.800> of

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
two shapes now we're gonna put both of

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.700 
two shapes now we're gonna put both of
those<00:00:28.130> shapes<00:00:28.519> in<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:28.880> key<00:00:29.060> of<00:00:29.089> C<00:00:29.509> now<00:00:30.349> I<00:00:30.380> say<00:00:30.650> C

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
those shapes in the key of C now I say C

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.340 
those shapes in the key of C now I say C
I'm<00:00:31.279> not<00:00:31.609> talking<00:00:31.820> about<00:00:31.849> C<00:00:32.119> minor<00:00:32.390> C<00:00:33.170> major

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
I'm not talking about C minor C major

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.010 
I'm not talking about C minor C major
I'm<00:00:33.649> talking<00:00:33.890> about<00:00:34.010> C<00:00:34.250> blooms<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:34.930> one<00:00:35.930> of

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
I'm talking about C blooms and one of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.959 
I'm talking about C blooms and one of
the<00:00:36.079> best<00:00:36.469> things<00:00:36.770> about<00:00:36.890> this<00:00:37.280> is<00:00:37.579> that<00:00:37.640> we

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
the best things about this is that we

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.639 
the best things about this is that we
can<00:00:38.149> actually<00:00:38.239> use<00:00:38.629> both<00:00:38.870> major<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:39.530> minor

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
can actually use both major and minor

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.029 
can actually use both major and minor
pentatonic<00:00:40.809> pentatonic<00:00:41.809> scales<00:00:42.079> over<00:00:42.800> the

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
pentatonic pentatonic scales over the

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.759 
pentatonic pentatonic scales over the
top<00:00:43.280> of<00:00:43.520> a<00:00:43.699> blues<00:00:43.940> track<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.780> backing<00:00:45.350> track<00:00:45.379> or

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
top of a blues track a backing track or

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.250 
top of a blues track a backing track or
or<00:00:46.070> whatever<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:46.519> is<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.000> we're<00:00:47.930> gonna<00:00:48.109> be

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
or whatever it is so we're gonna be

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.340 
or whatever it is so we're gonna be
using<00:00:48.789> firstly<00:00:49.789> C<00:00:50.180> minor<00:00:50.539> pentatonic<00:00:50.989> and

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
using firstly C minor pentatonic and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.810 
using firstly C minor pentatonic and
we're<00:00:51.500> just<00:00:51.590> gonna<00:00:51.769> be<00:00:51.890> using<00:00:51.949> that<00:00:52.309> shape<00:00:52.609> one

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
we're just gonna be using that shape one

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.119 
we're just gonna be using that shape one
for<00:00:53.030> that<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:53.390> that's<00:00:53.570> up<00:00:53.780> here<00:00:53.989> on<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.010> eighth

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
for that so that's up here on the eighth

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.639 
for that so that's up here on the eighth
fret<00:00:55.480> if<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:56.660> are<00:00:56.809> unsure<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.350> should<00:00:57.530> look

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
fret if you are unsure it should look

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:06.190 
fret if you are unsure it should look
like<00:00:57.710> this<00:01:04.390> so<00:01:05.390> that's<00:01:05.570> your<00:01:05.690> pentatonic

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
like this so that's your pentatonic

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.220 
like this so that's your pentatonic
shape<00:01:06.230> one<00:01:07.300> now<00:01:08.300> here's<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.690> thing<00:01:08.870> we're

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
shape one now here's the thing we're

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.230 
shape one now here's the thing we're
going<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.440> be<00:01:09.590> using<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:10.130> as<00:01:10.370> a<00:01:10.790> minor

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
going to be using that as a minor

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.290 
going to be using that as a minor
sounding<00:01:11.750> scale<00:01:11.990> as<00:01:12.320> an<00:01:12.710> aggressive<00:01:13.310> sounding

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
sounding scale as an aggressive sounding

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.080 
sounding scale as an aggressive sounding
scale<00:01:14.660> okay<00:01:15.410> but<00:01:16.040> for<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.280> sweeter<00:01:16.670> sounds

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
scale okay but for the sweeter sounds

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.280 
scale okay but for the sweeter sounds
for<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.240> major<00:01:17.570> sounds<00:01:17.930> we're<00:01:18.050> gonna<00:01:18.140> be

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
for the major sounds we're gonna be

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.220 
for the major sounds we're gonna be
using<00:01:18.440> C<00:01:18.890> major<00:01:19.250> pentatonic<00:01:19.970> now<00:01:20.930> we're<00:01:21.110> gonna

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
using C major pentatonic now we're gonna

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.830 
using C major pentatonic now we're gonna
use<00:01:21.470> shape<00:01:21.740> 2<00:01:22.010> because<00:01:22.820> shape<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.420> box<00:01:23.660> of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
use shape 2 because shape to the box of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.740 
use shape 2 because shape to the box of
shape<00:01:24.050> to<00:01:24.350> start<00:01:25.190> from<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.700> same<00:01:25.970> C<00:01:26.330> root<00:01:26.570> no

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
shape to start from this same C root no

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.660 
shape to start from this same C root no
up<00:01:26.870> on<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.110> eighth<00:01:27.260> Reds<00:01:27.620> will<00:01:28.310> actually

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
up on the eighth Reds will actually

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.790 
up on the eighth Reds will actually
start<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.690> know<00:01:29.840> in<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.170> same<00:01:30.320> place<00:01:30.590> as<00:01:30.770> the

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
start you know in the same place as the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.190 
start you know in the same place as the
minor<00:01:31.250> shape<00:01:31.640> one<00:01:31.910> so<00:01:32.450> shape<00:01:32.660> to<00:01:32.840> will<00:01:33.020> allow

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
minor shape one so shape to will allow

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.969 
minor shape one so shape to will allow
this

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.260 

so<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.220> see<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.490> actually<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:42.030> this

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so we can see that actually from this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.510 
so we can see that actually from this
same<00:01:42.570> see<00:01:43.020> root<00:01:43.290> note<00:01:43.500> up<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:43.950> e<00:01:43.979> string<00:01:44.070> on

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
same see root note up on the e string on

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.320 
same see root note up on the e string on
the<00:01:44.610> eighth<00:01:44.760> fret

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
the eighth fret

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.780 
the eighth fret
we've<00:01:45.750> got<00:01:46.020> box<00:01:46.320> one<00:01:46.650> in<00:01:46.830> minor<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:50.460> we've<00:01:50.610> got

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
ways going through these two scales in

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.720 
ways going through these two scales in
terms<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.290> fingering<00:03:18.650> ideas<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.609> positions

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
terms of fingering ideas and positions

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.030 
terms of fingering ideas and positions
and<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.989> just<00:03:21.200> worked<00:03:21.409> there<00:03:21.650> just<00:03:21.799> sound

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
and that just worked there just sound

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.220 
and that just worked there just sound
great<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.579> a<00:03:23.120> lot<00:03:23.389> of<00:03:23.419> this<00:03:23.599> is<00:03:23.780> going<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.019> be<00:03:24.200> a

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
great and a lot of this is going to be a

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.869 
great and a lot of this is going to be a
bit<00:03:24.439> of<00:03:24.530> trial<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:24.919> error<00:03:25.040> getting<00:03:25.609> used<00:03:25.790> to

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
bit of trial and error getting used to

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.119 
bit of trial and error getting used to
what<00:03:26.090> works<00:03:26.299> what<00:03:26.540> doesn't<00:03:26.599> and<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:27.859> the<00:03:27.950> first

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
what works what doesn't and so the first

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.349 
what works what doesn't and so the first
thing<00:03:28.310> I'll<00:03:28.400> say<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:28.639> just<00:03:28.760> go<00:03:29.000> through<00:03:29.209> those

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
thing I'll say is just go through those

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.300 
thing I'll say is just go through those
two<00:03:29.569> shapes<00:03:29.870> see<00:03:30.169> what<00:03:30.349> what<00:03:30.829> you<00:03:31.010> think

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
two shapes see what what you think

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.020 
two shapes see what what you think
sounds<00:03:31.609> good

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
sounds good

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.479 
sounds good
and<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.230> secondly<00:03:33.530> learn<00:03:33.769> these<00:03:33.919> two<00:03:34.159> Lakes

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
and it secondly learn these two Lakes

00:03:34.489 --> 00:04:17.810 
and it secondly learn these two Lakes
and<00:03:34.870> then<00:03:35.870> try<00:03:36.109> and<00:03:36.200> expand<00:03:36.530> on<00:03:36.680> those<00:03:36.769> licks

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.880 

you
