00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.009 
really the main reason I'm talking about
this<00:00:27.510> Jeep<00:00:27.779> today<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.859> what<00:00:29.010> they<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:30.019> they

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
this Jeep today and what they do is they

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.490 
this Jeep today and what they do is they
add<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.560> special<00:00:32.160> shocks<00:00:32.480> they<00:00:33.480> increase<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
add a special shocks they increase the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.119 
add a special shocks they increase the
size<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.250> springs<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.030> when<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.570> get<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.129> an

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
size the springs so when you get the an

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.799 
size the springs so when you get the an
increase<00:00:38.489> wheel<00:00:38.760> travel<00:00:39.239> because<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
increase wheel travel because of the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.970 
increase wheel travel because of the
lift<00:00:40.129> your<00:00:41.129> spring<00:00:41.550> doesn't<00:00:42.290> dislodge<00:00:43.290> from

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
lift your spring doesn't dislodge from

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.930 
lift your spring doesn't dislodge from
the<00:00:44.100> seat<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.539> really<00:00:45.960> important<00:00:46.579> now

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the seat which is really important now

lots of other things are important to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.200 
lots of other things are important to
the<00:00:50.969> steering<00:00:51.449> assembly<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.469> has<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.829> be

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
the steering assembly it has to be

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.060 
the steering assembly it has to be
lengthened<00:00:54.210> also<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.559> that's<00:00:55.710> done<00:00:56.039> with

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
lengthened also and that's done with

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.459 
lengthened also and that's done with
Mopar<00:00:56.940> parts<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.719> engineered<00:00:58.289> by<00:00:58.440> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that the geometry is perfect the center

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.170 
that the geometry is perfect the center
of<00:01:08.729> gravity<00:01:08.850> type<00:01:09.570> thing<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.170> perfect<00:01:10.619> too

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
of gravity type thing is perfect too
