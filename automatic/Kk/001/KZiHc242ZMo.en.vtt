00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.500
 hi friends would like to give a few 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.950
 tips for those who just started 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.200
 play toy with sandr 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.850
 i play it myself for three days now 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.900
 after about a long break and 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.500
 some practical advice that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.980
 will simplify your life the first is pumping 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.980
 crew 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.419
 crew to 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.970
 part I do not advise at least not 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.750
 I advise you to buy specifically for 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.600
 to exchange 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.090
 but the games here are these things to 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.730
 to pump as I have 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.220
 on that 2 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.380
 all turned off all turned off completely 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.380
 plus almost completely 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.020
 now from completely 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:02.880
 + ac skill level and honest 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.040
 saying the difference between off 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.570
 the crew crew is completely zero i'm not 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.920
 noticed because I had cases 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.660
 when 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.510
 completely 0 type knocked on two three 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.590
 fighters who are dangling from me 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.080
 on the tail and turned off type literally 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.280
 could not resist it happened 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.020
 another thing is that I heard these skills in 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.160
 arcade battles have no effect what well 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.380
 I know very doubtfully 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.440
 and the impact on the territory of historical fact 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.110
 whether in real this i am affirmed 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.530
 definitely can not but however in the arcade 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.790
 battles 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:51.920
 there’s no difference 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.920
 advice how to remove the plane from the hangar 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.920
 let's say 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.159
 it was a lot of them so I 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.530
 I did not immediately notice a button here 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.659
 let's change the plane I would not 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.590
 has become leafed but he early is 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.540
 such a thing as to do in the third 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.769
 century 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.769
 how to edit equipage 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.140
 send on vacation then there is this slot 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.930
 stays empty until what 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.300
 then you need it in order to 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.190
 hit a certain level range 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.480
 battles 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.470
 the fact is that if at least one plane 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.470
 your lineup is 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.920
 white crows let's say you have all 9 a 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.920
 let's have me here 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.950
 ep-2 12 then you will fall into the level of battles 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.860
 11-12 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.909
 even if you have one plane 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.909
 so you need to navigate 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.870
 on this one chip here and accordingly 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.760
 line up aircraft under 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.350
 certain level let me now 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:20.459
 here under 89 made 89 then 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:21.959
 level 10 11 by tone 12 13 and so on 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.660
 it can be seen when 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.500
 press the button to fight you have tsiferka there 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.540
 highlighted so do not forget about 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.489
 This thing because I could not long 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.080
 understand me and you bought premium all 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:40.620
 airplanes once upon a time there p60 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.019
 don't even remember what it's called 10 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.180
 level all the time got into battle to dozens 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.700
 while the rest of the plane is mine 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.980
 were 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:55.060
 much lower level further I don’t know 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.340
 I know the chip of this patch 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.010
 129 or not but now in historical 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.180
 battles 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.480
 unavailable soviet is not available 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.160
 Soviet branch of the planes that is not 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.160
 I can not participate 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.000
 so 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.650
 print from the calculation if you want to 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.350
 historical battles take part then 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.090
 discount this fact so on 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.139
 I also want to show something 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.139
 let's fight 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.360
 so see here our tsiferka burns 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:36.900
 so orange dark yellow here 8 9 10 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:44.819
 11 12 13 that is this level range 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:46.650
 airplanes so what did I want to show 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:49.319
 yeah i wanted to show tell a little bit 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:54.259
 about the missile sight, I also did not immediately to 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.259
 This came to this I will choose IL-2 m 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:04.629
 rocket sight slightly different from 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:07.930
 the rest of the sights with its scale which 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:09.819
 see below here under the main sight 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.639
 who you and focus in a circle if 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:15.750
 scale rocket sight 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:20.440
 here it is below the bottom then the bottom 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.479
 planochka it . aims at 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.900
 aiming at a distance of about 1 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:29.379
 kilometer 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:33.000
 that is, here I am about one kilometer 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:36.219
 I will shoot like this 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.710
 respectively the topmost dash 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:40.710
 it's about 50 meters and 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:51.219
 respectively 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:55.060
 average about five hundred pace another one of 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:59.789
 but nevertheless, now we are approaching 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.789
 per kilometer and 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:13.270
 yes that sending this bunch well in general 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:15.790
 something like this further further further further 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:19.270
 further I want to tell show probably 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.640
 I can not now but I want to tell you about 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.360
 then how did I finally learn to sit 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:28.120
 on the airfield looking very much vidyushki 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.950
 these most did not work 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:35.620
 until I finish one chip 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:41.950
 we have such a sight twice 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:44.530
 click on in here so this sight 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.830
 he shows the position of our plane 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.140
 regarding the land, that is, if here 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.700
 sight on 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.330
 dashes 0 then how would we be in 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.590
 completely horizontal and 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:04.110
 accordingly it does not help much 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:06.640
 nodding on on approach and 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.820
 approximately before the highway before the price 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:13.030
 turn on the sight two times on a strip 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.760
 press and level horizontally 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.740
 and no problem so you can 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:27.660
 sit u by the way maybe i am now and 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:30.660
 try to sit down add speed 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.660
 flaps 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:50.510
 completely everything sits down i won't 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:53.140
 and level 

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.140
 us sight 

00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:04.349
 here we are going on the runway
