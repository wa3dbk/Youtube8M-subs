00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the grill and would be basically the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.350 
the grill and would be basically the
same<00:01:22.110> cooking<00:01:22.680> method<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.759> what<00:01:24.180> we're<00:01:24.299> gonna

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
same cooking method so what we're gonna

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.030 
same cooking method so what we're gonna
do<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.900> we're<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.590> moisten<00:01:25.799> these

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
do is we're just going to moisten these

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.649 
do is we're just going to moisten these
steaks<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.759> little<00:01:26.850> bit<00:01:27.000> olive<00:01:27.240> oil

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
steaks with just a little bit olive oil

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.359 
steaks with just a little bit olive oil
and<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.049> does<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.530> when<00:01:28.920> they<00:01:29.070> hit<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and what that does is when they hit the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.929 
and what that does is when they hit the
grill<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.740> accelerates<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.040> searing<00:01:32.430> process

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
grill it accelerates the searing process

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.460 
grill it accelerates the searing process
because<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.329> oil<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.869> gonna<00:01:34.049> cook<00:01:34.259> off

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
because that oil is gonna cook off

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.230 
because that oil is gonna cook off
immediately<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> give<00:01:36.060> them

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
immediately and it's going to give them

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.340 
immediately and it's going to give them
a<00:01:36.299> nice<00:01:36.650> caramelized<00:01:37.650> outside<00:01:38.689> for<00:01:39.689> flavor<00:01:39.960> so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
a nice caramelized outside for flavor so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.450 
a nice caramelized outside for flavor so
we're<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.920> put<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.430> little

charcoal<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.790> think<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.239> great<00:02:38.569> it<00:02:38.810> burns<00:02:39.019> real

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
charcoal I think is great it burns real

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.890 
charcoal I think is great it burns real
clean<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.799> burns<00:02:40.040> real<00:02:40.310> hot<00:02:40.610> but<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.510> think<00:02:41.780> it's

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
clean it burns real hot but I think it's

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.930 
clean it burns real hot but I think it's
better<00:02:42.079> for<00:02:42.200> when<00:02:43.190> you're<00:02:43.340> doing<00:02:43.370> when<00:02:43.849> you're

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
better for when you're doing when you're

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.400 
better for when you're doing when you're
smoking<00:02:44.390> or<00:02:44.510> cooking<00:02:44.900> something<00:02:45.109> more

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
smoking or cooking something more

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.289 
smoking or cooking something more
long-term<00:02:45.650> today<00:02:46.549> we're<00:02:46.730> gonna<00:02:46.819> be<00:02:47.060> doing

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
long-term today we're gonna be doing

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.059 
long-term today we're gonna be doing
direct<00:02:47.599> grilling<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.349> want<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> nice<00:02:48.829> even

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
direct grilling so I want a nice even

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.580 
direct grilling so I want a nice even
heat<00:02:49.609> and<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:50.239> think<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.540> briquettes<00:02:50.959> give<00:02:51.470> us

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
heat and I think the briquettes give us

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.770 
heat and I think the briquettes give us
a<00:02:51.739> much<00:02:51.950> more<00:02:52.310> even<00:02:52.730> heat<00:02:52.910> because<00:02:53.510> they<00:02:53.599> don't

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
a much more even heat because they don't

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.270 
a much more even heat because they don't
have<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.989> hot<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.319> cold<00:02:54.349> spot<00:02:54.769> so<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.099> lump

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
have the hot and cold spot so the lump

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.580 
have the hot and cold spot so the lump
charcoal<00:02:55.700> can<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.090> these<00:02:56.870> charcoal

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
charcoal can have these charcoal

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.710 
charcoal can have these charcoal
chimneys<00:02:58.069> are<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.459> great<00:02:58.849> invention<00:02:59.209> when<00:02:59.690> I

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
chimneys are a great invention when I

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.479 
chimneys are a great invention when I
was<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.930> kid<00:03:00.170> my<00:03:00.349> dad<00:03:00.379> used<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.859> cut<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.190> bottom

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
was a kid my dad used to cut the bottom

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.640 
was a kid my dad used to cut the bottom
out<00:03:01.609> of<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.819> three<00:03:02.510> pound<00:03:02.720> coffee<00:03:03.049> can<00:03:03.379> and<00:03:03.590> do

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
out of a three pound coffee can and do

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.069 
out of a three pound coffee can and do
the<00:03:03.799> same<00:03:03.950> thing<00:03:04.310> but<00:03:04.659> basically<00:03:05.659> it's<00:03:05.810> just<00:03:05.870> a

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
the same thing but basically it's just a

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.420 
the same thing but basically it's just a
chimney<00:03:06.379> to<00:03:06.500> start<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.829> charcoal<00:03:07.159> so<00:03:07.340> you

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
chimney to start the charcoal so you

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.470 
chimney to start the charcoal so you
don't<00:03:07.579> have<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.819> mess<00:03:07.970> with<00:03:08.120> lighter<00:03:08.359> fluid

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.240 
don't have to mess with lighter fluid
you<00:03:09.079> don't<00:03:09.230> get<00:03:09.319> any<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.680> off<00:03:09.890> flavor

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
you don't get any of that off flavor

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.890 
you don't get any of that off flavor
