00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.180 
people didn't know that but with the new
update<00:00:35.149> FM<00:00:36.149> 4<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.510> able<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> hotspot

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
update FM 4 is able to be a hotspot

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.760 
update FM 4 is able to be a hotspot
without<00:00:38.730> using<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.600> cable<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:42.440> if<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.620> have

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
without using a cable for it if you have

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.970 
without using a cable for it if you have
already<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> Wi-Fi<00:00:44.579> turned<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:45.829> which<00:00:46.829> is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
already a Wi-Fi turned on which is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.920 
already a Wi-Fi turned on which is
normally<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> case<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.910> assume<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.809> will

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
normally the case I assume it will

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.810 
normally the case I assume it will
automatically<00:00:49.440> turn<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.680> off<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.250> use

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
automatically turn it off if you use

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.160 
automatically turn it off if you use
personal<00:00:51.570> hotspot<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:53.280> go<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> settings<00:00:54.390> use

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
personal hotspot so go to settings use

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.889 
personal hotspot so go to settings use
personal<00:00:55.680> hotspot<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.000> turned<00:00:57.239> off<00:00:57.449> turn

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
personal hotspot if it's turned off turn

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:58.569 
personal hotspot if it's turned off turn
it<00:00:57.930> on

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
it on

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.170 
it on
set<00:00:59.579> set<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> password<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.719> want<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
set set the password if you want to and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.910

of battery to use your iPhone as a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.050 
of battery to use your iPhone as a
hotspot<00:02:41.380> right<00:02:42.380> now<00:02:42.530> it's<00:02:42.860> more<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.910> gimmick

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
hotspot right now it's more of a gimmick

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.350 
hotspot right now it's more of a gimmick
to<00:02:44.750> have<00:02:45.230> disability<00:02:45.819> but<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:46.880> think<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.269> the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
to have disability but I think in the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.170
