00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.469
 hello to all this is arkane and 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.570
 today we will be entitled to a 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.730
 little video about the improvements of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.590
 field see in the menu these 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.930
 improvements that has five for each 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.059
 generally different class except 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.559
 except for attacking forces and shadows that 

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:27.329
 is common too but we have for example 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.399
 in antitank engineers and 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.130
 mechanics if we look at we have 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:34.590
 each time four levels that are in 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.450
 steps that must be taken at 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.720
 as the acquisition of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.190
 grip and to unlock these points 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.450
 it's very simple for that you have to 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.070
 look in play if you look down 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.260
 on the left next to the mini map you have 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.360
 your squad is above this one 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.490
 there is a bar of gold on the bar there 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.170
 has four levels that represent the 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.300
 four levels of improvement 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.730
 chosen and who if she is already in 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.040
 part filled this bar and thanks to the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.300
 good weight generation it's for the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.350
 fill it needs to generate weights but 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.149
 not just any that are 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.799
 fairs report with your squad that's 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.439
 to say for example locations 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.210
 of enemies and when you were from your 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.189
 squad and had his enemies recover from 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.679
 pears order bonuses and so on and 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.840
 cetera like here savard then fill 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:17.880
 this bar and reach the different 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.009
 bearings as for example here the bearing 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.389
 cover that I unlocked thanks to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.389
 weight generated by the squad 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.440
 but that would have been too good to be 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.770
 true since the levels the bonuses that 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.000
 you recover by performing actions 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 squad can not be kept 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.240
 indefinitely 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.090
 well yes because when you go 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.610
 to die after another player 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.290
 get used you will lose all your times 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.100
 so ground improvement what will 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.140
 reset you 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.270
 really i 'm going to start over so he 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.490
 do not have to play the madman either 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.530
 and you I throw you in the heap 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.110
 immediately knowing that the bonus 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 can be quite useful times and 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.840
 well here I hope that this video you 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.550
 will have learned how the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.440
 draw improvements do not hesitate to 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.440
 comment should bring you to see you soon
