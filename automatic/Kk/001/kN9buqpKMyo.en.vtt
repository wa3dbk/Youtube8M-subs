00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.019
 First 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:12.740
 It seems like we are at the height of my time at winter time 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.740
 You did 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.410
 Oh yes 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:26.880
 Once we grew up when we grew up with 2 cups of flour, 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.390
 I think it was the most sinful turn of the year when I played Champions Winter . 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 And this time, this time is the worst way 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.430
 I do not think my team is the strongest. 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:43.079
 In the past, when we were in the Roll Cup, we came after the two peaks. 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:48.960
 I do not think it's a little more challenging than a roll. 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.219
 If there were a lot of borders and problems in Korea, it would be best to take a column 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.660
 I wrote it. 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:59.129
 I think our team has fallen in antagonism. The other team is growing up . 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.930
 But we'd have to school the more masterful skills picked Newark kind 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.549
 I thought it was grounds for elimination. 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 I was a little short on communication, 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:16.650
 Because many cases I think I heard a little more because it was a spawning geureongeo 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:21.030
 Said specific problems come just one home, I'll get a lot Yeah dapgo 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.259
 A little bit of mistakes, he's looking at it so much more this time 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.259
 You'll be able to show a good picture. 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:36.119
 We just came to this difficulty and came to our rescue. 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.369
 Itguyo trying again that the best way is just to much self-interview 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.690
 I think that increasing the skills, so this four 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.290
 Virtue is always a little in the past that the atmosphere is not like the old days a little pep 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:51.150
 It's okay. Let's just show us what's wrong with Springs. 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.470
 But I'm trying to fix it, and there it is. 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.680
 Resolving funny faces 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.350
 If you take that vacation cream, you can fix it by mistake. 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.990
 I think you'll be fine . 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.460
 U 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:08.510
 I'm very proud of this time in Paris this time. 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.050
 Hey what do my best one was thinking of one goal win yigoyo 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:15.890
 If you can not laugh, I think it's almost the same grade. 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:21.710
 I still do not think that we should pull that off. 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:26.810
 Now I have to think of other strong teams, because there is one representative from the Korea 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:33.560
 Books that have won the world's leading economic dialogue Kim hagetdan expected to do so 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:36.740
 I have come to think that the goal is all but the winner, 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.640
 But it is also a win for the goal is to mean 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.200
 We sold it like this once, and if they did, 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.810
 I think that's good. 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.810
 Oh, but one went for a book I own glory
