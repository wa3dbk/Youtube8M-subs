00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.210 

I've<00:00:01.020> been<00:00:01.170> using<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.500> right<00:00:01.650> bit<00:00:01.890> behind<00:00:02.070> me

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
I've been using the right bit behind me

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.080 
I've been using the right bit behind me
for<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.370> couple<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.669> weeks<00:00:02.790> now

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
for a couple of weeks now

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.820 
for a couple of weeks now
although<00:00:03.510> I<00:00:03.540> really<00:00:03.840> like<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.080> binding<00:00:04.290> there

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
although I really like the binding there

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.249 
although I really like the binding there
is<00:00:04.920> one<00:00:05.130> compatible<00:00:06.000> compatibility<00:00:06.960> issues

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
is one compatible compatibility issues

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.749 
is one compatible compatibility issues
show<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.639> when<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.730> set<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.090> biped<00:00:09.599> up<00:00:10.759> it's

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
show you when you set the biped up it's

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.640 
show you when you set the biped up it's
designed<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.330> when<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> heel<00:00:12.780> piece<00:00:13.110> releases

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
designed so when the heel piece releases

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.609 
designed so when the heel piece releases
in<00:00:13.769> your<00:00:13.889> skiing<00:00:14.219> when<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.360> boot<00:00:15.599> rate<00:00:16.199> if<00:00:16.500> you

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
in your skiing when the boot rate if you

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.439 
in your skiing when the boot rate if you
will<00:00:16.830> fall<00:00:17.250> straight<00:00:17.430> forward<00:00:17.850> when<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> boot

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
will fall straight forward when the boot

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.019 
will fall straight forward when the boot
comes<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.590> contact<00:00:19.859> with<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> binding<00:00:20.789> here

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
comes in contact with the binding here

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.460 
comes in contact with the binding here
and<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.930> fall<00:00:22.170> further<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:25.230> boots

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and you fall further the boots

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.769 
and you fall further the boots
physically<00:00:26.189> pushes<00:00:26.730> down<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.269> toe<00:00:27.510> piece

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
physically pushes down on the toe piece

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.250 
physically pushes down on the toe piece
and<00:00:28.109> opens<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.529> binding<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.039> your<00:00:29.460> jet<00:00:33.260> when

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and opens the binding and your jet when

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.459 
and opens the binding and your jet when
you<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.160> walk<00:00:35.460> mode<00:00:36.140> gets<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> same

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
you are in walk mode gets the same

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.420 
you are in walk mode gets the same
position<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.300> doesn't<00:00:39.540> release

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
position and it doesn't release

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:49.240 
position and it doesn't release
that's<00:00:41.430> how<00:00:46.250> if<00:00:47.250> you've<00:00:47.460> got<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.940> particular

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
that's how if you've got a particular

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.950 
that's how if you've got a particular
particularly<00:00:50.329> low-profile<00:00:51.329> boot<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.930> this

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
particularly low-profile boot like this

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.389 
particularly low-profile boot like this
one<00:00:52.579> when<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:55.190> are<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.340> ski<00:00:56.699> mode<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:58.410> get<00:00:58.559> all

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
one when you are in ski mode you get all

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.350 
one when you are in ski mode you get all
four<00:00:59.699> words<00:01:00.920> yet<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.219> doesn't<00:01:02.520> release<00:01:03.710> okay

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
four words yet it doesn't release okay

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.780 
four words yet it doesn't release okay
in<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> binding<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.380> you've<00:01:07.619> got<00:01:07.830> no<00:01:08.130> lateral

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
in the binding if you've got no lateral

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.109 
in the binding if you've got no lateral
forces<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.479> help<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.900> get<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> binding

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
forces to help you get out the binding

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:19.480 
forces to help you get out the binding
so<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.420> done<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.869> did<00:01:15.049> is<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.380> have

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.140 

different-shaped

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
different-shaped

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.590 
different-shaped
inserts<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> standard

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
inserts here so this is the standard

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
inserts here so this is the standard
color<00:01:24.900> clip<00:01:25.200> insert<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> higher

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
color clip insert and this is the higher

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.120 
color clip insert and this is the higher
bump<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.689> one<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.680> does<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> it

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
bump with one so what it does is it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.090 
bump with one so what it does is it
makes<00:01:29.340> these<00:01:29.670> two<00:01:30.000> white<00:01:30.420> lumps<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
makes these two white lumps here it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.550 
makes these two white lumps here it
makes<00:01:32.520> them<00:01:32.729> even<00:01:33.180> higher<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:34.020> take<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
makes them even higher to take up the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:51.060 
makes them even higher to take up the
space<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.280> low-profile<00:01:35.970> boots<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> now

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.450 

so<00:01:52.070> now<00:01:52.250> whatever<00:01:52.610> this<00:01:52.940> beach<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.570> ski<00:01:53.900> mode

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
so now whatever this beach in ski mode

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.940 
so now whatever this beach in ski mode
okay<00:01:55.460> it<00:01:55.760> now<00:01:56.050> because<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.170> black<00:01:57.380> bits<00:01:57.650> made

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
okay it now because the black bits made

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.710 
okay it now because the black bits made
this<00:01:58.100> higher<00:01:58.540> in<00:01:59.540> their<00:01:59.780> releases<00:02:01.330> all<00:02:02.330> fine

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
this higher in their releases all fine

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:12.280 
this higher in their releases all fine
except<00:02:05.590> when<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:11.090> live<00:02:11.360> when<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.630> straight

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
except when I live when I straight

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.080 
except when I live when I straight
forwards<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:12.950> my<00:02:13.070> boot<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.460> in<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.730> different

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
forwards and my boot is in a different

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.260 
forwards and my boot is in a different
position<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.600> now<00:02:15.140> knocks<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:16.520> ski<00:02:16.760> out<00:02:17.030> of

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
position and now knocks the ski out of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.740 
position and now knocks the ski out of
walk<00:02:17.450> mode<00:02:17.750> back<00:02:17.990> into<00:02:18.320> ski<00:02:18.530> mode<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.150> cannot

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
walk mode back into ski mode so I cannot

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.540 
walk mode back into ski mode so I cannot
skin<00:02:21.320> properly<00:02:23.440> with<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.650> boot<00:02:25.010> so

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
skin properly with this boot so

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.480 
skin properly with this boot so

there's more in front of the pin sorry
so<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.160> angle<00:03:01.700> seems<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.150> be<00:03:02.860> more<00:03:03.860> laid-back

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
so the angle seems to be more laid-back

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.310 
so the angle seems to be more laid-back
I've<00:03:04.970> seen<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.270> what<00:03:05.510> they<00:03:05.630> describe<00:03:06.050> this

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
I've seen this what they describe this

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.540 
I've seen this what they describe this
as<00:03:06.820> is<00:03:07.820> that<00:03:08.120> on<00:03:08.330> this<00:03:08.810> boot<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.470> pin<00:03:09.830> is<00:03:10.130> being

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
as is that on this boot the pin is being

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.050 
as is that on this boot the pin is being
moved<00:03:10.880> back<00:03:12.520> okay<00:03:13.520> so<00:03:13.580> if<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:13.850> can<00:03:14.000> imagine

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
moved back okay so if you can imagine

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.449 
moved back okay so if you can imagine
you<00:03:14.390> move<00:03:14.540> that<00:03:14.750> pin<00:03:15.140> back<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.890> then<00:03:15.980> cut<00:03:16.280> the

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
you move that pin back and then cut the

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.220 
you move that pin back and then cut the
excess<00:03:16.790> off<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.090> front<00:03:17.330> you'd<00:03:17.870> end<00:03:18.020> up<00:03:18.170> with

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
excess off the front you'd end up with

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.120 
excess off the front you'd end up with
much<00:03:18.739> more<00:03:18.980> of<00:03:19.100> this<00:03:19.220> shake<00:03:19.660> okay<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.130> it's

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
much more of this shake okay so it's

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.820 
much more of this shake okay so it's
probably<00:03:22.959> from<00:03:23.959> reading<00:03:24.350> around<00:03:24.410> as<00:03:24.739> I'm

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
probably from reading around as I'm

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.760
