in packs of 9 and they give you 22 k
experience<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.460> piece<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.909> they<00:01:15.630> only<00:01:15.810> have

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
experience a piece and they only have

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.999

about<00:01:16.350> 78<00:01:17.159> k<00:01:17.400> health<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.590> easy<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
about 78 k health so it's really easy to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.710 
about 78 k health so it's really easy to
down<00:01:20.280> them<00:01:20.460> fast<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> powerful<00:01:21.330> AOE

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320 
down them fast with a powerful AOE
attack<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.280> obviously<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> best

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
attack so that obviously is the best

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.880 
attack so that obviously is the best
method<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> go<00:01:25.200> around<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.740> wait<00:01:25.860> for

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
method just to go around and wait for

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
method just to go around and wait for
the<00:01:26.100> response<00:01:26.340> go<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> middle<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> them

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the response go in the middle of them

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.370 
the response go in the middle of them
and<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:29.189> your<00:01:29.369> best<00:01:29.549> strongest<00:01:30.420> AOS<00:01:30.930> or<00:01:31.140> group

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and do your best strongest AOS or group

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.819 
and do your best strongest AOS or group
of<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.650> i<00:01:31.799> OS<00:01:32.210> now<00:01:33.210> once<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.650> get

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
of it i OS now once you do this you get

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.480 
of it i OS now once you do this you get
about<00:01:35.150> 200k<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.180> each<00:01:36.570> group<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:38.189> at

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
about 200k for each group and so at

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.109 
about 200k for each group and so at
level<00:01:39.390> 89<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.170> gives<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.500> about<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:41.030> sixth<00:01:42.030> of

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
level 89 that gives you about a sixth of

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.330 
level 89 that gives you about a sixth of
a<00:01:42.240> bar<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.140> quite<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.500> substantial<00:01:43.799> amount

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
a bar so it's quite a substantial amount

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.990 
a bar so it's quite a substantial amount
of<00:01:44.520> experience<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.840> minute<00:01:46.759> versus<00:01:47.759> doing

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000
