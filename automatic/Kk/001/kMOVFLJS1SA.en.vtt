00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
hi guys so yesterday I got my papers in

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.030 
hi guys so yesterday I got my papers in
the<00:00:03.449> mail<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.929> I'd<00:00:04.080> figured<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:04.710> would<00:00:04.770> do

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
the mail and I'd figured that I would do

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.450 
the mail and I'd figured that I would do
an<00:00:05.549> unboxing<00:00:05.759> video<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.569> them<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.290> I've<00:00:08.250> been

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
an unboxing video of them and I've been

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.490 
an unboxing video of them and I've been

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
waiting really long time I think that I

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.089
