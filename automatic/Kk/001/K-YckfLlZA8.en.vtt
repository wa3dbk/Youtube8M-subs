the only two aircraft taxiing and that

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.720 
the only two aircraft taxiing and that
they<00:00:31.679> like<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.980> tip<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.279> up<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:34.969> yeah<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:38.280> so

they like to tip it up but yeah and so
yeah<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.840> was<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:41.450> a<00:00:43.700> brake<00:00:44.700> problem<00:00:45.000> at<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
yeah it was a a brake problem at the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.459 
yeah it was a a brake problem at the
airport<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.629> something<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.170> bit

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
airport and not like something a bit

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.260 
airport and not like something a bit
strange<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:51.360> more<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:52.020> um<00:00:53.120> it<00:00:54.120> was<00:00:54.239> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
strange it's more like a um it was a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.610 
strange it's more like a um it was a
engine<00:00:54.809> failure<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:56.629> because<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:58.350> engine

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
engine failure and because one engine

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.380 
engine failure and because one engine
failed<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.399> then<00:01:00.059> one<00:01:00.500> was<00:01:02.059> overpowered<00:01:03.059> on

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
failed and then one was overpowered on

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.600 
failed and then one was overpowered on
the<00:01:03.690> approaches<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.680> engine<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the approaches in that one engine the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.850 
the approaches in that one engine the
pilot<00:01:05.970> forgot<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.479> bring<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.930> back<00:01:07.080> early

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
pilot forgot to bring it back early

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.899 
pilot forgot to bring it back early
enough<00:01:08.100> honey<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.970> inside<00:01:10.070> going<00:01:11.070> down<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
enough honey so inside going down the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.460 
enough honey so inside going down the
side<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> runway<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.840> eventually

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
side of the runway and eventually

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.730 
side of the runway and eventually
marries<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.860> get<00:01:14.010> off<00:01:14.210> here<00:01:15.619> under<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
marries just get off here under the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.200 
marries just get off here under the
grass<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.250> that's<00:01:17.340> not<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.549> lot<00:01:17.729> safe<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
grass and that's not a lot safe on the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:27.590 
grass and that's not a lot safe on the
grass<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.900> aircraft<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:21.799> be<00:01:26.600> what's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
grass because the aircraft can be what's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.359 
grass because the aircraft can be what's
good<00:01:27.840> minimizes<00:01:28.680> damage<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.490> airport<00:01:30.290> so

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.330 

yeah<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.850> that's<00:01:36.299> not<00:01:36.600> an<00:01:36.750> e<00:01:36.900> air<00:01:37.229> pregnant<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
yeah so that's not an e air pregnant and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.649 
yeah so that's not an e air pregnant and
is<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:39.590> absolutely<00:01:40.590> jam-packed<00:01:41.540> at<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
is for absolutely jam-packed at the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.490 
is for absolutely jam-packed at the
moment<00:01:45.200> see<00:01:46.759> but<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> yeah<00:01:48.990> hopefully<00:01:49.229> this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
moment see but so yeah hopefully this

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.870 
moment see but so yeah hopefully this
aircraft<00:01:49.860> will<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.009> moved<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:52.579> another<00:01:53.579> tug

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
aircraft will be moved and another tug

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.459 
aircraft will be moved and another tug
here<00:01:54.380> waiting<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:56.990> when<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.110> need<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.350> move

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
here waiting for when they need to move

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.030 
here waiting for when they need to move

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.960 
thoroughfare investigation was it 7:30
to<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.850> surf<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.240> runway<00:02:22.570> um<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:24.100> just<00:02:24.700> came

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
to the surf the runway um it just came

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.520 
to the surf the runway um it just came
back<00:02:25.120> from<00:02:25.390> Emerald<00:02:26.170> International<00:02:26.710> Airport

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
back from Emerald International Airport

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.360 
back from Emerald International Airport
so<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.680> means<00:02:29.940> ba<00:02:30.940> could<00:02:31.300> be<00:02:31.570> in<00:02:32.050> fact<00:02:32.680> hiring

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
so that means ba could be in fact hiring

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.420 
so that means ba could be in fact hiring
another<00:02:33.580> aircraft<00:02:33.820> of<00:02:34.330> another<00:02:34.720> airline<00:02:35.430> to

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
another aircraft of another airline to

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.470 
another aircraft of another airline to
get<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.950> putting<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:40.030> all<00:02:40.209> in<00:02:40.360> one

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
get the and putting it all in one

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.980 
get the and putting it all in one
aircraft<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.760> I'm<00:02:45.820> taking<00:02:46.060> both<00:02:46.390> temperatures

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
aircraft so I'm taking both temperatures

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.480 
aircraft so I'm taking both temperatures
out<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.230> service<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.770> replacing<00:02:48.340> them<00:02:48.430> with

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
out of service and replacing them with

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.360 
out of service and replacing them with
the<00:02:48.670> largest<00:02:48.940> seven<00:02:49.240> five<00:02:49.510> or<00:02:49.720> six<00:02:50.110> maybe<00:02:50.370> if

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
the largest seven five or six maybe if

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.100 
the largest seven five or six maybe if
that<00:02:52.120> would<00:02:52.450> be<00:02:52.480> possible

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
that would be possible

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.720 
that would be possible
I<00:02:53.260> don't<00:02:53.530> know<00:02:54.959> if<00:02:55.959> they<00:02:56.170> would<00:02:56.260> do<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.730> but

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
I don't know if they would do that but

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.910 
I don't know if they would do that but
seven<00:02:58.180> three<00:02:58.300> two<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.630> states<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:59.350> that<00:02:59.680> sin

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
seven three two of states is that sin
