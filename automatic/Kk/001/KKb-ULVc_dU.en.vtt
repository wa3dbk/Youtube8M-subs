00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:09.710
 count because it has arrived that it does not read the 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.780
 memory and we're looking at that one of the 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.480
 lines that is the suiche of memory 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.970
 which is the one that sends you that information 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.499
 to the microprocessor and informs you that the 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.099
 memory has been inserted is not 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:24.800
 working because this line is the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.169
 earth and the one on the side too and that's not 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.089
 is having contains a land we see 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.070
 that the switch on the line of the switch is 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.800
 positive if it's good there we see that 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.020
 it has continuity it must still be 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.970
 but the one that comes is that the earth does not 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.010
 It has no continuous ground 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.960
 so let's make a bridge 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.600
 between these two that this one exists in 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.460
 earth and this bridge with tin 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.460
 and we could solve it 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.090
 ah 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.090
 ah 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.229
 why 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.140
 and here we have it already reading then the 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.390
 memory today we see 1.8 gigas and we have 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.370
 made the bridge here the only problem 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.159
 that will remain is that when you remove the 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.710
 memory he will not know that he retired 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.990
 and when you enter the memory you have to 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.909
 be entered before starting or 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.979
 I turned on the phone so I can 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.009
 recognize when we make the bridge 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.650
 so let's really look at what 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.290
 bridges that we made 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.530
 Here we see then what what 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.020
 we did was give it again this continues 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.540
 to the mass that is the one that determines or 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.130
 send voltage to ground indicating 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.990
 to the microprocessor that enters the 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.830
 memory and then we send you a jumper 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.850
 at the switch 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.840
 that carries the information that is 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.180
 this one that is here 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.220
 we have made a bridge if we see that 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.489
 we have made a bridge to the other line 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.680
 of the switch sending the earth and already the 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.140
 phone you memory when memory 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.239
 is entered before turning on if the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.700
 we put later the phone does not have 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.980
 has that function direct then the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.260
 switch does not send that function here 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.080
 we have another one that we are arranging for 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.450
 the same noble case the memory we have 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.840
 practiced the same solution had the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.459
 same problem then let's see if 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.459
 this one also works
