00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.450
 but the idea is not to give in to the temptation to write the poem if it does not change 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.140
 in this frozen circle without communicating vessels state in silence after the 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.179
 check-in your wait 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.880
 the idea is to reach the other sphere 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.720
 not the one where everything was so violent or the other as in the movement but the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.800
 last the wheel of vertigo these elano stayed in the origin 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.629
 the idea is to put both hands in the nervous center of delirium that event in the 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.110
 place for the active word to freeze life at last 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.890
 but the same stigmata and paralysis paralysis mobility the police fiction 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.220
 but it has to be a very strong thing a team of weight says that 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.960
 be 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.030
 together 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.980
 the edict 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.309
 if you have your room with the worker, in fact, what you pay 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.640
 bike - yes a word worker 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.640
 as the sun has gathered together 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.390
 the navy of israel 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.400
 because it hurts a lot 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.130
 will be distributed in full 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.690
 after the ad and depressing lives and km 323 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.590
 but they should 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.270
 suitcase is blowing 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.850
 It was that place they are a sad interim staff but always 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.590
 elegant who need david benasulim will work and effective 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.640
 that the relationship afterwards and prose more or less than the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.440
 also car lived together than in the census the parliamentarian 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.950
 I think the police but she has a load of militant activity 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.840
 people who want to hit you 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.730
 but if not directly hit everyone here influenced me 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.920
 has many definitions right? 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.850
 I really like the definition of malaria that is language focused 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.489
 synthesis of its maximum degree né 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.200
 to reach your hands I must have crossed the border 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.589
 but my brothers said the members of the second shelf 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.529
 and that fourteen-digit girl the wrapping that was left with your friend 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.089
 she came to take care of a hard disk 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.089
 but says that this market is with me 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.149
 even more heroism is not mine 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:38.419
 the barbell weighed 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.969
 I discovered a bad way 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.309
 I took everything that was in the car 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.309
 but I left a revolver in the kitchen with a bullet 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.469
 Right-handed solid attachment immediately after reading 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.569
 to disarm one thing one thing I think about it a lot because nobody 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.350
 do you know 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.970
 the policy was not challenged and it is not only in Brazil we are all 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.519
 your belongings 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.939
 at the same time the police contaminate other areas 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:12.519
 clésio sálvaro cabral so 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.759
 take 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.049
 because the police pick-up truck 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.029
 pelé said I think it tells me to note 50% the reader 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:21.219
 by what the 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.219
 that there are absolutely things 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:26.919
 precious 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.279
 for appreciation of which people used to do robberies 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.269
 because the police also have this aside an action the understanding to 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.709
 braking will be in the house own room also a little communion of the 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.579
 before all the event 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.409
 the phenomenon - that he is nelinha 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.629
 that same time 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.349
 we hired forty minutes 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.820
 fly now make your poem more difficult on purpose 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.549
 harder 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.739
 the access region and did so much today I understand that to say an attempt to 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.870
 to make no further sense of what to do 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.069
 this doctor so that he can stay active when in fact the 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.769
 absolutely 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.950
 I sometimes giving myself to what is being said 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.500
 What I think when Ana Rosa Celestrino are put off the revenue the dollar has to 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.559
 to see the most serious case still 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.219
 I'm going to get too far away 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:26.009
 the normal language making it more normal that nothing else is 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.469
 than prose 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:28.570
 was allowed 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.160
 a goal is a rare type of seated pirouettes that bet on the years 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.979
 allowed 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.439
 the last leader with stop of the word erenice was montage of the word 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.960
 the group demands generally think 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.020
 these two things do not quite please me to work with to sit 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.529
 normal with the swearing of everything usually in a group of fado 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.499
 when I first saw the world I was very impressed with the fact that 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:53.879
 dance costume 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.330
 the words very simple and often to spend by using them as they 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
 revitalize with them through the context and the 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.160
 in the context of the poem
