00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
how they're doing it I don't really know

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.969 
how they're doing it I don't really know

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
but basically they unlock a bunch at

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.219 
but basically they unlock a bunch at
once<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.640> an<00:01:44.880> impossible<00:01:45.270> amount<00:01:45.899> at<00:01:46.200> once

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229

and so what does that do

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.030 
and so what does that do
that<00:01:48.210> sends<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.600> red<00:01:48.869> flag<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.200> rockstars<00:01:49.799> cheat
