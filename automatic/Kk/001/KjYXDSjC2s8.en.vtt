thought<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> thought<00:01:00.600> these<00:01:00.690> would<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
thought I thought these would be a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.000 
thought I thought these would be a
harder<00:01:01.410> plastic<00:01:01.710> um<00:01:03.619> it<00:01:04.619> looks<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
harder plastic um it looks like the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.090 
harder plastic um it looks like the
faces<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:05.760> exactly<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.570> same<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.200> would

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
faces are all exactly the same I would

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.820 
faces are all exactly the same I would
have<00:01:08.220> liked<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.820> seen<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.830> don't

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
have liked to have seen them I don't

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.100 
have liked to have seen them I don't
know<00:01:11.000> have<00:01:12.000> names<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.570> them<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> very

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
know have names on them at the very

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.609 
know have names on them at the very
least<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:15.509> again<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.930> kind<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.409> hard<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
least and again it's kind of hard to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.300 
least and again it's kind of hard to
turn<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.890> whether<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.610> makes<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.909> rubbery<00:01:18.299> I

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310
