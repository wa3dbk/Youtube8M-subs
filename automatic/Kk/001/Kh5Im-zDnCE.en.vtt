00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
going to do good on the cracks etc my

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.560

have<00:01:29.659> another<00:01:29.990> good<00:01:30.289> year<00:01:30.579> i'm<00:01:31.579> a<00:01:31.640> little

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
have another good year i'm a little

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.789 
have another good year i'm a little
worried<00:01:32.030> about<00:01:32.180> low<00:01:32.329> angle<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.259> olympics

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
worried about low angle and the olympics

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.550 
worried about low angle and the olympics
but<00:01:34.039> i<00:01:34.100> think<00:01:34.460> he<00:01:34.640> can<00:01:34.820> handle<00:01:34.969> the<00:01:35.210> job

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
but i think he can handle the job

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.599 
but i think he can handle the job
hopefully<00:01:36.560> they<00:01:36.740> give<00:01:36.920> them<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.159> you<00:01:37.310> know<00:01:37.430> a

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
hopefully they give them a you know a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:38.830 
hopefully they give them a you know a
little<00:01:37.820> bit<00:01:37.909> more<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.149> a<00:01:38.240> break<00:01:38.450> than<00:01:38.630> they<00:01:38.719> did

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
little bit more of a break than they did

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.539 
little bit more of a break than they did
before<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.469> think<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.859> Sabine's<00:01:40.189> are<00:01:40.369> going<00:01:40.490> to

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
before I think the Sabine's are going to

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.819 
before I think the Sabine's are going to
have<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.700> huge<00:01:41.359> year<00:01:41.719> I<00:01:41.899> don't<00:01:42.289> know<00:01:42.350> if<00:01:42.439> Burl's
