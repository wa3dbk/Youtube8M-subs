00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
qualify from European qualification you
have<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.540> good<00:01:39.570> right<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.920> difficult

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
have to be good right it's difficult

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.429 
have to be good right it's difficult
it's<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.820> difficult<00:01:42.000> process<00:01:42.360> though<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> think

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
it's a difficult process though I think

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.380 
it's a difficult process though I think
the<00:01:43.500> US<00:01:43.770> are<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> better<00:01:44.100> team<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.149> do

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the US are a better team you know I do

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.840 
the US are a better team you know I do
you<00:01:46.020> know<00:01:46.110> having<00:01:46.500> watched<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.860> u.s.<00:01:47.130> playing

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
you know having watched the u.s. playing

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.760 
you know having watched the u.s. playing
the<00:01:48.030> Confederations<00:01:48.659> Cup<00:01:48.720> last<00:01:49.079> year<00:01:49.320> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the Confederations Cup last year and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.560 
the Confederations Cup last year and
what<00:01:49.890> they<00:01:50.009> did<00:01:50.159> against<00:01:50.430> England<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.450> if

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
what they did against England I think if

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.050 
what they did against England I think if
they<00:01:51.720> play<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.380> way<00:01:52.740> they<00:01:53.579> will<00:01:53.759> beat

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
they play that way they will beat

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.999 
they play that way they will beat
slovenia<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> u.s.<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
slovenia I do think if the u.s. get a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.830 
slovenia I do think if the u.s. get a
little<00:01:56.250> bit<00:01:56.340> bold<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.880> try<00:01:57.030> attack<00:01:57.360> Slovenia

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
little bit bold and try attack Slovenia

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.990 
little bit bold and try attack Slovenia
I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.530> slovenia<00:01:58.950> will<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.640> some<00:01:59.820> sort

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
I think slovenia will will get some sort

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.270 
I think slovenia will will get some sort

was<00:03:05.959> very<00:03:06.200> england<00:03:06.530> but<00:03:06.980> again<00:03:07.370> i<00:03:07.400> keep<00:03:07.820> saying

was very england but again i keep saying
it<00:03:08.270> i<00:03:08.330> do<00:03:08.390> think<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.959> u.s.<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.500> being

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
it i do think the u.s. of being

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.370 
it i do think the u.s. of being
successful<00:03:10.630> building<00:03:11.630> themselves<00:03:11.989> on<00:03:12.320> a
