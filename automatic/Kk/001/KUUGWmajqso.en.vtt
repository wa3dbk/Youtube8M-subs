 it seems cold to me rather levada 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.679
 here let's go bask in the stable at the same time and 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.660
 let's see how it works and so stables 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.550
 and horse hotel consisting of stalls 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.949
 a kind of analog hotel 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.990
 rooms there are rooms in these hotels 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.640
 private kitchen shower in general

 everything is just like people, but we won't run 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.609
 forward 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.080
 tell about everything in order there is a number 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.390
 requirements that must be met 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160
 during the construction of course de some 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.440
 Of course for growth in breadth and are located 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.590
 usually in two rows I can come from 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.420
 four money ldeco bin for 420 heads like

 dolphin 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.950
 and the floor of any stable must be even 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.140
 without crevices of bumps and large stones 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.760
 end european class floor 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 additionally covered with rubber 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.800
 mats the main place is the passage there 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.989
 the horse puts on a denouement prepare for

 he cleans and combing 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.010
 ensure the free passage of two

 the horse could turn around freely 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.860
 special temperature requirements and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.780
 humidity heat and severe cold like today 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.119
 indoor temperature should be 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.490
 about 15 degrees centigrade temperature 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:31.560
 also try to keep it to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:33.930
 horses are not cold Down are watching us 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.750
 there are thermometers, too, there are veils 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.850
 thermal looks so horses are not here 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.380

 the horse pushes but he pours himself here 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.180
 water for normal health and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.700
 performance horses needed 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.800
 special feeding conditions depending on 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.479

 All horses ration includes hay and 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.600
 porridge is feeding trough this for giving

 of the day they eat constantly and karma 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.580
 concentrated give them 3 times a day 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.370
 horse animal is mobile and as a result 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.720
 serious physical exertion to sweat 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.240
 just like a man 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.610
 rather much more from here by the way 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.680
 went a famous expression like a horse were 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.160
 together with sweat the animal goes a lot 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.600
 salt 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.280
 to compensate for the loss of the horse 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.940
 you need to constantly replenish their 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.770
 stocks 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.380
 planting like all herbivores 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.270
 experience target hunger plus everything 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.730
 during training they lose pretty 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.340
 a lot of salt and i need to replenish 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.000
 her stock for this goes like this 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.950
 madmen and they are different with different 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.810

 human horse is no stranger to 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.590
 some stalls we saw small 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.380
 round objects like weights 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.040
 This toys some horses love 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.390
 some do not like to play toys 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.220
 toys also choose according to 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.019
 horses all horses prefer different 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.330
