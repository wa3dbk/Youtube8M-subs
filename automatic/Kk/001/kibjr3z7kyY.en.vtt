dragon 32 it's going to be tricky

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:43.020 
dragon 32 it's going to be tricky
because<00:00:33.090> i'm<00:00:33.450> using<00:00:33.480> joystick<00:00:34.320> controls<00:00:35.960> and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.389 

did<00:00:44.309> okay<00:00:46.020> i'm<00:00:47.020> not<00:00:47.260> using<00:00:47.440> joystick<00:00:48.010> control

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
did okay i'm not using joystick control

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.700 
did okay i'm not using joystick control
why<00:00:48.699> is<00:00:48.760> that<00:00:48.850> not<00:00:51.360> haha<00:00:52.360> okay<00:00:53.140> now<00:00:53.559> i'm<00:00:53.680> using

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
why is that not haha okay now i'm using

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.750 
why is that not haha okay now i'm using
joystick<00:00:54.280> controls<00:00:54.640> but<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:56.079> bomb<00:00:56.710> is<00:00:57.430> on<00:00:57.640> the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
joystick controls but the bomb is on the

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.549 
joystick controls but the bomb is on the
keyboard<00:00:58.409> so<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:01.149> a<00:01:01.329> little<00:01:01.449> tricky<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.110> it

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
keyboard so it's a little tricky and it

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.520 
keyboard so it's a little tricky and it
is<00:01:02.680> using<00:01:03.010> an<00:01:03.100> analog<00:01:03.280> stick<00:01:03.879> again<00:01:04.390> which<00:01:05.170> is

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.020 
is using an analog stick again which is
not<00:01:06.600> fist<00:01:07.600> Bob<00:01:08.350> not<00:01:09.159> best<00:01:09.399> suited<00:01:09.460> to<00:01:09.850> this

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
not fist Bob not best suited to this

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.080 
not fist Bob not best suited to this
kind<00:01:10.299> of<00:01:10.360> game<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:11.490> because<00:01:12.490> there's<00:01:12.610> no<00:01:12.729> self

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
kind of game and because there's no self

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:22.440 
kind of game and because there's no self
centering<00:01:16.740> you're<00:01:17.740> really<00:01:19.649> okay<00:01:20.649> um<00:01:21.450> I'm

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
centering you're really okay um I'm

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.469 
centering you're really okay um I'm
using<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.960> joystick<00:01:23.190> one-handed<00:01:24.190> and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
using the joystick one-handed and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.910 
using the joystick one-handed and
forgetting<00:01:25.479> about<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:26.320> fire<00:01:26.619> button<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:29.770> my

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
forgetting about the fire button with my

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.859 
forgetting about the fire button with my
other<00:01:30.009> hand<00:01:30.100> on<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.700> keyboard<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:31.300> try<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
other hand on the keyboard to try the

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:47.620 
other hand on the keyboard to try the
bombs<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:33.280> seems<00:01:33.550> to<00:01:33.700> be<00:01:33.819> working

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.040 

hmm

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.080 

but<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.100> definitely<00:01:53.340> doesn't<00:01:53.730> have<00:01:53.940> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
but it definitely doesn't have the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.230 
but it definitely doesn't have the
challenge<00:01:54.330> of<00:01:55.130> arcade<00:01:56.130> scramble<00:01:56.910> by<00:01:57.060> any

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
challenge of arcade scramble by any

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.530 
challenge of arcade scramble by any
means<00:01:57.510> that<00:01:58.370> game<00:01:59.370> I<00:01:59.550> always<00:01:59.760> found<00:01:59.970> really

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
means that game I always found really

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.800 
means that game I always found really
ridden<00:02:00.840> tough<00:02:01.430> this<00:02:02.430> now<00:02:02.820> I've<00:02:03.000> got<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> decent

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
ridden tough this now I've got a decent

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:12.100 
ridden tough this now I've got a decent
control<00:02:04.350> system<00:02:07.190> she's<00:02:08.190> proving<00:02:08.550> quite<00:02:08.670> easy

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.550 

mind<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.500> don't<00:02:13.980> know<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:15.290> don't<00:02:16.290> know<00:02:16.470> if

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
mind you I don't know I don't know if

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.470 
mind you I don't know I don't know if
later<00:02:16.800> levels<00:02:17.070> will<00:02:17.430> prove<00:02:17.670> quite<00:02:17.910> as<00:02:18.090> easy

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
later levels will prove quite as easy

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:28.150 
later levels will prove quite as easy
probably<00:02:18.960> not

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.580 

I<00:02:28.250> do<00:02:28.820> like<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.090> way<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.330> bombs<00:02:29.600> sleep<00:02:30.380> out

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
I do like the way the bombs sleep out

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.740 
I do like the way the bombs sleep out
over<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.370> front<00:02:31.640> isetta<00:02:32.150> kind<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.600> like

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
over the front isetta kind of like

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:41.210 
over the front isetta kind of like
bullets<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:34.190> this<00:02:34.430> surely

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.150 

oh<00:02:44.780> now<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.960> is<00:02:46.110> where<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.290> always<00:02:46.740> struggle

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
oh now this is where I always struggle

00:02:47.160 --> 00:03:00.350 
oh now this is where I always struggle
on<00:02:47.370> other<00:02:47.610> versions<00:02:48.180> oh<00:02:55.160> yeah<00:02:56.870> game<00:02:57.870> over<00:02:59.360> mmm

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
on other versions oh yeah game over mmm

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.630 
on other versions oh yeah game over mmm
no<00:03:01.350> I'm<00:03:01.500> not<00:03:01.530> going<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.890> go<00:03:01.980> back<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.400> start

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
no I'm not going to go back to the start

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.680 
no I'm not going to go back to the start
and<00:03:02.730> play<00:03:02.790> again<00:03:03.150> because<00:03:04.070> it's<00:03:05.070> not<00:03:05.420> it's<00:03:06.420> not

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
and play again because it's not it's not

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.790 
and play again because it's not it's not
bad<00:03:07.110> but<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:08.160> can't<00:03:08.550> get<00:03:08.730> excited<00:03:08.880> about<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.800> the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
bad but I can't get excited about it the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.470 
bad but I can't get excited about it the
control<00:03:11.160> system<00:03:11.610> playing<00:03:11.820> with<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> joystick

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
control system playing with the joystick

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.280 
control system playing with the joystick
just<00:03:12.660> doesn't<00:03:12.930> work<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:15.450> probably<00:03:16.080> would<00:03:16.260> be

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
just doesn't work it probably would be

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.410 
just doesn't work it probably would be
better<00:03:16.530> playing<00:03:16.830> with<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.040> keyboard<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:18.120> I

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
better playing with the keyboard but I

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.170 
better playing with the keyboard but I
can't<00:03:19.140> be<00:03:19.260> bothered<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.850> there<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.090> is

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
can't be bothered so there it is

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.740 
can't be bothered so there it is
scramble<00:03:21.870> spelled<00:03:22.200> with<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> k<00:03:23.120> by<00:03:24.120> micro<00:03:24.570> deal
