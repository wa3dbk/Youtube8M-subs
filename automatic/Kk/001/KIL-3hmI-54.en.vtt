00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.420
 good on this occasion we are going to talk about 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.959
 plan and ponce also known as 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.000
 accessory or spine we will make mention of 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:20.510
 its theology its embryonic development 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.660
 nuclei that make up its journey its 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.500
 function and finally we mention 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.500
 your clinical assessment 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.300
 sixties 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.489
 It is worth mentioning that the parents channels 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.370
 they are nerves that are in communication 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.770
 with the brain and that these go through 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.600
 the holes of the base of the skull with 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.510
 the purpose of burying different 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.019
 structures an example of them is the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.220
 head of the neck the viscera the thorax 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.410
 and the abdomen 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.350
 well let's see that each nerve 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.860
 cord before entering the marrow 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:04.559
 they are going to divide a root into branches and roots 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.290
 ventral or motor and other dorsal root 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.130
 It should be mentioned and as important information 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.759
 that our cranial bar number 11 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.630
 spinal accessory is a motor nerve and 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.630
 that starts 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.640
 the development during this time is formed 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.040
 from the neural plate of the reader 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.770
 dermot is a response to 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.640
 stimulation that exercises the fat noto and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.159
 the mesoderm for action this originates 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.530
 in two trained elements the tube 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.530
 neural and the neural crest he had in 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.020
 Oran originates that gives rise to 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.729
 encephalon and to the spinal cord the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.979
 oral christian gives origin to the system 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.850
 peripheral nervous system 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.690
 nervous autonomous all this happens at 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.410
 start of week 4 and it ends in the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.410
 fifth week 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.540
 its nuclei has two nuclei one 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.300
 apparent and one real the real one also 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.510
 divided in two which is the vulgar core and 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.360
 the core core the vulgar core is 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.930
 located in the cells of the portion 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.600
 lower nucleus ambiguous core 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.450
 medullar is located on the external part 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.760
 of the previous astra of the portion 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.550
 superior of the cervical cord its origin 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.190
 apparent are the vulgar roots that 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.010
 emerge from the posterior collateral sulcus 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.430
 of the medulla oblongata below the new 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.430
 buster 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.680
 well on your way we will see that 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.500
 this cranial pair will go on what's coming 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.349
 ce being one makes five will 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.080
 divide into two branches one internal and another 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.120
 external the internal will contain what 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.730
 are the cranial cities that come together 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.030
 with the vagus nerve and are distributed with 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.730
 the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.240
 on the outside it will contain singers 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.240
 spinal 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.400
 own journey and is directed only 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.510
 down in nerves muscles 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.630
 trapeze and this as we see in the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.630
 image 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.420
 good your function 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.879
 the main function of this pair plan 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.569
 it's going to be in erba the portion 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.780
 upper trapeze 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.079
 and also what is going to be with the muscle 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.079
 sternocleidomastoid 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.519
 his clinical assessment is divided into three 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.299
 that inspection palpation and strength 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:57.060
 muscle in inspection is observed the 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.849
 asymmetry of the palpation the tone or 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.129
 flaccidity and muscular strength is where 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:06.680
 a resistance is applied and the patient 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.680
 try to reverse it
