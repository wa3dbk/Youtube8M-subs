00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.770
 Well, we left on September 28th with 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.260
 girls with marion weights tomorrow they 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.910
 deliver without sauce we stayed two 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.070
 days in san francisco shopping 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.850
 and all that and then when we arrived 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.310
 Monday, October 1st it was learned that he 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.710
 there was the milk the shot down the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.050
 US government stopped de 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.600
 pay the 800 thousand officials there is 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.489
 so closed the national parks 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.460
 it is and so it leaves me say 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.940
 we beat we could go in and that 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.030
 the baths that our project take a 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.570
 peul or so what afterwards starts to 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.840
 arrange 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.880
 so in fact of one so we were a little 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.450
 beaten what by the new one does not 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.610
 to let down 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.860
 we do not know we would deny it's very 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.840
 calm all three we went on 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.910
 went to we said good is the will 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.710
 see how it's going in real on the 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.410
 ground so we are we took the car 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.570
 we went to see and then bah actually 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.070
 could get in and we could even go 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.110
 until when four years of course an abuse 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.220
 hey the cap we could go until 4 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.380
 and then at caen 4 we felt a little 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.110
 the atmosphere that is a bit strange by 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.280
 report to the usual lilacs we have 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.130
 met a round 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.479
 a rescuer who helps us has 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.549
 rather reassured that he told us to 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.549
 to go without being seen what 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:51.680
 I hope not because like that 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:59.440
 I would have done everything 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.440
 otherwise we can not in the parties 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.790
 the first is not boys and you 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.959

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.709

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.810
 500 it happens after us first want 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.489
 from the park 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.780
 then afterwards did not start on the cluster 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.290
 yeah so did the guys arrive 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:20.150

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.930

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.780

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.349
 doors after afterwards there when the 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.120
 lengths are set there are nicolas who 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.409
 begins to have doubts 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.379
 so we leave a little time and 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.840
 then in the end he decided not to come 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.970
 but we're going to leave we said we 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.280

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.760
 change what are we going to leave on 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.329
 Monday around noon but a little bit a little 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.640
 standing up what and there it was great 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:15.180
 in fact to see that ben that 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.690
 marion lives and fabien decided to 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.959
 just leave forthwith the 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.810
 how was the champion at the bottom 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.100
 it was the dream 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.560
 first because I was with super 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.300
 roped companion and then and then ben 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.460
 in a parish who were there who 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.970
 was blank what there was there was 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.910
 no one so we enjoyed the 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.700
 moment because it was suddenly 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.110
 crowded my curry schedule what like 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.780
 you proceed so that what was 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.340
 in front of how so low it was marion 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.010
 and fabien who was in front of 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.290
 climbed in reversible which fixed us 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.010
 the lengths and a pout lifted have 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.830
 back up or zubar and tell me first and 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.160
 then lives next who she when she 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.040
 arrived at the relay she fixed she is 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.360
 smooth and we are not fulfilling ourselves 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.520
 so everything went well all 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.950
 this comeback yeah yeah I did not have 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.120
 worries yeah yeah I got I 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.460
 I was well trained actually it's 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.260
 rather I had told myself all 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.200
 world I would do four max lengths by 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.669
 per day and in fact in the end it's 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.140
 rather the climbers who could 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.400
 anyway not do more three 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.530
 lengths per cheek in fact was when 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.030
 not even so easy as that so me 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.729
 I was good at what physically and 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.890
 no worries I could enjoy thoroughly 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:36.510
 of the moment I do not know how many days 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:39.090
 for me five days five days yeah you 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:42.270
 is put in the parish and one night at 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.669
 top but you want to go crazy again I'm 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.840
 not a man manages to do our very thing 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.950
 I do not know how to go 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.450
 I could have never in those conditions 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.100
 the very long but I refuse I do it again 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.440
 other things 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.450
 in any case it was really time 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.550
 it's a great moment for me 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.990
 sharing 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.290
 of the atmosphere was really beautiful with 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.130
 stretching out 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.130
