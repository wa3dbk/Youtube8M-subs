00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
and before this one I tried the

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.580 
and before this one I tried the
Energizer<00:00:27.650> one<00:00:27.920> but<00:00:28.760> there<00:00:28.910> was<00:00:29.029> some<00:00:29.590> issues

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
Energizer one but there was some issues

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.220 
Energizer one but there was some issues
with<00:00:30.920> that<00:00:31.070> particular<00:00:31.400> version<00:00:31.820> that<00:00:32.330> I<00:00:32.570> just

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
with that particular version that I just

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.500 
with that particular version that I just
cannot<00:00:33.500> keep<00:00:33.710> or<00:00:33.980> even<00:00:34.790> recommend<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.390> you

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
cannot keep or even recommend to you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.150 
cannot keep or even recommend to you
guys<00:00:36.879> and<00:00:37.879> there<00:00:38.690> are<00:00:38.840> reasons<00:00:39.170> why<00:00:39.530> this

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
guys and there are reasons why this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.900 
guys and there are reasons why this
particular<00:00:40.400> one<00:00:40.910> actually<00:00:41.570> works<00:00:41.809> a<00:00:42.910> lot

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
particular one actually works a lot

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.330 
particular one actually works a lot
better<00:00:44.269> than<00:00:44.690> me<00:00:44.900> than<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.710> Energizer

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
better than me than the Energizer

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.630 
better than me than the Energizer
version<00:00:47.829> which<00:00:48.829> is<00:00:48.920> actually<00:00:49.220> really<00:00:49.340> nice

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
version which is actually really nice

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.790 
version which is actually really nice
about<00:00:49.850> these<00:00:50.180> is<00:00:50.239> that<00:00:50.450> in<00:00:50.899> if<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:51.470> notice

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
about these is that in if you notice

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.299 
about these is that in if you notice
with<00:00:51.980> these<00:00:52.190> controllers<00:00:53.860> it's<00:00:54.860> not<00:00:55.040> really

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
with these controllers it's not really

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.130 
with these controllers it's not really
going<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.550> show<00:00:55.730> up<00:00:55.850> too<00:00:56.120> well<00:00:56.149> but<00:00:56.899> they<00:00:56.989> got

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
going to show up too well but they got

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.979 
going to show up too well but they got
these<00:00:57.290> old<00:00:57.530> holes<00:00:57.800> on<00:00:58.219> each<00:00:58.399> side<00:00:59.980> and<00:01:00.980> that

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
these old holes on each side and that

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.880 
these old holes on each side and that
corresponds<00:01:02.989> with<00:01:04.960> these<00:01:05.960> little<00:01:08.890> these

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
corresponds with these little these

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.410 
corresponds with these little these
little<00:01:09.950> things<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:10.820> sticks<00:01:11.390> out<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.410> that's

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
little things that sticks out and that's

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.699 
little things that sticks out and that's
that's<00:01:14.420> meant<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:15.050> hold<00:01:16.009> it<00:01:16.220> in<00:01:16.340> place<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:17.709> you

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709 
that's meant to hold it in place so you

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:24.400 
that's meant to hold it in place so you
put<00:01:19.039> it<00:01:19.160> in<00:01:20.319> and<00:01:22.179> that's<00:01:23.179> it<00:01:23.479> what's<00:01:24.170> really

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
put it in and that's it what's really

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.260 
put it in and that's it what's really
nice<00:01:24.560> about<00:01:24.619> these<00:01:25.100> unlike<00:01:25.910> some<00:01:26.119> of<00:01:26.209> the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
nice about these unlike some of the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.800 
nice about these unlike some of the
third-party<00:01:26.539> versions<00:01:27.289> these<00:01:28.039> things

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
third-party versions these things

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.010 
third-party versions these things
actually<00:01:29.810> go<00:01:29.929> inside<00:01:31.450> they<00:01:32.450> actually<00:01:32.780> act

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
actually go inside they actually act

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.820 
actually go inside they actually act
independently<00:01:34.810> so<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.990> energizer<00:01:36.470> weren't

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
independently so the energizer weren't

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.499 
independently so the energizer weren't
for<00:01:36.950> example<00:01:37.399> it<00:01:37.670> was<00:01:37.789> actually<00:01:38.149> just<00:01:38.330> one

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
for example it was actually just one

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.719 
for example it was actually just one
piece<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.140> that<00:01:39.740> calls<00:01:40.099> you<00:01:40.250> get<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.520> hole

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
piece and that calls you get the hole

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.490 
piece and that calls you get the hole
down<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.090> base<00:01:41.270> really<00:01:41.599> hard<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.349> ain't

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
down the base really hard and you ain't

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.779 
down the base really hard and you ain't
get<00:01:42.709> out<00:01:42.970> well<00:01:43.970> if<00:01:44.090> this<00:01:45.220> just<00:01:46.220> goes<00:01:46.399> in<00:01:46.580> like

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
get out well if this just goes in like

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.910 
get out well if this just goes in like
that<00:01:47.030> I<00:01:47.209> mean<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.660> don't<00:01:47.929> have<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.259> let<00:01:48.470> this<00:01:48.679> up

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that I mean I don't have to let this up

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.960 
that I mean I don't have to let this up
I<00:01:49.330> don't<00:01:50.330> have<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.630> hold<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.929> base<00:01:51.110> down<00:01:51.970> it's

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
I don't have to hold the base down it's

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.469 
I don't have to hold the base down it's
recommending<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:53.869> do<00:01:54.080> but<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:58.479> certainly

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
recommending that you do but I certainly

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.260 
recommending that you do but I certainly
don't<00:01:59.810> really<00:02:00.080> have<00:02:00.259> to

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.330 

that's<00:02:05.270> pretty<00:02:05.570> much<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.990> there's<00:02:06.860> really<00:02:06.920> not

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
that's pretty much it there's really not

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.450 
that's pretty much it there's really not
much<00:02:07.550> else<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.880> talk<00:02:08.119> about<00:02:08.179> except<00:02:09.050> that

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
much else to talk about except that

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.940 
much else to talk about except that
these<00:02:10.570> work<00:02:12.010> beautifully<00:02:14.680> these<00:02:15.680> are

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
these work beautifully these are

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.620 
these work beautifully these are
actually<00:02:16.430> some<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.510> best<00:02:19.390> Chargers<00:02:20.390> in

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
actually some of the best Chargers in

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.880 
actually some of the best Chargers in
terms<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.670> smoothness<00:02:23.650> doing<00:02:24.650> things

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
terms of smoothness doing things

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.290 
terms of smoothness doing things
smoother<00:02:25.370> than<00:02:25.520> this<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.930> my<00:02:27.230> opinion<00:02:27.740> are<00:02:28.100> the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
smoother than this in my opinion are the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.390 
smoother than this in my opinion are the
induction<00:02:29.300> Chargers<00:02:29.870> obviously<00:02:30.620> there's<00:02:31.190> no

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
induction Chargers obviously there's no

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.860 
induction Chargers obviously there's no
induction<00:02:31.970> things<00:02:32.959> inside<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.620> these<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.690> this

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
induction things inside of these so this

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.020 
induction things inside of these so this
is<00:02:36.020> what<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.320> get

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
is what you get

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
is what you get
but<00:02:38.030> they're<00:02:38.270> really<00:02:38.630> really<00:02:38.989> easy<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.440> get<00:02:39.560> on

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
but they're really really easy to get on

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.000 
but they're really really easy to get on
that's<00:02:42.050> pretty<00:02:42.350> much<00:02:42.500> it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
that's pretty much it

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.710 
that's pretty much it
these<00:02:43.550> retail<00:02:43.910> for<00:02:44.120> 20<00:02:44.570> bucks<00:02:46.270> for<00:02:47.270> 20<00:02:47.570> bucks

these retail for 20 bucks for 20 bucks
this<00:02:48.560> is<00:02:48.770> really<00:02:49.010> nice<00:02:52.870> really<00:02:53.870> well-made

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
this is really nice really well-made

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.259 
this is really nice really well-made
there's<00:02:54.800> actually<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.190> nice<00:02:55.489> little<00:02:55.519> weight<00:02:56.030> to

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
there's actually a nice little weight to

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.610 
there's actually a nice little weight to
it<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.940> only<00:02:59.120> downside<00:02:59.690> is<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.080> because<00:03:00.470> the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
it the only downside is that because the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.940 
it the only downside is that because the
top<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.489> shiny<00:03:04.239> it's<00:03:05.239> gonna<00:03:06.230> be<00:03:06.410> fingerprint

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
top is shiny it's gonna be fingerprint
