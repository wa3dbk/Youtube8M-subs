so far I think it's what really is it's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100 
so far I think it's what really is it's
a<00:01:28.890> lack<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.600> its<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> lack<00:01:31.079> of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
a lack of its really a lack of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.740 
a lack of its really a lack of
understanding<00:01:31.350> or<00:01:31.979> respect<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.119> consumer

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
understanding or respect of the consumer

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.160 
understanding or respect of the consumer
