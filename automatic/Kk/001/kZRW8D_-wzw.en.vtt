00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
it'll take a little bit more of a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.700 
it'll take a little bit more of a
beating<00:01:35.420> without<00:01:35.509> damaging<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.200> radiators

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
and such but it's still a very fragile

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.739 
and such but it's still a very fragile
front<00:01:38.929> end<00:01:39.049> for<00:01:39.170> us<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.590> then<00:01:40.509> we've<00:01:41.509> got<00:01:41.689> a

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
front end for us and then we've got a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.499 
front end for us and then we've got a
completely<00:01:42.289> redesigned<00:01:42.530> suspension<00:01:43.509> the

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
completely redesigned suspension the

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.260 
completely redesigned suspension the
brakes<00:01:44.539> are<00:01:45.499> just<00:01:45.889> slightly<00:01:46.130> bigger<00:01:46.429> it's<00:01:47.090> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
brakes are just slightly bigger it's the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.330 
brakes are just slightly bigger it's the
same<00:01:47.509> spec<00:01:47.869> for<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:48.170> wheel<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:48.710> tire<00:01:48.740> so

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
same spec for the wheel and the tire so

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.889 
same spec for the wheel and the tire so
nothing's<00:01:49.759> changed<00:01:50.119> they're<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:50.689> same

that's touching the ground nothing's

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.419 
that's touching the ground nothing's
really<00:01:54.319> different<00:01:54.710> there<00:01:54.889> but<00:01:55.039> then<00:01:55.130> inside

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
really different there but then inside

most of the specs of which I am not
aware<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.850> they<00:02:06.850> just<00:02:07.060> tell<00:02:07.240> me<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.480> step<00:02:07.690> on

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
aware of they just tell me to step on

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.000 
aware of they just tell me to step on
the<00:02:07.930> pedals<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.380> turn<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.619> steering<00:02:08.860> wheel

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
the pedals and turn the steering wheel

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.920 
the pedals and turn the steering wheel
but<00:02:09.760> it's<00:02:09.880> got<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.030> much<00:02:10.210> different<00:02:10.570> sound<00:02:10.750> as

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
but it's got a much different sound as

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.320 
but it's got a much different sound as
well<00:02:11.110> but<00:02:11.320> it's<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:12.030> fuel-injected<00:02:13.030> direct

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
well but it's a fuel-injected direct

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.260 
well but it's a fuel-injected direct
fuel<00:02:13.540> injection<00:02:13.600> in<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.230> motor<00:02:15.060> quite<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.090> bit

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
fuel injection in this motor quite a bit

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.270 
fuel injection in this motor quite a bit
nicer<00:02:16.630> should<00:02:17.200> be<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.320> lot<00:02:17.500> more<00:02:17.620> programmable

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
nicer should be a lot more programmable

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.310 
nicer should be a lot more programmable
for<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.940> no<00:02:19.030> traction<00:02:19.330> control<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.020> saving

cockpit you know pretty similar what

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.170 
cockpit you know pretty similar what
they've<00:02:25.240> redesigned<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.700> roll<00:02:27.910> cage

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
they've redesigned is the the roll cage

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.850 
they've redesigned is the the roll cage
in<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.540> car<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.020> they've<00:02:29.110> opened<00:02:29.350> up<00:02:29.710> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
in the car and they've opened up the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.410 
in the car and they've opened up the
window<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> drivers<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.820> get<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.330> out

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
window for the drivers to get in and out

window for the drivers to get in and out
a<00:02:31.480> little<00:02:31.690> bit<00:02:31.900> better<00:02:32.050> without<00:02:32.730> decreasing

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
a little bit better without decreasing

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.580 
a little bit better without decreasing
the<00:02:33.850> safety<00:02:34.210> of<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.420> roll<00:02:34.570> cage<00:02:34.750> at<00:02:34.960> all<00:02:35.080> so

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
the safety of the roll cage at all so

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.200 
the safety of the roll cage at all so
we've<00:02:36.070> got<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> little<00:02:36.490> more<00:02:36.580> space<00:02:36.760> for<00:02:37.060> us<00:02:37.180> to

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
we've got a little more space for us to

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.880 
we've got a little more space for us to
do<00:02:37.570> our<00:02:37.600> driver<00:02:37.900> changes<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.470> get<00:02:38.590> our<00:02:38.710> big

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
do our driver changes and get our big

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.410 
do our driver changes and get our big
clunky<00:02:39.310> helmets<00:02:39.640> in<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:39.880> out<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.150> car

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
clunky helmets in and out of this car

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.300 
clunky helmets in and out of this car
we've<00:02:41.140> got<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.290> lot<00:02:41.590> more<00:02:41.620> buttons<00:02:42.100> on<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
we've got a lot more buttons on the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.830 
we've got a lot more buttons on the
steering<00:02:42.550> wheel<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.940> time<00:02:43.000> but<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> lot<00:02:43.810> more

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
steering wheel this time but a lot more

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.180 
steering wheel this time but a lot more
of<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.170> controls<00:02:44.560> right<00:02:44.800> at<00:02:44.950> our<00:02:45.010> fingertips

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
of the controls right at our fingertips

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.860 
of the controls right at our fingertips
instead<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.910> us<00:02:46.000> having<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.270> reach<00:02:46.450> over<00:02:46.660> to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
instead of us having to reach over to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.440 
instead of us having to reach over to
the<00:02:46.960> centre<00:02:47.230> console<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:48.070> make<00:02:48.220> adjustments

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
the centre console to make adjustments

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.730 
the centre console to make adjustments
we've<00:02:49.450> got<00:02:49.600> much<00:02:49.870> nicer<00:02:50.230> setup<00:02:50.560> with<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
we've got much nicer setup with the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.460 
we've got much nicer setup with the
seatbelts<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.750> not<00:02:52.750> all<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:53.110> other<00:02:53.230> goodies

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
seatbelts and not all the other goodies

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.050 
seatbelts and not all the other goodies
that<00:02:53.740> we<00:02:53.800> had<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.250> racecars<00:02:54.640> from<00:02:54.850> last

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
that we had in the racecars from last

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.370 
that we had in the racecars from last
year<00:02:55.330> yet<00:02:55.570> because<00:02:55.780> we've<00:02:55.930> only<00:02:56.050> had<00:02:56.290> these

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
year yet because we've only had these

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.070 
year yet because we've only had these
things<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.830> couple<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.460> weeks<00:02:57.640> but<00:02:57.960> we're<00:02:58.960> gonna

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
things a couple of weeks but we're gonna

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.450 
things a couple of weeks but we're gonna
turn<00:02:59.290> them<00:02:59.380> into<00:02:59.530> spaceships<00:02:59.980> they<00:03:00.160> look<00:03:00.340> like

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
turn them into spaceships they look like

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.940 
turn them into spaceships they look like
UFOs<00:03:00.880> on<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.150> inside<00:03:01.420> in<00:03:01.570> no<00:03:01.660> time<00:03:01.900> I'm<00:03:02.800> gonna

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
UFOs on the inside in no time I'm gonna

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.020 
UFOs on the inside in no time I'm gonna
climb<00:03:03.100> in<00:03:03.280> here<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.550> we'll<00:03:03.640> go<00:03:03.730> over<00:03:03.910> some

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
climb in here and we'll go over some

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.530 
climb in here and we'll go over some
more<00:03:04.120> details<00:03:05.820> alright<00:03:06.820> so<00:03:06.970> in<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.180> cockpit

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
more details alright so in the cockpit

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.229 
more details alright so in the cockpit
of<00:03:07.630> our<00:03:07.720> new<00:03:07.870> 458<00:03:08.530> Ferrari<00:03:08.709> you<00:03:09.610> know<00:03:09.730> things

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
of our new 458 Ferrari you know things

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.760 
of our new 458 Ferrari you know things
are<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.420> little<00:03:10.570> bit<00:03:10.750> different<00:03:10.930> as<00:03:11.260> far<00:03:11.320> as<00:03:11.650> the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
are a little bit different as far as the

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.130 
are a little bit different as far as the
layout<00:03:11.920> goes<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.610> mean<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:13.450> basic<00:03:13.780> principle

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
layout goes I mean the basic principle

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.630 
layout goes I mean the basic principle
behind<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.500> car<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:15.010> build<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.430> car

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
behind the car and the build of the car

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.880 
behind the car and the build of the car
is<00:03:15.790> very<00:03:16.150> much<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.750> same<00:03:16.959> but<00:03:17.260> economically

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
is very much the same but economically

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.440 
is very much the same but economically
things<00:03:18.250> are<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.430> little<00:03:18.550> bit<00:03:18.730> different<00:03:19.090> as<00:03:19.239> is

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
things are a little bit different as is

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.479 
things are a little bit different as is
reminiscent<00:03:20.080> of<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.560> straight<00:03:21.040> version<00:03:21.370> of

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
reminiscent of a straight version of

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.400 
reminiscent of a straight version of
this<00:03:21.580> car<00:03:21.850> so<00:03:22.330> we've<00:03:22.480> got<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:22.840> nice<00:03:23.080> centre

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
this car so we've got this nice centre

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.979 
this car so we've got this nice centre
console<00:03:23.800> now<00:03:24.100> that's<00:03:24.820> contoured<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.720> comes

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
console now that's contoured and comes

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.750 
console now that's contoured and comes
closer<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.620> us<00:03:26.800> so<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.340> everything<00:03:27.640> is

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
closer to us so that everything is

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.820 
closer to us so that everything is
within<00:03:27.940> arm's<00:03:28.270> reach<00:03:28.420> so<00:03:29.140> all<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.770> our

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
within arm's reach so all of our

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.860 
within arm's reach so all of our
switches<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.430> everything<00:03:30.520> now<00:03:31.000> are<00:03:31.630> on<00:03:31.750> this

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
switches and everything now are on this

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.420 
switches and everything now are on this
console<00:03:32.290> whereas<00:03:32.650> they<00:03:32.800> were<00:03:32.860> on<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.040> flat

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
console whereas they were on a flat

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
there was a rail that came down this way

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.420 
there was a rail that came down this way
and<00:04:19.389> the<00:04:20.019> seat<00:04:20.260> had<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.590> be<00:04:20.680> further<00:04:20.949> forward

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
and the seat had to be further forward

in<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.639> cockpit<00:04:22.030> in<00:04:22.150> order<00:04:22.389> for<00:04:22.539> us<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.660> reach

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
in the cockpit in order for us to reach

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.600 
in the cockpit in order for us to reach
the<00:04:23.110> pedal<00:04:23.350> in<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.530> steering<00:04:23.830> wheel<00:04:23.979> so<00:04:24.520> it

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
the pedal in the steering wheel so it

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.100 
the pedal in the steering wheel so it
made<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:24.850> really<00:04:25.060> difficult<00:04:25.180> for<00:04:25.630> us<00:04:25.810> to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
made it really difficult for us to

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.629 
made it really difficult for us to
maneuver<00:04:26.650> because<00:04:26.949> as<00:04:27.100> we<00:04:27.220> were<00:04:27.310> driving

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
maneuver because as we were driving

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.520 
maneuver because as we were driving
around<00:04:27.729> our<00:04:28.090> heads<00:04:28.300> were<00:04:28.449> actually<00:04:28.810> touching

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
around our heads were actually touching

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.469 
around our heads were actually touching

these bars we've got a much nicer

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.000 
these bars we've got a much nicer
opportunity<00:04:32.199> now<00:04:32.289> to<00:04:32.350> get<00:04:32.530> in<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.740> out<00:04:32.800> of<00:04:32.949> the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
opportunity now to get in and out of the
