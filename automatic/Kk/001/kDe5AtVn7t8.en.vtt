00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
camera they've got not that different

camera they've got not that different
the<00:00:36.780> mirrors<00:00:37.140> do<00:00:37.410> look<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> bit<00:00:37.890> bigger

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the mirrors do look a bit bigger

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.610

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
I've noticed at least the mirrors do

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.310 
I've noticed at least the mirrors do
seem<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.450> they're<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> little<00:00:42.870> bit<00:00:43.050> bigger

in<00:01:27.479> f1<00:01:27.780> 2014<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.439> old<00:01:28.710> steering<00:01:29.100> wheel<00:01:29.340> but

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
in f1 2014 the old steering wheel but

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.760 
in f1 2014 the old steering wheel but
most<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.180> them<00:01:30.270> reverted<00:01:30.900> over<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> new

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770

steering wheel which wasn't represented
in<00:01:34.049> f1<00:01:34.409> 2014<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.210> nf1<00:01:36.420> 2015<00:01:37.079> that

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
in f1 2014 and you can see nf1 2015 that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.469 
in f1 2014 and you can see nf1 2015 that
is<00:01:37.409> represented<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:38.490> which<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.700> good<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
is represented it now which is good and

is represented it now which is good and
you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.619> other<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.159> whether

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
you can see there is other know whether

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.740

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
seems quite I don't know what the right

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.039 
seems quite I don't know what the right
word<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.100> violin<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.119> away<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.689> don't

word is here but violin it away I don't
know<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.229> that's<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.439> right<00:01:58.560> word<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.920> use<00:01:59.040> but

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
know if that's the right word to use but

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.209 
know if that's the right word to use but
yeah<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.119> touch<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.810> steering<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.590> little<00:02:01.979> bit

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
yeah you touch the steering a little bit

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.830 
yeah you touch the steering a little bit
and<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.460> seems<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.850> go<00:02:02.969> quite<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> bit<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and it seems to go quite a bit on the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.749 
and it seems to go quite a bit on the
screen<00:02:04.200> there<00:02:04.439> which<00:02:04.890> isn't<00:02:05.250> exactly<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
screen there which isn't exactly the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
screen there which isn't exactly the
easiest<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.360> watch<00:02:06.540> I'm<00:02:06.780> not<00:02:06.930> girl<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.320> guys

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
easiest to watch I'm not girl I guys

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.290 
easiest to watch I'm not girl I guys
it's<00:02:07.799> not<00:02:07.979> exactly<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.399> nice<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.179> watch

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
it's not exactly that nice to watch

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.330 
it's not exactly that nice to watch
gameplay<00:02:09.869> where's<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.739> steering<00:02:11.039> us<00:02:11.099> or

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
gameplay where's the steering us or

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.790 
gameplay where's the steering us or
soaring<00:02:11.819> about<00:02:12.060> all<00:02:12.270> over<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.720> place<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
soaring about all over the place and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860 
soaring about all over the place and
not<00:02:13.980> exactly<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.490> easiest<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.120> world<00:02:15.330> to

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
not exactly the easiest in the world to

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.570 
not exactly the easiest in the world to
see<00:02:15.900> what's<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:16.920> especially<00:02:17.010> with<00:02:17.400> this

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
see what's going on especially with this

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.550 
see what's going on especially with this
camera<00:02:17.940> view<00:02:18.240> when<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.750> steering<00:02:18.960> was<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.410> in

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
camera view when the steering was up in

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.890 
camera view when the steering was up in
the<00:02:19.680> air<00:02:19.710> most<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.190> time<00:02:20.370> but<00:02:20.670> it's<00:02:21.600> see<00:02:21.720> that

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
the air most the time but it's see that

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.630 
the air most the time but it's see that
we<00:02:21.990> lost<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.290> bit<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.470> time<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.890> Sergio<00:02:23.280> Perez

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
we lost a bit of time to Sergio Perez

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.420 
we lost a bit of time to Sergio Perez
here<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.390> only<00:02:24.540> 18<00:02:25.230> cars<00:02:25.710> in<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.130> race

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
here is the only 18 cars in this race

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.870 
here is the only 18 cars in this race
which<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.630> bit<00:02:27.930> confusing<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:29.160> manner<00:02:29.670> in

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
which is a bit confusing is manner in

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.960 
which is a bit confusing is manner in
the<00:02:30.030> game<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.480> don't<00:02:30.930> think<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.160> at<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.670> point

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the game I don't think so at this point

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.210 
the game I don't think so at this point
I<00:02:33.330> don't<00:02:34.080> know<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.410> guys<00:02:34.650> can<00:02:34.920> let<00:02:35.070> me<00:02:35.190> know

are not going to be in this game that
will<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:42.410> obviously<00:02:43.410> not<00:02:43.590> much<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.010> problem

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
will be obviously not much of a problem

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.740 
will be obviously not much of a problem
i'm<00:02:44.490> not<00:02:44.610> too<00:02:44.790> sure<00:02:44.820> how<00:02:45.210> many<00:02:45.270> people<00:02:45.600> are

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
i'm not too sure how many people are

i'm not too sure how many people are
actually<00:02:45.780> going<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.290> use<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:47.190> know<00:02:47.220> if

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
actually going to use it but you know if

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.220 
actually going to use it but you know if
you're<00:02:47.490> incredibly<00:02:48.000> fast<00:02:48.300> on<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.690> game<00:02:48.990> and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
you're incredibly fast on this game and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.930 
you're incredibly fast on this game and
you<00:02:49.680> want<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.920> challenge<00:02:50.100> yourself<00:02:50.280> there's

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
you want to challenge yourself there's

you want to challenge yourself there's
that<00:02:51.180> extra<00:02:51.360> challenge<00:02:51.960> gone<00:02:52.230> with<00:02:52.410> manner

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
that extra challenge gone with manner

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.380 
that extra challenge gone with manner
there<00:02:53.040> because<00:02:53.640> they<00:02:53.790> are<00:02:53.940> probably<00:02:54.300> about

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
there because they are probably about

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.990 
there because they are probably about
two<00:02:54.660> seconds<00:02:55.080> slower<00:02:55.350> than<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.580> what

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
two seconds slower than that the what

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.300 
two seconds slower than that the what
the<00:02:57.120> Mercedes<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:58.020> Toronto<00:02:58.380> Mercedes<00:02:58.800> the

the Mercedes and Toronto Mercedes the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.740 
the Mercedes and Toronto Mercedes the
McLaren<00:02:59.790> probably<00:03:00.060> about<00:03:00.150> two<00:03:00.390> seconds

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
McLaren probably about two seconds

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.200 
McLaren probably about two seconds
slower<00:03:00.960> than<00:03:00.990> ever<00:03:01.230> lap<00:03:01.470> 1.5<00:03:02.250> seconds<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.000> that

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
slower than ever lap 1.5 seconds so that

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.300 
slower than ever lap 1.5 seconds so that
X<00:03:03.660> challenge<00:03:04.080> is<00:03:04.170> taken<00:03:04.500> away<00:03:04.590> if<00:03:04.980> they<00:03:05.190> are

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
X challenge is taken away if they are

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.040 
X challenge is taken away if they are
not<00:03:05.520> in<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.820> game<00:03:06.000> which<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.300> interesting<00:03:06.900> I

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
in the game i really wasn't focusing on

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.530 
in the game i really wasn't focusing on
it<00:03:10.830> actually<00:03:10.980> with<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.700> manner<00:03:12.090> were<00:03:12.270> going<00:03:12.480> to

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
it actually with a manner were going to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.050 
it actually with a manner were going to
be<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> game<00:03:13.140> but<00:03:13.740> it<00:03:14.100> doesn't<00:03:14.760> look<00:03:14.850> like

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
be in the game but it doesn't look like

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.150 
be in the game but it doesn't look like
you're<00:03:15.210> only<00:03:15.300> 18<00:03:15.810> cars<00:03:16.290> does<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.010> really

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
you're only 18 cars does it really

actually enjoy the game somewhat so that

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.850 
actually enjoy the game somewhat so that
could<00:03:36.480> be<00:03:36.510> disappointing<00:03:37.200> for<00:03:37.230> those<00:03:37.530> players

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
could be disappointing for those players

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.330 
wheel user and you know logitech g27
user<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.360> overall<00:03:57.360> I'm<00:03:57.660> not<00:03:58.200> too<00:03:58.620> disappointed

user so overall I'm not too disappointed
at<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.459> steering<00:03:59.850> because<00:04:00.060> i<00:04:00.090> am<00:04:00.300> assuming

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
at the steering because i am assuming

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.330 
at the steering because i am assuming
it's<00:04:00.959> going<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.140> be<00:04:01.230> better<00:04:01.380> for<00:04:01.770> the<00:04:01.980> steering

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
it's going to be better for the steering

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.699 
it's going to be better for the steering
wheels<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:03.060> know<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.270> g27<00:04:03.780> for<00:04:04.200> pc<00:04:04.620> i'm

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
wheels that you know the g27 for pc i'm

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.040 
wheels that you know the g27 for pc i'm
not<00:04:04.860> too<00:04:05.010> short<00:04:05.190> for<00:04:05.400> ps4<00:04:05.820> whether<00:04:06.030> g27<00:04:06.720> works

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
not too short for ps4 whether g27 works

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.410 
not too short for ps4 whether g27 works
but<00:04:07.410> i<00:04:07.670> think<00:04:08.670> it's<00:04:08.880> going<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.120> be<00:04:09.209> all<00:04:09.390> right

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
but i think it's going to be all right

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.270 
but i think it's going to be all right
for<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:10.290> wheel<00:04:10.470> users<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.100> only

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
for the wheel users the only

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.830 
for the wheel users the only
disappointing<00:04:11.820> thing<00:04:12.060> is<00:04:12.180> if<00:04:12.300> i<00:04:12.360> do<00:04:12.420> ever<00:04:12.690> use

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
disappointing thing is if i do ever use

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.420 
disappointing thing is if i do ever use
a<00:04:12.870> controller<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.560> isn't<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.250> most

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
a controller that isn't the most

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.190 
a controller that isn't the most
appealing<00:04:15.120> thing<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.660> eyes<00:04:15.810> especially

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
appealing thing to the eyes especially

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.440 
appealing thing to the eyes especially
if<00:04:16.560> you're<00:04:16.650> watching<00:04:16.769> videos<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.850> wheels

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
if you're watching videos and the wheels

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.330 
if you're watching videos and the wheels
of<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:19.080> know<00:04:19.200> steering<00:04:19.680> all<00:04:19.830> over<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.160> place

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340
