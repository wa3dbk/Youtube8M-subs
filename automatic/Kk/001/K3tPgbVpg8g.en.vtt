00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
I thought they left out a lot of scenes

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.729 
I thought they left out a lot of scenes
and<00:04:08.140> they<00:04:08.320> added<00:04:08.500> their<00:04:08.709> own<00:04:08.739> scenes<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:11.440> they

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
and they added their own scenes and they

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.229 
and they added their own scenes and they
wanted<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:12.070> make<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.280> look<00:04:12.430> great<00:04:12.549> but<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.180> don't

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
wanted to make it look great but I don't

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.640 
wanted to make it look great but I don't
know<00:04:13.420> that's<00:04:13.600> a<00:04:13.750> big<00:04:13.930> issue<00:04:14.049> throughout<00:04:14.470> the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
know that's a big issue throughout the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.320 
know that's a big issue throughout the
franchise<00:04:14.830> some<00:04:15.310> people<00:04:15.549> have<00:04:15.640> felt<00:04:15.790> you<00:04:16.239> know

movie and from the book the books were
more<00:04:47.460> emotional<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.640> mean<00:04:49.180> at<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.510> end<00:04:49.690> I

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
more emotional I mean at the end I

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.570 
more emotional I mean at the end I
prefer<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.470> booze<00:04:50.650> was<00:04:50.920> you<00:04:51.190> know<00:04:51.310> it's<00:04:51.460> a

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
prefer the booze was you know it's a

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.850 
prefer the booze was you know it's a
different<00:04:52.000> feeling<00:04:52.240> at<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.290> end<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.620> film

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
different feeling at the end of the film

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.090 
different feeling at the end of the film
it<00:04:54.100> was<00:04:54.250> like<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:54.730> need<00:04:54.970> something<00:04:55.480> more

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
it was like I need something more

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.590 
it was like I need something more
emotional<00:04:57.100> you<00:04:57.250> know<00:04:57.280> something<00:04:58.270> more<00:04:58.420> like

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
emotional you know something more like

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.900 
emotional you know something more like
is<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.530> end<00:04:59.710> or<00:04:59.890> something<00:04:59.920> I<00:05:00.460> thought<00:05:00.700> the

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
is the end or something I thought the

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.230 
is the end or something I thought the
end<00:05:01.090> was<00:05:01.150> kind<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.550> don't<00:05:03.550> know<00:05:03.670> the<00:05:03.940> overall

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
end was kind of I don't know the overall

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.850 
end was kind of I don't know the overall
ending<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:04.840> know<00:05:04.960> they<00:05:05.200> had<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.350> refill<00:05:05.680> mitt

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
ending I know they had a refill mitt

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.370 
ending I know they had a refill mitt
because<00:05:06.310> they<00:05:06.970> felt<00:05:07.270> it<00:05:07.420> wasn't<00:05:07.570> perfect

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
because they felt it wasn't perfect

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.750 
because they felt it wasn't perfect
yeah<00:05:08.530> when<00:05:08.800> they<00:05:08.890> actually<00:05:09.040> do<00:05:09.310> film<00:05:09.640> in<00:05:09.700> the

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
yeah when they actually do film in the

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.240 
yeah when they actually do film in the
production<00:05:10.030> but<00:05:10.780> um<00:05:10.960> it<00:05:11.560> still<00:05:11.860> felt<00:05:12.070> a<00:05:12.160> little

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
production but um it still felt a little

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:26.100 
production but um it still felt a little
rushed<00:05:22.410> I<00:05:24.240> wouldn't<00:05:25.240> say<00:05:25.360> it's<00:05:25.480> exactly<00:05:25.600> worth

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
rushed I wouldn't say it's exactly worth

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.410 
rushed I wouldn't say it's exactly worth
it<00:05:26.350> you<00:05:26.890> know<00:05:27.040> because<00:05:27.400> usually<00:05:27.580> for<00:05:27.880> 3d<00:05:28.180> you

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
it you know because usually for 3d you

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.940 
it you know because usually for 3d you
know<00:05:28.510> I<00:05:28.540> prefer<00:05:28.900> when<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.500> stuff<00:05:29.680> is<00:05:29.800> coming

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
know I prefer when the stuff is coming

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.910 
know I prefer when the stuff is coming
right<00:05:30.130> out<00:05:30.190> at<00:05:30.580> you<00:05:30.850> but<00:05:31.140> it<00:05:32.140> wasn't<00:05:32.350> quite

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
right out at you but it wasn't quite

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.340 
right out at you but it wasn't quite
worth<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.820> money<00:05:34.030> I<00:05:34.120> guess<00:05:34.390> if<00:05:34.660> I<00:05:34.840> knew<00:05:35.110> they

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
worth the money I guess if I knew they

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.200 
worth the money I guess if I knew they
wasn't<00:05:35.620> that<00:05:36.070> good<00:05:36.280> in<00:05:36.340> 3d<00:05:36.640> I<00:05:36.730> wouldn't<00:05:37.060> bought

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210
