some time now for filming wine country
out<00:00:40.280> in<00:00:40.430> California<00:00:41.000> which<00:00:41.180> was<00:00:41.329> really<00:00:41.480> cool

out in California which was really cool

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.900 
out in California which was really cool
but<00:00:42.829> I<00:00:42.860> decided<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:43.340> break<00:00:43.489> down<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.760> get<00:00:43.880> a

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
but I decided to break down to get a

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.479 
but I decided to break down to get a
phantom<00:00:44.270> because<00:00:44.570> as<00:00:44.899> always<00:00:45.649> with<00:00:46.040> IR<00:00:46.220> skies

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
phantom because as always with IR skies

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.639 
phantom because as always with IR skies
of<00:00:46.670> inter<00:00:46.910> channel<00:00:47.090> I'm<00:00:47.630> always<00:00:47.840> taking<00:00:48.410> it<00:00:48.530> to

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
of inter channel I'm always taking it to

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.690 
of inter channel I'm always taking it to
the<00:00:48.739> next<00:00:48.920> level

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
the next level

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.670 
the next level
now<00:00:50.390> why<00:00:50.600> did<00:00:50.840> I<00:00:50.899> go<00:00:51.050> with<00:00:51.200> the<00:00:51.260> phantom

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
now why did I go with the phantom

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.430 
now why did I go with the phantom
instead<00:00:52.579> of<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.730> phantom<00:00:53.149> ii<00:00:53.390> that<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.260> now

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
instead of the phantom ii that is now

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.650 
instead of the phantom ii that is now
ability<00:00:55.010> i'm<00:00:55.550> going<00:00:55.700> to<00:00:55.760> summarize<00:00:56.120> it<00:00:56.480> very

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
ability i'm going to summarize it very

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.560 
ability i'm going to summarize it very
quickly<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.110> it's<00:00:57.350> it's<00:00:57.739> primarily<00:00:58.370> due<00:00:59.300> to

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
quickly and it's it's primarily due to

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.520 
quickly and it's it's primarily due to
cost

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
cost

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.389 
cost
now<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.010> phantom<00:01:01.489> ii<00:01:02.170> just<00:01:03.170> a<00:01:03.350> bass<00:01:03.649> phantom

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
now the phantom ii just a bass phantom

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.819 
now the phantom ii just a bass phantom
ii<00:01:04.609> in<00:01:04.819> comparison<00:01:05.359> to<00:01:05.389> a<00:01:05.539> phantom<00:01:05.929> one<00:01:06.200> you're

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
ii in comparison to a phantom one you're

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.289 
ii in comparison to a phantom one you're
gonna<00:01:06.950> notice<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.310> price<00:01:07.549> is<00:01:07.789> a<00:01:07.819> lot<00:01:08.060> higher

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
gonna notice the price is a lot higher

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.469 
gonna notice the price is a lot higher
now<00:01:08.749> what<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:09.499> don't<00:01:09.799> see<00:01:10.189> unless<00:01:11.119> you<00:01:11.299> do

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
and and and price check everything the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.599 
and and and price check everything the
phantom<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.779> the<00:01:17.990> battery<00:01:18.529> yeah<00:01:19.219> you<00:01:19.279> get

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
phantom to the battery yeah you get

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.669 
phantom to the battery yeah you get
longer<00:01:19.850> battery<00:01:20.209> life<00:01:20.420> for<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.869> fly<00:01:21.049> time<00:01:21.380> I

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
longer battery life for the fly time I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.760 
longer battery life for the fly time I
think<00:01:22.189> it's<00:01:22.609> it's<00:01:23.359> several<00:01:23.749> minutes<00:01:24.319> and<00:01:24.590> in

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
think it's it's several minutes and in

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.559 
think it's it's several minutes and in
real<00:01:25.009> world<00:01:25.159> tests<00:01:25.759> like<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.090> consensus

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
real world tests like the consensus

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.749 
real world tests like the consensus
opinion<00:01:26.810> has<00:01:27.049> been<00:01:27.079> it's<00:01:27.549> probably<00:01:28.549> five

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
opinion has been it's probably five

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.239 
opinion has been it's probably five
minutes<00:01:28.969> or<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:29.389> longer<00:01:29.689> comfortably<00:01:30.439> than

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.249 
minutes or so longer comfortably than

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:33.550 
minutes or so longer comfortably than
the<00:01:31.369> phantom<00:01:31.700> one<00:01:31.939> but<00:01:32.509> you're<00:01:33.170> getting<00:01:33.469> a
