perfectly smooth it does have some ridge

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.670 
perfectly smooth it does have some ridge
lines<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.480> key<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.200> get<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.500> much

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
up the hog here with joint compound that

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.030 
up the hog here with joint compound that
I<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.110> right<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.650> this<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.890> just

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
I have right here and this is just

00:00:47.040 --> 00:01:05.090 
I have right here and this is just
all-purpose<00:00:48.030> joint<00:00:48.300> compound<00:01:03.890> okay<00:01:04.890> we'll

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
all-purpose joint compound okay we'll

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.910 
all-purpose joint compound okay we'll
take<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.820> scoop<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.649> again<00:01:07.649> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
take one more scoop here and again the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.710 
take one more scoop here and again the
that<00:01:08.369> would<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> way<00:01:08.910> to<00:01:08.940> do<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.300> is<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.509> come

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that would be a way to do it is to come

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.920 
that would be a way to do it is to come
up<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.110> turn<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.850> puts<00:01:12.149> it<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> point<00:01:12.750> in

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
up and turn it it puts it to a point in

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.650 
up and turn it it puts it to a point in
the<00:01:13.080> middle<00:01:13.950> there<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.520> I'm<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.479> put

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
the middle there so I'm going to put

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
the middle there so I'm going to put
this<00:01:15.840> down<00:01:15.899> here

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
this down here

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
here so um again this is like very

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.790 
here so um again this is like very
mountainous<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.319> we're<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.679> have

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
mountainous here so we're going to have

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.499 
mountainous here so we're going to have
to<00:01:28.950> really<00:01:29.069> put<00:01:29.429> like<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.610> lot<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> mud<00:01:30.179> up<00:01:30.330> there

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
to really put like a lot of mud up there

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690 
to really put like a lot of mud up there
and<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.869> don't<00:01:31.050> want<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> make<00:01:31.319> a<00:01:31.380> mess<00:01:31.700> either

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.990 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:34.200> reorganize<00:01:34.349> the<00:01:34.920> mud<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.929> this<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:38.610> turn

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
to reorganize the mud here this and turn

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.960 
to reorganize the mud here this and turn
it<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.539> it<00:01:39.569> puts<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.959> to<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> point<00:01:40.530> there<00:01:40.970> okay

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
it so it puts it to a point there okay

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.550 
it so it puts it to a point there okay
then<00:01:42.209> I<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.569> want<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.170> give<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
then I just want to just give it a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.990 
then I just want to just give it a
little<00:01:43.740> shake<00:01:44.039> and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> sticks<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.940> you

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
little shake and then it sticks and you

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.320 
little shake and then it sticks and you
turn<00:01:45.300> all<00:01:45.539> all<00:01:46.140> upside<00:01:46.619> down<00:01:46.890> there<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.819> the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
turn all all upside down there so the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.130 
turn all all upside down there so the
best<00:01:48.990> way<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.709> up<00:01:49.830> load<00:01:50.459> up<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.140> 12-inch

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
best way to do to up load up the 12-inch

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
best way to do to up load up the 12-inch
trial<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.800> that<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.069> don't<00:01:53.220> make<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> mess

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
trial here so that you don't make a mess

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.730 
trial here so that you don't make a mess
out<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.300> mud<00:01:54.539> and<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.929> mud<00:01:55.110> stays<00:01:55.470> in

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
out of the mud and that the mud stays in

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.529 
out of the mud and that the mud stays in
the<00:01:55.800> middle<00:01:56.069> of<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.789> just<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.149> come<00:01:57.360> into

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
the middle of it it's just to come into

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.900 
the middle of it it's just to come into
it<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.709> it<00:01:58.739> loads<00:01:59.039> up<00:01:59.280> light<00:01:59.520> light

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
it like that so it loads up light light

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.749 
it like that so it loads up light light
light<00:01:59.970> like<00:02:00.690> that<00:02:00.720> there<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> transfer<00:02:02.729> it

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
light like that there now I transfer it

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.630 
light like that there now I transfer it
here<00:02:02.940> I'm<00:02:03.869> going<00:02:04.289> to<00:02:04.349> do<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.830> darkness<00:02:05.429> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
here I'm going to do like a darkness to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.029 
here I'm going to do like a darkness to
the<00:02:05.910> left<00:02:06.330> there<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.810> when<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.470> do<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.709> it

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the left there and when I do that it

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
the left there and when I do that it
kind<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.399> keeps<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.849> mud<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.569> middle<00:02:09.959> of

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
kind of keeps the mud in the middle of

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.440 
kind of keeps the mud in the middle of
it<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.590> I'm<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.489> come<00:02:11.730> back<00:02:11.910> here
