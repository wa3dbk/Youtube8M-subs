00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
little bit to explore here it's not I

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.740

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
things like looking where to break

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.880 
things like looking where to break
things<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.299> stuff<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.110> come<00:02:01.380> over<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.619> this

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.600 
things and stuff and come over to this
area<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:03.329> haven't<00:02:03.540> found<00:02:03.810> anything<00:02:04.229> that

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
area but we haven't found anything that

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.039 
area but we haven't found anything that
loads<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.880> loading<00:02:06.210> zone<00:02:06.240> yet<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:06.960> you

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
loads the loading zone yet so if you

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.650 
loads the loading zone yet so if you
guys<00:02:07.200> can<00:02:07.500> tell<00:02:07.680> us<00:02:07.710> or<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:09.000> find<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
guys can tell us or if you can find a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.540 
guys can tell us or if you can find a
loading<00:02:10.020> zone<00:02:10.050> for<00:02:10.470> us<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:11.310> would<00:02:11.400> be

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
loading zone for us that would be

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.850 
loading zone for us that would be
awesome<00:02:11.760> because<00:02:12.270> we<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.720> definitely

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
awesome because we can definitely

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.600 
awesome because we can definitely
take<00:02:13.980> care<00:02:14.220> from<00:02:14.640> there<00:02:14.940> but<00:02:15.980> here<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.130> go<00:02:17.310> so

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
take care from there but here we go so

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.150 
take care from there but here we go so
this<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.060> part<00:02:18.330> where<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.080> can<00:02:19.320> literally

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
this is the part where you can literally

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.940 
this is the part where you can literally
go<00:02:20.370> inside<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.930> map<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.710> can<00:02:22.860> go

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
go inside the the map like you can go

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.190 
go inside the the map like you can go
inside<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:23.880> you're<00:02:24.060> underneath<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.840> so

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
inside of it but you're underneath it so

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.960 
inside of it but you're underneath it so
look<00:02:25.800> at<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.010> see<00:02:26.370> there's<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.670> little<00:02:26.700> crack

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
look at this see there's a little crack

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.570 
look at this see there's a little crack
here<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.630> jump<00:02:28.200> down<00:02:28.260> here<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.340> just

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
here you just jump down here you just

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.080 
here you just jump down here you just
jump<00:02:29.910> up<00:02:30.030> here<00:02:30.450> BAM<00:02:31.290> look<00:02:31.950> at<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.250> I'm

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
jump up here BAM look at that I'm

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.670 
jump up here BAM look at that I'm
already<00:02:33.240> under<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.660> mat<00:02:33.870> um<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:36.500> there's<00:02:37.500> not

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
already under the mat um so there's not

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.350 
already under the mat um so there's not
much<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.100> explore<00:02:38.460> here<00:02:38.670> other<00:02:38.820> than<00:02:38.910> that

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
much to explore here other than that

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.960 
much to explore here other than that
loading<00:02:39.750> zone<00:02:39.959> thing<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.410> I'm<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:40.980> keep

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
loading zone thing that I'm just keep

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.880 
loading zone thing that I'm just keep
talking<00:02:42.180> about<00:02:42.540> over<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.840> over<00:02:42.990> again<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.770> if

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890

talking about over and over again but if
you<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.190> find<00:02:44.459> something<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:45.270> would<00:02:45.360> be

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
you can find something that would be

down here don't you worry about it it's
like<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.959> takes<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.500> while<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.920> find<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.370> but

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
like it takes a while to find it but

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.400 
like it takes a while to find it but
there's<00:03:06.000> like<00:03:06.180> this<00:03:06.390> little<00:03:06.450> slope<00:03:07.140> I'm

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
there's like this little slope I'm

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.470 
there's like this little slope I'm
trying<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.800> find<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.880> you'll<00:03:09.030> see<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.390> a

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
trying to find here so you'll see in a

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.690 
trying to find here so you'll see in a
second<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.110> I'm<00:03:10.230> walking<00:03:10.830> around<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.340> like

just go around this little invisible

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.890 
just go around this little invisible
barrier<00:03:23.310> here<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.790> then<00:03:24.209> there<00:03:24.420> should<00:03:24.690> be<00:03:24.870> a

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
barrier here and then there should be a

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.830 
barrier here and then there should be a
rock<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.680> see<00:03:25.920> soon<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.549> call<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.630> whale

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
rock I don't know why it looks like a

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.520 
rock I don't know why it looks like a
whale<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.940> me<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.959> just<00:03:30.989> keep<00:03:31.260> running

whale to me but you just keep running
around<00:03:31.920> here<00:03:32.780> just<00:03:33.780> um<00:03:34.070> exploring<00:03:35.070> the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
around here just um exploring the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.009 
around here just um exploring the
outside<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.880> how<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.209> just<00:03:36.630> standing

outside and how you just standing

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.430 
outside and how you just standing
underneath<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.830> ridiculous<00:03:38.549> but<00:03:38.880> anyway<00:03:39.810> this

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
underneath is ridiculous but anyway this
